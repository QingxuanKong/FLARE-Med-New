    "predict": "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the current state of treatment options for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, leading to progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. The standard treatment for DMD is corticosteroids, such as prednisone, which can slow the progression of the disease but does not stop it. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in gene therapy and exon-skipping therapies as potential treatments for DMD. Casimersen is an antisense oligonucleotide therapy that has been investigated as a treatment for DMD. It works by skipping exon 45 of the dystrophin gene, which is a common mutation in DMD patients, and allowing for the production of a truncated but functional dystrophin protein. Clinical trials have shown that casimersen can increase dystrophin levels and improve muscle function in patients with DMD. Therefore, casimersen is a promising treatment option for DMD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" }",

Some patients cannot tolerate glucocorticoid therapy; weight gain and increased risk of fractures in particular represent a significant deterrent for some boys. As in other recessively inherited dystrophies presumed to arise from loss of function of a critical muscle gene, there is optimism that Duchenne disease may benefit from novel therapies that either replace the defective gene or missing protein or implement downstream corrections (e.g., skipping mutated exons or reading through mutations that introduce stop codons). This less severe form of X-linked recessive muscular dystrophy results from allelic defects of the same gene responsible for Duchenne dystrophy. Becker muscular dystrophy is ~10 times less frequent than Duchenne."

One is the injection of human myoblasts, stem cells, or satellite cells that contain a full complement of dystrophin and other structural elements into the muscles of patients with muscular dystrophy. The preclinical aspects of this strategy have been summarized by Blau and are being slowly implemented in patients. There is an analogous effort to use the technology of viral-mediated gene delivery to allow gene and protein replacement in the recessively inherited dystrophies. The difficulties of injecting every dystrophic muscle are obvious."

Many receptors, such as catecholamines, histamine, acetylcholine, and corticosteroids, and their associated therapeutic uses were discovered by analyzing effects of the physiologic chemical signals. This approach continues to be fruitful. For example, mis-expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), small RNAs that regulate protein expression by binding to protein-coding (messenger) RNAs, was linked recently to Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Current preclinical investigations include the utility of RNA-based therapy for this and other diseases."

Treatment of the Muscular Dystrophies There has, until recently, been no specific treatment for any of the muscular dystrophies. The physician is forced to stand by and witness the unrelenting progression of weakness and wasting. The various vitamins, amino acids, testosterone, and drugs, such as penicillamine, recommended in the past, have all proved to be ineffective. The administration of prednisone appears to slightly retard the tempo of progression of Duchenne dystrophy for a period of up to 3 years (Fenichel et al). The optimal dose is 0.75 mg/kg given daily, but it must often be reduced because of intolerable side effects (weight gain, behavioral and gastrointestinal disorders)."

The diagnosis of Becker muscular dystrophy requires Western blot analysis of muscle biopsy samples, demonstrating a reduced amount or abnormal size of dystrophin or mutation analysis of DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes. Genetic testing reveals deletions or duplications of the dystrophin gene in 65% of patients with Becker dystrophy, approximately the same percentage as in Duchenne dystrophy. In both Becker and Duchenne dystrophies, the size of the DNA deletion does not predict clinical severity; however, in ~95% of patients with Becker dystrophy, the DNA deletion does not alter the translational reading frame of messenger RNA. These \u201cin-frame\u201d mutations allow for production of some dystrophin, which accounts for the presence of altered rather than absent dystrophin on Western blot analysis."

The protein is expressed in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle, as well as in brain. To date, the dystrophin gene is the largest one known in humans, spanning more than 2 Mb of DNA. This is in part the explanation for the observation that one-third of affected boys have a spontaneous mutation in the gene. Most mutations are deletions and combined with the less frequent duplications, account for over two-thirds of cases."

            "content": "Serum CK levels are always markedly elevated. Diagnosis is established by genetic testing for the dystrophin gene mutation. Prenatal diagnosis is possible. Approximately one third of cases represent new mutations. Occasionally, the diagnosis is not made until a muscle biopsy shows muscle fiber degeneration and regeneration accompanied by increased intrafascicular connective tissue. Steroid therapy is now instituted to slow the pace of the disease and delay motor disability. Supportive care includes physical therapy, bracing, proper wheelchairs, and treatment of cardiac dysfunction or pulmonary infections. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended. Through improvements in management, patients are now living significantly longer than in the pre-steroid era."

            "content": "The loss of dystrophin leads to a parallel loss of DAPs and to disruption of the dystroglycan\u2013protein complex. This change renders the sarcolemma susceptible to breaks and tears during muscle contraction, a hypothesis proposed first by Mokri and Engel and entirely consistent with the ultrastructural abnormalities that characterize Duchenne dystrophy. These authors demonstrated defects of the plasma membrane (sarcolemma) in a large proportion of nonnecrotic hyalinized muscle fibers, allowing ingress of extracellular fluid and calcium. The entrance of calcium is speculated to activate proteases and to increase protein degradation. The membrane defects and the associated alterations in the underlying region of the fiber represent the earliest and most basic pathologic change in Duchenne dystrophy and account for the leakage into the serum of CK and other enzymes of muscle.

            "content": "Duchenne dystrophy is caused by a mutation of the gene that encodes dystrophin, a 427-kDa protein localized to the inner surface of the sarcolemma of the muscle fiber. The dystrophin gene is >2000 kb in size and thus is one of the largest identified human genes. It is localized to the short arm of the X chromosome at Xp21. The most common gene mutation is a deletion. The size varies but does not correlate with disease severity. Deletions are not uniformly distributed over the gene but rather are most common near the beginning (5\u2032 end) and middle of the gene. Less often, Duchenne dystrophy is caused by a gene duplication or point mutation. Identification of a specific mutation allows for an unequivocal diagnosis, makes possible accurate testing of potential carriers, and is useful for prenatal diagnosis."
