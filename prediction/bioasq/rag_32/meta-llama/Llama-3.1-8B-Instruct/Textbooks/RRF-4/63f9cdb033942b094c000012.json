    "predict": "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if silencing of SRRM4 promotes microexon inclusion, we need to understand the role of SRRM4 in the splicing process. SRRM4 is a serine/arginine (SR) protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of alternative splicing. SR proteins, including SRRM4, are involved in the recognition of exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) and exonic splicing silencers (ESSs), which are critical for the proper recognition and splicing of exons. When SRRM4 is silenced, the splicing machinery may be disrupted, leading to changes in the inclusion or exclusion of microexons. Microexons are small exons that are typically excluded from the final mRNA product due to their small size or weak splicing signals. The silencing of SRRM4 may lead to the increased inclusion of microexons, as the splicing machinery may be less efficient in recognizing and excluding these small exons. Therefore, based on the role of SRRM4 in the splicing process, silencing of SRRM4 is likely to promote microexon inclusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" }",

In some cases, the RNA interference machinery can also selectively shut off synthesis of the target RNAs. For this to occur, the short siRNAs produced by the Dicer protein are assembled with a group of proteins (including Argonaute) to form the RITS (RNA-induced transcriptional silencing) complex. Using single-stranded siRNA as a guide sequence, this complex binds complementary RNA transcripts as they emerge from a transcribing RNA polymerase II (Figure 7\u201377). Positioned on the genome in this way, the RITS complex attracts proteins that covalently modify nearby histones and eventually direct the formation of heterochromatin to prevent further transcription initiation. In some cases, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a Dicer enzyme are also recruited by the RITS complex to continually generate additional siRNAs in situ.

MicroRNAs are encoded either singly or can be transcribed in a \u201cpolycis-tronic\u201d clusters and produced by an elaborate expression and processing mechanism. After a primary miRNA transcript is generated by RNA polymerase II or III, it is processed in the nucleus to produce a short hairpin precursor miRNA transcript.

The mature double-stranded miRNA is then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) in the cytoplasm.

Thus, these receptors are capable of mediating dramatic changes in the level of gene activity. Certain disease states are associated with defective regulation of these events.

Covalent posttranslational modifications of histones play an important role in altering DNA accessibility and chromatin structure and hence in regulating transcription. Histones can be reversibly modified in their amino-terminal tails, which protrude from the nucleosome core particle, by acetylation of lysine, phosphorylation of serine, methylation of lysine and arginine residues, and sumoylation. Acetylation of histones by histone acetylases (HATs), e.g., leads to unwinding of chromatin and accessibility to transcription factors. Conversely, deacetylation by histone deacetylases (HDACs) results in a compact chromatin structure"

            "content": "In the previous chapter, we introduced the central dogma, according to which the flow of genetic information proceeds from DNA through RNA to protein (Figure 6\u20131). But we have seen throughout this book that RNA molecules perform many critical tasks in the cell besides serving as intermediate carriers of genetic information. Among these noncoding RNAs are the rRNA and tRNA molecules, which are responsible for reading the genetic code and synthesizing proteins. The RNA molecule in telomerase serves as a template for the replication of chromosome ends, snoRNAs modify ribosomal RNA, and snRNAs carry out the major events of RNA splicing. And we saw in the previous section that Xist RNA has an important role in inactivating one copy of the X chromosome in females."

            "content": "You will recall from Chapter 1 that epigenetics refers to reversible, heritable changes in gene expression that occur without mutation. Such changes involve posttranslational modifications of histones and DNA methylation, both of which affect gene expression. In normal, differentiated cells, the major portion of the genome is not expressed. These regions of the genome are silenced by DNA methylation and histone modifications. On the other hand, cancer cells are characterized by a global DNA hypomethylation and selective promoter-localized hypermethylation. Indeed, it has become evident during the past several years that tumor suppressor genes are sometimes silenced by hypermethylation of promoter sequences, rather than by mutation. In addition, genome-wide hypomethylation has been shown to cause chromosomal instability and can induce tumors in mice. Thus, epigenetic changes may influence carcinogenesis in many ways. As an added wrinkle, deep sequencing of cancer genomes has identified"
