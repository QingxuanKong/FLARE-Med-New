According to Document [0], the 12\u2014month prevalence estimate for trichotillomania in adults and adolescents is 1%\u20142%, and females are more frequently affected than males, at a ratio of approximately 10:1. However, Document [1] states that among children with trichotillomania, males and females are more equally represented. Therefore, we need to consider whether the difference in prevalence between males and females is consistent across different age groups. Document [10] suggests that females and males have more similarities than differences in terms of most clinical features, but males are more likely to have genital preoccupations, and females are more likely to have a comorbid eating disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" }",

Hair pulling may be seen in infants, and this behavior typically resolves during early devel- opment. Onset of hair pulling in trichotillomania most commonly coincides with, or follows the onset of, puberty. Sites of hair pulling may vary over time. The usual course of trichotillo- mania is chronic, with some waxing and waning if the disorder is untreated. Symptoms may possibly worsen in females accompanying hormonal changes (e.g., menstruation, perimeno\u2014 pause). For some individuals, the disorder may come and go for weeks, months, or years at a time. A minority of individuals remit without subsequent relapse within a few years of onset. Genetic and physiological. There is evidence for a genetic vulnerability to trichotillo\u2014 mania. The disorder is more common in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and their first-degree relatives than in the general population."
