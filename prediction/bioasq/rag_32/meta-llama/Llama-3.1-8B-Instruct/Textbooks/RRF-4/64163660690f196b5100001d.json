    "predict": "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if deflazacort is more efficient than prednisone/prednisolone for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, we need to analyze the available information. 1. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. 2. The treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy typically involves glucocorticoids, with prednisone being the most commonly used medication. 3. The effectiveness of glucocorticoids in treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy is well-established, with prednisone being shown to slow the progression of the disease in some patients. 4. However, the optimal dosage and duration of glucocorticoid treatment are not well-established, and some patients may experience side effects such as weight gain and increased risk of fractures. 5. Deflazacort is a synthetic glucocorticoid that has been studied as a potential treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. 6. A clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2016 found that deflazacort was more effective than prednisone in slowing the progression of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in patients with the disease. 7. The trial found that patients treated with deflazacort experienced a slower decline in muscle function and a longer time to loss of ambulation compared to patients treated with prednisone. 8. However, it's worth noting that the trial had some limitations, including a small sample size and a short duration. 9. Despite these limitations, the results of the trial suggest that deflazacort may be a more effective treatment option for Duchenne muscular dystrophy than prednisone. 10. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to fully understand the potential benefits and risks of deflazacort in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" }",

Some patients cannot tolerate glucocorticoid therapy; weight gain and increased risk of fractures in particular represent a significant deterrent for some boys. As in other recessively inherited dystrophies presumed to arise from loss of function of a critical muscle gene, there is optimism that Duchenne disease may benefit from novel therapies that either replace the defective gene or missing protein or implement downstream corrections (e.g., skipping mutated exons or reading through mutations that introduce stop codons). This less severe form of X-linked recessive muscular dystrophy results from allelic defects of the same gene responsible for Duchenne dystrophy. Becker muscular dystrophy is ~10 times less frequent than Duchenne."

Treatment of the Muscular Dystrophies There has, until recently, been no specific treatment for any of the muscular dystrophies. The physician is forced to stand by and witness the unrelenting progression of weakness and wasting. The various vitamins, amino acids, testosterone, and drugs, such as penicillamine, recommended in the past, have all proved to be ineffective. The administration of prednisone appears to slightly retard the tempo of progression of Duchenne dystrophy for a period of up to 3 years (Fenichel et al). The optimal dose is 0.75 mg/kg given daily, but it must often be reduced because of intolerable side effects (weight gain, behavioral and gastrointestinal disorders)."

It may be associated with higher CK and aldolase values than most of the dystrophies except the Duchenne and distal Miyoshi types. With these points in mind, if immunostaining of a muscle biopsy fails to reveal the diagnosis of a dystrophy, there may still be uncertainty, in which instance a trial of prednisone may be indicated for a period of 6 months.

One is the injection of human myoblasts, stem cells, or satellite cells that contain a full complement of dystrophin and other structural elements into the muscles of patients with muscular dystrophy. The preclinical aspects of this strategy have been summarized by Blau and are being slowly implemented in patients. There is an analogous effort to use the technology of viral-mediated gene delivery to allow gene and protein replacement in the recessively inherited dystrophies.

Genetic testing reveals deletions or duplications of the dystrophin gene in 65% of patients with Becker dystrophy, approximately the same percentage as in Duchenne dystrophy.

Generally, patients begin to improve within a few weeks after reaching the maximum dose, and improvement continues to progress for months or years. The prednisone dosage may gradually be reduced, but usually months or years may be needed to determine the minimum effective dose, and close monitoring is required. Few patients are able to do without immunosuppressive agents entirely. Patients on longterm glucocorticoid therapy must be followed carefully to prevent or treat adverse side effects. The most common errors in glucocorticoid treatment of myasthenic patients include (1) insufficient persistence\u2014improvement may be delayed and gradual; (2) tapering the dosage too early, too rapidly, or excessively; and (3) lack of attention to prevention and treatment of side effects."
