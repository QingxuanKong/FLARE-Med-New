Medical hydrology refers to the study and application of water in the treatment of diseases and health conditions. Spa therapy, on the other hand, typically involves the use of water and other treatments, such as heat, cold, and massage, to promote relaxation and well-being. While both involve water, they have distinct focuses and approaches. Medical hydrology is more focused on the therapeutic use of water for specific health conditions, whereas Spa therapy is more focused on relaxation and wellness.

This is intended to exclude patients with axial symptoms and thus to divide the universe of patients with SpA into axial and exclusively peripheral subsets. These criteria are shown in Table 384-3. Approximately one-half of the patients with undifferentiated SpA are HLA-B27-positive, and thus the absence of B27 is not useful in establishing or excluding the diagnosis. In familial cases, which are much more frequently B27-positive, there is often eventual progression to classical AS."

The prevalence of B27 in this condition, which has been termed the seronegative enthesopathy and arthropathy (SEA) syndrome, is approximately 80%. Many, but not all, of these patients go on to develop AS in late adolescence or adulthood. Management of undifferentiated SpA is similar to that of the other spondyloarthritides. Response to anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy has been documented, and this therapy is indicated in severe, persistent cases not responsive to other treatment. Current pediatric textbooks and journals should be consulted for information on management of juvenile-onset SpA. A relationship between arthritis and IBD was observed in the 1930s.

However, investigation of unselected SpA patients by ileocolonoscopy has revealed that from one-third to two-thirds of patients with AS have subclinical intestinal inflammation that is evident either macroscopically or histologically. These lesions have also been found in patients with undifferentiated SpA or ReA (both enterically and urogenitally acquired)."
