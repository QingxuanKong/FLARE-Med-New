    "predict": "{ \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if microexon alternative splicing of small GTPase regulators has implications in central nervous system diseases, we need to consider the role of alternative splicing in the nervous system and the function of small GTPase regulators. Alternative splicing is a process by which a single gene can code for multiple proteins, and it is highly prevalent in the nervous system. Small GTPase regulators are involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and protein transport, which are critical for proper nervous system function. Given the importance of alternative splicing in the nervous system and the role of small GTPase regulators in cellular processes, it is reasonable to infer that microexon alternative splicing of small GTPase regulators could have implications in central nervous system diseases. In fact, research has shown that aberrant splicing of small GTPase regulators can contribute to the development of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Therefore, based on the understanding of alternative splicing and the function of small GTPase regulators, it is likely that microexon alternative splicing of small GTPase regulators has implications in central nervous system diseases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" }",

Alternative splicing refers to the inclusion of different combinations of exons in mature mRNA, resulting in the potential for many different protein products encoded by a single gene. Alternative splicing represents a powerful mechanism for generation of complexity and variation, and this mechanism appears to be highly prevalent in the nervous system, affecting key processes such as neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels. Numerous diseases are already known to result from abnormalities in alternative splicing. Increased inclusion of exon 10\u2013containing transcripts of MAPT can cause frontotemporal dementia. Aberrant splicing also contributes to the pathogenesis of Duchenne\u2019s, myotonic, and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophies; ataxia telangiectasia; neurofibromatosis; some inherited ataxias; and fragile X syndrome, among other disorders.

Earlier in this section we saw that alternative splicing can give rise to different proteins from the same gene and that this is a common strategy to enhance the coding potential of genomes. Some examples of alternative splicing are constitutive; that is, the alternatively spliced mRNAs are produced continuously by cells of an organism. However, in many cases, the cell regulates the splicing patterns so that different forms of the protein are produced at different times and in different tissues (see Figure 6\u201326). In Chapter 7, we return to this issue to discuss some specific examples of regulated RNA splicing."

This demarcation of exons by the SR proteins occurs cotranscriptionally, beginning at the CBC (cap-binding complex) at the 5\u02b9 end. It has been proposed that a group of proteins known as the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) may preferentially associate with intron sequences, further helping the spliceosome distinguish introns from exons.

Instead, the mutation typically creates a new pattern of splicing (Figure 6\u201333). Most commonly, an exon is simply skipped (Figure 6\u201333B). In other cases, the mutation causes a cryptic splice junction to be efficiently used (Figure 6\u201333C). Apparently, the splicing machinery has evolved to pick out the best possible pattern of splice junctions, and if the optimal one is damaged by mutation, it will seek out the next best pattern, and so on. This inherent plasticity in the process of RNA splicing suggests that changes in splicing patterns caused by random mutations have been important in the evolution of genes and organisms.

            "content": "The diseases grouped in this chapter, and many in the next, represent four particular categories of genetic abnormality: (1) monogenic disorders determined by a single mutation that follow a mendelian pattern of inheritance. These mutations can be of a single base pair (point mutation), an insertion or deletion of nucleotides, or structural rearrangements of a sequence of DNA, such as translocations or inversions; because the most important of these involve the protein coding (exonic) portion of DNA, they are likely to disrupt the structure and function of enzymes or cellular structural proteins; this \u201cexome\u201d constitutes 1 percent of the entire genome; (2) a type of monogenic mutation characterized by duplications or deletions of genes or parts of chromosomes, termed copy number variations; these account for some proportion the heritability of common diseases; (3) single nucleotide polymorphisms, which are variations from the most common, \u201cwild type,\u201d sequence of a gene and are by"

            "content": "Figure 6\u201326 Alternative splicing of the \u03b1-tropomyosin gene from rat. \u03b1-Tropomyosin is a coiled-coil protein (see Figure 3\u20139) that carries out several tasks, most notably the regulation of contraction in muscle cells. The primary transcript can be spliced in different ways, as indicated in the figure, to produce distinct mRNAs, which then give rise to variant proteins. Some of the splicing patterns are specific for certain types of cells. For example, the \u03b1-tropomyosin made in striated muscle is different from that made from the same gene in smooth muscle. The arrowheads in the top part of the figure mark the sites where cleavage and poly-A addition form the 3\u02b9 ends of the mature mRNAs."

            "content": "Prions are proteins that adopt an alternative conformation, which becomes self-propagating. Some prions cause degeneration of the central nervous system (CNS). Once relegated to causing a group of rare disorders of the CNS such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), prions\u2014as mounting evidence shows\u2014also appear to play a key role in more common illnesses such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). While CJD is caused by the accumulation of PrPSc, increasing data argue that A\u03b2 prions cause AD, \u03b1-synuclein prions cause PD, and tau prions cause the frontotemporal dementias (FTDs). In this chapter, we confine our discussion to CJD, which typically presents with a rapidly progressive dementia as well as motor abnormalities. The illness is relentlessly progressive and generally causes death within 9 months of onset. Most CJD patients are between 50 and 75 years of age; however, patients as young as 17 and as old as 83 have been recorded."

            "content": "These diseases are the result of mutations in the mitochondrial genome, a ringed DNA of 16,569 base pairs and 37 genes contained within the organelle, or of mutations in a few nuclear genes that code for a component of the mitochondrion. To date, more than 100 point mutations and 200 deletions, insertions, and rearrangements have been identified. It is estimated that two-thirds of the point mutations affect the transfer RNA of the mitochondrion, one-third affect polypeptide units of the respiratory chain, and a small number affect mitochondrial ribosomal RNA. This corresponds approximately to the proportion of genes devoted to each of these functions. DiMauro and Schon, and Koopman and colleagues have written reviews of mitochondrial genomics and the most relevant diseases, which may be consulted by interested readers."
