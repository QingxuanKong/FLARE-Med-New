This is not a perceptual deficit because prosopagnosic patients easily can tell whether two faces are identical. Furthermore, a prosopagnosic patient who cannot recognize a familiar face by visual inspection alone can use auditory cues to reach appropriate recognition if allowed to listen to the person\u2019s voice. The deficit in prosopagnosia is therefore modality-specific and reflects the existence of a lesion that prevents the activation of otherwise intact multimodal templates by relevant visual input. Prosopagnosic patients characteristically have no difficulty with the generic identification of a face as a face or a car as a car, but may not recognize the identity of an individual face or the make of an individual car.

The notion that there is a \u201cface area\u201d in the fusiform gyrus is expressed uncritically in the literature and seems to be an oversimplification. A variant of this disorder is characterized by specific difficulty with facial matching or discrimination from partial cues, such as portions of the face or a profile. The distinction between this deficit and the usual type of prosopagnosia rests on the use of tests that do not require memory of a specific face. This difficulty with facial matching and discrimination is more likely to be seen with lesions of the right than of the left posterior hemisphere."

Such patients also cannot learn to recognize new faces. They may also be unable to interpret the meaning of facial expressions or to judge the ages or distinguish the genders of faces. In identifying persons, the patient depends on other data, such as the presence and type of glasses or moustache, the type of gait, or sound of the voice. Similarly, species of animals and birds and specific models or types of cars cannot be distinguished from one another, but the patient can still recognize an animal, bird, or car as such.

This defect has been attributed to a subcortical lesion of the left temporal lobe, spanning the Wernicke area and interrupting also those auditory fibers that cross in the corpus callosum from the opposite side. Thus, there is a failure to activate the left auditory language area (Wernicke area). Bilateral lesions of the auditory cortex have the same effect (see Chap. 22). 4.

            "content": "A second type, semantic dementia (aphasia), is characterized by early difficulty naming items, people, and words, followed by verbal perseveration, but fluency is retained. There is considerable difficulty in generating lists of words of a given category, such as animals. These individuals are quite aware that they are having trouble finding words. Eventually the patient loses not just the use of names of people and objects, but also their meaning, or the conceptual knowledge of the word. Some may develop severe prosopagnosia, especially if the atrophy is predominantly right sided. Memory for day-to-day events is preserved. A third type has been proposed, logopenic aphasia, that shares most aspects of nonfluent aphasia but in which the meaning of words is retained."

            "content": "Color agnosia Here one must distinguish several different aspects of identification of colors, such as the correct perception of color (the loss of which is called color blindness) or the naming of a color. The common form of retinal color blindness is congenital and is readily tested by the use of Ishihara plates. Acquired color blindness caused by a cerebral lesion, with retention of form vision, is referred to as central achromatopsia. Here the disturbance is one of hue discrimination; the patient cannot sort a series of colored wools according to hue (Holmgren test) and may complain that colors have lost their brightness or that everything looks gray. Achromatopsia is frequently associated with visual field defects and with prosopagnosia. Most often, the field defects are bilateral and tend to affect the upper quadrants. However, full-field achromatopsia may exist with retention of visual acuity and form vision. There may also be a hemior quadrant-achromatopsia without other"
