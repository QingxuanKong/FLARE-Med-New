CIDEB (CIDEB) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in lipid metabolism. Mutations in this gene have been associated with various metabolic disorders, including hepatic steatosis. However, the question of whether a CIDEB mutation protects from liver disease is not directly addressed in the provided documents. The documents focus on other genetic disorders such as hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which are associated with liver disease. There is no specific information on CIDEB mutations and their protective effects on liver disease.

Several studies have shown an increased prevalence of HFE mutations in PCT patients. Iron accentuates the inherited enzyme deficiency in PCT and clinical manifestations of PCT. The situation in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is less clear, but some studies have shown an increased prevalence of HFE mutations in NASH patients. The role of phlebotomy therapy, however, is unproven. In chronic HCV infection, HFE mutations are not more common, but some subjects have increased hepatic iron. Before initiating antiviral therapy in these patients, it is reasonable to perform phlebotomy therapy to remove excess iron stores, because this reduces liver enzyme levels. HFE mutations are not increased in frequency in alcoholic liver disease. Hemochromatosis in a heavy drinker can be distinguished from alcoholic liver disease by the presence of the C282Y mutation."

Inherited disorders include hemochromatosis, Wilson\u2019s disease, \u03b11 antitrypsin (\u03b11AT) deficiency, and cystic fibrosis (CF). Hemochromatosis is the most common inherited disorder affecting white populations, with the genetic susceptibility for the disease being identified in 1 in 250 individuals. Over the past 15 years, it has become increasingly apparent that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of elevated liver enzymes found in the U.S. population.

            "content": "The ATP7B gene, located on chromosome 13, encodes a transmembrane copper-transporting ATPase that is expressed on the hepatocyte canalicular membrane. The overwhelming majority of patients with Wilson disease are compound heterozygotes with different loss-of-function mutations affecting each ATP7B allele. The overall frequency of mutated alleles is 1:100, and the prevalence of the disease is approximately 1:30,000 to 1:50,000. Loss of ATP7B protein function impairs the transport of copper into the bile and the incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin, which is not secreted in its apoceruloplasmin form. These abnormalities lead to copper accumulation in the liver and a decrease in plasma ceruloplasmin. Accumulating copper causes liver injury through the production of reactive oxygen species by the Fenton reaction (Chapter 3). Eventually, non-ceruloplasmin\u2013bound copper is released from injured hepatocytes into the circulation, causing red cell hemolysis and allowing copper to deposit"

Why are both these types of mutation usually dominant? 8\u201315 Discuss the following statement: \u201cWe would have no idea today of the importance of insulin as a regulatory hormone if its absence were not associated with the human disease diabetes. It is the dramatic consequences of its absence that focused early efforts on the identification of insulin and the study of its normal role in physiology.\u201d 8\u201316 You have just gotten back the results from an RNA-seq analysis of mRNAs from liver. You had anticipated counting the number of reads of each mRNA to determine the relative abundance of different mRNAs. But you are puzzled because many of the mRNAs have given you results like those shown in Figure Q8\u20134. How is it that different parts of an mRNA can be represented at different levels?"
