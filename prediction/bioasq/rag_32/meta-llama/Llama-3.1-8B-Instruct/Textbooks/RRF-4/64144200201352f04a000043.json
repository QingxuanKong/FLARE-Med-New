The key to understanding anaphylaxis is to recognize that it is mediated by the release of histamine and other chemical mediators from mast cells. Mast cells are a type of immune system cell that play a crucial role in the body's response to allergens. When an allergen enters the body, it binds to IgE antibodies on the surface of mast cells, leading to the activation of the mast cells and the release of histamine and other chemical mediators. This release of mediators causes a range of symptoms, including hives, itching, swelling, stomach cramps, diarrhea, and difficulty breathing. In severe cases, anaphylaxis can lead to a drop in blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, and even death. Therefore, anaphylaxis is a result of mast cell activation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" }",

Both reactions are acute, severe, and can be life threatening due to a massive release of inflammatory mediators. Urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis are best considered as symptoms because they have a variety of causes. Not all mast cell activation is IgE-mediated. Immunologic, nonimmunologic, physical, and chemical stimuli can produce degranulation of mast cells and basophils. Anaphylatoxins,C3a and C5a, can cause histamine release in a non\u2013IgE-mediated reaction. Anaphylatoxins are generated in serum sickness (reactions to blood transfusions) (see Chapter 82) and in infectious, neoplastic, and rheumatic diseases. In addition mast cell degranulation can occur from a direct pharmacologic effect or physical or mechanical activation, such as urticaria after exposure to opiate medications, and dermatographism."

Elevations of tryptase levels in serum implicate mast cell activation in a systemic reaction and are particularly informative for anaphylaxis with episodes of hypotension during general anesthesia or when there has been a fatal outcome.

Increased \u02dcuid in tissues causing increased \u02dcow of lymph to lymph nodes, increased cells and protein in tissues, increased effector response in tissues Hypotension potentially leading to anaphylactic shock Congestion and blockage of airways (wheezing, coughing, phlegm) Swelling and mucus secretion in nasal passages Ocular itching Sneezing Expulsion of gastrointestinal tract contents (diarrhea, vomiting) Decreased airway diameter, increased mucus secretion Eyes, nasal passages, and airways Mast-cell activation and granule release Increased \u02dcuid secretion, increased peristalsis Increased blood \u02dcow, increased permeability Gastrointestinal tract Blood vessels 14-6 Most IgE is cell-bound and engages effector mechanisms of the immune system by pathways different from those of other antibody isotypes."

            "content": "It is estimated that 20% to 30% of immediate hypersensitivity reactions are triggered by nonantigenic stimuli such as temperature extremes and exercise, and do not involve TH2 cells or IgE. It is believed that in these cases mast cells are abnormally sensitive to activation by various nonimmune stimuli. The incidence of many allergic diseases is increasing in developed countries and seems to be related to a decrease in infections during early life. These observations have http://ebooksmedicine.net"

A. Connective tissue mast cells do not participate in the initiation of an anaphylactic reaction. B. Epinephrine should be avoided in patients suffering from anaphylactic shock as it may worsen the patient\u2019s condition. C. During anaphylactic shock, blood vessels lose permeability, and high blood pressure leads to death. D. Penicillin can modify self proteins, causing an immune response with IgE production in some individuals that can lead to anaphylaxis upon re-encountering the drug. 14.7 Multiple Choice: Hypersensitivity reactions can cause pathology through the deposition of immune complexes. Which of the following is a mechanism by which immune complexes can be pathogenic? (More than one may apply.) ___ A. Immune complexes deposit in blood vessel walls."
