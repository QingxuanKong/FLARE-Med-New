ATP7B is an efflux transporter in the liver, but it is also essential in the Trans-Golgi Network for transferring copper for the metalation of ceruloplasmin and biliary copper excretion. [32] The point mutation H1069Q is the most common ATP7B mutation in patients from Central, Eastern, and Northern Europe, and 50 to 80% of Wilson disease patients from these countries carry at least one H1069Q allele. [33] Mutations resulting in completely absent or non-functional ATP7B protein activity are associated with early-onset, typically hepatic, severe Wilson disease; these mutations are comparatively rare. [34] It is characterized by hepatolenticular degeneration due to copper deposition in organs, including the basal ganglia, cornea, and liver.\u00a0In Wilson's disease, ceruloplasmin levels are usually low, but urinary excretion of copper is high. Liver biopsy results show high copper content. Clinically, a dark ring around the iris suggests a diagnosis of Wilson disease. This sign is known as a Kayser-Fleischer ring. [35]"

            "content": "Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is released from the liver and acts as a serine protease inhibitor (serpin) that protects the cells from neutrophil elastase activity. AAT deficiency is caused by a mutation in the SERPINA1 gene. The mutation is more common in European descendants. The production of AAT in individuals with the mutation is dependent on the allele type. There are three alleles for the AAT gene: M, S, and Z with autosomal codominant inheritance. The normal allele for the SERPINA1 gene is M, and AAT production in homozygous (PiMM) individuals is normal. The S mutation causes a moderate decrease in AAT production, and the Z mutation causes a significant decrease. Therefore, the severity of the disease is dependent on the genotypic expression. Individuals with two normal alleles, PiMM (protease inhibitor MM), have 100% expression of normal protein and have normal levels of AAT. Individuals with PiMS have 80% of normal serum levels of AAT. Individuals with PiSS, PiMZ, and PiSZ have 40-60% serum levels of AAT. Severe AAT deficiency is in individuals homozygous of the Z allele (PiZZ). They produce 10% of the normal serum AAT."

Augmentation therapy is only indicated for patients who have severe alpha-1 antitrypsin serum deficiency and COPD. Augmentation therapy is infused to elevate alpha-1 antitrypsin levels in plasma to oppose the elastase activity of the neutrophils in the lungs, which protects the lung tissue from damage.

Most cases of PCT (~80%) in fact occur in the absence of a UROD mutation and are due exclusively to acquired factors causing a deficiency in UROD activity- these cases are referred to as \"sporadic.\" [13] The decreased activity of UROD in the liver leads to the accumulation of uroporphyrinogen III, which is oxidized to uroporphyrin and heptacarboxyl porphyrin.

The role of phlebotomy therapy, however, is unproven. In chronic HCV infection, HFE mutations are not more common, but some subjects have increased hepatic iron. Before initiating antiviral therapy in these patients, it is reasonable to perform phlebotomy therapy to remove excess iron stores, because this reduces liver enzyme levels.

            "content": "The suspension injections can induce temporary infertility at higher concentrations, and patients experience delays in returning to baseline after\u00a0ceasing treatment. Medroxyprogesterone tablets are also contraindicated in patients with incomplete abortions. In women with hepatic dysfunction or hepatic diseases, medroxyprogesterone usage is contraindicated. Use should be discontinued in women who experience jaundice or disturbances with their liver function. In women with a history of major depression, migraine, or seizure disorder, medroxyprogesterone should be used with caution, as progestin can exacerbate these conditions.\u00a0 Clinicians\u00a0should counsel patients that using medroxyprogesterone does not protect against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or other sexually transmitted diseases.

            "content": "gene, which encodes a tight junction protein normally present in ductal cells. In cases of chronic pancreatitis, the CLDN2 protein is abnormally expressed in acinar cells and may alter the secretory dynamics of enzyme release. The abnormality does not appear to cause pancreatitis, but if pancreatitis occurs for any reason in a person with the CLDN2 variant, it is more likely that the person will develop chronic pancreatitis; the risk is increased even further among alcohol users. Only 10% of women have the X chromosome\u2013linked variant on both X chromosomes, and most women with the CLDN2 variant on one X chromosome appear to be protected from alcoholic chronic pancreatitis by the other X chromosome, if it is normal. Men, with only one X chromosome, have no protection if they inherit a CLDN2 mutation. This helps to explain the high prevalence of alcoholic chronic pancreatitis among men, although the mechanism remains unclear. This study does not demonstrate a genetic cause for all cases"

            "content": "Cells that harbor a mutation in BCL-2 where it increases quantity or remains to inhibit Bak/Bax despite death signals can become cancerous. For example, follicular lymphoma has a quantity mutation that leads to excessively high levels of BCL-2, decreasing the propensity of these cells to release Bak/Bax and enter apoptosis. If there is a lot of BCL-2 protecting the cell, there would need to be a greater increase in Bim/Bad/Bid to counter, which does\u00a0not happen in this cancerous state."

            "content": "There are 2 main types of HHT that are both caused by heterozygous mutations. HHT1 involves a mutation in endoglin (ENG). With this type, patients, especially women, are at a higher risk of getting pulmonary and cerebral AVMs. HHT2 involves a mutation in activin A receptor-like type 1 (ACVRL1), also known as ALK1. Patients with HHT2 have a higher risk of getting liver AVMs. ENG comprises about 61%, and ACVRL1 comprises about 37% of the mutations known to cause HHT. Mutations in growth differentiation factor 2 (GDF2) have been found. These\u00a0encode the protein that binds to endoglin and ACVRL1. Lastly, there are mutations in SMAD4 which encodes a protein that transmits signals from the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor. This mutation only comprises about 2% of cases. Patients with this gene mutation get juvenile\u00a0GI polyposis and HHT. [1] [2]"
