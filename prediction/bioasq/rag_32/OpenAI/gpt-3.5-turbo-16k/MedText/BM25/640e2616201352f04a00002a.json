    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if medical hydrology is the same as Spa therapy, we need to understand the definitions and characteristics of both terms. Medical hydrology refers to the therapeutic use of water in the treatment of various medical conditions. It involves the use of water in different forms such as baths, showers, and compresses to promote healing and improve health. On the other hand, Spa therapy refers to the use of natural mineral waters, often in a resort or spa setting, for relaxation, rejuvenation, and therapeutic purposes. While both medical hydrology and Spa therapy involve the use of water for therapeutic purposes, they have different focuses and settings. Medical hydrology is more medically oriented and can be practiced in various healthcare settings, while Spa therapy is often associated with leisure and relaxation in a spa or resort setting. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The prevalence of B27 in this condition, which has been termed the seronegative enthesopathy and arthropathy (SEA) syndrome, is approximately 80%. Many, but not all, of these patients go on to develop AS in late adolescence or adulthood. Management of undifferentiated SpA is similar to that of the other spondyloarthritides. Response to anti-TNF-\u03b1 therapy has been documented, and this therapy is indicated in severe, persistent cases not responsive to other treatment. Current pediatric textbooks and journals should be consulted for information on management of juvenile-onset SpA. A relationship between arthritis and IBD was observed in the 1930s.

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] This procedure can also be performed in older children and adults when the bladder outlet is obstructed. Despite its accuracy and strong endorsement, SPA is infrequently performed due to its invasive nature and associated discomfort, leading many healthcare professionals to prefer urinary catheterization.

Knowledge of the vascular anatomy and surrounding landmarks is necessary to avoid surgical failure and lower the risk of postoperative bleeding. [7] The sphenopalatine artery can be exposed endoscopically by raising a posterolateral mucosal flap over the orbital process of the palatine bone. [15] A vertical incision is then made inferior to the posterior portion of the middle turbinate, 1 cm anterior to its posterior tip. Raising the mucoperiosteal flap posteriorly and superiorly will expose the ethmoid crest. [7] The ethmoid crest represents a significant landmark for locating the position of the sphenopalatine artery and is consistently anteromedially to the sphenopalatine foramen. [6] Resection of the ethmoid crest enhances the exposure of the sphenopalatine artery and helps identify its terminal branches. As the flap is raised and the ethmoid crest resected, the fibro neurovascular bundle including the SPA and nasopalatine nerve, will be reachable at the sphenopalatine foramen. After isolating the artery and its branches, the next step is either cauterizing them with bipolar forceps, occluding with clips, or using a combination of both. If bleeding is not controlled distally, the sphenopalatine artery may be traced proximally through the sphenopalatine foramen into the pterygopalatine fossa to ligate the vessel before its terminal bifurcation. Upon attaining hemostasis,\u00a0the mucoperiosteal flap is returned and covered with an oxidized cellulose polymer hemostatic agent.

Inflammatory joint pain is associated with morning stiffness lasting more than one\u00a0hour, improving\u00a0with activity, and worsening with rest or inactivity. NSAIDs may markedly improve symptoms. Patients with axial SpA typically have chronic low back pain for more than three months with insidious onset before the age of 45. In these patients, the Schober\u2019s test (for assessment of lumbar flexion) and occiput to wall test (for assessment of upper thoracic/cervical spine mobility) should be a routine part of the physical exam [12] . Those with peripheral SpA have peripheral arthritis (acute onset, usually knees and ankles), enthesitis, and dactylitis. It is important to note that the peripheral arthritis is usually asymmetric. Enthesitis is relatively specific to SpA and is usually seen at the insertion of the calcaneal tendon. This typically leads to difficulty walking and to tenderness upon palpation. Dactylitis is a non-specific finding but is often seen in PsA and ReA. Non-musculoskeletal features that are important to ascertain in the history include ocular inflammation (uveitis, iritis, conjunctivitis), preceding/current gastrointestinal or genitourinary (GI/GU) infection, or diagnosis of or signs of psoriasis or IBD.

It presents a challenge when treating as the vessel is hard to visualize and presents with profound bleeding.

Five TNF inhibitors, infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab, are shown to achieve partial or full remission of symptoms. Of note, active infection (including latent or active tuberculosis which should be treated before starting treatment), advanced heart failure, lupus, multiple sclerosis, and cancer are contraindications for treatment with TNF inhibitors. Secukinumab, a monoclonal antibody to interleukin 17A, has been recently approved to treat AS and has been shown to be quite effective in those who cannot tolerate TNF inhibitors [16] . Non-biologic DMARDS (disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) such as methotrexate and sulfasalazine are not effective in axial disease but are a second-line treatment for the peripheral disease [15] . In the event, the non-biologics do not control disease, TNF-inhibitors are the third line, and at times, combination therapy with both biologic and non-biologic DMARDs is required. Systemic glucocorticoids have a limited role in SpA. For IBD associated arthritis and patients with severe uveitis, they may be unavoidable. Localized glucocorticoid injections should be used very sparingly due to the risk of tendon rupture. It is important to note that although ReA is usually a self-limited disease, it can be treated similarly to any other disease in the SpA family. Surgery is the very last resort management strategy. Disease progression is measured by history, physical exam, inflammatory markers, and serial imaging [15] ."

Subsequently, stimulation of other discrete sites in the medial and caudal regions of the diencephalon and rostral bulbar nuclei (notably raphe magnus and paragigantocellularis) was shown to have the same effect. Under the influence of such electrical stimulation, the animal could be operated on without anesthesia and move around in an undisturbed manner despite the administration of noxious stimuli.
