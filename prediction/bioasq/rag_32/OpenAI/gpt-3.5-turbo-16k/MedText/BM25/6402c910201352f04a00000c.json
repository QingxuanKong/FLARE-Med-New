One well-known occurrence of dementia is sundowning, which is the exacerbation of delirium at night and is often linked to sleep disturbances. Sundowning is identified by symptoms such as agitation, confusion, and irritability as natural light diminishes into the evening and at night. Individuals with dementia frequently experience excessive daytime sleepiness and nighttime insomnia. Sleep loss and reduced REM sleep in tauopathies, such as Alzheimer disease, can lead to insomnia and are believed to be due to the degeneration of sleep-promoting regions of the brain.

The findings can vary and\u00a0are related to the underlying etiology of vascular compromise, including lacunar infarcts, hemorrhagic lesions, and microvascular disease. [19] There is considerable overlap of neuropathological findings between dementia with Lewy body and Parkinson disease, and some overlap with Alzheimer disease.\u00a0Lewy body dementia and Parkinson disease are characterized by the presence of\u00a0Lewy bodies throughout the neocortex, brainstem, and limbic regions of the brain. Lewy bodies are intracellular aggregates of proteins, predominantly composed of alpha-synuclein proteins, which can be highlighted by various stains depending on location within the brain.\u00a0 There is also a loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and a loss of cholinergic neurons in ventral forebrain nuclei. Additionally, there are neuritic plaques made up of amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles, which can overlap findings in AD. [20] Alzheimer disease is characterized by neuritic plaques composed of extracellular amyloid beta protein deposition and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. It is also common to see signs of vascular ischemic damage and hippocampal sclerosis. [21] [22] Frontotemporal dementia is characterized by atrophy in the frontal and or temporal lobes. There is neuronal loss, microvacuolation, and loss of myelin. Degeneration is found in the cortical and basal ganglia. Four pathological subtypes are named after the proteins that make up inclusions found in the brain tissue. FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP are the most common. FTLD-FET is less common, and FTD-UPS is quite rare.

Obesity leads to depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Obesity can also, unfortunately, lead to unfair disadvantages such as being bullied and having fewer friends, which creates a feedback loop into even more depression and low self-esteem. This is clinically relevant because an outlook of negativity or overall harmful mental health can take a great toll on one\u2019s physical health and vice versa. Thus, it is imperative for clinicians, especially primary care physicians, to strongly encourage and motivate their patients to take better care of themselves through healthier eating habits, choosing fewer calories with greater nutritional value, staying active, and aiming for healthy body weight for their height. [5] Reducing body weight by decreasing calorie intake and increasing activity levels greatly reduces the health risks associated with obesity. It is known to extend lifespans and even prevent brain function decline with age. According to Alzheimer transgenic models, caloric restriction can prevent beta-amyloid deposition, which is the hallmark of Alzheimer disease. It also can reduce oxidative stress on the brain and support the plasticity of the synapses. Together, exercise and caloric\u00a0reduction can decrease neurodegenerative disease as a whole. Caloric restriction also notably decreases growth factors such as IGF-1, anabolic hormones, and inflammatory cytokines in the bloodstream as well as oxidative stress markers linked to certain cancers.

Stimulants used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may partially underlie the condition's relationship to bruxism."
