As in other recessively inherited dystrophies presumed to arise from loss of function of a critical muscle gene, there is optimism that Duchenne disease may benefit from novel therapies that either replace the defective gene or missing protein or implement downstream corrections (e.g., skipping mutated exons or reading through mutations that introduce stop codons).

Most patients with Becker dystrophy first experience difficulties between ages 5 and 15 years, although onset in the third or fourth decade or even later can occur.

            "content": "This milder dystrophy is closely related to the Duchenne type clinically, genetically, and ultrastructurally, involving the same DMD gene as in the Duchenne type. It had long been noted that mixed with the Duchenne group were relatively benign cases. In 1955, Becker and Keiner proposed that the latter be separated as a distinct entity, now called Becker muscular dystrophy. The incidence is difficult to ascertain, but it has been estimated as 3 to 6 per 100,000 male births. Like the Duchenne form, it is an X-linked disorder, practically limited to males and transmitted by females. It causes weakness and hypertrophy in the same muscles as Duchenne dystrophy, but the onset is much later (mean age: 12 years; range: 5 to 45 years). While boys with Duchenne dystrophy are usually dependent on a wheel-chair by early in the second decade, it is not uncommon for those with Becker dystrophy to walk well into adult life. In comparison to Duchenne dystrophy, those with Becker and intermediate"
