[41] A recent meta-analysis reported that isotretinoin is associated with a 61.1% excellent response rate. [42] However, high-dose isotretinoin is difficult to tolerate due to severe xerosis and cheilitis, myalgias, elevations in liver function tests, elevated triglycerides, and a high risk of congenital disabilities. Targeted biologics may be preferred, given the emerging role of the IL17/IL23 axis in PRP. Ixekizumab, a biologic IL17A inhibitor, was given to adults with moderate-to-severe PRP and resulted in a mean 61.3% improvement in clinical severity after 24 weeks, with no serious adverse events.

They reported a success rate of 97.1% after the first month with a recurrence rate of 8.2% at 60.2 months; mean healing time was 13.3 days, with 82.6% complete healing after a single application. [47] The methods employed by Sevinc et al. included preparing PRP from 40 cc of the patient\u2019s blood, and once the gel form was obtained, the procedure was performed under local anesthesia in the outpatient setting. There were no complications related to the use of PRP during their study. There has been a meta-analysis evaluating PRP for the treatment of pilonidal disease which included four studies and a pooled 484 patients, which found that the healing time was 36% less than the healing time of the control group which was calculated as 27.1 days in the PRP group versus 43 days in the control arm.

The level of (maternally acquired) serum antibody to the capsular polysaccharide, which is a polymer of polyribitol ribose phosphate (PRP), declines from birth to 6 months of age and, in the absence of vaccination, remains low until ~2 or 3 years of age. The age at the antibody nadir correlates with that of the peak incidence of type b disease. Antibody to PRP then appears partly as a result of exposure to Hib or cross-reacting antigens. Systemic Hib disease is unusual after the age of 6 years because of the presence of protective antibody.

            "content": "GLossary of prion terminoLoGy Prion Proteinaceous infectious particle that lacks nucleic acid. Prions are composed entirely of alternatively folded proteins that undergo self-propagation. Distinct strains of prions exhibit different biologic properties, which are epigenetically heritable. PrP prions cause scrapie in sheep and goats, mad cow disease, and related neurodegenerative diseases of humans such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). PrPSc Disease-causing isoform of the prion protein. This protein is the only identifiable macromolecule in purified preparations of scrapie prions. PrPC Cellular isoform of the prion protein. PrPC is the precursor of PrPSc. PrP 27-30 A fragment of PrPSc, generated by truncation of the NH2terminus by limited digestion with proteinase K. PrP 27-30 retains prion infectivity and polymerizes into amyloid. PRNP PrP gene located on human chromosome 20."

Children immunized with PRP-OMP at 2 and 4 months of age do not require a dose at 6 months of age. PRP-T should only be used for the booster dose in children aged 12\u201315 months. 2Two RV vaccines are available for use: (1) RV-1 (Rotarix) monovalent live, oral, human attenuated rotavirus vaccine is approved for a two-dose series, and (2) RV-5 (RotaTeq) pentavalent live, oral, human-bovine reassortant rotavirus vaccine is approved for a three-dose series."
