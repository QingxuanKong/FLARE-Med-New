    "question": "A 10-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician after discovering a painless mass in the left testicle. Results from tumor markers and a biopsy are as follows:\nAFP 350 ng/mL (normal value < 10 ng/mL)\nhCG 0.4 IU/L (normal value < 0.5 IU/L)\nBiopsy: Presence of glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells.\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Classic seminoma",
        "B": "Choriocarcinoma",
        "C": "Teratoma",
        "D": "Yolk sac tumor"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key information provided: 1. The patient is a 10-year-old boy presenting with a painless mass in the left testicle. 2. Tumor markers: AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) is elevated at 350 ng/mL (normal value < 10 ng/mL), and hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is within the normal range. 3. Biopsy results: Presence of glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells. Given these details, let's evaluate the options: - A. Classic seminoma: Typically presents with elevated hCG levels and is more common in older children and adults. The biopsy description does not match the characteristic features of seminoma. - B. Choriocarcinoma: This type of tumor usually presents with elevated hCG levels and often shows a \"moth-eaten\" appearance on imaging. The biopsy description does not support this diagnosis. - C. Teratoma: Teratomas can contain elements from all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). However, the biopsy description does not mention the presence of ectodermal elements, which are typically seen in teratomas. - D. Yolk sac tumor: Also known as endodermal sinus tumor, it is a germ cell tumor that can present with elevated AFP levels. The biopsy description of glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells, is consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, based on the elevated AFP levels and the specific biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is D. Yolk sac tumor.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
