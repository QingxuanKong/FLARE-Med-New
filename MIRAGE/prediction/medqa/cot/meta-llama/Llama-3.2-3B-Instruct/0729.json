    "question": "A 6-week-old male infant is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of recurrent nonbilious vomiting. Vomiting occurs almost immediately after most feeds. Each time, he becomes irritable while feeding and refuses to finish the bottle. He was born at 37 weeks' gestation and weighed 3300 g (7 lb 4 oz); he currently weighs 4000 g (8 lb 13 oz). He has Down syndrome. His vaccinations are up-to-date. He appears agitated and cries during the examination. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), pulse is 156/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 100/49 mm Hg. Examination shows upward slanting of the eyelids, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a single transverse palmar crease on both hands. The abdomen is soft and nontender. A 2.5-cm (1-inch) epigastric mass is palpated. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis is within normal limits. Further diagnostic evaluation of the patient is most likely to show which of the following?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Dilated colon segment on abdominal x-ray",
        "B": "Detection of rotavirus antigen on enzyme immunoassay (EIA)",
        "C": "Elongated and thickened pylorus on abdominal ultrasound",
        "D": "Tripple bubble sign on abdominal x-ray"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the symptoms of nonbilious vomiting in a 6-week-old infant, particularly the fact that the vomiting occurs almost immediately after feeding, becomes irritable during feeding, and is accompanied by refusal to finish the bottle, these symptoms are highly suggestive of pyloric stenosis. Pyloric stenosis is a condition where the pylorus, the passage that connects the stomach to the small intestine, becomes narrowed, leading to obstruction of food passage. The symptoms are classic for this condition, especially in infants with Down syndrome, who are at higher risk. The presence of an epigastric mass palpated during examination is also consistent with pyloric stenosis. The absence of bilious vomiting and normal arterial blood gas analysis further supports this diagnosis. The findings of upward slanting of the eyelids, broad and flat nasal bridge, and single transverse palmar crease are consistent with Down syndrome. The diagnostic test that would most likely confirm this diagnosis is an abdominal ultrasound, which would show an elongated and thickened pylorus. The other options are less likely to be correct given the symptoms and clinical findings. The dilated colon segment on abdominal x-ray (A) is more suggestive of intestinal obstruction or intussusception, which does not fit the symptoms. Detection of rotavirus antigen on enzyme immunoassay (B) would be relevant for viral gastroenteritis, which does not match the presentation of pyloric stenosis. The triple bubble sign on abdominal x-ray (D) is indicative of duodenal atresia or stenosis, which also does not fit the clinical scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
