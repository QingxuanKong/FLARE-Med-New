    "question": "An unconscious 55-year-old man is brought to the Emergency Department by ambulance. He had recently lost his job and his house was about to begin foreclosure. His adult children were concerned for his well being and called the police requesting a welfare check. He was found unresponsive in his gurague. There were several empty bottles of vodka around him and one half empty container of antifreeze. A review of his medical records reveals that he was previously in good health. Upon arrival to the ED he regains consciousness.  His blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg, heart rate 120/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and temperature 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F). On physical exam his speech is slurred and he has difficulty following commands. His abdomen is diffusely tender to palpation with no rebound tenderness. Initial laboratory tests show an elevated serum creatinine (Cr) of 1.9 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 29 mg/dL. Which of the following findings would be expected in this patient\u2019s urine?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Calcium oxalate crystals",
        "B": "Hyaline casts",
        "C": "Urine ketones",
        "D": "Urate crystals"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of acute intoxication, as evidenced by his unresponsiveness, slurred speech, and abdominal tenderness. The presence of empty vodka bottles and antifreeze further supports this diagnosis. The laboratory results showing elevated serum creatinine and BUN levels suggest renal impairment. In the context of acute ethanol intoxication, one of the common findings in the urine is the presence of ketones. This is because ethanol inhibits the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase, leading to the accumulation of pyruvate, which is then converted to acetyl-CoA, and subsequently to ketone bodies. Therefore, the expected finding in this patient's urine would be ketones.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
