    "question": "A 39-year-old woman with poorly controlled systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents to her rheumatologist for a follow-up visit. She has had intermittent myalgias, arthralgias, fatigue, and skin rashes over the past 10 years that have acutely worsened over the past year. She works as a school teacher but reports that she has had to miss several days of work due to her symptoms. She has been on hydroxychloroquine for several years but does not feel that it is adequately controlling her symptoms. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her temperature is 99.2\u00b0F (37.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/75 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 18/min. On exam, she is well-appearing and in no acute distress. She has erythematous, raised plaques with keratotic scaling and follicular plugging on her hands. The physician decides to trial the patient on low-dose prednisone to better control her symptoms. At 2 months of follow-up, she reports that her flares have subsided and she has been able to return to work full-time. If this patient continues this medication regimen, she will be at an elevated risk for developing which of the following?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Femoral neck fracture",
        "B": "Femoral shaft fracture",
        "C": "Osgood-Schlatter disease",
        "D": "Proximal phalanx fracture"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is taking low-dose prednisone, which is a corticosteroid medication commonly used to treat various inflammatory conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Long-term use of corticosteroids is known to have several side effects. One of the potential risks associated with prolonged corticosteroid use is osteoporosis, particularly in the hips and spine. This is because corticosteroids can interfere with bone formation and increase bone resorption, leading to a decrease in bone density. This increased risk of osteoporosis is a concern, especially in postmenopausal women, but it can also affect individuals of any age. The patient in this scenario is 39 years old and does not mention menopause, but she is still at risk of developing osteoporosis due to the long-term use of corticosteroids. Among the options provided, the most relevant risk associated with corticosteroid use is osteoporosis, which can increase the risk of fractures. However, the question asks about the specific type of fracture. Corticosteroids are more commonly associated with fractures of the hip (femoral neck or intertrochanteric region) rather than the shaft of the femur or proximal phalanx. Osgood-Schlatter disease is a condition that affects the patellar tendon and is not directly related to corticosteroid use. Therefore, the most likely answer is A. Femoral neck fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
