    "question": "A 67-year-old man with peripheral neuropathy comes to the physician for a follow-up examination after the results of serum protein electrophoresis showed monoclonal gammopathy. A complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells. Further analysis shows that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. Which of the following best describes this class of immune cells?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Bone marrow-derived macrophages",
        "B": "CD4+ T lymphocytes",
        "C": "Natural killer cells",
        "D": "Band neutrophils"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to understand the information provided and relate it to the characteristics of the immune cells listed as options. First, the patient has monoclonal gammopathy, which indicates the presence of an abnormal protein produced by a clone of plasma cells. The bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells, suggesting that the abnormal plasma cells are present in a relatively small percentage of the bone marrow cells. The key piece of information is the downregulation of class I major histocompatibility molecules (MHC I) on these monoclonal plasma cells. Normally, MHC I molecules are expressed on the surface of almost all nucleated cells and present peptides from proteins inside the cell to cytotoxic T cells. The downregulation of MHC I on these plasma cells suggests that they are evading the immune system. Given that the proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation, we can infer that these cells are not dependent on the antigen presentation pathway. Considering the options provided: A. Bone marrow-derived macrophages are primarily involved in phagocytosis and antigen presentation through MHC II, not MHC I. B. CD4+ T lymphocytes are a type of T cell that plays a central role in the immune response, but they require antigen presentation through MHC II and are not responsible for lysing abnormal cells directly. C. Natural killer (NK) cells are a type of lymphocyte that can lyse abnormal cells without prior antigen exposure or activation, and they do not require MHC I for their cytotoxic function. They can recognize stressed or infected cells through other mechanisms, such as the presence of stress-induced ligands or the absence of MHC I. D. Band neutrophils are a type of granulocyte involved in phagocytosis, but they are not known for their ability to lyse abnormal cells or evade MHC I. Based on the information provided, the best answer is C. Natural killer cells, as they are the immune cells that can lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation, and can recognize cells that have downregulated MHC I.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
