    "question": "A previously healthy 29-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 35 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a routine prenatal visit. Current medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. A rectovaginal swab culture grows bacitracin-resistant colonies of gram-positive cocci with surrounding areas of clear hemolysis. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to decrease vertical transmission of this organism?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Abstain from breastfeeding",
        "B": "Administer ampicillin intrapartum",
        "C": "Perform amniocentesis at 37 weeks",
        "D": "Administer intravenous immune globulin postpartum"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the key elements and analyze the situation step by step: 1. **Patient Profile**: A 29-year-old woman at 35 weeks' gestation with a history of no previous pregnancies (gravida 1, para 0). This is considered a high-risk pregnancy due to the advanced gestational age. 2. **Symptoms and Findings**: The patient presents with a rectovaginal swab culture growing bacitracin-resistant colonies of gram-positive cocci with surrounding areas of clear hemolysis. This suggests a Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection. GBS is a common cause of neonatal sepsis and is a significant concern for vertical transmission from mother to child during delivery. 3. **Understanding GBS Infection**: GBS can cause severe illness in newborns, including sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for pregnant women at 35-37 weeks' gestation if they are at high risk for GBS colonization. 4. **Options Analysis**: - **A. Abstain from breastfeeding**: This is not a recommended intervention for GBS infection and is not directly related to preventing vertical transmission. - **B. Administer ampicillin intrapartum**: This is the recommended intervention for GBS IAP, which can help reduce the risk of GBS transmission to the newborn. - **C. Perform amniocentesis at 37 weeks**: Amniocentesis is not a standard procedure for GBS prophylaxis or treatment. - **D. Administer intravenous immune globulin postpartum**: This is not a standard treatment for GBS infection and is not recommended for preventing vertical transmission. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most appropriate intervention to decrease vertical transmission of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) in this patient is administering ampicillin intrapartum, which is a standard practice for GBS IAP. **Output**: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a rectovaginal swab culture growing bacitracin-resistant colonies of gram-positive cocci with surrounding areas of clear hemolysis, suggesting a Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection.
