    "question": "A 25-year-old male is hospitalized for acute agitation, photophobia, and dysphagia. His parents report that he has been experiencing flu-like symptoms for one week prior to hospital admission. Five weeks ago, the patient was in Mexico, where he went on several spelunking expeditions with friends. The patient ultimately becomes comatose and dies. Autopsy of brain tissue suggests a viral infection. The likely causal virus spreads to the central nervous system (CNS) in the following manner:",
    "options": {
        "A": "Hematogenous dissemination to the meninges",
        "B": "Retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons",
        "C": "Reactivation of virus previously latent in dorsal root ganglia",
        "D": "Infection of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes"

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. The patient was experiencing flu-like symptoms for a week prior to hospital admission, which suggests an initial viral infection. 2. The patient was in Mexico, where he went on spelunking expeditions with friends. This information is crucial, as spelunking can involve exposure to bats and other animals that can carry viruses. 3. The patient ultimately becomes comatose and dies, which suggests a severe and potentially life-threatening infection. 4. The autopsy of brain tissue suggests a viral infection. Considering the above points, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is a viral infection that can be transmitted through exposure to bats and other animals, and can cause severe neurological symptoms. The key to answering this question is to identify the viral infection that fits these criteria. Based on the options provided, the most likely answer is: C. Reactivation of virus previously latent in dorsal root ganglia Here's the step-by-step thinking in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and exposure history suggest a viral infection that can be transmitted through exposure to bats and other animals. The most common viral infection that fits this description is rabies. Rabies is a viral infection that can be transmitted through the saliva of infected animals, such as bats. The virus can reactivate from a latent state in the dorsal root ganglia, which can lead to severe neurological symptoms, including agitation, photophobia, and dysphagia. The patient's symptoms and autopsy results are consistent with rabies infection. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Reactivation of virus previously latent in dorsal root ganglia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
