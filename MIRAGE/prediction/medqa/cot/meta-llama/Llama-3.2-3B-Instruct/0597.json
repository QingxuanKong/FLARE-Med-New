    "question": "A study is conducted to determine the most effective ways to prevent transmission of various infective agents. One of the agents studied is a picornavirus that preferentially infects hepatocytes. The investigator determines that inactivating this virus can prevent its spread. Which of the following disinfectants is most likely to inactivate this virus?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Chlorhexidine",
        "B": "Sodium hypochlorite",
        "C": "Sulfuric acid",
        "D": "Ethyl alcohol"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To determine the most effective disinfectant against the picornavirus, let's consider the properties of each option: 1. **Chlorhexidine (A)**: Chlorhexidine is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, effective against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. However, its effectiveness against picornaviruses is not well-established. 2. **Sodium hypochlorite (B)**: Sodium hypochlorite is a strong disinfectant, commonly used for disinfecting surfaces and water. It is effective against a wide range of microorganisms, including viruses. However, its effectiveness against picornaviruses is not well-documented. 3. **Sulfuric acid (C)**: Sulfuric acid is a strong acid, not typically used as a disinfectant. While it can inactivate microorganisms, its use as a disinfectant is not well-established, and it can be corrosive and hazardous to human skin and mucous membranes. 4. **Ethyl alcohol (D)**: Ethyl alcohol (ethanol) is a well-known disinfectant and antiseptic, effective against a wide range of microorganisms, including viruses. It works by denaturing proteins and disrupting cell membranes, leading to viral inactivation. Ethanol is commonly used as a disinfectant for skin and surfaces. Considering the options, **ethyl alcohol (D)** is the most likely to inactivate the picornavirus due to its established effectiveness against a broad range of viruses and its mode of action. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key factor in inactivating the picornavirus is the ability to denature proteins and disrupt cell membranes. Ethanol is a well-established disinfectant with a proven track record of inactivating viruses, making it the most likely choice. Chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite may also be effective, but their effectiveness against picornaviruses is not as well-documented. Sulfuric acid is not typically used as a disinfectant and can be hazardous to human health.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
