    "question": "A 27-year-old man with a history of cocaine abuse comes to the physician 2 weeks after undergoing successful arthroscopic repair of a torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee. There were no complications. He was discharged with prescriptions for oxycodone and acetaminophen. He complains of severe pain that prevents him from participating in physical therapy and wakes him from sleep. Physical examination of the left knee shows a healing incision; there is no joint effusion, erythema, or evidence of wound dehiscence, and his gait is normal. When the physician recommends switching to ibuprofen for pain, he becomes visibly angry and demands a refill of oxycodone. Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient's request?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Prescribe a long-acting opioid for better pain relief if he is willing to sign a pain contract",
        "B": "Request further information about which drugs he has taken recently and in the past",
        "C": "Request consent for urine test to assess current drug use",
        "D": "Refer to a substance use counselor for addiction counseling"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To determine the most appropriate response, let's analyze the situation step by step: 1. **Patient's History and Current Situation**: The patient has a history of cocaine abuse and has recently undergone a surgical procedure, for which he was prescribed oxycodone and acetaminophen. He is now experiencing severe pain that is impacting his daily activities, including physical therapy. 2. **Current Concerns**: The patient's reaction to being switched to ibuprofen, a non-opioid medication, is extreme, indicating a possible dependency on opioids. This reaction suggests that he may be experiencing opioid withdrawal symptoms or that he is experiencing a strong psychological dependence on opioids. 3. **Assessing the Options**: - **A. Prescribe a long-acting opioid for better pain relief if he is willing to sign a pain contract**: This option may not address the underlying issue of potential opioid dependency and could potentially worsen the situation by providing more opioids. - **B. Request further information about which drugs he has taken recently and in the past**: This is a standard inquiry to assess the patient's current substance use and potential for diversion or abuse. It does not directly address the immediate concern of his reaction to the pain management change. - **C. Request consent for urine test to assess current drug use**: While this could provide information about the patient's current substance use, it may not be the most direct or appropriate response to his immediate reaction to the pain management change. - **D. Refer to a substance use counselor for addiction counseling**: This option directly addresses the potential underlying issue of opioid dependency and provides a proactive approach to addressing the patient's substance use concerns. 4. **Conclusion**: Given the patient's history of cocaine abuse and his extreme reaction to switching to ibuprofen, the most appropriate response is to address the potential for opioid dependency and provide support for addressing his substance use. **JSON Output**: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's reaction to switching to ibuprofen indicates a potential dependency on opioids, and referring him to a substance use counselor addresses this concern directly. This proactive approach is crucial in managing opioid use and preventing potential complications.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
