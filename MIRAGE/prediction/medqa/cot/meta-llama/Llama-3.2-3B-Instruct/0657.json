    "question": "A 62-year-old man presents with episodes of palpitations for the past 3 weeks. He says that he has episodes where he feels his heart is \u2018racing and pounding\u2019, lasting 1\u20132 hours on average. Initially, he says the episodes would happen 1\u20132 times per week but now happen almost every day. This last episode has been constant for the past 2 days. He denies any seizure, loss of consciousness, dizziness, chest pain, or similar symptoms in the past. His past medical history is significant for an ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery 1 month ago, status post intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with still some residual neurologic impairment, and long-standing gastroesophageal reflux secondary to a hiatal hernia, managed medically. The patient reports a 15-pack-year smoking history, but no alcohol or recreational drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, pulse 105/min, and respiratory rate 16/min. On physical examination, muscle strength in the lower extremities is 4/5 on the left and 5/5 on the right, along with sensory loss on the left, all of which is improved from his previous exam 3 weeks ago. There is a loss of the left half of the visual field bilaterally which is stable from the previous exam. Cardiac examination is significant for a new-onset irregular rate and rhythm. No rubs, thrills or murmurs. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan shows evidence of an area of infarction in the vicinity of the right anterior cerebral artery showing normal interval change with no evidence of new hemorrhage or expansion of the area of infarction. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed, which is shown in the exhibit (see image below). Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to best prevent future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Begin aspirin therapy",
        "B": "Begin clopidogrel",
        "C": "Carotid endarterectomy",
        "D": "Begin warfarin and heparin"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Based on the patient's presentation, let's analyze the information step by step: 1. **Chief Complaint and History**: The patient presents with palpitations, which have increased in frequency and duration over the past 3 weeks. This suggests a possible cardiac issue, but the patient's history of ischemic stroke and residual neurologic impairment raises concern for a cardiac source of embolism. 2. **Past Medical History**: The patient has a history of ischemic stroke, which is a strong indication for secondary prevention of stroke. He also has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) managed medically, which may be relevant for his current cardiac symptoms. 3. **Vital Signs**: The patient's pulse is elevated at 105/min, which is consistent with palpitations. His blood pressure is within a relatively normal range, but his heart rate is significantly elevated. 4. **Physical Examination**: The patient has some residual neurologic impairment from his previous stroke, but the recent sensory loss on the left side has improved. The loss of the left half of the visual field is stable, which is consistent with his previous examination. 5. **Diagnostic Findings**: The noncontrast CT scan shows evidence of infarction in the vicinity of the right anterior cerebral artery, which is consistent with his previous stroke. The ECG shows an irregular rate and rhythm, which is consistent with atrial fibrillation (AFib), a common cardiac arrhythmia that increases the risk of stroke. 6. **Risk Factors**: The patient has a history of ischemic stroke, which increases his risk for future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). He also has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is a significant risk factor for stroke. Considering these factors, the most appropriate intervention to prevent future CVAs in this patient would be: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation and diagnostic findings are consistent with atrial fibrillation, which is a significant risk factor for stroke. Given his history of ischemic stroke, anticoagulation therapy is the most appropriate intervention to prevent future CVAs. Aspirin therapy is often used as initial therapy for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, but in this case, given the patient's history of stroke and atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation with warfarin is more appropriate. Heparin may also be used in the acute setting to prevent further thromboembolic events, but warfarin is more suitable for long-term stroke prevention. Clopidogrel and carotid endarterectomy are not the most appropriate initial interventions for this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
