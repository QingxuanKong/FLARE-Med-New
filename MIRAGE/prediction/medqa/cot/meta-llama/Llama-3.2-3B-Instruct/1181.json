    "question": "A 21-year-old woman comes to the physician for evaluation of excess hair growth on her face. Menses occur irregularly at 45 to 65-day intervals. She is 159 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 23 kg/m2. Physical examination shows facial acne and growth of coarse dark hair on the face, chest, and lower back. Pelvic examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:\nSodium 141 mEq/L\nPotassium 4.2 mEq/L\nGlucose 109 mg/dL\nCortisol (1600 h) 4 \u03bcg/dL\nProlactin 14 ng/mL\n17-hydroxyprogesterone 390 ng/dL (N=20\u2013300 ng/dL)\nTestosterone 91 ng/dL (N=8\u201360 ng/dL)\nA urine pregnancy test is negative. This patient's condition is most likely associated with which of the following?\"",

        "A": "Hyperproliferation of theca interna cells",
        "B": "Exogenous anabolic steroid use",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key findings and analyze them step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with irregular menses, excess hair growth on the face, chest, and lower back, and facial acne. This combination of symptoms, particularly the hirsutism (excess hair growth in a male-like pattern), suggests an androgen excess. 2. **Laboratory Findings**: - **Elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP)**: This is a key finding. Elevated levels of 17-OHP are indicative of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), a group of inherited disorders that affect the adrenal glands. CAH can lead to an overproduction of androgens, which causes the symptoms the patient is experiencing. - **Elevated Testosterone**: This further supports the presence of androgen excess, consistent with CAH. - **Normal Prolactin**: This helps rule out prolactinoma, a tumor of the pituitary gland that can cause hormonal imbalances. - **Negative Pregnancy Test**: Rules out pregnancy as a cause of hormonal imbalances. - **Normal Glucose and Other Hormones**: These help to rule out other conditions that might cause hormonal imbalances. 3. **Options Analysis**: - A. **Hyperproliferation of theca interna cells**: This is a characteristic feature of CAH, particularly 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which is the most common form of CAH. The elevated 17-OHP levels support this diagnosis. - B. **Exogenous anabolic steroid use**: This would typically present with more pronounced virilization symptoms and different laboratory findings, such as elevated testosterone levels not related to the body's own production. - C. **Ovarian fibrosis and multiple cystic follicles**: This would be more suggestive of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which can cause hirsutism but is typically associated with insulin resistance, irregular menses, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound, not mentioned in this case. - D. **Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex**: While this can cause an increase in cortisol and other hormones, it is less directly linked to the specific pattern of hormonal imbalances seen in this patient, particularly the elevated 17-OHP and testosterone. Based on the elevated 17-OHP levels and the presentation of hirsutism, the most likely diagnosis is a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, specifically 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which is associated with hyperproliferation of theca interna cells.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
