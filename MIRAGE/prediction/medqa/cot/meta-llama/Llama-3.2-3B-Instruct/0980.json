    "question": "A 29-year-old G4P0 woman presents following a spontaneous pregnancy loss in the 18th week of her pregnancy. This is her fourth loss in the second trimester and she is concerned about her inability to have a successful pregnancy. She is otherwise healthy and has no acute complaints. Her vitals are unremarkable and exam is notable only for a firm, asymmetric uterus. Laboratory studies are ordered as seen below.\n\nHemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL\nHematocrit: 30%\nLeukocyte count: 6,800/mm^3 with normal differential\nPlatelet count: 199,000/mm^3\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 4.3 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 25 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 99 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.1 mg/dL\n\nWhich of the following tests is most likely to elucidate the cause of this patient's pregnancy losses?",

        "A": "Karotyping",
        "B": "Hysterosalpingogram",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's history of recurrent spontaneous pregnancy losses in the second trimester, the most likely underlying cause needs to be identified. The patient's firm, asymmetric uterus is also a significant finding. This suggests that the issue may be related to the shape or structure of the uterus rather than a hormonal or metabolic issue. The laboratory studies provided do not show any abnormalities in blood cell counts or electrolytes that would indicate a hematological or metabolic disorder. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are low, but this could be a secondary finding due to chronic anemia from previous pregnancy losses. Considering the patient's history and physical exam findings, the most likely cause of her pregnancy losses is a uterine anomaly. A hysterosalpingogram (B) is a diagnostic imaging test that can help identify abnormalities in the shape and structure of the uterus, such as a septate or bicornuate uterus, which can cause recurrent pregnancy loss. Karotyping (A) is typically used to identify chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus, which may be a cause of recurrent pregnancy loss. However, this test is not directly related to the patient's uterine anatomy. Prolactin level (C) is a hormone test that is typically used to evaluate lactation and prolactinoma, which is not directly related to the patient's symptoms. TSH level (D) is a test used to evaluate thyroid function, which is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or physical exam findings. Therefore, the most likely test to elucidate the cause of this patient's pregnancy losses is a hysterosalpingogram (B).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
