    "question": "A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 6-month history of mild episodic abdominal pain. The episodes occur every 1\u20132 months and last for a few hours. The pain is located in the epigastrium, radiates to his back, and is occasionally associated with mild nausea. His mother is concerned that his condition might be hereditary because his older sister was diagnosed with congenital heart disease. He is otherwise healthy and has met all developmental milestones. He is at the 75th percentile for height and the 65th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows no abdominal distention, guarding, or rebound tenderness. Which of the following congenital conditions would best explain this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis",
        "B": "Biliary cyst",
        "C": "Intestinal malrotation",
        "D": "Pancreas divisum"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario: 1. **Age and sex**: The patient is a 6-year-old boy. 2. **Symptoms**: The boy experiences mild episodic abdominal pain in the epigastrium that radiates to his back, accompanied by mild nausea. 3. **Frequency and duration**: The episodes occur every 1\u20132 months and last for a few hours. 4. **Associated factors**: The mother is concerned that the condition might be hereditary, as her older sister was diagnosed with congenital heart disease. 5. **Physical examination findings**: No abdominal distention, guarding, or rebound tenderness. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. **Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis**: This condition typically presents with projectile vomiting, which is not mentioned in the scenario. The symptoms described do not strongly suggest this diagnosis. B. **Biliary cyst**: Biliary cysts can cause abdominal pain, but they are usually associated with jaundice, fever, or other signs of infection, which are not mentioned in the scenario. C. **Intestinal malrotation**: This condition can cause abdominal pain, but it is often associated with bilious vomiting, abdominal distention, and signs of intestinal obstruction, which are not present in this case. D. **Pancreas divisum**: This congenital anomaly involves the pancreas and can cause recurrent abdominal pain, often radiating to the back, due to pancreatic ductal obstruction. It can be associated with other abdominal symptoms, but the episodic nature and lack of other symptoms make this a more likely diagnosis. Considering the episodic nature of the pain, its location, and the absence of other symptoms, **D. Pancreas divisum** is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms. This condition is a congenital anomaly that can cause recurrent abdominal pain, making it a plausible diagnosis in a child with a family history of congenital heart disease. **{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The episodic nature and location of the pain, combined with the absence of other symptoms, make pancreas divisum a more likely diagnosis in this case. The patient's family history of congenital heart disease is not directly related to the abdominal symptoms, but it is worth noting. The episodic nature of the pain and the location of the pain are consistent with pancreas divisum, which can cause recurrent abdominal pain due to pancreatic ductal obstruction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
