    "question": "An 8-year-old girl presents to her pediatrician with intensely pruritic lesions over her buttocks, as shown. These lesions occur intermittently but have worsened over time. Her medical history is remarkable for iron deficiency, for which she is on ferrous sulfate. The patient has also experienced intermittent episodes of mild diarrhea, previously diagnosed as lactose intolerance. Her height is at the 30th percentile and weight is at the 25th percentile for age and sex. An immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase titer is 5 times the upper limit of normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Crohn\u2019s disease",
        "B": "Celiac disease",
        "C": "Common variable immune deficiency",
        "D": "Henoch-Schonlein purpura"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and history: 1. **Intensely pruritic lesions over the buttocks**: This symptom is characteristic of dermatitis herpetiformis, a skin manifestation of celiac disease. The pruritic nature of the lesions, particularly on the buttocks, is a classic presentation. 2. **Iron deficiency, treated with ferrous sulfate**: While iron deficiency can cause various symptoms, the presence of dermatitis herpetiformis, a condition closely associated with celiac disease, suggests a link to malabsorption, which could be contributing to the iron deficiency. 3. **Intermittent episodes of mild diarrhea**: This symptom could be related to malabsorption, consistent with celiac disease, where the small intestine's villi are flattened due to an immune response to gluten, impairing nutrient absorption. 4. **Immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase titer is 5 times the upper limit of normal**: Elevated IgA titer is a key diagnostic criterion for celiac disease, indicating an autoimmune response to gluten. Given these points, let's evaluate the options: - **A. Crohn\u2019s disease**: While Crohn's disease can cause skin manifestations, it is less commonly associated with the specific pattern of pruritic lesions on the buttocks and elevated IgA tissue transglutaminase titer. - **B. Celiac disease**: This is strongly supported by the combination of dermatitis herpetiformis (pruritic lesions), elevated IgA tissue transglutaminase titer, and symptoms of malabsorption (iron deficiency and diarrhea). - **C. Common variable immune deficiency**: This condition is characterized by impaired antibody production and is not directly related to the symptoms or test results presented. - **D. Henoch-Schonlein purpura**: This condition is characterized by purpura (bleeding under the skin), which is not the primary symptom presented in this case. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation of intensely pruritic lesions over her buttocks, elevated IgA tissue transglutaminase titer, and symptoms of malabsorption (iron deficiency and diarrhea) strongly suggest celiac disease, a condition where the small intestine's villi are flattened due to an immune response to gluten, impairing nutrient absorption.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
