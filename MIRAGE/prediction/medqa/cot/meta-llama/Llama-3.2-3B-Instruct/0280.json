    "question": "A 32-year-old man arrives to his primary care physician to discuss his fear of flying. The patient reports that he has had a fear of flying since being a teenager. He went on a family vacation 15 years ago, and during the flight there was turbulence and a \u201crough landing\u201d. Since then he has avoided flying. He did not go to his cousin\u2019s wedding because it was out of the country. He also was unable to visit his grandmother for her 80th birthday. The last time his job asked him to meet a client out of state, he drove 18 hours instead of flying. Two years ago he promised his fianc\u00e9 they could fly to Florida. Upon arrival at the airport, he began to feel dizzy, lightheaded, and refused to go through security. During the clinic visit, the patient appears anxious and distressed. He recognizes that his fear is irrational. He is upset that it is affecting his relationship with his wife. Additionally, his current job may soon require employees in his sales position to fly to meet potential clients. He is embarrassed to have a conversation with his manager about his fear of flying. Which of the following is the best therapy for the patient\u2019s condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Alprazolam",
        "B": "Cognitive behavioral therapy",
        "C": "Fluoxetine",
        "D": "Psychodynamic psychotherapy"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a specific phobia of flying, which is a type of anxiety disorder. The patient's fear is not only related to the traumatic event of the rough landing during his teenage years but also to the avoidance behaviors and the impact it has on his life, such as missed opportunities and strained relationships. The patient is aware that his fear is irrational and recognizes the negative impact it has on his life. Given the nature of the phobia and the patient's desire to overcome it, the most effective therapy approach would be cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to the phobia. It is a well-established treatment for specific phobias, including aerophobia (fear of flying). Alprazolam (A) is a benzodiazepine, which is typically used as a short-term treatment for anxiety symptoms but is not a long-term solution for addressing the underlying fear. Fluoxetine (C) is an SSRI, which is primarily used to treat depression and other mood disorders, not specific phobias. Psychodynamic psychotherapy (D) may be helpful in addressing underlying emotional issues, but it is not the most effective approach for specific phobias like aerophobia. Therefore, the best therapy for the patient's condition is cognitive behavioral therapy (B).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
