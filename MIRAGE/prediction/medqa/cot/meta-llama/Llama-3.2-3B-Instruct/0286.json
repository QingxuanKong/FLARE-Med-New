    "question": "A 27-year-old HIV positive female gave birth to a 7lb 2oz (3.2 kg) baby girl. The obstetrician is worried that the child may have been infected due to the mother's haphazard use of her anti-retroviral medications. Which of the following assays would a hospital use detect the genetic material of HIV if the child had been infected?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)",
        "B": "Rapid HIV antibody test",
        "C": "Polymerase chain reaction",
        "D": "Southern blot"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To detect the genetic material of HIV in a newborn, we need to consider the different types of tests available. The question specifically asks for an assay that detects genetic material, which means we are looking for a test that can identify viral DNA or RNA. The first option, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), is a serological test that detects antibodies against HIV, not the genetic material itself. Therefore, option A is incorrect. The second option, Rapid HIV antibody test, also detects antibodies, not the genetic material. It is used to screen for HIV infection, but it is not suitable for detecting the genetic material. So, option B is also incorrect. The third option, Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), is a molecular biology technique that can amplify and detect specific DNA sequences. In the context of HIV, PCR can be used to detect the genetic material of the virus, making it a suitable choice for diagnosing HIV infection in newborns. This is because PCR can identify the genetic material of the virus even if the mother's anti-retroviral medications have suppressed the viral load. The fourth option, Southern blot, is a technique used to detect specific DNA sequences, but it is not as sensitive or specific as PCR for detecting HIV genetic material. Therefore, option D is incorrect. Considering the options, the most suitable assay for detecting the genetic material of HIV in a newborn is option C, Polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
