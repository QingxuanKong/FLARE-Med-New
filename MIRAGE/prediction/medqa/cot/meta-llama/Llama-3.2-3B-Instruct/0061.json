    "question": "A 22-year-old female college student is treated with metronidazole after presenting to student health services with itching, discharge, and pain in her vagina. At a party shortly afterward she experiences facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps after consuming alcohol. Serum levels of which of the following are likely elevated in this patient following alcohol consumption:",
    "options": {
        "A": "Acetaldehyde",
        "B": "Uric acid",
        "C": "Cytochrome P-450 enzymes",
        "D": "Amylase"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is treated with metronidazole, which is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial vaginosis and other infections. However, metronidazole can cause a disulfiram-like reaction when consumed with alcohol, leading to symptoms such as facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps. This reaction occurs due to the inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme that breaks down acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism. When alcohol is consumed, it is first converted to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase, and then acetaldehyde is further broken down to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase. In individuals with normal aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, acetaldehyde is quickly converted to acetate, which is then further metabolized to carbon dioxide and water. However, in individuals who have a genetic variation that leads to impaired aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, such as those who have taken metronidazole, acetaldehyde accumulates and causes the disulfiram-like reaction. Therefore, when the patient consumes alcohol, her serum levels of acetaldehyde are likely to be elevated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
