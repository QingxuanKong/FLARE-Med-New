    "question": "A 31-year-old male comes to your office for his annual exam. He states that he received all of his recommended vaccinations prior to beginning college, but has not had any vaccines in the past 13 years. His medical history is significant for intermittent, exercise-induced asthma. He has been sexually active in the past with multiple female partners. In addition to an influenza vaccine, which vaccine should be administered to this patient during this visit?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Pneumococcal vaccine",
        "B": "Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis booster (Tdap) vaccine",
        "C": "Haemophilus influenza B (HIB) vaccine",
        "D": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate vaccine for this patient, we need to consider his medical history and risk factors. The patient has a history of exercise-induced asthma and has been sexually active with multiple female partners. Given these risk factors, we need to assess which vaccine would provide protection against the most significant potential health risks. The patient is due for a booster vaccine, as it has been 13 years since his last vaccination. The options provided include the pneumococcal vaccine (A), tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis booster (Tdap) vaccine (B), Haemophilus influenza type b (HIB) vaccine (C), and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (D). Exercise-induced asthma increases the risk of respiratory infections, including pneumococcal disease. However, the pneumococcal vaccine is not typically recommended for individuals without underlying conditions that increase their risk of pneumococcal disease. The tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis booster (Tdap) vaccine is recommended for individuals who have not had a Tdap booster in the past 10 years, which applies to this patient. This vaccine provides protection against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, which is a highly contagious respiratory illness. The Haemophilus influenza type b (HIB) vaccine is typically recommended for young children and is not typically recommended for adults. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is recommended for individuals 11-26 years old, and a booster dose is recommended for those who did not receive the full series as an adolescent. This patient is 31 years old, so the HPV vaccine is not indicated for him. Considering the patient's risk factors and the vaccine options provided, the most appropriate vaccine to administer during this visit is the tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis booster (Tdap) vaccine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
