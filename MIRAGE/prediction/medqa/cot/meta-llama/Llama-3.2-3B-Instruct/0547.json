    "question": "A 62-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 40 minutes after his wife noticed during breakfast that the left side of his face was drooping. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and shoes before coming to the hospital. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. His current medications include metformin, enalapril, and atorvastatin. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. He drinks one glass of wine daily. He is alert and oriented to time, place and person. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 99/min and blood pressure is 170/100 mm Hg. Examination shows equal and reactive pupils. There is drooping of the left side of the face. Muscle strength is decreased in the left upper and lower extremities. Plantar reflex shows an extensor response on the left side. Speech is dysarthric. There is a bruit on the right side of the neck. Fundoscopy shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count, coagulation profile, and serum concentrations of glucose and electrolytes are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "MRI of the brain",
        "B": "Lumbar puncture",
        "C": "Duplex ultrasonography of the neck",
        "D": "CT scan of the head"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of a stroke, including unilateral facial drooping (indicative of a third cranial nerve palsy), difficulty with motor function (difficulty putting on clothes), and a bruit on the right side of the neck, which is highly suggestive of carotid artery stenosis. The patient's history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia further increases the risk of atherosclerotic disease. The patient's symptoms are consistent with an acute ischemic stroke, specifically a lateral medullary stroke affecting the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory or a vertebral artery dissection. Given the presence of a bruit on the right side of the neck, a non-invasive imaging study to evaluate the carotid arteries is necessary before proceeding to more invasive imaging studies. Duplex ultrasonography of the neck is a suitable initial imaging modality to evaluate the carotid arteries for stenosis or thrombosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
