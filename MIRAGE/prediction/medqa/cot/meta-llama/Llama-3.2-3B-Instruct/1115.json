    "question": "A 10-year-old African American girl with known sickle cell disease becomes acutely anemic in the setting of underlying infection. Her mother denies any previous history of blood clots in her past, but she says that her mother has also had to be treated for pulmonary embolism in the recent past. The patient\u2019s past medical history is significant for a few episodes of acute pain crisis and a need for splenectomy 3 years ago. The vital signs upon arrival include: temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 106/74 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min and regular, and respiratory rate 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding and fingernails are pale, but breath sounds remain clear. Oxygen saturation was initially 91% on room air and electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus tachycardia. A blood transfusion is initiated. Shortly after the transfusion has begun, the patient experiences fevers, chills, a burning sensation at the intravenous (IV) site, and sudden hypotension. What is the name of this reaction, and what is the best treatment?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Nonhemolytic febrile reaction; administer antihistamines",
        "B": "Minor allergic reaction; discontinue transfusion",
        "C": "Hemolytic transfusion reaction; administer antihistamines",
        "D": "Hemolytic transfusion reaction; discontinue transfusion"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the scenario: 1. The patient has sickle cell disease and is acutely anemic due to an underlying infection. This is a known risk factor for hemolytic transfusion reactions. 2. The patient has a history of splenectomy, which increases the risk of hemolytic transfusion reactions. 3. The patient experiences symptoms such as fevers, chills, a burning sensation at the IV site, and sudden hypotension shortly after the transfusion begins. These symptoms suggest a severe reaction. 4. The patient's oxygen saturation is low (91% on room air), which could be related to the reaction. 5. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia, which is consistent with a stress response to the reaction. Given these points, the most likely diagnosis is a hemolytic transfusion reaction. Hemolytic transfusion reactions occur when the immune system reacts to the transfused blood, recognizing it as foreign and attacking it. This is more likely in patients with sickle cell disease due to their increased risk of hemolysis. The best treatment for a hemolytic transfusion reaction is to discontinue the transfusion immediately and administer supportive care. In this case, the patient is already showing signs of hemolysis (low oxygen saturation, fever, chills, and hypotension), so further transfusion is not indicated. Antihistamines may be used to manage symptoms such as itching or hives, but they are not the primary treatment for a hemolytic transfusion reaction. The other options are incorrect because a nonhemolytic febrile reaction typically does not cause such severe symptoms, a minor allergic reaction would not cause hypotension or low oxygen saturation, and discontinuing the transfusion is the correct course of action for a hemolytic transfusion reaction.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
