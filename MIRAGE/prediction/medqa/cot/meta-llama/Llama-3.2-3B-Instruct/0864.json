    "question": "A 26-year-old man with no significant past medical history presents to the ED following a motor vehicle accident. Vital signs on presentation are T 99.0 F, BP 100/60 mmHg, HR 125 bpm, RR 16/min, SpO2 98% on room air. He complains of extreme abdominal pain worse in the left upper quadrant which has worsened over the past 30 minutes. Exam demonstrates abdominal wall rigidity, involuntary guarding, and tenderness on light percussion. Bedside sonography shows evidence for hemoperitoneum. Despite administering more intravenous fluids, repeat vitals are T 98.9 F, BP 82/50 mm hg, HR 180 bpm, RR 20/min, SpO2 97% on room air. Which of the following is the best next step?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Normal saline bolus and re-evaluation of hemodynamics after infusion",
        "B": "CT abdomen and pelvis",
        "C": "Morphine",
        "D": "Exploratory laparotomy"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with signs and symptoms of peritonitis and hemoperitoneum following a motor vehicle accident, which is a classic presentation for an abdominal injury. The patient's vital signs indicate hemodynamic instability, with hypotension (BP 82/50 mmHg) and tachycardia (HR 180 bpm), which suggests that the patient is at risk of going into shock. The patient's abdominal examination reveals abdominal wall rigidity, involuntary guarding, and tenderness on light percussion, which further supports the presence of peritonitis and hemoperitoneum. Given the patient's hemodynamic instability and the need for immediate surgical intervention to control bleeding and repair any potential injuries, the best next step is to perform an exploratory laparotomy. This procedure will allow the surgeon to evaluate the extent of the injury, control any bleeding, and repair any damaged organs or tissues. The other options, such as administering a normal saline bolus and re-evaluating hemodynamics, or performing a CT abdomen and pelvis, may not address the patient's immediate need for surgical intervention, and may delay necessary treatment. Administering morphine may also mask the patient's pain and make it more difficult to assess the severity of their condition.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
