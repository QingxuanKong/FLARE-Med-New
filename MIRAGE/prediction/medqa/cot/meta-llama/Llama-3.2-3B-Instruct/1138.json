    "question": "A 62-year-old woman with small-cell lung cancer comes to the physician because of a painful, burning red rash on her face and hands that developed 30 minutes after going outside to do garden work. She wore a long-sleeved shirt and was exposed to direct sunlight for about 10 minutes. The patient is light-skinned and has a history of occasional sunburns when she does not apply sunscreen. Current medications include demeclocycline for malignancy-associated hyponatremia and amoxicillin for sinusitis. Physical examination shows prominent erythema and a papular eruption on her forehead, cheeks, neck, and the dorsum of both hands. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Degranulation of presensitized mast cells",
        "B": "Formation of drug-induced autoantibodies",
        "C": "Accumulation of porphobilinogen",
        "D": "Cell injury due to drug metabolites"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To determine the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with a painful, burning red rash on her face and hands that developed after exposure to sunlight. This suggests a photosensitive reaction. 2. **History of Sun Exposure**: The patient was exposed to direct sunlight for about 10 minutes, which is a relatively short duration. However, her skin is light-skinned, and she has a history of occasional sunburns without sunscreen, indicating a predisposition to sun sensitivity. 3. **Medications**: The patient is taking demeclocycline for malignancy-associated hyponatremia and amoxicillin for sinusitis. Demeclocycline is known to cause photosensitivity, which is a condition where certain medications trigger a skin reaction upon exposure to sunlight. 4. **Symptoms**: The physical examination shows prominent erythema (redness) and a papular eruption (a small, raised, solid bump) on the forehead, cheeks, neck, and the dorsum of both hands. These symptoms are consistent with a photosensitive reaction. Considering the above points, let's evaluate the options: A. **Degranulation of presensitized mast cells**: While this process can contribute to allergic reactions, it's not directly related to photosensitivity or the specific medications mentioned. B. **Formation of drug-induced autoantibodies**: This is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or the medications she is taking. C. **Accumulation of porphobilinogen**: This is related to porphyria, a group of disorders that can cause sensitivity to sunlight, but it is not directly linked to the patient's medications. D. **Cell injury due to drug metabolites**: Demeclocycline is known to cause photosensitivity, and the patient's symptoms occurred after exposure to sunlight. This suggests that the drug metabolites are causing the skin reaction. Based on the analysis, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is cell injury due to drug metabolites, specifically demeclocycline. **Answer Choice**: D",
