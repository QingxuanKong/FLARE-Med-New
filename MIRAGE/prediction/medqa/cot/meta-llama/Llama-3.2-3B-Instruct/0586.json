    "question": "A 34-year-old man comes to the physician because of frequent headaches and blurry vision during the past 4 months. He has also had difficulties achieving an erection over the past few weeks. Physical examination shows a temporal visual field deficit bilaterally. An MRI of the brain shows an intrasellar mass. The mass is most likely derived from which of the following types of cells?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Thyrotrophs",
        "B": "Lactotrophs",
        "C": "Somatotrophs",
        "D": "Gonadotrophs"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the symptoms and the location of the mass in the brain. The patient is experiencing headaches, blurry vision, and difficulties with achieving an erection, along with a temporal visual field deficit. This combination of symptoms, particularly the visual field deficit, is highly suggestive of a pituitary tumor. The temporal visual field deficit is a common finding in cases of pituitary tumors, as they can compress the optic chiasm, which is located near the sella turcica where the pituitary gland is located. The pituitary gland is also known as the \\u201cmaster gland\\u201d because it produces several hormones that regulate various bodily functions, including growth, metabolism, and reproductive processes. The symptoms of the patient, such as erectile dysfunction, could be related to hormonal imbalances caused by the tumor. The mass is most likely derived from the cells that produce growth hormone. Among the options provided, the somatotrophs are the cells that produce growth hormone. Therefore, the mass is most likely derived from somatotrophs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
