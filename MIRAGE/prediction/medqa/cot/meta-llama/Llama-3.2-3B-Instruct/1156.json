    "question": "A 7-month-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 2-month history of fatigue, weakness, and difficulty feeding. He was delivered at term to a 32-year-old woman. He is not able to sit upright on his own. He is at the 75th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. His temperature is 37.7\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), blood pressure is 110/68 mm Hg, pulse is 150/min, and respirations are 50/min. His tongue protrudes beyond the teeth. Neck veins are distended. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows an S3 gallop. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Neurologic examination shows profound weakness in proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities. He has 2+ reflexes bilaterally. A chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly. Serum glucose is 105 mg/dL. Which of the following is the enzyme most likely to be defective in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Muscle glycogen phosphorylase",
        "B": "Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase",
        "C": "Lysosomal acid maltase",
        "D": "Glycogen debranching enzyme"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break down the key clinical findings and relate them to the possible enzyme deficiencies: 1. **Age and Presentation**: The patient is 7 months old, presenting with fatigue, weakness, difficulty feeding, and failure to thrive (indicated by being at the 25th percentile for weight). This presentation is suggestive of a metabolic disorder. 2. **Cardiac Findings**: The patient has cardiomegaly (enlarged heart) and an S3 gallop, which is indicative of heart failure. This is a common finding in glycogen storage diseases due to the accumulation of glycogen in the heart. 3. **Neurological Findings**: The patient has profound weakness in proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities, with 2+ reflexes bilaterally. This suggests a neuromuscular involvement, which is typical of glycogen storage diseases. 4. **Tongue Protrusion and Neck Veins Distension**: These signs are indicative of hypoglycemia, which can occur in glycogen storage diseases due to the inability to break down glycogen to glucose. 5. **Chest X-ray Showing Cardiomegaly**: This further supports the diagnosis of a glycogen storage disease affecting the heart. 6. **Serum Glucose is 105 mg/dL**: This confirms the presence of hypoglycemia, which is a hallmark of glycogen storage diseases. Given these findings, let's evaluate the options: - **A. Muscle glycogen phosphorylase**: Deficiency in this enzyme leads to McArdle disease, which primarily affects skeletal muscles, causing muscle cramps, fatigue, and exercise intolerance. While it can lead to muscle weakness, it doesn't fully account for the cardiac findings. - **B. Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase**: Deficiency in this enzyme leads to a disorder affecting the mitochondria, primarily causing episodes of acute illness, lactic acidosis, and cardiomyopathy. However, it does not typically present with the constellation of findings seen in this patient. - **C. Lysosomal acid maltase (acid alpha-glucosidase)**: Deficiency in this enzyme leads to Pompe disease, a glycogen storage disease type II. It presents with muscle weakness, cardiomegaly, and hypoglycemia, which aligns with the patient's clinical findings. - **D. Glycogen debranching enzyme**: Deficiency in this enzyme leads to Cori disease (debranching enzyme deficiency), which typically presents with hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and hepatomegaly, but it does not typically cause cardiomegaly. Considering the combination of muscle weakness, cardiomegaly, hypoglycemia, and failure to thrive, the enzyme most likely defective in this patient is **C. Lysosomal acid maltase (acid alpha-glucosidase)**, which is associated with Pompe disease. ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's clinical presentation of muscle weakness, cardiomegaly, hypoglycemia, and failure to thrive is most consistent with Pompe disease, which is caused by a deficiency in lysosomal acid maltase (acid alpha-glucosidase). This enzyme is crucial for breaking down glycogen in lysosomes, and its deficiency leads to glycogen accumulation in muscles and the heart, causing the observed clinical manifestations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" } ```",
