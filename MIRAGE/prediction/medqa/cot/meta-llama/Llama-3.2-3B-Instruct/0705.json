    "question": "A 35-year-old woman arrives to the clinic complaining of progressive urinary leakage that has occurred for the past 1 year. At first, she would notice leakage only during athletic exercise, but now the incontinence occurs even when she laughs or coughs. The patient states that she goes to the bathroom more frequently to try to prevent \u201cwetting myself.\u201d She wakes up once a night to urinate. She denies dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The patient has bipolar syndrome and takes lithium. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 years ago and a cesarean section 4 years ago. She has had no other surgeries. She drinks at least 6 glasses of water a day but may drink more on days she goes for a long run. She also has a large coffee in the morning and another coffee mid-day if she \u201cneeds to focus.\u201d The patient denies tobacco, alcohol, and other recreational drug use. Pelvic examination and speculum examination are unremarkable. When that patient is asked to Valsalva, leakage of urine is observed. A urinalysis, including specific gravity, is within normal limits. A beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Diabetic polyuria",
        "B": "Primary polydipsia",
        "C": "Urethral hypermobility",
        "D": "Vescicovaginal fistula"

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and history: 1. The patient is a 35-year-old woman with progressive urinary leakage, which started 1 year ago and has worsened over time. 2. The leakage occurs during activities that increase abdominal pressure, such as exercise, laughing, and coughing. 3. The patient wakes up at night to urinate, indicating nocturia. 4. She denies symptoms of dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and abnormal vaginal discharge. 5. The patient has a history of bipolar syndrome and takes lithium. 6. She has had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery and cesarean section. 7. She drinks a significant amount of water throughout the day, which may increase her urine output. 8. The patient's urine analysis shows normal specific gravity, ruling out diabetic polyuria (A). 9. The beta-human chorionic gonadotropin test is negative, ruling out pregnancy. 10. The pelvic examination and speculum examination are unremarkable, making a vesicovaginal fistula (D) less likely. 11. The patient's symptoms of urinary leakage during increased abdominal pressure and nocturia are suggestive of a urethral or bladder issue. Given these points, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is urethral hypermobility (C). This condition is characterized by an abnormal mobility of the urethra, which can cause urinary leakage during activities that increase abdominal pressure. Urethral hypermobility is a common cause of stress urinary incontinence, especially in women with a history of vaginal delivery or multiple pregnancies. The patient's symptoms and history support this diagnosis.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
