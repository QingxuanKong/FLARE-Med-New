    "question": "A scientist is studying the properties of myosin-actin interactions in a sample of human muscle tissue. She has identified a drug that selectively inhibits phosphate release by the myosin head. If she gives this drug to a sample of human muscle tissue under physiologic conditions, which of the following steps in cross-bridge cycling will most likely be blocked?",

        "A": "Myosin head cocking",
        "B": "Exposure of myosin-binding sites on actin",
        "C": "Myosin head binding to actin",
        "D": "Power stroke"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To understand which step in cross-bridge cycling will be blocked when the drug inhibits phosphate release by the myosin head, let's break down the steps involved in muscle contraction and the role of the myosin head in these steps.\\n\\n1. **Myosin head binding to actin**: This is the initial step where the myosin head binds to the actin filament. This step is not directly affected by the inhibition of phosphate release.\\n2. **Myosin head cocking**: After binding to actin, the myosin head undergoes a conformational change (cocking) to position itself for the power stroke. This step is also not directly affected by the inhibition of phosphate release.\\n3. **Exposure of myosin-binding sites on actin**: As the myosin head undergoes cocking, it exposes the myosin-binding sites on the actin filament, preparing it for the power stroke. This step is also not directly affected by the inhibition of phosphate release.\\n4. **Power stroke**: The power stroke is the final step where the myosin head releases the phosphate group, causing the actin filament to slide along the myosin filament. This step is directly affected by the inhibition of phosphate release, as the phosphate group is necessary for the power stroke to occur.\\nTherefore, when the drug inhibits phosphate release by the myosin head, the power stroke will be blocked.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
