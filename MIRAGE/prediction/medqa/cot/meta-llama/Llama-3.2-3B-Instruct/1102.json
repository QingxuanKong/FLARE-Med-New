    "question": "A 27-year-old college student presents to his physician for constant fatigue. The patient states that for the past several weeks he has felt oddly fatigued and has struggled to complete his work. He is a foreign exchange student and is concerned he will fail out of his academic program. He has experienced some occasional nausea and vomiting which has caused him to lose weight. The patient is a first year college student, drinks alcohol regularly, smokes marijuana, and has unprotected sex with multiple partners. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 4.3 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 25 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 99 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.1 mg/dL\nCa2+: 10.2 mg/dL\nTotal bilirubin: 2.0 mg/dL\nAST: 85 U/L\nALT: 92 U/L\n\nUrine\nColor: Amber/brown\nMarijuana: Positive\nAmphetamines: Positive\nCocaine: Positive\n\nThe patient refuses an examination of his genitals. Which of the following is the best diagnostic test?",
    "options": {
        "A": "CAGE questions",
        "B": "Uretheral swab and culture",
        "C": "Viral core antibody",
        "D": "Viral surface antibody"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, nausea, and vomiting, which could be indicative of a variety of conditions. However, the laboratory values and the history of unprotected sex with multiple partners raise the suspicion of a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The presence of marijuana and amphetamines in the urine also suggests substance abuse. The patient's refusal to undergo a genital examination does not rule out the possibility of an STI. Given the patient's history of unprotected sex with multiple partners, the most likely STI to consider is gonorrhea or chlamydia. The CAGE questions (A) are a screening tool for alcohol use disorder, which is not the primary concern in this case. A urethral swab and culture (B) is the most appropriate test to diagnose gonorrhea or chlamydia, as these bacteria can be cultured directly from the urethral discharge. Viral core antibody (C) tests are used to diagnose viral infections such as HIV, but they would not be the first-line test for gonorrhea or chlamydia. Viral surface antibody (D) tests are also used to diagnose viral infections and are not relevant to the diagnosis of gonorrhea or chlamydia.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
