    "question": "A hospitalized 34-year-old man with severe diarrhea and bloating for 1 month is diagnosed with celiac disease based on serology and duodenal biopsy. He has no history of any serious illnesses and takes no medications. He has no history of recent travel. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. At discharge from the hospital, he is given complete instructions for a strict gluten-free diet. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for the temporary control of the severe diarrhea and bloating?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Avoiding all dairy products",
        "B": "Diphenoxylate",
        "C": "Prednisone",
        "D": "Restriction of soy products"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To manage the symptoms of severe diarrhea and bloating in a patient with newly diagnosed celiac disease, we need to consider the pathophysiology of the condition. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes the immune system to react to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The reaction leads to inflammation in the small intestine, which can cause malabsorption of nutrients, including water and electrolytes, resulting in diarrhea and bloating. Given the patient's symptoms, the primary goal is to reduce the inflammation and promote healing of the intestinal lining. Option A, avoiding all dairy products, may not be necessary as dairy products are not a primary source of gluten. Option B, diphenoxylate, is an opioid medication used to treat diarrhea, but it is not a first-line treatment for celiac disease. It may provide temporary relief from diarrhea but does not address the underlying cause of the condition. Option C, prednisone, is a corticosteroid that can be used to reduce inflammation in the body. In the context of celiac disease, prednisone may be used to reduce the inflammation in the small intestine and alleviate symptoms such as diarrhea and bloating. It is a common recommendation for managing symptoms in the initial stages of celiac disease. Option D, restriction of soy products, is not necessary as soy products are not a primary source of gluten. However, some soy products may contain gluten due to cross-contamination, but this is not a primary concern in this scenario. Considering these options, the most appropriate recommendation for the temporary control of severe diarrhea and bloating in a patient with newly diagnosed celiac disease is prednisone to reduce inflammation and promote healing of the intestinal lining.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
