    "question": "A 19-year-old woman is brought into the emergency department after collapsing during a cheerleading practice session. Her vitals taken by the emergency medical services (EMS) include blood pressure 88/55 mm Hg, pulse 55/min. She was given a liter of isotonic fluid while en route to the hospital. At the emergency department, she is alert and oriented and is noted to be anorexic. The patient fervently denies being underweight claiming that she is \u2018a fatty\u2019 and goes on to refuse any further intravenous fluid and later, even the hospital meals. Which of the following is the best option for long-term management of this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Cognitive-behavioral therapy",
        "B": "In-patient psychiatric therapy",
        "C": "Antidepressants",
        "D": "Appetite stimulants"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To address this patient's condition, we need to first identify the underlying issue. The patient's low blood pressure (hypotension) and low pulse (bradycardia) are indicative of hypovolemia, which is likely caused by dehydration and possibly an eating disorder. The patient's refusal of further IV fluids and hospital meals suggests a psychological component to her condition. The anorexic behavior and denial of being underweight, claiming to be 'fatty', are red flags for an eating disorder. Given the severity of her condition, it is likely that she is suffering from anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. The goal of long-term management should be to address the underlying psychological issues, rather than just treating the physical symptoms. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a widely effective treatment for eating disorders, as it helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors. In-patient psychiatric therapy may also be necessary to ensure the patient's safety and provide a supportive environment. Antidepressants and appetite stimulants may be used to treat some symptoms, but they are not the primary treatment for eating disorders. Therefore, the best option for long-term management is cognitive-behavioral therapy, with potential adjunctive use of in-patient psychiatric therapy and other supportive measures.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
