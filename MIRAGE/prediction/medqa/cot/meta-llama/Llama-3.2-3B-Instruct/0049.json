    "question": "A 67-year-old man is hospitalized after several days of fever and increasing shortness of breath. Respiratory viral panel returns positive for influenza A and the patient is started on a standard five day course of oseltamivir. Despite therapy, his shortness of breath continues to worsen and his oxygen saturation decreases to the point where ICU transfer and intubation are required. Chest radiograph shows bilateral infiltrates. Clinical criteria are consistent with development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). After several weeks of supportive therapy, the patient improves with lung function returning to near normal. Which of the following processes is involved in the regeneration of alveolar lining after damage to alveoli occurs?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Sweeping of debris out of the alveoli by ciliated cells",
        "B": "Excess mucus production by goblet cells",
        "C": "Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells",
        "D": "Proliferation of club cells"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the process of regeneration of alveolar lining after damage to alveoli in the context of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is characterized by inflammation, edema, and damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane, leading to impaired gas exchange. The regeneration of alveolar lining is crucial for restoring normal lung function. Let's analyze each option: Option A: Sweeping of debris out of the alveoli by ciliated cells - Ciliated cells play a role in moving mucus and debris out of the respiratory tract, but they are not directly involved in the regeneration of alveolar lining. Option B: Excess mucus production by goblet cells - While goblet cells do produce mucus, excess mucus production is not the primary mechanism for regenerating alveolar lining after damage. Option C: Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells - Surfactant is a critical component of lung function, reducing surface tension within the alveoli and facilitating gas exchange. However, the proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells is not the primary mechanism for regenerating alveolar lining. Option D: Proliferation of club cells - Club cells, also known as club-shaped cells or Clara cells, are non-ciliated, secretory cells that play a key role in the regeneration of alveolar lining in the lungs. They produce surfactant proteins and other proteins that help repair damaged alveoli and restore normal lung function. Given the above analysis, the correct answer is the one related to the proliferation of club cells, which is crucial for the regeneration of alveolar lining after damage in ARDS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
