    "question": "A 62-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for vision changes. About 90 minutes ago she was on the couch watching television with her husband when she suddenly noticed that she couldn't see the screen normally. She also felt a little dizzy. She has never had anything like this happen before. Her general physical exam is unremarkable. Her neurologic exam is notable for loss of vision in the right visual field of both eyes with macular sparing, though extraocular movements are intact. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head shows no acute intracranial process. Angiography of the brain will most likely show a lesion in which of the following vessels?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Internal carotid artery",
        "B": "Anterior cerebral artery",
        "C": "Posterior cerebral artery",
        "D": "Basilar artery"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sudden vision loss in the right visual field of both eyes with macular sparing, which is a characteristic feature of a specific type of visual field defect. Macular sparing is typically seen in lesions that affect the optic radiation, which is the pathway of the visual information from the lateral geniculate nucleus to the visual cortex. The most likely cause of this visual field defect is a lesion in the optic radiation, which is supplied by the posterior cerebral artery (PCA). The PCA supplies the occipital lobe and the medial and posterior parts of the temporal lobe, where the optic radiation is located. The fact that the patient's general physical exam is unremarkable and the CT scan shows no acute intracranial process makes a large vessel occlusion less likely. However, a smaller vessel occlusion in the PCA is still a possibility. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a stroke, and angiography of the brain will likely show a lesion in the posterior cerebral artery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
