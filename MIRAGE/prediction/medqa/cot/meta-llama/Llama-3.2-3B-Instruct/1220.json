    "question": "A 67-year-old woman with depression comes to the physician because of easy bruising and bleeding of her gums for the past 2 months. She has been living alone since the death of her husband 1 year ago. She appears thin and has temporal wasting bilaterally. Physical examination shows bruises on her lower legs, swollen gums, and petechiae on the hard palate. This patient's symptoms are most likely due to defective synthesis of a substance that is composed primarily of which of the following amino acids?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Glycine",
        "B": "Proline",
        "C": "Lysine",
        "D": "Arginine"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Identify the key symptoms**: The patient presents with easy bruising, bleeding of gums, petechiae on the hard palate, and temporal wasting. These symptoms suggest a bleeding disorder. 2. **Consider the underlying cause**: The patient's symptoms could be related to a bleeding disorder, and given the context of easy bruising and bleeding, we should consider a deficiency in a clotting factor. 3. **Link to amino acid synthesis**: Many clotting factors are synthesized from amino acids. Let's consider the options: - Glycine is a non-essential amino acid and is a precursor to creatine and heme, but it's not directly related to clotting factor synthesis. - Proline is an essential amino acid and is a component of collagen, but it's not directly related to clotting factor synthesis. - Lysine is an essential amino acid and is involved in the synthesis of several proteins, including clotting factors. Notably, vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is required for the hydroxylation of lysine residues in the synthesis of collagen and other proteins, and its deficiency leads to scurvy, which can cause easy bruising and bleeding. - Arginine is a semi-essential amino acid and is involved in nitric oxide production and other processes, but it's not directly related to clotting factor synthesis. 4. **Make the connection**: Given the patient's symptoms of easy bruising and bleeding, and the fact that she has been living alone since her husband's death (which could lead to a lack of vitamin C-rich foods in her diet), we can infer that her symptoms are likely due to a deficiency in vitamin C, which is synthesized from **lysine**. 5. **Choose the answer**: Based on the step-by-step analysis, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of easy bruising and bleeding are most likely due to a deficiency in vitamin C, which is synthesized from lysine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
