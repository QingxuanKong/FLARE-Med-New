    "question": "A stillborn infant is delivered at 38 weeks' gestation to a 32-year-old woman. The mother had no prenatal care. Examination of the stillborn shows a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet. An x-ray shows the absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae. Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Maternal oligohydramnios",
        "B": "Intrauterine alcohol exposure",
        "C": "Maternal diabetes",
        "D": "Chromosome 18 trisomy"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. **Gestational age and birth weight**: The stillborn infant was delivered at 38 weeks' gestation, which is considered near term. However, the lack of prenatal care and the presence of certain physical abnormalities suggest potential fetal growth restriction or developmental issues. 2. **Physical abnormalities**: The examination reveals a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet. These findings are indicative of a congenital disorder that affects bone development. 3. **Radiographic findings**: The absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae is a critical finding that points towards a congenital disorder affecting the axial skeleton. Given these findings, the likely diagnosis is **Edwards syndrome**, also known as Trisomy 18. This condition is characterized by multiple congenital anomalies, including skeletal abnormalities, heart defects, and developmental delays. Now, let's analyze the options provided: A. **Maternal oligohydramnios**: While oligohydramnios can be associated with certain fetal anomalies, it is not a direct cause of the observed skeletal abnormalities. B. **Intrauterine alcohol exposure**: Fetal alcohol syndrome is a possible cause of congenital anomalies, but it does not typically result in the specific combination of findings seen in this case. C. **Maternal diabetes**: Maternal diabetes can increase the risk of congenital anomalies, but it is not directly linked to the specific skeletal abnormalities observed in this case. D. **Chromosome 18 trisomy (Edwards syndrome)**: This is the most likely diagnosis, given the combination of physical and radiographic findings. Trisomy 18 is a chromosomal disorder that can cause a range of congenital anomalies, including skeletal abnormalities, heart defects, and developmental delays. Therefore, the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The combination of physical and radiographic findings, including a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, club feet, and absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae, is most consistent with Edwards syndrome, which is associated with Trisomy 18. This condition is a chromosomal disorder that can cause multiple congenital anomalies, including skeletal abnormalities. The other options do not directly explain the observed findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
