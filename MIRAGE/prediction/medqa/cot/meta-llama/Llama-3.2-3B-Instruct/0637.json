        "B": "Impaired attention is a key feature of the disorder",
        "C": "Intellectual disability is a key feature of the disorder",
        "D": "Typical age of onset is 3-5 years of age"

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the symptoms described and match them with the characteristics of a specific disorder. The key points from the scenario are: the girl is nervous around other children, struggles to understand social cues, is easily distracted and upset by change, has a single interest in marine biology, and exhibits intense eye contact, flat affect, and a concrete thought process during the mental status exam.\\n\\nThe symptoms described are consistent with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Individuals with ASD often struggle with social interactions, have difficulty understanding social cues, and exhibit repetitive behaviors or interests. They may also have difficulty with changes in routine and can be easily distracted.\\n\\nLet's evaluate the answer choices based on this information:\\n\\nA. Boys are more commonly affected than girls: Research suggests that ASD is more commonly diagnosed in boys than girls, with a male-to-female ratio ranging from 3:1 to 4:1. So, this statement is false.\\n\\nB. Impaired attention is a key feature of the disorder: While individuals with ASD may have difficulty with attention, it is not a key feature of the disorder. The key features are social communication and social interaction difficulties, repetitive behaviors or interests, and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Impaired attention is not a defining characteristic of ASD.\\n\\nC. Intellectual disability is a key feature of the disorder: While some individuals with ASD may also have intellectual disability, it is not a key feature of the disorder. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) states that ASD is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, including social-emotional reciprocity, nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, and developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships. Intellectual disability is not a required criterion for the diagnosis of ASD.\\n\\nD. Typical age of onset is 3-5 years of age: The typical age of onset for ASD is around 2-3 years of age, with some cases identified as early as 6-12 months or as late as adolescence or adulthood. The age of onset can vary widely, and 12 years of age is within the range of typical ages for diagnosis.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is D. Typical age of onset is 3-5 years of age.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
