    "question": "A 6-month-old boy presents to a pediatrician for the evaluation of recurrent bacterial infections. He has a history of a variety of bacterial infections since birth. Physical examination reveals light-colored skin with silver-colored hair. The pediatrician suspects an immunodeficiency disorder and decides to order several tests. Study of the boy\u2019s neutrophils reveals that they contain large cytoplasmic vacuoles. Genetic studies show a mutation in the LYST gene. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)",
        "B": "Common variable immunodeficiency",
        "C": "Chediak-Higashi syndrome",
        "D": "Leukocyte adhesion deficiency\u20131"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the symptoms and test results presented in the scenario. The boy has a history of recurrent bacterial infections since birth, which suggests an immunodeficiency disorder. The physical examination reveals light-colored skin with silver-colored hair, which is a characteristic feature of Chediak-Higashi syndrome. The genetic studies show a mutation in the LYST gene, which is also a key finding in Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Neutrophils containing large cytoplasmic vacuoles are also consistent with this diagnosis. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is incorrect because it is caused by the HIV virus and does not typically present with the physical characteristics described in the scenario. B. Common variable immunodeficiency is incorrect because it is characterized by impaired antibody production, not recurrent bacterial infections since birth. C. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is the most likely diagnosis, given the combination of recurrent bacterial infections, light-colored skin with silver-colored hair, and a mutation in the LYST gene. D. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1 is incorrect because it is characterized by impaired neutrophil adhesion, not the presence of large cytoplasmic vacuoles. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Chediak-Higashi syndrome.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
