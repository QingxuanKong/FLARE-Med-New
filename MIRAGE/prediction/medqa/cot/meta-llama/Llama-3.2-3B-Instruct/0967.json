    "question": "A 16-year-old girl comes to the emergency department because of left wrist pain and swelling for 5 hours. She fell on an outstretched hand while playing basketball. She ignored it initially as she thought it was just a bruise, but the pain and swelling worsened throughout the day. The analgesic spray she used did not provide adequate relief. There is no family history of serious illness. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive pill. Her immunizations are up-to-date. She appears anxious. Her temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg. Examination shows a swollen and tender left wrist; range of motion is limited. The anatomical snuffbox is tender to palpation. The grip strength of the left hand is decreased. The thumb can be opposed towards the other fingers. Finkelstein's test is negative. X-rays of the wrist shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Corticosteroid injections",
        "B": "Thumb spica cast and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks",
        "C": "Rest, ice, and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks",
        "D": "Percutaneous pinning\n\""
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate next step in management, let's analyze the given clinical scenario step by step. The patient is a 16-year-old girl presenting with wrist pain and swelling after a fall, which worsened over time. The absence of family history of serious illness, up-to-date immunizations, and no mention of trauma-related injuries other than the fall make it less likely to be a fracture. The Finkelstein's test being negative also decreases the likelihood of De Quervain's tenosynovitis. The anatomical snuffbox tenderness is a red flag for a possible scaphoid fracture, but the X-rays show no abnormalities. The decreased grip strength and limited range of motion are concerning signs of a wrist injury. The patient's anxiety level is elevated, but it's not directly relevant to the diagnosis. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a scaphoid fracture. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) recommends the following management protocol for suspected scaphoid fractures: 1) Immobilization with a thumb spica cast, 2) repeat X-rays in 2 weeks to assess for healing, and 3) follow-up with a hand therapist to monitor for complications. Therefore, the most appropriate next best step in management is thumb spica cast and repeat X-rays in 2 weeks.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
