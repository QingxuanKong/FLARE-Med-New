    "question": "A 25-year-old male involved in a knife fight presents with a penetrating wound to the chest. The patient is unconscious and cannot provide any further history. Vitals show a temperature of 37-0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg, pulse of 115/min, respirations of 19/min, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is diaphoretic and unresponsive. Extremities are pale and cool. There is a 3-inch long penetrating wound between the 3rd and 4th intercostal space on the left side of the chest, which is bleeding profusely. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall. There are no apparent injuries to any coronary arteries or major branches. The patient is intubated and aggressive fluid resuscitation is initiated, including a blood transfusion. Which of the following is the best definitive surgical approach to take in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Immediate cardiac transplant",
        "B": "Watchful waiting while resuscitative fluids are initiated",
        "C": "Interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets",
        "D": "Needle thoracostomy over the 2nd intercostal space"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this case, we need to prioritize the patient's life-threatening condition, which is the penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall. The patient is hemodynamically unstable, as evidenced by hypotension (blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg) and tachycardia (pulse of 115/min). The presence of a full-thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall is a high-risk lesion that requires immediate repair to prevent further cardiac compromise and potential cardiac arrest. The patient is already intubated and receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation, which is appropriate for the patient's hypotension. The correct approach should focus on stabilizing the patient's hemodynamics and repairing the cardiac injury. Immediate cardiac transplant (A) is not an appropriate option as the patient is not brain dead and is in need of repairable injuries. Watchful waiting (B) is not suitable for a patient with a penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall, as it can lead to further cardiac compromise. Needle thoracostomy (D) may be used for tension pneumothorax, but it does not address the cardiac injury. Interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets (C) is the most appropriate option to repair the full-thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall, as it allows for adequate hemostasis and closure of the wound, which is essential to prevent further cardiac complications and stabilize the patient's hemodynamics.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
