    "question": "A 52-year-old man with Crohn disease comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of dysuria and urinary urgency. He had been treated for urinary tract infections twice in the past 6 months. He is currently taking infliximab. Cystoscopy shows pearl-like plaques on the bladder wall. Biopsy of these lesions shows a focal layer of stratified squamous epithelium with hyperkeratosis. If the patient's bladder finding is caused by a vitamin deficiency, which of the following features is also most likely to be seen?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Carpopedal spasm",
        "B": "Photodermatitis",
        "C": "Night blindness",
        "D": "Intracranial hypertension"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Patient's symptoms and medical history**: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, which is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. He has also had two previous episodes of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the past 6 months, and is currently taking infliximab, a medication commonly used to treat IBD. 2. **Cystoscopy findings**: The cystoscopy shows \"pearl-like plaques\" on the bladder wall, which suggests a condition affecting the bladder mucosa. 3. **Biopsy findings**: The biopsy of these lesions shows a focal layer of stratified squamous epithelium with hyperkeratosis. This finding is unusual in the bladder, as the normal bladder lining is pseudostratified or transitional epithelium, not stratified squamous epithelium. 4. **Vitamin deficiency connection**: The question suggests that the bladder finding is caused by a vitamin deficiency. Given the unusual histological finding in the bladder, we need to think about which vitamin deficiency could lead to such a change in the bladder lining. 5. **Vitamin D deficiency**: The key to this question is the histological finding of stratified squamous epithelium in the bladder. This is a hallmark of vitamin D deficiency, specifically rickets in children, but also can be seen in adults with severe deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency can cause changes in the skin and other tissues, but the bladder lining is particularly affected in this way. 6. **Connecting the dots**: Vitamin D deficiency can cause a range of symptoms, but the specific finding of stratified squamous epithelium in the bladder is most closely associated with a different condition: **vitamin D deficiency-related hypercalcemia (also known as osteomalacia or rickets in children)**. This condition can lead to softening of bones, but also affects the skin, kidneys, and other tissues. The skin manifestation of this condition is **x-linked**. 7. **Choosing the correct answer**: Given the patient's symptoms and biopsy findings, the most likely feature associated with vitamin D deficiency is **C. Night blindness**, as this is a classic symptom of vitamin A deficiency, which is closely related to vitamin D metabolism. Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin in response to UV light, and vitamin A is a precursor to vitamin D. Therefore, a deficiency in vitamin D can lead to a deficiency in vitamin A, causing night blindness. Here is the output in json format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's biopsy findings of stratified squamous epithelium with hyperkeratosis in the bladder suggest a vitamin D deficiency, which can lead to night blindness as a classic symptom of vitamin A deficiency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" } ```",
