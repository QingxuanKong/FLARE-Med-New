    "question": "A researcher hypothesizes that low birth weight is related to obesity later in life. He conducts a study with a 95% confidence interval with a p-value of 0.049 to disprove his null hypothesis. He rejects his null hypothesis and concludes that low birth weight is associated with obesity. Which of the following statements best associates with his study?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Confidence interval should have been 90%.",
        "B": "A type 2 error is not possible in this case.",
        "C": "A type 2 error has been made.",
        "D": "A type 1 error has been made."
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the key concepts involved: 1. **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: The null hypothesis typically states that there is no association between the variables being studied (in this case, low birth weight and obesity). The researcher is trying to disprove this null hypothesis. 2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The alternative hypothesis typically states that there is an association between the variables. In this case, the researcher is testing the hypothesis that low birth weight is associated with obesity. 3. **P-Value**: The p-value represents the probability of observing the results (or more extreme) assuming the null hypothesis is true. A low p-value (in this case, 0.049) indicates that the observed results are unlikely under the null hypothesis. 4. **95% Confidence Interval (CI)**: A confidence interval provides a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to lie. A 95% CI means that if the study were repeated many times, the true population parameter would lie within this interval 95% of the time. Now, let's analyze the given options: A. **Confidence interval should have been 90%**: This option is incorrect because the confidence interval is already set at 95%, which means the researcher is 95% confident that the true effect size lies within this interval. Changing the confidence level would require a different sample size or a different statistical analysis. B. **A type 2 error is not possible in this case**: This option is incorrect because a type 2 error (also known as a false negative) occurs when a true effect is not detected. Since the researcher is trying to disprove the null hypothesis, a type 2 error would mean that the researcher failed to detect an actual association between low birth weight and obesity. C. **A type 2 error has been made**: This option is incorrect because a type 2 error occurs when a true effect is not detected. Since the researcher has rejected the null hypothesis, it's unlikely that a type 2 error has been made. D. **A type 1 error has been made**: This option is correct. A type 1 error (also known as a false positive) occurs when a false positive result is obtained. Since the p-value is 0.049, which is close to the significance level (usually 0.05), the researcher has made a type 1 error. This means the researcher incorrectly rejected the null hypothesis, concluding that low birth weight is associated with obesity when it may not actually be the case. Therefore, the correct answer is: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The researcher conducted a study with a 95% confidence interval and a p-value of 0.049 to disprove the null hypothesis that low birth weight is not associated with obesity. The researcher incorrectly rejected the null hypothesis, concluding that low birth weight is associated with obesity when it may not actually be the case. This indicates a type 1 error has been made.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"} ```",
