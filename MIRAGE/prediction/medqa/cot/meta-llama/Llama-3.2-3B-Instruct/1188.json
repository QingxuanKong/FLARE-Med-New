    "question": "After a T cell progenitor leaves the bone marrow, most of its development takes place in the thymus. It passes through several stages during its maturation. Positive selection is an important process during maturation of T lymphocytes, and it ensures the preservation of self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted T cells. During which of the following developmental stages does a T cell undergo this process?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Pre-T cell",
        "B": "Double-positive T cell",
        "C": "Single-positive CD4+ T cell",
        "D": "Single-positive CD8+ T cell"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the stages of T cell development and the process of positive selection. T cells undergo several stages of development in the thymus, including the pre-T cell stage, double-positive stage, and single-positive stage. Positive selection is a critical process that occurs during the double-positive stage, where T cells are selected based on their ability to recognize self-MHC molecules. This process ensures that only T cells that can recognize self-MHC molecules are allowed to mature and become functional T cells. The double-positive stage is characterized by the expression of both CD4 and CD8 markers on the T cell surface. Therefore, the correct answer is the stage where T cells have both CD4 and CD8 markers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
