    "question": "An 80-year-old man presents with severe pain of the right lower extremity. He says that symptoms had an acute onset while he was in the ICU for a COPD exacerbation due to a recent upper respiratory infection, which was treated with nebulized albuterol and ipratropium bromide, continuous oxygen, IV methylprednisolone, and levofloxacin. He says he has been hospitalized 3 other times this year for COPD exacerbations. The medical history is significant for a left main coronary artery myocardial infarction after a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 2 months ago, mild cognitive impairment, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications are metformin, aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, atorvastatin, galantamine, and enalapril. He reports a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. His temperature is 39.0\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F); blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg; pulse is 122/min; respiratory rate is 20/min, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. The physical examination is significant for the cutaneous finding shown in the picture. The involved area is severely tender to palpation and there are warmth and crepitus. A foul-smelling discharge is also noted. Pain seems out of proportion to the exam findings. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Immediate debridement",
        "B": "Immediate debridement and empiric IV antibiotics",
        "C": "Biopsy of wound",
        "D": "Contrast CT of the chest and abdomen"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's presentation with severe pain, fever, and signs of cellulitis (redness, warmth, crepitus, and foul-smelling discharge) on the right lower extremity, along with a history of recent hospitalization for COPD exacerbation and a history of coronary artery disease, the clinical suspicion for an infected thrombophlebitis or infected thrombophlebitis with sepsis is high. The patient's pain seems out of proportion to the physical exam findings, which is a classic sign of referred pain in the context of an infected thrombophlebitis. The presence of a recent myocardial infarction and a history of cardiovascular disease also increases the risk of thrombophlebitis. Therefore, the next best step in management would be to immediately initiate empiric IV antibiotics to cover for a broad spectrum of pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are common causes of infected thrombophlebitis in hospitalized patients. This is especially true given the patient's immunocompromised state due to recent hospitalization and the fact that he has been hospitalized multiple times for COPD exacerbations. Immediate debridement may be necessary, but it should not be done without first starting empiric IV antibiotics. A biopsy of the wound may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, but it should not be done until the patient has received IV antibiotics for at least 24 hours. A contrast CT of the chest and abdomen may be useful in identifying any pulmonary or abdominal sources of infection, but it is not the next best step in management given the clinical presentation of an infected thrombophlebitis. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
