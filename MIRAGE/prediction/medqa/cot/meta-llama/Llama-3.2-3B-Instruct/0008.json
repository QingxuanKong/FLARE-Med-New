    "question": "A 37-year-old-woman presents to her primary care physician requesting a new form of birth control. She has been utilizing oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for the past 8 years, but asks to switch to an intrauterine device (IUD). Her vital signs are: blood pressure 118/78 mm Hg, pulse 73/min and respiratory rate 16/min. She is afebrile. Physical examination is within normal limits. Which of the following past medical history statements would make copper IUD placement contraindicated in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "A history of stroke or venous thromboembolism",
        "B": "Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)",
        "C": "Past medical history of breast cancer",
        "D": "Known liver neoplasm"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step: 1. **Copper IUD placement contraindications**: Copper IUDs are generally considered safe for most women, but there are certain contraindications that need to be considered. These include: - Active or recent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) - Pregnancy - Active cancer (including breast cancer) - Active liver disease - Known liver neoplasm - Active or uncontrolled bleeding disorders - Current use of anticoagulant therapy 2. **Analyzing option A (History of stroke or venous thromboembolism)**: While a history of stroke or venous thromboembolism may increase the risk of thrombotic events, it is not typically a contraindication for copper IUD placement. However, the patient's current blood pressure is normal (118/78 mm Hg), and there is no mention of active thrombotic events or current anticoagulant therapy. 3. **Analyzing option B (Active or recurrent PID)**: This is a contraindication for copper IUD placement. The insertion of a copper IUD can exacerbate or spread infection, making it contraindicated in active or recurrent PID. 4. **Analyzing option C (Past medical history of breast cancer)**: While breast cancer is a concern, the type and stage of the cancer, as well as the time since treatment, are crucial factors in determining whether a copper IUD is safe. Generally, most women with a history of breast cancer can safely use an IUD, but the decision should be made on a case-by-case basis. 5. **Analyzing option D (Known liver neoplasm)**: A known liver neoplasm could potentially increase the risk of bleeding or other complications. However, this is not typically a contraindication for copper IUD placement. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided, the most definitive contraindication for copper IUD placement is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Analyzing each option, the most clear-cut contraindication for copper IUD placement in this patient is a history of active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can be life-threatening if not properly treated and can lead to severe complications with IUD insertion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
