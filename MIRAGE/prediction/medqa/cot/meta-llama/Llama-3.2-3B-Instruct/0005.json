    "question": "A 39-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of progressively worsening chest pain and nausea that started at a local bar 30 minutes prior. The pain radiates to the epigastric area. He has a 5-year history of untreated hypertension. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 5 years and started abusing cocaine 2 weeks before his emergency room visit. The patient is diaphoretic and in marked distress. What should be the first step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Diltiazem",
        "B": "Labetalol",
        "C": "Propranolol",
        "D": "Reassurance and continuous monitoring"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) given the history of hypertension, smoking, and the onset of chest pain radiating to the epigastric area. The patient's recent cocaine abuse is a significant risk factor for cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction (MI). The patient's diaphoresis and marked distress indicate a high level of anxiety and potential for cardiac decompensation. The first step in management should prioritize stabilization of the patient's cardiovascular system and addressing the potential for MI.\\n\\nGiven the patient's symptoms and risk factors, an anti-arrhythmic agent is not the most appropriate initial choice. Beta-blockers (options B and C) could worsen the situation by reducing cardiac output and perfusion of vital organs in the setting of cocaine use and potential MI. Diltiazem (option A) is also not ideal as it can further reduce cardiac contractility.\\n\\nThe most appropriate initial step is reassurance and continuous monitoring, as it allows for further assessment of the patient's symptoms and cardiac status while minimizing potential complications from medications that could worsen the situation. This approach also allows for timely administration of other necessary medications, such as oxygen, nitrates, or thrombolytics, if indicated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
