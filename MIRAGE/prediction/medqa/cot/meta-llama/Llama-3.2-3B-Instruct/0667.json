    "question": "A 40-year-old patient is brought into the emergency department after suffering a motor vehicle crash where he was pinned underneath his motorcycle for about 30 minutes before a passerby called 911. While evaluating him per your institution's trauma guidelines, you discover pain upon palpation of his right lower extremity which is much larger than his left counterpart. The patient admits to decreased sensation over his right lower extremity and cannot move his leg. There are no palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses on this extremity, and it is colder and paler in comparison to his left side. Measured compartment pressure of his distal right leg is 35 mm Hg. What is the next best step in this patient's care?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Emergent fasciotomy",
        "B": "Venous doppler",
        "C": "Arteriogram",
        "D": "External fixation"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this patient's condition, we need to consider the signs and symptoms presented. The patient has a history of being pinned underneath a motorcycle for 30 minutes, which is a high-risk scenario for compartment syndrome. The patient's right lower extremity is larger than the left counterpart, and there is decreased sensation over the right lower extremity. The absence of palpable pulses and the difference in temperature and color between the two legs further support the suspicion of compartment syndrome. The measured compartment pressure of 35 mm Hg is also consistent with compartment syndrome, as the normal range is typically below 30 mm Hg. Given these findings, the next best step in this patient's care should be to relieve the pressure in the affected compartment to prevent further tissue damage and potential amputation. The most appropriate intervention in this case is an emergent fasciotomy to release the pressure and restore blood flow to the affected limb.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
