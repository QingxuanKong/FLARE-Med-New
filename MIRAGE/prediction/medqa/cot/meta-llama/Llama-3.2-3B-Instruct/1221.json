    "question": "A 49-year-old female with a history of alcoholism was found lying unconscious on a bench at a local park and rushed to the emergency department. Upon arrival, the patient regained consciousness and complained of intense bilateral flank pain and a recent decrease in urination. Urine microscopy demonstrated abundant square crystals of calcium oxalate that looked like \u201cfolded envelopes.\" Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen in this patient:",
    "options": {
        "A": "Anion gap metabolic acidosis",
        "B": "Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis",
        "C": "Respiratory acidosis",
        "D": "Respiratory alkalosis"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Patient Profile**: A 49-year-old female with a history of alcoholism, found unconscious and exhibiting symptoms of intense bilateral flank pain and decreased urination. The history of alcoholism is crucial, as it can lead to various complications, including kidney stones. 2. **Symptoms**: The patient's symptoms of intense flank pain and decreased urination suggest a renal issue. Flank pain is a common symptom of kidney stones, and decreased urination (oliguria) can be due to obstruction or inflammation in the urinary tract. 3. **Urine Microscopy Findings**: The presence of abundant square crystals of calcium oxalate that resemble \"folded envelopes\" on microscopy is highly indicative of kidney stones, specifically calcium oxalate stones. These stones are the most common type of kidney stone. 4. **Clinical Correlation**: Given the patient's history of alcoholism, it is likely that she has a condition called primary hyperoxaluria, which is a genetic disorder that leads to the excessive production of oxalate in the urine. This excess oxalate can combine with calcium to form calcium oxalate stones. 5. **Metabolic Consequence**: In the setting of primary hyperoxaluria, there is a high risk of developing hyperoxaluria, which can lead to hypercalciuria (excessive calcium in the urine) and kidney stones. This condition can also lead to metabolic acidosis due to the increased excretion of oxalate, which is acidic in nature. 6. **Metabolic Acidosis Type**: The type of metabolic acidosis that is most likely to be seen in this patient is non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. This type of acidosis occurs due to the loss of bicarbonate-rich fluids, which can happen when the kidneys are not able to reabsorb enough bicarbonate in the setting of kidney stones and obstruction. Based on the step-by-step analysis, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's history of alcoholism, symptoms of kidney stones, and the presence of calcium oxalate stones, the most likely metabolic finding is non-anion gap metabolic acidosis due to the loss of bicarbonate-rich fluids in the setting of kidney stones and hyperoxaluria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
