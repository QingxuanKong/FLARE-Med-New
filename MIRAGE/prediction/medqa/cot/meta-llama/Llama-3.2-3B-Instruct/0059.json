    "question": "A 17-year-old girl is referred by her dentist for a suspected eating disorder. She has been visiting the same dentist since childhood and for the past 2 years has had at least 2 visits for dental caries. She eventually admitted to him that she regularly induces vomiting by putting her fingers down her throat. She says she has been doing this for the last few years and purging at least once a week. More recently, she has been inducing emesis more often and even looked into diuretics as she feels that she is gaining more and more weight compared to her \u2018skinny friends\u2019. Her BMI is at the 50th percentile for her age and sex. Which of the following features is most consistent with this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Patients with this disorder are not further sub-typed",
        "B": "Patients do not usually initiate treatment",
        "C": "Patients can have a history of both anorexia and bulimia",
        "D": "Patients will typically have a BMI between 17\u201318.5 kg/m2"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the information provided step by step: 1. **Patient's symptoms and behavior**: The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has been inducing vomiting by putting her fingers down her throat, which is a clear sign of bulimia nervosa. She also mentioned using diuretics to lose weight, which is a common behavior among individuals with bulimia nervosa. 2. **Dental caries visits**: The patient has had multiple visits for dental caries, which can be attributed to the frequent vomiting. The enamel erosion caused by stomach acid can lead to tooth decay and sensitivity. 3. **BMI**: The patient's BMI is at the 50th percentile for her age and sex, which is slightly above the normal weight range. This suggests that she is not underweight but may be overweight or obese. 4. **Comparison with options**: - Option A: Patients with bulimia nervosa are often further sub-typed based on the presence or absence of binge-eating/purging subtype, which is not applicable in this case. - Option B: Individuals with bulimia nervosa usually do not hesitate to seek treatment, as it is a serious eating disorder that can have severe physical and mental health consequences. - Option C: Individuals with bulimia nervosa can have a history of both anorexia and bulimia nervosa, as they often exhibit a spectrum of eating disorders. - Option D: The patient's BMI is not consistent with anorexia nervosa (which is typically below 18.5 kg/m^2), but it is consistent with bulimia nervosa. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the correct answer is **C. Patients can have a history of both anorexia and bulimia**. This option is consistent with the patient's symptoms, behavior, and BMI, which is not indicative of anorexia nervosa but is consistent with bulimia nervosa. ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient exhibits symptoms and behavior consistent with bulimia nervosa, including inducing vomiting, using diuretics, and a slightly above-average BMI. The correct answer is option C, as individuals with bulimia nervosa can have a history of both anorexia and bulimia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"} ```",
