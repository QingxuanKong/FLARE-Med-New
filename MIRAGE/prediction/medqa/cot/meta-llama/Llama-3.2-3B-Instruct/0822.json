    "question": "A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to a change in his skin color. The patient went on a long hike this morning, and his girlfriend noticed that his skin had changed color when they were driving home. The patient has a past medical history of marijuana use, IV drug use, alcohol use, and asthma. His current medications include albuterol, fluticasone, and ibuprofen. His temperature is 97.5\u00b0F (36.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/75 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 10/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Laboratory studies are ordered and are seen below.\n\nHemoglobin: 10 g/dL\nHematocrit: 32%\nLeukocyte count: 5,500 cells/mm^3 with normal differential\nPlatelet count: 207,000/mm^3\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nCl-: 99 mEq/L\nK+: 4.3 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nBUN: 17 mg/dL\nGlucose: 89 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.0 mg/dL\nCa2+: 10.1 mg/dL\nBilirubin, total: 11.3 mg/dL\nBilirubin, direct: 7.8 mg/dL\n\nPhysical exam is notable for a patient with skin that appears yellow/orange. Cardiac, pulmonary, abdominal, and neurological exams are within normal limits. Which of the following is associated with this patient's underlying pathology?",
    "options": {
        "A": "A pathology responsive to sofosbuvir",
        "B": "Decreased UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity",
        "C": "Hyperpigmentation of the liver",
        "D": "Increased consumption of beta-carotene"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a change in skin color after a long hike, which suggests a possible exposure to an environmental toxin or a condition that affects hemoglobin or bilirubin metabolism. The patient has a history of IV drug use, which increases the risk of infectious diseases, including hepatitis. The laboratory results show a significantly elevated total bilirubin level (11.3 mg/dL), with a predominance of direct bilirubin (7.8 mg/dL), indicating an increase in conjugated bilirubin. This suggests a pre-hepatic or intrahepatic cause of jaundice, rather than a post-hepatic cause. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with a diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria, a disorder of heme biosynthesis that can be precipitated by various factors, including stress, fasting, or certain medications. The patient's history of IV drug use may also be relevant, as some drugs can trigger attacks of porphyria. The elevated bilirubin level is not responsive to sofosbuvir, which is a treatment for hepatitis C infection. Decreased UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity is associated with Gilbert's syndrome, a benign condition that causes mild jaundice, which does not match the severity of the patient's presentation. Hyperpigmentation of the liver is not a characteristic feature of this condition. Increased consumption of beta-carotene is associated with carotenemia, a benign condition that causes yellow skin discoloration, but it is not consistent with the patient's elevated direct bilirubin level and other laboratory findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
