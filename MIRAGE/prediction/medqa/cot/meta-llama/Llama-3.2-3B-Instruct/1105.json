    "question": "A 55-year-old woman presents to the office because she has been feeling weak. For the past 2 years, she has been urinating a considerable volume every time she goes to the bathroom. She has no past medical history. Her heart rate is 86/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, temperature is 37.4\u00b0C (99.3\u00b0F), and blood pressure is 111/79 mm Hg. Laboratory studies are significant for the following:\nCalcium 13.8 mg/dL\nPTH 230 pg/mL\nHer complete metabolic panel is otherwise within normal limits. Imaging studies show subperiosteal resorption and osteoporosis. Scintigraphy reveals the most common pathologic condition associated with the patient\u2019s diagnosis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Adenoma",
        "B": "Carcinoma",
        "C": "Decreased calcitriol concentration",
        "D": "Phosphate retention"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with polyuria (excessive urination) and weakness. Polyuria can be a symptom of several conditions, but in this context, we need to consider the other symptoms and laboratory findings. 2. **Laboratory Findings**: - Elevated calcium level (13.8 mg/dL): This can be seen in hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, or other conditions. - Elevated PTH (230 pg/mL): Parathyroid hormone is typically elevated in primary hyperparathyroidism, a condition where the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone. - Normal complete metabolic panel: This suggests that the patient does not have significant kidney dysfunction or electrolyte imbalances. 3. **Imaging Studies**: - Subperiosteal resorption: This is a characteristic radiographic finding in primary hyperparathyroidism due to the increased bone resorption caused by elevated PTH levels. - Osteoporosis: This is also consistent with long-standing hyperparathyroidism, as it leads to bone resorption. 4. **Scintigraphy**: The question does not specify what type of scintigraphy was performed, but given the context, it is likely related to bone metabolism or parathyroid function. Considering these points, the most common pathologic condition associated with the patient's diagnosis is likely related to hyperparathyroidism. Now, let's evaluate the options: - A. Adenoma: A parathyroid adenoma is a common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism, which would explain the elevated PTH levels, subperiosteal resorption, and osteoporosis. - B. Carcinoma: While parathyroid carcinoma can also cause hyperparathyroidism, it is less common than adenoma. - C. Decreased calcitriol concentration: This would not typically cause hyperparathyroidism or the observed laboratory and imaging findings. - D. Phosphate retention: This would not explain the elevated PTH levels or the observed bone changes. **Answer**: A. Adenoma **Rationale**: The combination of elevated PTH levels, subperiosteal resorption, osteoporosis, and the clinical presentation of polyuria and weakness makes primary hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma the most likely diagnosis.",
