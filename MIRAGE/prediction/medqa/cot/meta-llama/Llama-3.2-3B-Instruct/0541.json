    "question": "In a study to determine the risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age (age < 30 years), 30 young patients with the condition are recruited into the study group. Sixty similar but healthy individuals are recruited into the control group. Educational status is considered to be an important variable, as it would affect the awareness of the disease and its risk factors among the participants. Based on the level of education, 2 groups are formed: low educational status and high educational status. A chi-square test is performed to test the significance of the relationship, and an odds ratio of 2.1 was computed for the association between low education and the risk of MI, with a confidence interval of 0.9\u20139.7. What inference can be made on the association between young age MI and educational status from this study?",
    "options": {
        "A": "The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.",
        "B": "The association is statistically significant, but low education is not a risk factor.",
        "C": "The association is not statistically significant, but low education is a risk factor.",
        "D": "One can not comment, as the p-value is not given."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. **Study Design**: The study is a case-control study, comparing two groups: patients with myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age (age < 30 years) and healthy controls. This type of study design is useful for identifying risk factors. 2. **Sample Size**: The study has a relatively small sample size, with 30 patients with MI and 60 healthy controls. This sample size might be too small to detect many risk factors, especially when the effect size is small. 3. **Variable of Interest**: The variable of interest is the association between educational status and the risk of MI at a young age. 4. **Statistical Test**: A chi-square test is used to test the significance of the association between low education and the risk of MI. 5. **Odds Ratio (OR)**: The computed odds ratio is 2.1, with a confidence interval of 0.9\u20139.7. The confidence interval is quite wide, indicating that the true effect size is uncertain and may not be statistically significant. 6. **Interpretation of Odds Ratio**: An odds ratio of 2.1 indicates that individuals with low education are 2.1 times more likely to develop MI at a young age compared to those with high education. However, the confidence interval (0.9\u20139.7) suggests that this association may not be statistically significant. 7. **Statistical Significance**: The chi-square test is used to determine statistical significance. However, the p-value is not provided in the question. Typically, if the p-value is less than 0.05, the association is considered statistically significant. Considering these points, we can make the following inference: - The confidence interval (0.9\u20139.7) is quite wide, indicating that the true effect size may not be statistically significant. - The odds ratio suggests an association between low education and the risk of MI, but it is not strong enough to be considered a risk factor. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is: **\"The association is not statistically significant, but low education is a risk factor.\"** This answer acknowledges the association between low education and the risk of MI, but also notes that it is not statistically significant due to the wide confidence interval.",
