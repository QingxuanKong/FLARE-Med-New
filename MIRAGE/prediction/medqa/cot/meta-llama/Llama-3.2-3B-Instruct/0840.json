    "question": "Candida is injected into the skin of a 38-year-old female patient. Forty-eight hours later, there is a 14 mm raised, slightly hardened area at the injection site. What type of hypersensitivity reaction has occurred and what cell type plays a role?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Type I hypersensitivty; eosinophils",
        "B": "Type IV hypersensitivity; mast cells",
        "C": "Type III hypersensitivity; CD4+ T cells",
        "D": "Type IV hypersensitivity; CD4+ T cells"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To determine the type of hypersensitivity reaction and the cell type involved, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. **Time frame**: The reaction occurs 48 hours after the injection, which is a delayed response. This suggests a cell-mediated immune response, as immediate hypersensitivity reactions (Type I) typically occur within minutes to hours. 2. **Type of reaction**: The reaction is a 14 mm raised, slightly hardened area at the injection site. This description is characteristic of a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, also known as a cell-mediated or T-cell-mediated response. 3. **Cell type involved**: In delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, T cells play a crucial role. Specifically, CD4+ T cells (also known as T helper 1 cells) are involved in the activation of macrophages and other immune cells, leading to the release of chemical mediators that cause tissue damage. Considering these points, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction occurs due to the activation of CD4+ T cells, which are responsible for the immune response at the injection site. The reaction is characterized by the formation of a raised, hardened area, which is indicative of granulomatous inflammation. This type of reaction is typical of a Type IV hypersensitivity response.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
