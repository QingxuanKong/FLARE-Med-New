    "question": "A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after collapsing at the grocery store and losing consciousness for 1 minute following a sudden onset of palpitations. He has no chest pain or dizziness. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and is currently being treated as an outpatient for pneumonia. His current medications include lisinopril, metformin, and azithromycin. He has no sign of injury, and he appears well. During the examination, he loses consciousness again. Telemetry shows polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis, which spontaneously resolves after 30 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's syncope?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Hypomagnesemia",
        "B": "Brugada syndrome",
        "C": "Prolonged QT interval",
        "D": "Hyperkalemia"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking and the answer: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and history: 1. **Sudden onset of palpitations and loss of consciousness**: This suggests a cardiac cause for his syncope, as it is not related to the patient's history of hypertension, diabetes, or pneumonia. 2. **No chest pain or dizziness**: This helps to rule out acute coronary syndrome and other cardiac conditions that typically present with chest pain or dizziness. 3. **History of hypertension and diabetes**: While these conditions can contribute to cardiac complications, they do not directly explain the sudden onset of palpitations and syncope in this case. 4. **Medications**: Lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) and metformin (an oral hypoglycemic agent) are not typically associated with cardiac arrhythmias. Azithromycin (an antibiotic) can cause QT prolongation, but the patient's symptoms and ECG findings suggest a more specific cause. 5. **Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis on telemetry**: This ECG pattern is highly suggestive of **Brugada syndrome**, a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal potassium channel function and a predisposition to sudden cardiac death. The polymorphic pattern can be seen in Brugada syndrome, and the cyclic alteration of the QRS axis is a hallmark of this condition. 6. **Spontaneous resolution after 30 seconds**: This rapid resolution is consistent with Brugada syndrome, as the arrhythmia is often self-limiting and resolves on its own. Given these points, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's syncope is **Brugada syndrome**.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
