    "question": "While on a teaching sabbatical in Uruguay, a pathologist examined the excised liver of an 18-year-old otherwise healthy female who passed away due to massive hepatic necrosis 5 days after she underwent general anesthesia to repair a fractured femur. Which of the following is a general anesthetic most likely responsible for her death?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Lidocaine",
        "B": "Midazolam",
        "C": "Halothane",
        "D": "Desflurane"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to consider the characteristics of the anesthetics listed and their known side effects, especially in relation to liver damage and hepatitis. The key detail here is the patient's condition: a healthy 18-year-old female who underwent general anesthesia for a femur fracture and developed massive hepatic necrosis 5 days post-surgery. This timeline suggests an anesthetic-related liver injury, as it occurred after the surgery and not due to a pre-existing liver condition. The anesthetic agent responsible for this condition would likely have a known association with liver toxicity or hepatitis.\\n\\nHalothane is known to cause hepatitis in rare cases, but it is not the most common cause of liver damage associated with general anesthesia. Midazolam, a benzodiazepine, is not commonly associated with liver toxicity. Lidocaine, a local anesthetic, is not typically linked to liver damage. Desflurane, a halogenated anesthetic, also carries a risk of hepatotoxicity but is less commonly associated with severe liver damage compared to halothane.\\n\\nGiven the options, the most likely cause of the patient's death is Halothane due to its well-documented association with rare but severe cases of hepatitis and liver necrosis, especially in the context of general anesthesia.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is C. Halothane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
