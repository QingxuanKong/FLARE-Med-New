    "question": "A 54-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he was found outside in the middle of a blizzard. On presentation, he is conscious but does not know where he is nor how he got there. His wife is contacted and says that he has been getting increasingly confused over the past 6 weeks. This progressed from misplacing objects to getting lost in places that he knew how to navigate previously. Most worryingly, he has recently started forgetting the names of their children. In addition to these memory changes, she says that he now has rapid jerky movements of his extremities as well as coordination and balance problems. Finally, he has become extremely paranoid about government surveillance and has had hallucinations about secret agents in their house. His previous medical history is significant for a previous car crash in which the patient required internal fixation of a femur fracture and a corneal transplant for corneal degeneration. Otherwise he had no neurologic deficits prior to 6 weeks ago. Physical exam reveals myoclonus and ataxia. Which of the following is true of the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Can be transmitted on medical equipment even after autoclaving instruments",
        "B": "Contains genetic material but is unable to survive independent from a host",
        "C": "Has a cell wall containing peptidoglycan",
        "D": "Leads to intracellular aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and history: 1. **Progressive memory changes**: The patient's memory issues started 6 weeks ago, progressing from misplacing objects to getting lost in familiar places, and eventually forgetting the names of his children. This suggests a degenerative process affecting cognitive function. 2. **Motor symptoms**: The patient exhibits myoclonus (rapid jerky movements) and ataxia (coordination and balance problems). These symptoms indicate a neurological disorder affecting movement and coordination. 3. **Hallucinations and paranoia**: The patient's paranoia and hallucinations about secret agents suggest a psychotic component to his condition. 4. **Previous medical history**: The patient had a significant traumatic event (car crash) and a previous corneal transplant, but no previous neurological deficits. Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is **Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)**, specifically the subtype known as **Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Dementia (bvFTD)**. This condition is characterized by changes in personality, behavior, and social functioning, as well as motor symptoms such as myoclonus and ataxia. Now, let's evaluate the answer choices in relation to FTD/bvFTD: A. **Can be transmitted on medical equipment even after autoclaving instruments**: This is true of prions, a type of infectious agent that can cause neurodegenerative diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which is a type of prion disease. However, FTD/bvFTD is not caused by prions. B. **Contains genetic material but is unable to survive independent from a host**: This is true of viruses, which can cause various neurological diseases. However, FTD/bvFTD is not caused by a viral infection. C. **Has a cell wall containing peptidoglycan**: This is true of bacteria, which are not related to the causation of FTD/bvFTD. D. **Leads to intracellular aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein**: This is true of Alzheimer's disease, which is a different neurodegenerative disorder. While Alzheimer's disease does involve tau protein pathology, the primary pathology in FTD/bvFTD involves tau protein, but in a different context (frontotemporal lobe degeneration, rather than diffuse cortical degeneration). Based on this analysis, the correct answer is: **None of the above options directly describe the primary cause of FTD/bvFTD. However, option A is the closest to describing a characteristic of prions, which are associated with a different neurodegenerative disease (CJD).**",
