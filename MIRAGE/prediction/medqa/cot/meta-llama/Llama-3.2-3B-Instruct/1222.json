    "question": "A 53-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up appointment three days after being prescribed a selective alpha-1 agonist. He reports improvement in his symptoms and has not experienced any adverse effects. This drug was most likely prescribed for which of the following conditions?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Bronchospasm due to bronchial asthma",
        "B": "Urinary hesitancy due to benign prostatic hyperplasia",
        "C": "Nasal congestion due to a viral infection",
        "D": "Blood pressure management prior to pheochromocytoma excision"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to understand the primary uses of selective alpha-1 agonists. These drugs are known to relax smooth muscle in the bladder neck and prostate, which helps to improve urine flow and reduce symptoms of urinary hesitancy. They also have a bronchodilatory effect, which can help alleviate bronchospasm. However, they are not typically used for blood pressure management or treating nasal congestion. Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that requires different treatment approaches, such as alpha-blockers, and not alpha-1 agonists. Considering the patient's improvement in symptoms and lack of adverse effects, the most likely indication for this selective alpha-1 agonist is related to a condition that benefits from smooth muscle relaxation in the bladder neck and prostate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
