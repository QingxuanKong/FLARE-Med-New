    "question": "A 72-year-old woman with a 40 pack-year history of smoking presents to your office with jaundice. After a thorough workup, you determine that the patient has pancreatic cancer. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial statement to inform the patient of her condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "\"Have you ever heard of pancreatic cancer?\"",
        "B": "\"I have bad news I need to share with you. Please sit down so we can discuss.\"",
        "C": "\"Have you designated a healthcare proxy?\"",
        "D": "\"Your test results are consistent with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\""
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"When delivering bad news to a patient, it's essential to prioritize empathy and compassion. The initial approach should be gentle, clear, and concise. Option A is not suitable as it may come across as insensitive and dismissive. Option C is also not ideal as it shifts the focus from the patient's condition to their advance care planning, which is not the primary concern in this scenario. Option D is a medical statement that provides information about the diagnosis but lacks emotional support and empathy. A more effective approach is needed to break the news gently and compassionately. A good approach would be to start with a empathetic phrase that acknowledges the patient's experience and prepares them for the news, making option B the most appropriate choice. This phrase allows the patient to process their emotions and become receptive to the diagnosis, making it easier to discuss the treatment options and next steps.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
