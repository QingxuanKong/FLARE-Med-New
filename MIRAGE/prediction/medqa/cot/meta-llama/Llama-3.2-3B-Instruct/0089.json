    "question": "A 26-year-old G1P0 woman presents to her primary care physician\u2019s office with feelings of anxiety and trouble with sleep. She finds it difficult initiating sleep, occasionally has palpitations, and feels fatigued. She denies having similar symptoms in the past or starting any new medications or illicit drugs. She is currently 10 weeks pregnant and is closely followed by her obstetrician. Her temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/70 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical exam, the patient is mildly diaphoretic. The skin is warm and the thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged with thyroid bruits. Laboratory studies are significant for a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.01 \u00b5U/mL (normal is 0.5-5.0 \u00b5U/mL) and an elevated free thyroxine (FT4) that is inappropriate for her pregnancy. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Methimazole",
        "B": "Propylthiouracil",
        "C": "Radioiodine therapy",
        "D": "Thyroidectomy"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's symptoms of anxiety, trouble with sleep, palpitations, and fatigue, along with a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland and thyroid bruits, the clinical presentation is highly suggestive of hyperthyroidism. The laboratory results confirm this diagnosis with a low TSH level (0.01 \u00b5U/mL) and elevated FT4 level, which is inappropriate for pregnancy. This is a classic presentation of Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism. The patient's pregnancy status complicates the management of hyperthyroidism, as certain medications can be teratogenic or affect fetal development. Radioiodine therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy due to the risk of radiation exposure to the fetus. Methimazole and propylthiouracil are commonly used antithyroid medications, but propylthiouracil is preferred in early pregnancy due to a lower risk of teratogenicity compared to methimazole. Therefore, the best treatment option for this patient is propylthiouracil.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
