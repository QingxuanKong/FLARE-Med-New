    "question": "A 37-year-old woman presents to your office with heartburn. Following an extensive workup, you diagnose her with a duodenal ulcer secondary to H. pylori infection. You prescribe triple therapy of omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of omeprazole?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Parasympathetic inhibition",
        "B": "Reversible block of H2 receptors",
        "C": "Inhibition of primary active transport",
        "D": "Inhibition of 50S ribosomal subunit"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break down the mechanism of action of omeprazole, which is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). PPIs are commonly used to treat conditions like duodenal ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The primary mechanism of action of PPIs involves the inhibition of the H+K+ ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cells in the stomach. This enzyme system is responsible for pumping hydrogen ions into the stomach lumen, creating an acidic environment. By inhibiting this enzyme, PPIs reduce gastric acid secretion, thereby providing relief from symptoms like heartburn and ulcers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
