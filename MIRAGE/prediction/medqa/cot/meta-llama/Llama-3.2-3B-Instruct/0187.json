    "question": "A 65-year-old man with metastatic lung cancer has been experiencing severe, unremitting pain. He has required escalating doses of oral morphine, but is now having dose limiting side-effects. His pain management team recommends using a medication that can reduce his opioid need through interaction with the NMDA-receptor. Which of the following was the most likely recommended agent?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Propofol",
        "B": "Ketamine",
        "C": "Fentanyl",
        "D": "Midazolam"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the mechanism of action of the options provided and their interaction with NMDA-receptors, which are involved in pain modulation. The patient is experiencing dose-limiting side effects from oral morphine, indicating the need for an alternative pain management strategy. The goal is to reduce opioid need through interaction with the NMDA-receptor, which can help manage chronic pain without increasing opioid dependence or side effects.\\n\\nNMDA-receptors are a type of glutamate receptor, and they play a role in pain perception and memory formation. Medications that interact with NMDA-receptors can enhance pain inhibition and reduce opioid consumption.\\n\\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\\n\\nA. Propofol: It is a general anesthetic agent that acts on the GABA receptor, not the NMDA receptor, making it an unlikely choice for pain management in this context.\\n\\nB. Ketamine: It is a non-competitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor, which blocks glutamate release and inhibits NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory neurotransmission. This action can lead to analgesia, making it a suitable choice for managing chronic pain, especially in patients who have developed tolerance to opioids.\\n\\nC. Fentanyl: It is a potent opioid agonist that works through the mu-opioid receptor, not the NMDA receptor, so it's unlikely to reduce opioid need through NMDA receptor interaction.\\n\\nD. Midazolam: It is a benzodiazepine that acts on the GABA receptor, not the NMDA receptor, and is primarily used for sedation and anxiolysis, not pain management.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the most likely recommended agent is ketamine, as it directly interacts with the NMDA receptor to produce analgesia and reduce opioid need in patients with chronic pain.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
