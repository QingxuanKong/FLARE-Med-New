    "question": "A male newborn born at 27 weeks' gestation is evaluated for rapid breathing and hypoxia shortly after birth. His mother had no prenatal care. Cardiopulmonary examination shows normal heart sounds, intercostal retractions, and nasal flaring. An x-ray of the chest shows low lung volumes, air bronchograms, and diffuse ground-glass opacities. He is started on nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Bilateral pleural effusions on lung ultrasound",
        "B": "Corkscrew-shaped organisms on umbilical cord culture",
        "C": "Hyaline membranes lining the alveoli on lung biopsy",
        "D": "Meconium-stained fluid on deep suctioning"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a premature newborn born at 27 weeks' gestation, which makes him susceptible to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The clinical presentation of rapid breathing, hypoxia, intercostal retractions, and nasal flaring is consistent with RDS. The chest x-ray findings of low lung volumes, air bronchograms, and diffuse ground-glass opacities also support this diagnosis. RDS is caused by a deficiency of surfactant in the lungs, which is a substance that reduces surface tension in the alveoli. Surfactant is produced by type II pneumocytes in the lungs and is essential for maintaining lung expansion and preventing alveolar collapse. Given the patient's prematurity and lack of prenatal care, it is likely that he has respiratory distress syndrome due to surfactant deficiency. The use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a standard treatment for RDS in premature infants. The options provided can be evaluated as follows: A. Bilateral pleural effusions on lung ultrasound would be more consistent with a different condition, such as hydrops fetalis or a pulmonary edema. B. Corkscrew-shaped organisms on umbilical cord culture would be indicative of Group B streptococcal infection, which is not directly related to the clinical presentation of RDS. C. Hyaline membranes lining the alveoli on lung biopsy are characteristic of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants. The hyaline membranes are a result of surfactant deficiency and are a hallmark of this condition. D. Meconium-stained fluid on deep suctioning would be more consistent with meconium aspiration syndrome, which is a different condition that can cause respiratory distress in newborns. However, the clinical presentation and chest x-ray findings in this case are more consistent with RDS rather than meconium aspiration syndrome. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient is hyaline membranes lining the alveoli on lung biopsy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",
