    "question": "A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his mother after being found lying unconscious next to a bottle of pills. The patient\u2019s mother mentions that he has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder 3 years ago for which he was taking a medication that resulted in only a slight improvement in his symptoms. She says he still found it difficult to concentrate on his studies and did not participate in any social events in college. He didn\u2019t have many friends and was often found sitting alone in his room. He has also threatened to take his life on several occasions, but she did not think he was serious. While recording his vital signs, the patient goes into a coma. His ECG shows a QT interval of 450 milliseconds. Which of the following medications did this patient most likely overdose on?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Bupropion",
        "B": "Sertraline",
        "C": "Venlafaxine",
        "D": "Clomipramine"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To determine the most likely medication the patient overdosed on, let's analyze the information provided step by step: 1. **Patient's History and Symptoms**: The patient has a history of major depressive disorder and has been taking medication for it, but it only resulted in slight improvement. He exhibits symptoms of social withdrawal, difficulty concentrating, and has made suicidal threats. This suggests that the patient has a history of treatment-resistant depression. 2. **Medication Side Effects and Toxicity**: The patient's ECG shows a QT interval of 450 milliseconds, which is significantly prolonged. A prolonged QT interval is a known side effect of certain medications, particularly those that affect the heart's electrical activity. 3. **Medication Options**: - **A. Bupropion**: Bupropion is an antidepressant that can cause QT interval prolongation, but it is less commonly associated with this side effect compared to other options. - **B. Sertraline**: Sertraline is an SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor), and while it can have various side effects, a prolonged QT interval is not commonly associated with its overdose. - **C. Venlafaxine**: Venlafaxine is a SNRI (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor). It is known to cause QT interval prolongation and has a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmias, especially in overdose situations. This makes it a likely candidate for causing the patient's symptoms and ECG findings. - **D. Clomipramine**: Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). While TCAs can cause QT interval prolongation, they are more commonly associated with other side effects, such as anticholinergic effects, and are less likely to cause the specific combination of symptoms and ECG findings described. Considering the information provided and the known side effects of the medications listed, the patient most likely overdosed on **Venlafaxine** due to its association with QT interval prolongation and the severity of the patient's symptoms and ECG findings. ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of treatment-resistant depression and the presence of a significantly prolonged QT interval on the ECG are key factors in determining the likely medication overdose.
