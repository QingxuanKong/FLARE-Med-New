    "question": "A 27-year-old woman was referred to a dermatology clinic due to a changing discoloration of her fingers from white to red to blue. Although she has not had any recent changes in her daily routines, she also complains of increasing fatigue, muscle weakness, and weight loss. She has a blood pressure of 126/77 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 14/min, and heart rate of 88/min. Physical examination reveals regular heart and lung sounds. Anti-U1 RNP antibodies and increased creatinine kinase were found in her serum. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Mixed connective tissue disease",
        "B": "Polymyositis",
        "C": "Systemic sclerosis",
        "D": "Rheumatoid arthritis"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a characteristic skin discoloration of her fingers, which is a classic symptom of Raynaud's phenomenon. The presence of anti-U1 RNP antibodies is a key finding, as it is commonly associated with Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD). MCTD is a autoimmune disorder that combines features of lupus, scleroderma, and polymyositis. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness, and weight loss are also consistent with MCTD. The elevated creatinine kinase level indicates muscle involvement, which is another characteristic feature of polymyositis. However, the presence of anti-U1 RNP antibodies and the overall clinical picture point more towards MCTD. Systemic sclerosis is characterized by skin thickening and fibrosis, which is not evident in this case. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the joints, but the patient's symptoms and lab findings do not suggest this diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
