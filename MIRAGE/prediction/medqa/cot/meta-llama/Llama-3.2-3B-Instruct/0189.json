    "question": "A 17-year-old woman presents to your office concerned that she has not had her menstrual period in 4 months. She states that menses began at age of 13 and has been regular until two months ago. She denies sexual activity, and urine pregnancy test is negative. On exam, she appears well-nourished with a BMI of 21 kg/m^2, but you note that she has enlarged cheeks bilaterally and has calluses on the dorsum of her hands. She says that she has been very stressed with school and has recently been binge eating. What other finding do you expect to see in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Malar rash",
        "B": "Increased blood glucose level",
        "C": "Erosion of tooth enamel",
        "D": "Elevated estrogen levels"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 4-month amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), which is a significant finding that warrants further evaluation. The patient's history of regular menstrual cycles until two months ago and denial of sexual activity make an organic cause such as pregnancy or hormonal imbalance less likely. The presence of enlarged cheeks bilaterally and calluses on the dorsum of her hands are suggestive of a psychological condition. The patient's recent stress with school and binge eating are also indicative of a psychological issue. The most likely diagnosis is bulimia nervosa, which is characterized by binge eating followed by purging behaviors to prevent weight gain. One of the common signs of bulimia nervosa is dental problems, specifically tooth erosion due to frequent vomiting. The erosion of tooth enamel can lead to sensitivity, pain, and discoloration of the teeth. The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and presentation. Malar rash is more commonly associated with autoimmune disorders such as lupus, increased blood glucose level is related to diabetes, and elevated estrogen levels are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
