    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to a surgeon with painless swelling over his right leg. He noticed the swelling 6 months ago, but he ignored it because it was painless. However, he is now concerned as the swelling has been increasing in size over the last 6 months. He also mentions that his father and brother have lipomas over the extremities. On physical examination, the swelling is well-circumscribed and non-tender, measuring approximately 4 x 5 cm. After evaluation, the surgeon performs a surgical resection of the tumor and sends the tissue for histopathological examination. The pathologist reports the tumor to be a liposarcoma rather than a lipoma. Which of the following enzymes is most likely to show increased activity in the cells of this patient\u2019s tumor?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Alkaline phosphatase",
        "B": "RNase",
        "C": "Superoxide dismutase",
        "D": "Telomerase"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's analyze the information provided step by step: 1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient presents with a painless swelling over his right leg that has been increasing in size over the last 6 months. This long-standing, painless growth raises suspicion for a benign tumor, such as a lipoma, given the family history of similar lesions. 2. **Family History**: The patient mentions that his father and brother have lipomas over the extremities. This family history increases the likelihood of a genetic predisposition to lipomas. 3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The swelling is well-circumscribed and non-tender, which is consistent with a lipoma. Lipomas are benign tumors composed of adipose tissue and are typically well-defined. 4. **Histopathological Diagnosis**: The pathologist reports the tumor to be a liposarcoma, not a lipoma. Liposarcoma is a malignant tumor of adipose tissue, which is a significant deviation from the initial diagnosis of lipoma. 5. **Understanding Liposarcomas**: Liposarcomas are malignant tumors that arise from the cells of adipose tissue. They are known to have various subtypes, each with distinct genetic and molecular characteristics. One of the hallmarks of liposarcomas, particularly the myxoid/round cell and well-differentiated liposarcomas, is the overexpression of telomerase. 6. **Analyzing the Options**: - A. Alkaline phosphatase: This enzyme is often elevated in various bone and liver conditions, not typically in liposarcomas. - B. RNase: This enzyme is involved in RNA degradation and is not specifically associated with liposarcomas. - C. Superoxide dismutase: This enzyme is involved in the detoxification of superoxide radicals and is not typically associated with liposarcomas. - D. Telomerase: As mentioned, telomerase is overexpressed in some subtypes of liposarcomas, particularly those that are myxoid/round cell and well-differentiated. Given the diagnosis of liposarcoma, the enzyme most likely to show increased activity in the cells of this patient\u2019s tumor is telomerase. ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key to solving this question lies in understanding the difference between lipomas and liposarcomas, as well as the characteristics of liposarcomas. The patient's family history and the physical examination findings initially suggested a lipoma, but the histopathological diagnosis of liposarcoma changed the approach. The critical clue is the overexpression of telomerase in certain subtypes of liposarcomas, which is not typically seen in lipomas.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"} ```",
