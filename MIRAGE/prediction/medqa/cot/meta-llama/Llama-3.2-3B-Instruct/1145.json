    "question": "A 33-year-old woman at 17-weeks gestation comes to the physician for evaluation of a painless mass in the right breast for the last 3 weeks that has not increased in size. Physical examination shows dense breasts and a 2.5-cm rubbery, mobile mass that is nontender in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. A biopsy of the mass shows rounded contour with overgrowth of fibrous and glandular tissue. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Fibroadenoma",
        "B": "Normal pregnancy-related changes",
        "C": "Fat necrosis",
        "D": "Phyllodes tumor"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the characteristics of the mass and the patient's presentation. The patient is a 33-year-old woman at 17 weeks of gestation, which is a time when breast tissue is known to undergo significant changes due to hormonal fluctuations. The mass is described as painless, rubbery, and mobile, which suggests a benign process. The fact that it has not increased in size over 3 weeks is also a good indicator of a benign lesion. The physical examination findings of dense breasts and the mass's location in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast are consistent with several breast conditions. However, the biopsy results show a mass with rounded contour and overgrowth of fibrous and glandular tissue, which is a characteristic finding in fibroadenomas. This, combined with the patient's age and the mass's characteristics, makes fibroadenoma a likely diagnosis. Normal pregnancy-related changes would typically present with diffuse breast tenderness and swelling, which is not the case here. Fat necrosis is a rare condition that usually presents with a palpable mass and is often associated with trauma or surgery, which is not mentioned in the scenario. Phyllodes tumors can present with a rapidly growing mass, which contradicts the fact that the mass has not increased in size over 3 weeks. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is fibroadenoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
