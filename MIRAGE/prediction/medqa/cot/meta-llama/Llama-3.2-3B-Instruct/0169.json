    "question": "An 8-year-old girl comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of hematuria. Two weeks ago, she had a sore throat that resolved without treatment. Physical examination shows 1+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles. Urinalysis shows numerous RBCs and 3+ proteinuria. Her antistreptolysin O titer is elevated. Formation of which of the following is most likely involved in the underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Antigen-specific IgE binding to mast cells",
        "B": "Tissue-specific antibodies",
        "C": "Antigen-antibody complexes",
        "D": "Presensitized CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the patient's symptoms and test results: 1. The patient is an 8-year-old girl presenting with hematuria (blood in the urine) and proteinuria (excess protein in the urine), which suggests a kidney issue. 2. She had a sore throat two weeks ago that resolved without treatment, and her antistreptolysin O titer is elevated. This suggests a recent streptococcal infection, possibly strep throat. 3. The physical examination shows 1+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles, which is consistent with nephrotic syndrome, a condition characterized by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia (low albumin levels), and edema. 4. Nephrotic syndrome can be caused by various mechanisms, but the presence of antistreptolysin O titer elevation and a recent streptococcal infection suggests a post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). Given these clues, let's evaluate the options: A. Antigen-specific IgE binding to mast cells: This is more related to allergic reactions, which is not directly related to the patient's symptoms. B. Tissue-specific antibodies: While antibodies can be involved in kidney damage, the specific context of a recent streptococcal infection and elevated antistreptolysin O titer points towards a different mechanism. C. Antigen-antibody complexes: This is a common mechanism in PSGN, where immune complexes formed between streptococcal antigens and antibodies against them deposit in the glomeruli, causing inflammation and damage. D. Presensitized CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells: While CD8+ T-cells can contribute to tissue damage, the primary mechanism in PSGN is not attributed to cytotoxic T-cells. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the formation of antigen-antibody complexes is most likely involved in the underlying mechanism of her symptoms.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
