    "question": "A 19-year-old female college soccer player presents to a sports medicine clinic with right knee pain. One day prior she twisted her right knee and felt a \u201cpop\u201d while chasing after a ball. She has since felt severe throbbing knee pain and noticed a rapid increase in swelling around her knee. She is able to bear weight but feels \u201cunstable\u201d on her right leg. On exam, anterior drawer and Lachman\u2019s tests are positive. The physician informs her that she has likely injured an important structure in her knee. What is the function of the structure that she has most likely injured?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Prevent excess posterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur",
        "B": "Prevent excess anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur",
        "C": "Resist excess valgus force on the knee",
        "D": "Provide a cushion between the lateral tibial and femoral condyles"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided: 1. **Mechanism of Injury**: The patient twisted her right knee while chasing after a ball, which indicates a traumatic injury. 2. **Symptoms**: Severe throbbing knee pain, rapid increase in swelling, and feeling \"unstable\" on her right leg. 3. **Physical Examination Findings**: Positive anterior drawer and Lachman's tests, which are specific tests used to assess the integrity of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Given these points, the most likely injury is an **Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury**. Now, let's consider the functions of the structures mentioned in the options: - **A. Prevent excess posterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur**: This is the primary function of the **Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL)**, not the ACL. - **B. Prevent excess anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur**: This is the primary function of the **Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL)**. - **C. Resist excess valgus force on the knee**: This is a function of the **Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL)**, not the ACL. - **D. Provide a cushion between the lateral tibial and femoral condyles**: This is a function of the **Menisci**, not the ACL. Therefore, the structure that the patient has most likely injured is the **Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL)**, which prevents excess anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur. Here's the answer in the required format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, particularly the positive Lachman's test, indicate an ACL injury. The ACL prevents excess anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur, which is the primary function of the injured structure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" } ```",
