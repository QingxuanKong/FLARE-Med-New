She now soaks one super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle. Her cycles have also become irregular, with intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months. She now experiences significant dysmenorrhea, requiring 400 mg ibuprofen every four hours for the majority of each menses.

The patient has a past medical history of obesity and type II diabetes on metformin. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. At this office visit, temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Globular 10-week sized uterus",
        "B": "Adnexal mass",
        "C": "Irregular 14-week sized uterus",
        "D": "No remarkable physical exam finding"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient is experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia, which suggests a possible uterine condition. The patient's history of obesity and type II diabetes on metformin is also relevant. The patient's symptoms have been ongoing for six months, and her cycles have become irregular, with intermenstrual bleeding. This pattern suggests a possible uterine condition that is causing her symptoms, such as adenomyosis, fibroids, or endometrial hyperplasia. The patient's age and parity also make uterine atony or a uterine septum less likely. The patient's symptoms of heavy bleeding and dysmenorrhea are more suggestive of a uterine condition. Given the patient's age and symptoms, the most likely physical exam finding would be an irregularly sized uterus. The patient's irregular bleeding and dysmenorrhea are consistent with a uterine condition such as adenomyosis or fibroids, which can cause an irregularly sized uterus. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Irregular 14-week sized uterus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
