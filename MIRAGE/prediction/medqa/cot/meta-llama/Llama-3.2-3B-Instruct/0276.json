    "question": "A 69-year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung carcinoma on chemotherapy presents to his oncologist for a follow-up visit. He has responded well to etoposide and cisplatin with plans to undergo radiation therapy. However, he reports that he recently developed multiple \u201cspots\u201d all over his body. He denies any overt bleeding from his gums or joint swelling. His past medical history is notable for iron deficiency anemia, osteoarthritis, and paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton syndrome. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, a rash is noted diffusely across the patient\u2019s trunk and bilateral upper and lower extremities.\n\nResults from a complete blood count are shown below:\nHemoglobin: 11.9 mg/dl\nHematocrit: 35%\nLeukocyte count: 5,000/mm^3\nPlatelet count: 20,000/mm^3\n\nThe oncologist would like to continue chemotherapy but is concerned that the above results will limit the optimal dose and frequency of the regimen. A recombinant version of which of the following is most appropriate in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Interleukin 2",
        "B": "Interleukin 8",
        "C": "Interleukin 11",
        "D": "Granulocyte colony stimulating factor"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) at 20,000/mm^3, which is a significant concern given his ongoing chemotherapy regimen. The patient's platelet count is likely compromised due to bone marrow suppression from the chemotherapy. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest that he is at risk for bleeding complications. The goal is to stimulate the production of platelets to safely continue chemotherapy. The most appropriate recombinant version of a growth factor to address this issue would be one that specifically stimulates megakaryocytes, which are the bone marrow cells responsible for producing platelets. This would be a recombinant form of a growth factor that mimics the action of thrombopoietin, which is a natural hormone that stimulates the production of platelets.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
