    "question": "A 62-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of right-sided back pain, nausea, and dark urine. He reports alternating episodes of decreased urine output followed by a temporary increase in urine output for the past 2 days. In the past year, he has had two urinary tract infections. He has Crohn disease and underwent a small bowel resection 5 years ago. He currently takes mesalamine and a multivitamin. His father had recurrent kidney stones. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows right costovertebral angle tenderness. Urinalysis shows 70 RBC/hpf and envelope-shaped crystals. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a 6-mm stone in the proximal right ureter and two 4-mm stones in the left kidney. Which of the following factors has most likely contributed most to this patient\u2019s current condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Parathyroid gland adenoma",
        "B": "Excess vitamin D",
        "C": "Malabsorption of fatty acids",
        "D": "High urine pH"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and physical examination: 1. The patient has a history of Crohn disease, which is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can cause malabsorption of nutrients, including fat-soluble vitamins. 2. The patient has a history of small bowel resection, which can lead to malabsorption of nutrients, including vitamin D. 3. The patient is taking a multivitamin, but it's unclear if it contains vitamin D. 4. The patient's father had recurrent kidney stones, which may indicate a genetic predisposition to stone formation. 5. The patient's symptoms of right-sided back pain, nausea, and dark urine, along with the presence of RBCs and envelope-shaped crystals in the urine, are consistent with a kidney stone. 6. The CT scan confirms the presence of a 6-mm stone in the proximal right ureter and two 4-mm stones in the left kidney. Considering these points, the most likely factor contributing to the patient's current condition is the malabsorption of vitamin D, which can lead to hypercalcemia (elevated calcium levels in the blood). Hypercalcemia can cause the formation of kidney stones, particularly calcium oxalate stones. The patient's Crohn disease and small bowel resection may have contributed to malabsorption of vitamin D, leading to hypercalcemia and subsequent stone formation. \", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
