    "question": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for evaluation of progressively worsening swelling around the eyes. He has no history of major medical illness. He had a sore throat and cough 2 weeks ago that resolved spontaneously. Physical examination shows moderate periorbital edema and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities bilaterally. A kidney biopsy specimen shows effacement of the podocytes on electron microscopy. Which of the following is most likely to be found on urinalysis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Hyaline casts and immunoglobulins",
        "B": "Fatty casts and albumin",
        "C": "White blood cell casts and eosinophils",
        "D": "Granular casts and tubular epithelial cells"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the given clinical scenario and laboratory findings. The patient is a 7-year-old boy with progressively worsening swelling around the eyes, which is indicative of edema. The patient also has a history of a recent respiratory infection, which could be related to the current condition. The physical examination shows moderate periorbital edema and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities, suggesting fluid retention and possible nephrotic syndrome. The kidney biopsy specimen shows effacement of the podocytes on electron microscopy, which is a hallmark of minimal change disease (MCD). MCD is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema. The urinalysis in nephrotic syndrome typically shows proteinuria, which can manifest as various types of casts. The options provided are: A. Hyaline casts and immunoglobulins: Hyaline casts are common in normal urine but not specific to nephrotic syndrome. Immunoglobulins can be present in the urine in various conditions, but they are not a specific marker for nephrotic syndrome. B. Fatty casts and albumin: Fatty casts are a specific finding in nephrotic syndrome, as the loss of albumin in the urine leads to the presence of fatty casts. This option is consistent with the diagnosis of minimal change disease. C. White blood cell casts and eosinophils: White blood cell casts are typically seen in pyelonephritis or interstitial nephritis, and eosinophils are not a common finding in nephrotic syndrome. D. Granular casts and tubular epithelial cells: Granular casts can be seen in various conditions, including acute tubular necrosis and interstitial nephritis, but they are not specific to nephrotic syndrome. Based on the clinical presentation and biopsy findings, the most likely urinalysis finding in this patient is proteinuria, which is consistent with option B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
