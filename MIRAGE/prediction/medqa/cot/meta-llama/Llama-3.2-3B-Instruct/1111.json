    "question": "A 3-year-old boy presents with episodic diarrhea with malodorous stools, stunted growth, occasional abdominal cramps, and an itchy rash. His mother says that these symptoms developed approximately 2 years ago. The patient was exclusively breastfed up to the age of 7 months. Supplementary feeding was started with non-starchy vegetable followed by starchy vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, and bread. Bread and cookies were the last product to be introduced at the age of 12 months. The patient\u2019s mother tried to withdraw dairy products from the patient\u2019s diet because she heard that lactose can cause such symptoms, but it did not help. The patient\u2019s vital signs include: blood pressure 90/55 mm Hg, heart rate 101/min, respiratory rate 19/min, and temperature 36.3\u2103 (97.3\u2109). His weight is 11 kg (24.2 lb, -2 SD) and height is 90 cm (2 ft 11 in, -1 SD). On physical examination, the patient\u2019s skin is pale with a papulovesicular rash on his abdomen and back. There are a few aphthous ulcers in the oral cavity. The abdomen is distended but no tenderness to palpation. No hepatosplenomegaly. An immunological assay is performed and shows positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies. Which of the following changes would you most likely expect to see on intestinal biopsy in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Granulomas in the submucous tissue",
        "B": "Crypt abscesses",
        "C": "Villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy",
        "D": "Villous hyperplasia"

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and physical examination: 1. **Symptoms**: Episodic diarrhea with malodorous stools, stunted growth, occasional abdominal cramps, and an itchy rash. These symptoms have been ongoing for approximately 2 years. 2. **Dietary History**: The patient was exclusively breastfed up to 7 months, followed by a gradual introduction of non-starchy vegetables, starchy vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, and bread. Dairy products were introduced at 12 months, but the patient's symptoms persisted. 3. **Symptom persistence despite dietary changes**: The patient's mother attempted to withdraw dairy products, which did not improve symptoms. 4. **Vital signs and physical examination findings**: * Pale skin * Papulovesicular rash on the abdomen and back * Aphthous ulcers in the oral cavity * Distended abdomen without tenderness * No hepatosplenomegaly 5. **Immunological assay results**: Positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies. Given these findings, the patient's symptoms and test results are highly suggestive of **Celiac Disease** (also known as Celiac Sprue). Celiac Disease is an autoimmune disorder that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals, triggered by the ingestion of gluten. The immune response damages the small intestine's lining, leading to malabsorption of nutrients. **Expected findings on intestinal biopsy in Celiac Disease:** The hallmark of Celiac Disease is **villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy**. This is due to the immune response to gluten, which causes inflammation and damage to the villi, leading to their flattening (atrophy) and the proliferation of crypts (hypertrophy). This damage impairs the absorption of nutrients, resulting in malabsorption and symptoms like those described. Therefore, the correct answer is: ``` {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and test results are consistent with Celiac Disease, and villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy are the characteristic changes expected in this condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"} ```",
