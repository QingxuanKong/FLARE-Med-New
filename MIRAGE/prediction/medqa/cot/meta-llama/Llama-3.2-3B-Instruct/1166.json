    "question": "A 15-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because of worsening grades over the past year. Since she started high school one year ago, her academic performance has decreased. She also has had difficulty finding friends at the new school. She is afraid that her classmates will make fun of her and think that she is \u201cstupid.\u201d One month ago, when she had to give a presentation, she could not stop wondering how her classmates were going to react if she said something wrong. During the presentation, her heart started racing and she became flushed. Since this event, she avoids saying anything in class. She spends her breaks in the restroom because she is worried that nobody will talk to her. Physical and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, the girl avoids eye contact and appears uncomfortable and anxious. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Clomipramine",
        "B": "Phenelzine",
        "C": "Fluoxetine",
        "D": "Propranolol"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms step by step: 1. **Identify the key symptoms**: The patient is experiencing anxiety and social avoidance due to fear of social rejection and ridicule. She has also developed physical symptoms such as a racing heart and flushing during a presentation. 2. **Consider potential diagnoses**: Based on the symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is Social Anxiety Disorder (also known as Social Phobia). Social Anxiety Disorder is characterized by excessive and persistent fear or anxiety in social situations, leading to avoidance of such situations. 3. **Assess the need for pharmacotherapy**: Given the diagnosis, pharmacotherapy is often considered as a first-line treatment option for Social Anxiety Disorder. 4. **Evaluate the options**: - A. Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) primarily used to treat Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and some other anxiety disorders. While it can be used for social anxiety, it's not the first-line treatment. - B. Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) primarily used to treat depression and some anxiety disorders. It's not typically used as a first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder. - C. Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which is a commonly used first-line treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder due to its efficacy and relatively favorable side effect profile. - D. Propranolol is a beta-blocker primarily used to treat hypertension and certain heart conditions. While it can be used to alleviate physical symptoms of anxiety, it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder. 5. **Choose the most appropriate answer**: Based on the analysis, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition is Fluoxetine, as it is a commonly used and effective treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder. Here is the final answer in the requested format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms suggest Social Anxiety Disorder, and the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this condition is Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
