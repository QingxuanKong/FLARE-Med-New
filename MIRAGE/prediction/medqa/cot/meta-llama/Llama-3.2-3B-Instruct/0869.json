    "question": "In a small town with a population of 10,000 people, the prevalence of alcohol use is estimated to be 30%. A study is done with a null hypothesis that there is no association between alcohol use and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The data obtained shows, of the 200 alcoholics who were followed-up, 30 developed GERD; and out of the 400 non-alcoholics, 30 developed GERD. What fraction of GERD can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed in this town?",
    "options": {
        "A": "45/195",
        "B": "30/400",
        "C": "(30/200) / (30/400)",
        "D": "30/200"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of relative risk (RR) and how it relates to the fraction of GERD that can be prevented. Step 1: Calculate the risk of developing GERD in alcoholics and non-alcoholics. - Risk of developing GERD in alcoholics = Number of alcoholics with GERD / Total number of alcoholics = 30/200 = 0.15 - Risk of developing GERD in non-alcoholics = Number of non-alcoholics with GERD / Total number of non-alcoholics = 30/400 = 0.075 Step 2: Calculate the relative risk (RR) of developing GERD in alcoholics compared to non-alcoholics. - RR = Risk in alcoholics / Risk in non-alcoholics = 0.15 / 0.075 = 2 Step 3: Calculate the risk of developing GERD in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed. - Since the null hypothesis states there is no association, we assume the risk in non-alcoholics is the same as the overall population, which is 30% or 0.3. Step 4: Calculate the fraction of GERD that can be prevented. - Since the relative risk is 2, this means that for every 2 people who would develop GERD in the general population, 1 would develop it if they were alcoholics. Therefore, if we remove alcohol consumption, the risk in non-alcoholics would decrease by half. - Fraction of GERD that can be prevented = (Risk in non-alcoholics - Risk in alcoholics) / Risk in non-alcoholics = (0.3 - 0.15) / 0.3 = 0.15 / 0.3 = 0.5 To express this as a fraction, we simplify 0.5 to 1/2. Now, let's convert this into the format you requested: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we calculated the risk of developing GERD in alcoholics and non-alcoholics, then the relative risk, and finally the fraction of GERD that can be prevented by removing alcohol consumption. We found that 1/2 of the GERD cases can be prevented.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"} ``` The correct answer is C.",
