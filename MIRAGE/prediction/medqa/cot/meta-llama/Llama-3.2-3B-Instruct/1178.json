    "question": "A 6-year-old Russian boy who recently immigrated to the United States presents to your office with fever and dyspnea. On examination of the oropharynx, you note a grayish-white pseudomembrane and uneven elevation of the soft palate. The patient displays marked enlargement of the cervical lymph nodes. Which of the following describes the organism responsible for this patient's disease?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Yeast with pseudohyphae",
        "B": "Gram-positive bacteria producing exotoxin that acts via ADP ribosylation",
        "C": "Gram-positive cocci with hyaluronic acid capsule",
        "D": "Gram-negative encapsulated bacteria producing IgA protease"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. **Symptoms and Signs**: The patient presents with fever, dyspnea, a grayish-white pseudomembrane, uneven elevation of the soft palate, and marked enlargement of the cervical lymph nodes. These symptoms are highly suggestive of diphtheria, a bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. 2. **Common Causes and Associations**: Diphtheria is typically caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a Gram-positive, non-motile, rod-shaped bacterium. It is known for producing a toxin that causes the characteristic pseudomembrane formation, which can lead to respiratory and cardiac complications if left untreated. 3. **Analyzing the Options**: - A. Yeast with pseudohyphae: This is characteristic of fungal infections like candidiasis, which does not match the symptoms described. - B. Gram-positive bacteria producing exotoxin that acts via ADP ribosylation: This describes the mechanism of action of diphtheria toxin, which is produced by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, making this the most likely correct answer. - C. Gram-positive cocci with hyaluronic acid capsule: This describes the characteristics of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a different type of bacteria that causes pneumonia and other infections, not diphtheria. - D. Gram-negative encapsulated bacteria producing IgA protease: This describes Neisseria species, which can cause infections like meningitis and gonorrhea, not diphtheria. **Answer Choice**: B. Gram-positive bacteria producing exotoxin that acts via ADP ribosylation.",
