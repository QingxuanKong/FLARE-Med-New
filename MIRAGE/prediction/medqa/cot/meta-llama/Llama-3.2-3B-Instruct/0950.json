    "question": "An investigator is studying cellular regeneration of epithelial cells. She has obtained a tissue sample from a normal thyroid gland for histopathologic examination. It shows follicles lined by a single layer of cube-like cells with large central nuclei. Which of the following parts of the female reproductive tract is also lined by this type of epithelium?",

        "A": "Ovaries",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the given information and the options provided. The investigator is studying cellular regeneration of epithelial cells in a normal thyroid gland, and the tissue sample shows follicles lined by a single layer of cube-like cells with large central nuclei. This description is characteristic of follicular cells in the thyroid gland, which are responsible for producing thyroid hormones. The thyroid gland is part of the endocrine system and is not directly related to the female reproductive tract. However, the question asks which part of the female reproductive tract is also lined by this type of epithelium. The female reproductive tract consists of the vagina, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and vulva. We need to identify which of these structures is also lined by follicles similar to those in the thyroid gland. The fallopian tubes are known to be lined by ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, the vagina is lined by stratified squamous epithelium, and the vulva is lined by stratified squamous epithelium as well. However, the ovaries are known to be lined by follicles that are similar to the follicles in the thyroid gland, which are also lined by a single layer of cube-like cells with large central nuclei. Therefore, the correct answer is the ovaries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
