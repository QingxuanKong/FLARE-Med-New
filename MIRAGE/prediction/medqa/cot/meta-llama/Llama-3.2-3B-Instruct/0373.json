    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to the physician because of a 1-day history of progressive pain and blurry vision in his right eye. He is struggling to open this eye because of the pain. His left eye is asymptomatic. He wears contact lenses. He has bronchial asthma treated with inhaled salbutamol. He works as a kindergarten teacher. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 85/min, and blood pressure 135/75 mm Hg. The examination shows a visual acuity in the left eye of 20/25 and the ability to count fingers at 3 feet in the right eye. A photograph of the right eye is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Angle-closure glaucoma",
        "B": "Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis",
        "C": "Herpes simplex keratitis",
        "D": "Pseudomonas keratitis"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the patient's presentation and history: 1. **Progressive pain and blurry vision in one eye**: This suggests an acute condition rather than a chronic or subacute process. 2. **Inability to open the eye due to pain**: This indicates severe ocular pain, which is a red flag symptom. 3. **Asymptomatic left eye**: This suggests that the condition is localized to the right eye. 4. **Contact lens use**: This increases the risk of certain types of eye infections, such as keratitis. 5. **Bronchial asthma**: Asthmatics are more prone to certain infections, including those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 6. **Vital signs are relatively normal**: The patient's temperature, pulse, and blood pressure are within normal limits, which suggests that the condition is not severely systemic. Considering these points, let's evaluate the options: - **Angle-closure glaucoma (A)**: This condition typically presents with severe eye pain, blurred vision, and a history of angle closure, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. - **Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (B)**: This condition usually presents with a history of exposure to a viral infection, such as adenovirus, and is not typically associated with severe ocular pain. - **Herpes simplex keratitis (C)**: This condition can cause severe ocular pain, but it usually presents with a history of herpes simplex virus exposure, and the patient's history does not mention this. - **Pseudomonas keratitis (D)**: This condition is a common complication of contact lens wear, especially in asthmatics, and can cause severe ocular pain, blurred vision, and a history of contact lens use. The patient's history of asthma and contact lens use make this a likely diagnosis. Given the patient's symptoms, history, and risk factors, the most likely diagnosis is **Pseudomonas keratitis**.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
