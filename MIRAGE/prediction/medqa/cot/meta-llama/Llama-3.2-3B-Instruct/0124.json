    "question": "A obstetrician is working in a developing country to help promote maternal health and fetal well being. While there, he delivers a baby who he suspects has congenital hypothyroidism, most likely caused by inadequate maternal iodine intake. Which of the following signs and symptoms would NOT be expected to be observed in this child?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Hypotonia",
        "B": "Diarrhea",
        "C": "Umbilical hernia",
        "D": "Macroglossia"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to understand the effects of congenital hypothyroidism on a newborn, particularly in the context of inadequate maternal iodine intake. Congenital hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones, which are essential for growth and development. Iodine is a crucial component of thyroid hormones, and its deficiency can lead to hypothyroidism. Let's analyze each option: A. Hypotonia: This refers to low muscle tone, which is a common symptom of congenital hypothyroidism. Iodine deficiency can affect the development of the nervous system, leading to muscle weakness and hypotonia. B. Diarrhea: While diarrhea can be a symptom of various conditions, it is not a typical symptom of congenital hypothyroidism. However, it's essential to consider that iodine deficiency can also affect the gastrointestinal system, potentially leading to gastrointestinal issues, but diarrhea is not a primary symptom associated with congenital hypothyroidism. C. Umbilical hernia: This is a possible complication of congenital hypothyroidism. The condition can affect the development of the abdominal wall, leading to hernias. D. Macroglossia: This refers to an enlarged tongue, which can be a symptom of congenital hypothyroidism. Iodine deficiency can affect the development of the thyroid gland and other tissues, potentially leading to an enlarged tongue. Considering these points, the correct answer is B. Diarrhea, as it is not a typical symptom of congenital hypothyroidism, whereas the other options are more directly related to the condition.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
