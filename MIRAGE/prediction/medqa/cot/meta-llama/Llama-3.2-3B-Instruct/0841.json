    "question": "On routine screening, a 62-year-old man is found to have positive fecal occult blood tests. He is asymptomatic, but his father died of large intestinal cancer. Abdominal and rectal exams are normal. A colonoscopy subsequently reveals a polyp in the descending colon but no other abnormalities. Excisional biopsy of the polyp shows 75% tubular architecture. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Inflammatory polyp",
        "B": "Adenomatous polyp",
        "C": "Hamartomatous polyp",
        "D": "Colorectal cancer"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the given information and the characteristics of each type of polyp mentioned in the options.\\n\\nThe patient is a 62-year-old man with a family history of large intestinal cancer, which increases his risk for colorectal cancer. He is asymptomatic, but the fecal occult blood test is positive, indicating the presence of blood in the stool, which can be a sign of polyp or cancer.\\n\\nThe colonoscopy reveals a polyp in the descending colon, but no other abnormalities are found. The excisional biopsy of the polyp shows 75% tubular architecture.\\n\\nNow, let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. Inflammatory polyp: These polyps are typically associated with chronic inflammation and are usually found in the rectum. The patient's colonoscopy did not reveal any other abnormalities, and there is no mention of inflammatory bowel disease, making this option less likely.\\n\\nB. Adenomatous polyp: These polyps have a higher potential to become malignant over time and are characterized by tubular architecture. The patient's family history of colorectal cancer and the presence of a polyp with 75% tubular architecture make this option the most likely diagnosis.\\n\\nC. Hamartomatous polyp: These polyps are typically found in juvenile polyposis syndrome and are usually found in the rectum. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms make this option less likely.\\n\\nD. Colorectal cancer: While the patient's family history increases his risk, the colonoscopy did not reveal any other abnormalities, and the biopsy of the polyp shows 75% tubular architecture, which is not typical of invasive cancer.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is B. Adenomatous polyp.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
