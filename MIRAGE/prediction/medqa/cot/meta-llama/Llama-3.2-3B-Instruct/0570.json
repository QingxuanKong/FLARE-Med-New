    "question": "A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of pain in his right knee for the past week. The pain is exacerbated by jogging and climbing up stairs. He has no history of trauma to the knee. He is otherwise healthy. He is an active member of his school's gymnastics team. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the right knee shows a tender swelling at the proximal tibia; range of motion is full. Knee extension against resistance causes pain in the anterior proximal tibia. The remainder of the examinations shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the right knee shows anterior tibial soft tissue swelling with fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Administration of oral ketorolac",
        "B": "Perform joint aspiration",
        "C": "Open reduction of the tuberosity",
        "D": "Application of a lower leg cast\n\""
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this case, let's break down the key information provided: 1. The patient is a 13-year-old boy with pain in his right knee that worsens with activities like jogging and climbing stairs, but has no history of trauma. This suggests a non-traumatic cause for the pain. 2. The patient is an active member of his school's gymnastics team, which increases the likelihood of a stress-related injury. 3. The examination findings of a tender swelling at the proximal tibia, full range of motion, and pain in knee extension against resistance point towards a specific location of pain and indicate a possible issue with the patellofemoral joint. 4. The X-ray findings of anterior tibial soft tissue swelling and fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity are highly suggestive of Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD), a common overuse injury in adolescents, particularly in active youth sports participants. 5. Considering the diagnosis of OSD, the most appropriate next step would be to confirm the diagnosis with a joint aspiration to rule out other possible causes of pain and to assess for any effusion. 6. Administration of oral ketorolac (A) may be considered for pain management, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic process. 7. Open reduction of the tuberosity (C) is not indicated in OSD, as it is a non-surgical condition that typically resolves with rest, physical therapy, and sometimes, orthotics. 8. Application of a lower leg cast (D) is not necessary, as OSD is a non-displaced fracture and does not require immobilization. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform a joint aspiration (B) to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of the pain and swelling.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
