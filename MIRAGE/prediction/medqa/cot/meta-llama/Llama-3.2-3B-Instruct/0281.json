    "question": "A 75-year-old man presents to a medical clinic for evaluation of a large, tense, pruritic bulla on his inner thighs, abdomen, and lower abdomen. A skin biopsy is performed, which shows an epidermal basement membrane with immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and linear immunofluorescence. Which of the following is the most likely cell junction to which the antibodies bind?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Desmosomes",
        "B": "Gap junctions",
        "C": "Hemidesmosomes",
        "D": "Tight junctions"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to understand the clinical presentation and the histopathological findings. The patient presents with a large, tense, pruritic bulla on his inner thighs, abdomen, and lower abdomen. This presentation is suggestive of bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune disease characterized by the formation of blisters on the skin. The presence of IgG antibodies in the epidermal basement membrane is a hallmark of this disease. In bullous pemphigoid, the autoantibodies target proteins that are involved in the attachment of the epidermis to the dermis. The basement membrane zone is the site where the epidermis and dermis meet. The main cell junctions in this zone are hemidesmosomes, which are involved in the attachment of the epidermis to the dermis. Therefore, the antibodies in bullous pemphigoid are likely to bind to hemidesmosomes, which are the most likely cell junction to be targeted in this disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
