    "question": "A 51-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of malaise. He returned from a research trip to Madagascar 2 weeks ago and has since developed a worsening fever with a maximum temperature of 102.2\u00b0F (39\u00b0C). He also reports some swelling around his neck and groin. He works as a zoologist and was in rural Madagascar studying a rare species of lemur. His past medical history is notable for hypertension and gout. He takes lisinopril and allopurinol. His temperature is 101.9\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 145/85 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 22/min. On exam, he has painful erythematous cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. Black hemorrhagic eschars are noted on his fingertips bilaterally. The pathogen responsible for this patient\u2019s condition produces a virulence factor that has which of the following functions?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Cleave immunoglobulin",
        "B": "Inhibit phagocytosis",
        "C": "Inhibit ribosomal function",
        "D": "Trigger widespread inflammation"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step: 1. **Patient's symptoms and history**: The patient has a fever, swelling around the neck and groin, painful erythematous lymphadenopathy, and black hemorrhagic eschars on his fingertips. These symptoms are highly suggestive of a zoonotic infection, given his occupation as a zoologist and recent travel to Madagascar. 2. **Geographic location**: Madagascar is known for its diverse wildlife, including lemurs, some of which can carry diseases. This raises the suspicion of a zoonotic infection. 3. **Symptoms and signs**: The presence of black hemorrhagic eschars is particularly indicative of certain diseases, such as anthrax. 4. **Differential diagnoses**: Based on the symptoms and history, one of the potential diagnoses could be anthrax, which is a zoonotic infection caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. 5. **Virulence factors of Bacillus anthracis**: The key virulence factor of B. anthracis is the anthrax toxin, which is composed of three components: lethal factor (LF), edema factor (EF), and protective antigen (PA). The lethal factor (LF) inhibits ribosomal function, which is essential for protein synthesis in host cells. Given this analysis, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the patient's symptoms, history, and the geographic location, the most likely diagnosis is anthrax. The virulence factor responsible for this condition is the lethal factor (LF) of Bacillus anthracis, which inhibits ribosomal function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
