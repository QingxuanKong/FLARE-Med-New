    "question": "A 68-year-old female presents to her primary care physician with a 7-month history of fatigue and low back pain. Her pain is not improved by over the counter analgesics. Laboratory analysis is notable for a calcium level of 11.5 mg/dL, creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen level of 30 mg/dL. Large eosinophilic casts are seen on renal biopsy. Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen on peripheral blood smear?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Abundant reticulocytes",
        "B": "Linear aggregations of red blood cells",
        "C": "Schistocytes",
        "D": "Leukocytosis with abundant mature myeloid cells"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with fatigue, low back pain, and laboratory findings of elevated calcium, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels, which suggest chronic kidney disease. The presence of large eosinophilic casts on renal biopsy is indicative of a glomerular disease, specifically a type of kidney damage that affects the glomeruli. The most common glomerular disease associated with these findings is IgA nephropathy, also known as Berger's disease. This condition is characterized by the deposition of IgA antibodies in the glomeruli, leading to inflammation and damage. A hallmark feature of IgA nephropathy is the presence of hemolytic anemia, which is often seen on peripheral blood smear. The presence of schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells) is a characteristic finding in hemolytic anemia, making option C the most likely answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
