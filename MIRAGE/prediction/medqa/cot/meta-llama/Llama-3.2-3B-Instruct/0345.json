    "question": "A 52-year-old man comes to the physician because of generalized pruritus and raised, erythematous plaques on the skin over his hands, chest, and legs for 6 hours. He reports having clear liquid discharge from his nose and sneezing. He says that his symptoms began suddenly the previous night, 30 minutes after he had dinner at a seafood restaurant. He has had similar symptoms occasionally in the past as well. Four months ago, he had an episode of narrow-angle glaucoma. He takes no medications. His vital signs are within normal limits. Nasal exam shows clear, serous secretions, with edematous and erythematous mucosa and turbinates. Paranasal sinuses are not tender to palpation. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Diphenhydramine",
        "B": "Fexofenadine",
        "C": "Vitamin K",
        "D": "Calamine lotion"

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this case, we need to consider the symptoms and signs presented by the patient. The patient has generalized pruritus, raised, erythematous plaques on the skin, and clear liquid discharge from his nose, which started suddenly after eating seafood. He also has a history of narrow-angle glaucoma. The key points to consider are: 1. The sudden onset of symptoms after eating seafood, which suggests an allergic reaction. 2. The presence of clear liquid discharge from the nose and erythematous mucosa in the nasal exam, which points towards an allergic rhinitis. 3. The patient's history of narrow-angle glaucoma, which is a contraindication for antihistamines, as they can cause pupillary dilation. Given these considerations, we need to choose a medication that can effectively treat the allergic reaction without exacerbating the patient's narrow-angle glaucoma. Option A, Diphenhydramine, is an antihistamine that can cross the blood-eye barrier and cause pupillary dilation, which is contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Option B, Fexofenadine, is a non-sedating antihistamine that is less likely to cause pupillary dilation and is a good option for patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Option C, Vitamin K, is not relevant to the treatment of allergic reactions or allergic rhinitis. Option D, Calamine lotion, is a topical treatment for skin itching and irritation, but it does not address the underlying cause of the allergic reaction. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is Fexofenadine, which can effectively treat the allergic reaction without exacerbating the patient's narrow-angle glaucoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
