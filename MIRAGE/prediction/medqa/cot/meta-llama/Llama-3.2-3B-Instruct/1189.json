    "question": "A 28-year-old male presents with a recent onset of upsetting dreams, anxiety, and disturbing flashbacks. The patient reports that he returned from active duty in Iraq 3 months ago and was adjusting to life back at home until about 7 weeks ago when he began having intense fear of loud noises and seeing sudden flashbacks to bombing attacks he endured during his time in Iraq. He had to take a leave from his army instructor duties as he was not able to handle the familiar settings of practice shooting ranges and sudden loud explosions during battalion training. After refusing to leave his house, he was finally persuaded by his wife to visit your clinic. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Acute stress disorder",
        "B": "Performance anxiety",
        "C": "Posttraumatic stress disorder",
        "D": "Panic attack"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and history. The patient has a history of experiencing traumatic events during his time in Iraq, which is a significant factor in this case. He is now experiencing symptoms such as intense fear of loud noises, disturbing flashbacks, and anxiety. These symptoms have developed after returning home from his deployment, which suggests a possible link to the traumatic event. The patient's symptoms have been present for about 7 weeks, which is a relatively short period. This duration is consistent with acute stress disorder (ASD), but it's also possible that the symptoms could be part of a more chronic condition. The patient's inability to handle familiar settings that remind him of the traumatic event, such as shooting ranges and explosions during training, further supports the idea that his symptoms are related to the traumatic event. The patient's refusal to leave his house and his need for persuasion from his wife to seek medical attention also indicates that his symptoms are severe enough to impact his daily life and relationships. Considering these factors, the most likely diagnosis is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is a condition characterized by the development of symptoms after a traumatic event, such as combat, and can include symptoms of flashbacks, anxiety, and avoidance of triggers. The other options are less likely: * Performance anxiety (B) is a type of anxiety disorder that is related to specific performance situations, but it does not typically involve flashbacks or avoidance of triggers. * Acute stress disorder (A) is a short-term condition that typically lasts for up to 4 weeks, which is shorter than the duration of the patient's symptoms. * Panic attack (D) is a short-term episode of intense anxiety that is not typically characterized by flashbacks or avoidance of triggers. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is C. Posttraumatic stress disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
