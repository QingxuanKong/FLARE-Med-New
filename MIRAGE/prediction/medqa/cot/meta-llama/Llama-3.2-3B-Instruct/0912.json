    "question": "A 37-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician after returning from her honeymoon in Cancun. A few days ago, she began to notice an eruption of small red bumps that cover her torso, back, and buttocks. The patient first thought she had acne, but became worried when the rash continued to itch. The patient denies other symptoms. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical exam is notable for red papules and pustules scattered across the trunk, abdomen, back, and buttocks, while sparing the limbs. Closer examination indicates inflammation of the hair follicles. Culture yields motile, gram-negative rods that are non-lactose fermenting and oxidase positive. What other finding is commonly observed in the culture of the most likely organism?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Pink colonies",
        "B": "Blue-green pigment",
        "C": "Yellow sulfur granules",
        "D": "Red pigment"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break down the information provided: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with a rash characterized by small red bumps (papules and pustules) on the torso, back, and buttocks, with inflammation of the hair follicles. This presentation is suggestive of folliculitis, which is an inflammation of the hair follicles. 2. **Denial of other symptoms**: The patient denies other symptoms, which makes it less likely that the condition is a systemic infection or a more severe dermatological condition. 3. **Vital signs and physical exam**: Vital signs are within normal limits, and the physical exam is notable for the rash on the trunk, abdomen, back, and buttocks. The sparing of the limbs suggests a localized condition. 4. **Culture results**: The culture yields motile, gram-negative rods that are non-lactose fermenting and oxidase positive. This is a key piece of information, as it narrows down the possible organisms. Given the gram-negative rods and the oxidase positive result, the most likely organism is *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is a common cause of folliculitis, particularly in individuals who have been in warm, moist environments (such as a tropical vacation). The organism is known for its ability to cause infections in the skin, especially in areas with high humidity and temperature, such as the groin and armpits. Now, considering the culture findings, the answer to the question is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The clinical presentation and culture results are consistent with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, which is known to produce yellow sulfur granules in its culture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
