    "question": "A 26-year-old man comes to the physician for episodic fever, recurrent night sweats, and a 6-kg (14.2-lb) weight loss over the past 2 months. He reports that the fever lasts for 7 to 10 days, then subsides completely for about a week before returning again. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Physical examination shows nontender cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. An x-ray of the chest shows bilateral mediastinal masses. Resection of a cervical lymph node is performed. A photomicrograph of the resected specimen is shown. Further histopathological examination is most likely to show which of the following findings?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30",
        "B": "Cells with BCR-ABL rearrangement",
        "C": "Cells overexpressing Bcl-2",
        "D": "Cells with t(8;14) chromosomal translocation"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with episodic fever, recurrent night sweats, and significant weight loss over a short period. These symptoms are classic for an infectious or malignant process. 2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The presence of nontender cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy suggests a lymphoproliferative disorder, as these areas are commonly involved in such conditions. 3. **Chest X-ray Findings**: Bilateral mediastinal masses are indicative of a mediastinal mass, which can be associated with lymphomas, neurogenic tumors, or other pathologies. 4. **Surgical Intervention**: The resection of a cervical lymph node suggests that the condition is localized and can be surgically managed. 5. **Histopathological Examination**: Given the clinical presentation and the fact that a lymph node was resected, the most likely diagnosis is a type of lymphoma. Now, let's consider the options: - **A. Cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30**: This is characteristic of Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL). The presence of these markers is a hallmark of this disease. - **B. Cells with BCR-ABL rearrangement**: This is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and is not typically associated with the clinical presentation described. - **C. Cells overexpressing Bcl-2**: This is characteristic of follicular lymphoma, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). However, the clinical presentation and the presence of mediastinal masses are more suggestive of Hodgkin lymphoma. - **D. Cells with t(8;14) chromosomal translocation**: This is characteristic of Burkitt lymphoma, another type of NHL. However, the clinical presentation and the mediastinal masses are more suggestive of classical Hodgkin lymphoma. **Conclusion**: Given the clinical presentation of episodic fever, recurrent night sweats, significant weight loss, nontender cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, and bilateral mediastinal masses, the most likely diagnosis is classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Therefore, the histopathological examination is most likely to show cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30. **JSON Output**: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's clinical presentation, including episodic fever, recurrent night sweats, significant weight loss, nontender cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, and bilateral mediastinal masses, is most suggestive of classical Hodgkin lymphoma.
