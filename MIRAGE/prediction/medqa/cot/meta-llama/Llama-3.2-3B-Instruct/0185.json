    "question": "A previously healthy 18-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for evaluation of an abdominal mass noticed a few days ago. He appears markedly pale and lethargic. Examination shows a 6-cm, nonmobile mass in the left upper quadrant that crosses the midline. 24-hour urine collection shows elevated homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid. Further evaluation including biopsy confirms the diagnosis of intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. The physician recommends the established standard treatment, which is initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection, if possible. After a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of chemotherapy, the likelihood of unresectability without neoadjuvant treatment, and the prognosis without it, the patient's parents steadily refuse chemotherapy because they do not want their son to suffer the side effects. They prefer to take their son home for supportive care only. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Help the parents to arrange supportive care at home",
        "B": "Refer the patient to another oncologist",
        "C": "Recommend for parents to take 2 weeks to think about decision",
        "D": "Seek a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "**Step-by-Step Thinking:** 1. The patient is diagnosed with intermediate-risk neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that requires prompt treatment to improve survival rates and reduce the risk of complications. 2. The standard treatment for neuroblastoma is neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection, if possible. This approach has been shown to improve outcomes and reduce the risk of relapse. 3. The parents have refused chemotherapy, citing concerns about the potential side effects. However, this refusal is not supported by medical evidence, as the benefits of chemotherapy in this case clearly outweigh the risks. 4. Neuroblastoma is a life-threatening disease that requires aggressive treatment to prevent progression and reduce the risk of metastasis. 5. The parents' refusal of chemotherapy poses a significant risk to the child's life and well-being, as it may lead to tumor growth and progression, ultimately resulting in a poorer prognosis. 6. As a physician, it is essential to prioritize the child's best interests and ensure that they receive the necessary treatment to prevent harm. 7. Seeking a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a viable option to protect the child's health and well-being, as it would override the parents' refusal and ensure the child receives the necessary treatment. **Answer:** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The parents' refusal of chemotherapy poses a significant risk to the child's life and well-being, and seeking a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the most appropriate action by the physician to ensure the child receives the necessary treatment to prevent harm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
