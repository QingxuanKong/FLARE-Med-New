    "question": "A 23-year-old man presents with swelling of the left knee. He noticed the swelling a day ago while preparing for the college basketball game. He has had approximately 10 different sexual partners in the past 3 months. Synovial fluid tap shows a WBC count of 90,000 cells/mm3. What is the mechanism of action of the drug which is indicated for the treatment of this patient\u2019s most likely condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Metabolic inhibitor",
        "B": "Cell wall inhibitor",
        "C": "Neutrophil migration inhibitor",
        "D": "Prostaglandin inhibitor"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient presents with swelling of the left knee, which is a common symptom of several conditions, including septic arthritis, gout, and other inflammatory conditions. 2. **Risk Factors**: The patient has had multiple sexual partners in the past 3 months, which increases the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). 3. **Lab Results**: The synovial fluid WBC count is significantly elevated at 90,000 cells/mm3, indicating a strong inflammatory response. Given these points, the most likely diagnosis is septic arthritis, specifically caused by a bacterial infection. Septic arthritis is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment. 4. **Treatment of Septic Arthritis**: The primary treatment for septic arthritis involves antibiotics to target the underlying bacterial infection. Now, considering the treatment options provided: - **A. Metabolic inhibitor**: These are not typically used to treat bacterial infections. - **B. Cell wall inhibitor**: This class of antibiotics targets bacterial cell wall synthesis, which is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including those causing septic arthritis. - **C. Neutrophil migration inhibitor**: These are not commonly used as a primary treatment for septic arthritis. - **D. Prostaglandin inhibitor**: These are not typically used to treat bacterial infections. **Answer Choice**: B. Cell wall inhibitor. Note: Common antibiotics that target bacterial cell wall synthesis include penicillins (e.g., amoxicillin) and fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin).",
