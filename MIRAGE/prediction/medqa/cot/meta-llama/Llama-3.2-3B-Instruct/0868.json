    "question": "An 80-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of fatigue and lightheadedness. He does not have chest pain, palpitations, or difficulty breathing. He has a history of hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and asthma. Current medications include simvastatin, metformin, lisinopril, albuterol, and ibuprofen. His pulse is 48/min and blood pressure is 89/50 mm Hg. He responds slowly to questions but is oriented to person, place, and time. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. His lungs are clear to auscultation and bowel sounds are positive with no pulsatile masses or bruits. Pedal pulses are nonpalpable, distal extremities are cold, and capillary refill time is 4 seconds. An ECG shows left axis deviation, a Q wave in lead III, a constant PR interval of 0.15 seconds with every third P wave that is nonconducted, and a QRS interval of .09 seconds. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Dobutamine",
        "B": "Norepinephrine",
        "C": "Cardiac pacing",
        "D": "Epinephrine"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with fatigue, lightheadedness, bradycardia (pulse of 48/min), hypotension (blood pressure 89/50 mm Hg), and signs of poor peripheral perfusion (cold extremities, delayed capillary refill time of 4 seconds). The ECG shows left axis deviation, a Q wave in lead III, a constant PR interval of 0.15 seconds with every third P wave that is nonconducted, and a QRS interval of.09 seconds. These findings are highly suggestive of sick sinus node dysfunction, which is likely due to hypotension and hypovolemia. Given the patient's hypotension and bradycardia, the most appropriate next step is to restore a normal heart rate and blood pressure. The first-line treatment for symptomatic bradycardia and hypotension in this context is intravenous atropine, but it is not listed among the options. However, the closest and most appropriate choice would be to use a medication that can increase heart rate and blood pressure. Norepinephrine is a potent alpha-adrenergic agonist that can increase blood pressure and heart rate, making it the most appropriate choice in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
