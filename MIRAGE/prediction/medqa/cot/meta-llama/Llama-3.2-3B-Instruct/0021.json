    "question": "A 3-month-old infant is brought to her pediatrician because she coughs and seems to have difficulty breathing while feeding. In addition, she seems to have less energy compared to other babies and appears listless throughout the day. She was born by cesarean section to a G1P1 woman with no prior medical history and had a normal APGAR score at birth. Her parents say that she has never been observed to turn blue. Physical exam reveals a high-pitched holosystolic murmur that is best heard at the lower left sternal border. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following abnormalities?",
    "options": {
        "A": "22q11 deletion",
        "B": "Deletion of genes on chromosome 7",
        "C": "Lithium exposure in utero",
        "D": "Maternal alcohol consumption"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the symptoms and physical exam findings presented: 1. The infant has a high-pitched holosystolic murmur that is best heard at the lower left sternal border. This suggests a possible congenital heart defect, specifically a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) or a ventricular septal defect (VSD), which are common congenital heart defects. 2. The infant's symptoms of coughing, difficulty breathing while feeding, and listlessness are consistent with heart failure or increased pulmonary blood flow, which can be associated with a PDA or VSD. 3. The absence of cyanosis (blue discoloration) is notable, as cyanosis is often seen in cases of severe congenital heart defects that lead to significant hypoxemia. 4. The patient's normal APGAR score at birth suggests that the infant was born in good condition, but the presence of a heart murmur and symptoms of heart failure may indicate a previously undiagnosed congenital heart defect. 5. The options provided can be evaluated as follows: - A. 22q11 deletion: This deletion is associated with DiGeorge syndrome, which includes congenital heart defects such as VSD and PDA, but it is not the most common cause of the symptoms described. - B. Deletion of genes on chromosome 7: This deletion is associated with Williams syndrome, which includes cardiovascular anomalies such as supravalvular aortic stenosis, but it is not the most likely cause of the symptoms described. - C. Lithium exposure in utero: Lithium exposure has been associated with cardiac malformations, particularly Ebstein's anomaly, but it is not the most common cause of the symptoms described. - D. Maternal alcohol consumption: Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy is not typically associated with congenital heart defects. 6. Based on the symptoms and physical exam findings, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a congenital heart defect, such as a PDA or VSD. The most common cause of these defects is a genetic abnormality, and the deletion of genes on chromosome 7 is associated with a higher risk of congenital heart defects, including PDA and VSD.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
