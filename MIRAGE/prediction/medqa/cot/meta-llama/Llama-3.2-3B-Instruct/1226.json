        "A": "Atenolol",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's medical history and the potential impact of the surgical procedure on her condition. The patient has a history of primary hyperparathyroidism, which is characterized by an overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to hypercalcemia. Additionally, she has a history of thyroidectomy, which may have affected her calcium levels and blood pressure regulation. The presence of an adrenal mass is a concern for pheochromocytoma, a catecholamine-secreting tumor that can cause hypertension. Given these factors, the primary concern during surgery is to prevent a hypertensive emergency. The patient's history of primary hyperparathyroidism and potential adrenal mass raises the risk of hypocalcemia during surgery, but the primary concern is managing blood pressure. The correct answer choice should be a medication that can effectively manage blood pressure without causing significant hypotension or interacting with the patient's existing medical conditions. Atenolol (A) and Labetalol (B) are beta-blockers that can be used to manage hypertension, but they may not be the best choice in this scenario due to the potential for hypotension. Phenoxybenzamine (D) is an alpha-blocker that can be used to manage hypertension, but it may not be the best choice in this scenario due to its potential to cause hypotension. Nifedipine (C) is a calcium channel blocker that can be used to manage hypertension and has a favorable profile in this scenario, as it does not have significant effects on calcium levels. It also has a lower risk of causing hypotension compared to beta-blockers or alpha-blockers. Therefore, Nifedipine is the most appropriate choice to prevent a hypertensive emergency intraoperatively in this patient.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
