    "question": "An 18-month-old boy is brought to his pediatrician because his mother is concerned about his walking. The boy was born at 37 weeks\u2019 gestation and spent 1 night in the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress. He otherwise has been healthy and started walking independently at 12 months. However, his mother reports that he has stopped walking and appears weaker than he was a few months ago. He also has started having brief convulsive episodes over the past week. His parents are both healthy with no medical conditions. On exam, the child demonstrates muscle rigidity and diffuse muscle wasting. He is unable to stand or sit up straight. His patellar, Achilles, and brachioradialis reflexes are absent. Fundoscopic examination is unremarkable. A urine sample demonstrates metachromic granules. This patient\u2019s condition is caused by a defect in which of the following enzymes?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Alpha-galactosidase A",
        "B": "Arylsulfatase A",
        "C": "Beta-galactocerebrosidase",
        "D": "Hexosaminidase A"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To determine the enzyme defect responsible for the patient's condition, let's break down the clinical presentation and laboratory findings: 1. **Clinical Presentation:** - The child was born at 37 weeks' gestation and spent 1 night in the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress. - He started walking independently at 12 months and has since stopped walking and appears weaker. - Brief convulsive episodes have been observed over the past week. - Muscle rigidity and diffuse muscle wasting are noted. - Absent reflexes in the patellar, Achilles, and brachioradialis muscles. - Metachromic granules in the urine. 2. **Differential Diagnosis:** - The combination of muscle weakness, rigidity, and absent reflexes, along with the presence of metachromic granules in the urine, points towards a lysosomal storage disorder. The absence of reflexes and muscle wasting also suggest a neurological component. 3. **Specific Enzyme Defects:** - **Alpha-galactosidase A (A):** Deficiency in alpha-galactosidase A leads to Fabry disease, characterized by angiokeratomas, chronic pain, and renal and cardiac complications. While it can affect the nervous system, the primary presentation doesn't match this case. - **Arylsulfatase A (B):** Deficiency in arylsulfatase A leads to Metachromatic Leukodystrophy, characterized by demyelination, progressive neurological decline, and the presence of metachromic granules in the urine. This condition also presents with muscle weakness and absent reflexes, making it a strong candidate. - **Beta-galactocerebrosidase (C):** Deficiency in beta-galactocerebrosidase leads to Krabbe disease, characterized by early onset of neurological symptoms, including loss of reflexes, and progressive neurological decline. However, the presence of metachromic granules in the urine is not a hallmark of this disease. - **Hexosaminidase A (D):** Deficiency in hexosaminidase A leads to Tay-Sachs disease, characterized by progressive neurological decline, seizures, and cherry-red spots on the macula. This condition does not typically present with metachromic granules in the urine. **Conclusion:** Given the combination of muscle weakness, absent reflexes, progressive neurological decline, and the presence of metachromic granules in the urine, the most likely enzyme defect responsible for this patient's condition is a deficiency in **Arylsulfatase A**, leading to Metachromatic Leukodystrophy. ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The clinical presentation of muscle weakness, rigidity, absent reflexes, and the presence of metachromic granules in the urine suggests a lysosomal storage disorder.
