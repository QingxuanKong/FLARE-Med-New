    "question": "A 16-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by ambulance from a soccer game. During the game, he was about to kick the ball when another player collided with his leg from the front. He was unable to stand up after this collision and reported severe knee pain. On presentation, he was found to have a mild knee effusion. Physical exam showed that his knee could be pushed posteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion but it could not be pulled anteriorly in the same position. The anatomic structure that was most likely injured in this patient has which of the following characteristics?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Runs anteriorly from the medial femoral condyle",
        "B": "Runs medially from the lateral femoral condyle",
        "C": "Runs posteriorly from the lateral femoral condyle",
        "D": "Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. **Mechanism of Injury**: The patient was hit from the front while attempting to kick the ball, which suggests a direct blow to the knee joint. 2. **Symptoms**: The patient is unable to stand up after the collision, indicating a significant knee injury. 3. **Physical Exam Findings**: - Mild knee effusion suggests joint inflammation or bleeding within the joint. - The knee can be pushed posteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion but cannot be pulled anteriorly in the same position. This finding is crucial for determining the injured structure. Given the inability to pull the knee anteriorly, it implies that the injured structure is likely to be the one that limits or restricts anterior movement of the knee. Now, let's consider the options: - **A. Runs anteriorly from the medial femoral condyle**: If this structure ran anteriorly from the medial femoral condyle, it would not restrict anterior movement of the knee. - **B. Runs medially from the lateral femoral condyle**: This option is not directly related to the restriction of anterior movement of the knee. - **C. Runs posteriorly from the lateral femoral condyle**: This option suggests that the injured structure is located posteriorly and originates from the lateral femoral condyle. Given the mechanism of injury and the inability to pull the knee anteriorly, this is a strong candidate for the injured structure. - **D. Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle**: This option suggests that the injured structure is posteriorly located and originates from the medial femoral condyle. However, this would not typically restrict anterior movement of the knee. Considering the information provided and the physical exam findings, the most likely injured structure is the **Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL)**, which runs posteriorly from the lateral femoral condyle and is known to be injured in this manner, especially with a direct posterior force to the knee joint. Therefore, the answer is: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mechanism of injury and physical exam findings suggest a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury, which is characterized by its posterior location and origin from the lateral femoral condyle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" } ```",
