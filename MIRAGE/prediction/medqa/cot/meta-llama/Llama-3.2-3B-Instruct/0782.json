    "question": "A 25-year-old primigravida is admitted to the hospital at 36 weeks gestation after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. She is conscious, but lethargic and complains of a headache that started 2 hours prior to the seizure. She denies alcohol intake or drug use. She has no history of convulsive disorders and the antepartum course has been unremarkable. She was compliant with the recommended prenatal care and her last prenatal visit was 2 weeks ago. She has gained 2 kg (4.4 lb) since her last visit. The blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg, the heart rate was 79/min, the respiratory rate was 14/min, and the temperature was 37.0\u2103 (98.6\u2109). The physical examination shows leg and perineal edema. The neurologic examination is significant for symmetric upper and lower extremity hyperreflexia and ankle clonus. Which of the following laboratory findings would be most common in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Elevated transaminases",
        "B": "Leukocytosis",
        "C": "Hyponatremia",
        "D": "Proteinuria"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 25-year-old primigravida at 36 weeks gestation with a history of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, headache, leg and perineal edema, symmetric upper and lower extremity hyperreflexia, and ankle clonus. These symptoms are suggestive of pre-eclampsia, a condition characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria in the third trimester of pregnancy. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with severe pre-eclampsia, which can cause neurological symptoms such as seizures, headache, and hyperreflexia. The patient's blood pressure is elevated at 160/90 mmHg, which further supports the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. The presence of proteinuria is a key diagnostic criterion for pre-eclampsia, as it indicates damage to the kidneys and can lead to further complications such as eclampsia, which is the patient's condition. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with severe pre-eclampsia, which can cause a range of complications for both the mother and the fetus. Therefore, the most likely laboratory finding in this patient is proteinuria.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
