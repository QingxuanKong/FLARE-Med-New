    "question": "A 3-day-old boy is admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for seizures. He was born to a 33-year-old woman at 31 weeks gestation via cesarean section. His birth weight was 1400 grams. Vital signs are significant for systemic hypotension, bradycardia, and hypoventilation. On physical exam, the patient has an altered level of consciousness with decreased spontaneous and elicited movements. The patient is hypotonic on motor testing, has bulging anterior fontanelle, and appears cyanotic. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Complete blood count",
        "B": "Cranial ultrasonography",
        "C": "Head CT",
        "D": "MRI of the head"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this case, we need to consider the clinical presentation and the patient's gestational age. The patient is a 3-day-old boy who was born at 31 weeks gestation, which makes him preterm. The symptoms of systemic hypotension, bradycardia, hypoventilation, altered level of consciousness, decreased spontaneous and elicited movements, hypotonia, bulging anterior fontanelle, and cyanosis are concerning for a severe neurological insult or infection. Given the patient's age and symptoms, the primary concern is for intracranial hemorrhage, particularly intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), which is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. The patient's bulging fontanelle and decreased level of consciousness suggest increased intracranial pressure, which could be due to IVH. Cranial ultrasonography is the preferred initial imaging modality for detecting IVH in preterm infants due to its non-invasive nature and ability to assess for hemorrhage in the first few days of life. A head CT or MRI would not be the first choice due to the patient's age and the need for radiation exposure or contrast agents. A complete blood count (CBC) may be useful in assessing for infection or other systemic conditions, but it is not directly related to the immediate management of the patient's neurological symptoms. Therefore, the best next step in management would be to perform cranial ultrasonography to assess for IVH and other intracranial abnormalities.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
