    "question": "A 46-year-old woman presents with a 5-month history of worsening dry cough, occasional shortness of breath, and fatigue. She says she is now having trouble walking a full block. For the past week, she also has noticed bilateral swelling of the lower legs. She denies chest pain, fever, chills, syncope, or bloody sputum. Current vitals include: temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 63/min, blood pressure 128/91 mm Hg and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, there is elevated jugular venous pressure, decreased breath sounds bilaterally at the lung bases, and 1+ non-pitting edema bilaterally in the lower extremities. A chest X-ray demonstrates a slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the diagnosis of this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Bronchoalveolar wash",
        "B": "Pulmonary function studies",
        "C": "Echocardiography",
        "D": "Chest CT"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"This patient presents with symptoms of worsening dry cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, and bilateral lower leg swelling, which have progressed over a 5-month period. The physical examination findings of elevated jugular venous pressure, decreased breath sounds at the lung bases, and 1+ non-pitting edema in the lower extremities are suggestive of heart failure. The chest X-ray showing a slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette further supports this suspicion. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more indicative of a cardiac cause for her symptoms rather than a pulmonary cause. Therefore, the next step in diagnosis should focus on evaluating the heart's structure and function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
