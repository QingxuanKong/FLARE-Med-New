    "question": "A 31-year-old man, who was hospitalized for substance-induced psychosis two days prior, has had episodic neck stiffness and pain for the past 8 hours. These episodes last for approximately 25 minutes and are accompanied by his neck rotating to the right. During the last episode, he was able to relieve the stiffness by lightly touching his jaw. He has received six doses of haloperidol for auditory hallucinations since his admission. He appears anxious. His temperature is 37.3\u00b0C (99.1\u00b0F), pulse is 108/min, and blood pressure is 128/86 mm Hg. Examination shows a flexed neck rotated to the right. The neck is rigid with limited range of motion. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Benztropine",
        "B": "Physical therapy",
        "C": "Dantrolene",
        "D": "Baclofen"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with episodic neck stiffness and pain, accompanied by neck rotation, and relief with jaw manipulation. This presentation is suggestive of a diagnosis of acute dystonic reaction, a common side effect of antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol. The patient's history of receiving six doses of haloperidol for auditory hallucinations further supports this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms are characterized by rapid onset, short duration, and a specific trigger (jaw manipulation), which are all consistent with a dystonic reaction. The patient's examination findings of a flexed neck rotated to the right, rigidity, and limited range of motion also support this diagnosis. The primary goal of treatment is to quickly alleviate the symptoms and prevent further complications. Benztropine is an anticholinergic medication commonly used to treat acute dystonic reactions, and it is the most appropriate choice for this patient's symptoms. The other options, physical therapy, dantrolene, and baclofen, are not typically used to treat acute dystonic reactions and are therefore incorrect.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
