    "question": "A 27-year-old male presents to the psychiatrist requesting help with his compulsions as they are interfering with his life. He explains that he has this fear that something terrible will happen to his house if he does not check every appliance, outlet, window and door lock, faucet, and light fixture before he leaves. He states that he must check everything 7 times in a specific order and if he goes out of order he must start from the beginning and perform it all over. He has recently been fired from his job because he is always late and lost his fiancee as she could not deal with his habits anymore. The physician explained that cognitive-behavioral therapy may be of assistance and also prescribed clomipramine. Which of the following is the mechanism of reaction of clomipramine?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Decreases the degradation of norepinephrine and serotonin",
        "B": "Increases the release of norepinephrine and serotonin by alpha 2 receptor antagonism",
        "C": "Blocks only norepinephrine reuptake",
        "D": "Blocks reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the information and analyze the options provided. The patient's symptoms, such as excessive checking of appliances, outlets, and other objects, are characteristic of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The physician's suggestion of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and the prescription of clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), are also consistent with the treatment of OCD. Clomipramine is a TCA with a specific mechanism of action that is relevant to OCD. To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option: A. Decreases the degradation of norepinephrine and serotonin: This statement is partially correct, as TCAs like clomipramine can increase the levels of norepinephrine and serotonin by inhibiting their reuptake. However, it does not specifically mention the inhibition of degradation. B. Increases the release of norepinephrine and serotonin by alpha 2 receptor antagonism: This statement is incorrect. Clomipramine is not known to act primarily through alpha 2 receptor antagonism. C. Blocks only norepinephrine reuptake: This statement is incorrect. Clomipramine blocks the reuptake of both norepinephrine and serotonin, not just norepinephrine. D. Blocks reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin: This statement is correct. Clomipramine is a TCA that blocks the reuptake of both norepinephrine and serotonin, which is consistent with its use in treating OCD. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms suggest Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that blocks the reuptake of both norepinephrine and serotonin, which is consistent with its use in treating OCD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
