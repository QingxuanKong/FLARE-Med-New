    "question": "A 1-month-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her parents. They are concerned that she becomes lethargic and irritated between meals. They found that feeding her often with small servings helps. She was born at 39 weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is meeting all developmental milestones. Her mother has one brother that occasionally requires blood transfusions. Today, her blood pressure is 55/33 mm Hg, his heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 40/min, and temperature of 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical exam, the infant is irritated. She is slightly jaundiced. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her blood work shows normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin. Sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies are also ruled out. A Coombs test is negative. Red blood cell osmotic fragility gap is normal. The physician determined that these findings are related to an enzyme deficiency. Which of the following allosterically inhibits this enzyme?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Alanine",
        "B": "Adenosine monophosphate",
        "C": "Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate",
        "D": "Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The 1-month-old girl is lethargic, irritated, and has a low blood pressure (55/33 mmHg), indicating possible dehydration and possible anemia. She has a slightly jaundiced appearance, which can be associated with anemia. The elevated reticulocyte count suggests the bone marrow is actively producing red blood cells to compensate for a loss. 2. **Blood Work**: - Normocytic anemia: This indicates that the red blood cells are of normal size but reduced in number. - Elevated reticulocyte count: This suggests the bone marrow is actively producing red blood cells to compensate for the anemia. - Decreased haptoglobin: This is a marker of hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells). - Normal Coombs test: Rules out autoimmune hemolytic anemia. - Normal red blood cell osmotic fragility gap: This helps rule out hereditary spherocytosis. 3. **Enzyme Deficiency**: The question mentions that the findings are related to an enzyme deficiency. Given the clinical presentation and blood work, the likely enzyme deficiency is Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. This enzyme is crucial for protecting red blood cells from oxidative damage. 4. **Allosteric Inhibitors**: Now, we need to identify an allosteric inhibitor of the enzyme G6PD. G6PD is allosterically inhibited by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. However, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is an allosteric activator of G6PD. Given the options: - A. Alanine: Not directly related to G6PD regulation. - B. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP): Not directly related to G6PD regulation. - C. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate: Allosteric activator of G6PD, not inhibitor. - D. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate: Allosteric inhibitor of G6PD. Therefore, the correct answer is: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient likely has G6PD deficiency, and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is the allosteric inhibitor of this enzyme.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"} ```",
