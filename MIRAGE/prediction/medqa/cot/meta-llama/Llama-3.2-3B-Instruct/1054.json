    "question": "A 69-year-old gentleman presents to his primary care physician for pain in his right shoulder. The patient was helping his son move this past weekend, and he noticed after the move that he had pain and weakness in his right shoulder. The patient thought that this pain was just him being in poor shape so he started going to the gym and lifting weights which made his symptoms significantly worse. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, obesity, and asthma. His current medications include albuterol, lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide. On physical exam you note an obese gentleman who seems to be in pain. You note prominent weakness of external rotation of his right upper extremity. When you ask the patient to slowly lower his right arm to his side when he holds it overhead, you note that he suddenly drops his arm and appears to be in pain. The patient's strength is 1/5 for abduction of the right arm. Which of the following is most likely injured in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Supraspinatus",
        "B": "Infraspinatus",
        "C": "Teres minor",
        "D": "Deltoid"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and physical examination: 1. The patient had a recent traumatic event (lifting heavy objects while moving) that led to pain and weakness in his right shoulder. 2. The patient has a history of diabetes, obesity, and asthma, but these are not directly relevant to the shoulder injury. 3. The patient's physical examination reveals prominent weakness of external rotation of his right upper extremity, which suggests a problem with the muscles responsible for external rotation. 4. The patient's strength is 1/5 for abduction of the right arm, which indicates significant weakness in this movement. Given these points, let's consider the muscles responsible for shoulder abduction and external rotation: * The deltoid muscle is responsible for abduction of the arm, but it is not primarily responsible for external rotation. * The supraspinatus muscle is involved in the initial 15-30 degrees of abduction, but it is not primarily responsible for external rotation. * The infraspinatus muscle is a key stabilizer of the shoulder joint and is responsible for external rotation. * The teres minor muscle also assists in external rotation. Considering the patient's weakness in external rotation and abduction, the most likely injured muscle is the infraspinatus. This muscle is often injured in cases of shoulder impingement syndrome, where the head of the humerus gets pinched between the acromion and the coracoid process, leading to pain and weakness in external rotation. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely injured muscle is the infraspinatus.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
