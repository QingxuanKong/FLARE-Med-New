    "question": "Public health researchers are reviewing data from an outbreak of hepatitis A that was traced to contaminated produce from a popular restaurant. A case series investigation with prospective and retrospective follow-up found that 500 individuals dined at the restaurant during the week of study. The incidence of hepatitis A infection was found to be 25%, and the total number of deaths recorded among the incident cases was 5 individuals. What was the case-fatality rate for the hepatitis A outbreak?",
    "options": {
        "A": "4%",
        "B": "10%",
        "C": "20%",
        "D": "25%"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To calculate the case-fatality rate, we need to first calculate the number of individuals infected with hepatitis A and then determine the number of deaths due to the infection. Given data: - Total individuals who dined at the restaurant during the study: 500 - Incidence of hepatitis A infection: 25% - Number of deaths due to hepatitis A: 5 Step 1: Calculate the number of individuals infected with hepatitis A Number of individuals infected = Total individuals who dined at the restaurant * Incidence of hepatitis A = 500 * 0.25 = 125 Step 2: Calculate the case-fatality rate Case-fatality rate = (Number of deaths due to hepatitis A / Number of individuals infected with hepatitis A) * 100 = (5 / 125) * 100 = 4% Therefore, the case-fatality rate for the hepatitis A outbreak is 4%. ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the case-fatality rate, we first calculated the number of individuals infected with hepatitis A by multiplying the total number of individuals who dined at the restaurant by the incidence rate. Then, we used this number to calculate the case-fatality rate by dividing the number of deaths due to the infection by the number of infected individuals and multiplying by 100.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" } ```",
