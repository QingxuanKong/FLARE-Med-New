    "question": "A 34-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with a fever. She developed worsening malaise and diaphoresis over the past 48 hours. Her maximum temperature was 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C) taken the night before presentation. Her past medical history is notable for major depressive disorder, obesity, fibromyalgia, and severe tension headaches. She previously took paroxetine for a 2-month trial but switched to citalopram 6 months ago as she did not feel like paroxetine was adequately helping her symptoms. Her mood has been stable on her current dose of citalopram. She takes ibuprofen for her headaches but previously borrowed a friend\u2019s headache medication when her headaches became very severe. Of note, she has been trying to lose weight and recently started taking an amino acid supplement at the suggestion of her nephew who is a nutritionist. She is also trying out a new low-carbohydrate diet. She works as a nurse at a local primary care clinic. Her temperature is 101.5\u00b0F (38.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 144/80 mmHg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 22/min. She is diaphoretic and shivering. Patellar and brachioradialis reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. Tone is increased in her bilateral upper and lower extremities. Rapid dorsiflexion of her right ankle elicits 3 beats of clonus. Pupils are equally round and reactive to light. A basic metabolic panel is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely inciting factor for this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Decreased carbohydrate intake",
        "B": "Increased tryptophan intake",
        "C": "Medication change",
        "D": "Surreptitious opiate abuse"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely inciting factor for this patient's condition, let's analyze the provided information step by step.\\n\\nThe patient presents with fever, worsening malaise, diaphoresis, and autonomic instability (increased reflexes, increased tone in extremities, and clonus), which suggests a neurological condition. The patient's history of major depressive disorder and fibromyalgia may be relevant, but the acute presentation and autonomic instability make it less likely that her current medication (citalopram) is the cause.\\n\\nThe patient's recent changes in diet, including a low-carbohydrate diet and taking an amino acid supplement, may contribute to her condition. However, the acute presentation of fever and autonomic instability makes a dietary change the less likely cause.\\n\\nThe patient's history of severe tension headaches and previous use of headache medication without a prescription raises the possibility of surreptitious opiate abuse. The presence of autonomic instability, including increased reflexes, increased tone, and clonus, is consistent with opioid use syndrome.\\n\\nThe patient's fever and autonomic instability are not typical of a simple medication change or decreased carbohydrate intake. Therefore, the most likely inciting factor for this patient's condition is surreptitious opiate abuse.\\n\\nAnswer: D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
