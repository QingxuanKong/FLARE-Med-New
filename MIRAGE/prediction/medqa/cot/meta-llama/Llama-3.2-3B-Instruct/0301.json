    "question": "A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of decreased appetite and abdominal pain for the last several weeks. Physical examination shows a well-appearing toddler with a palpable left-sided abdominal mass that does not cross the midline. A CT of the abdomen shows a large, necrotic tumor on the left kidney. Histological examination of the kidney mass shows primitive blastemal cells and immature tubules and glomeruli. This tissue is most likely derived from the same embryological structure as which of the following?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Adrenal medulla",
        "B": "Thyroid gland",
        "C": "Papillary muscles",
        "D": "Anterior pituitary\n\""

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's analyze the key points provided: 1. The patient is a 2-year-old boy with a palpable left-sided abdominal mass that does not cross the midline, which suggests a left-sided renal origin. 2. The CT scan shows a large, necrotic tumor on the left kidney, indicating a malignant process. 3. The histological examination of the kidney mass shows primitive blastemal cells and immature tubules and glomeruli. Given these points, the tumor is likely a renal tumor, specifically a Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma), which is a type of renal cancer that typically affects children. Wilms tumor originates from the metanephric blastema, which is the embryonic tissue that gives rise to the renal glomeruli and tubules. The metanephric blastema is derived from the intermediate mesoderm, which is the same embryological structure that gives rise to other tissues such as the adrenal medulla. Therefore, the correct answer is related to the adrenal medulla, which is derived from the intermediate mesoderm. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Adrenal medulla - This is the correct answer, as the adrenal medulla is derived from the intermediate mesoderm, the same embryological structure that gives rise to the metanephric blastema and, consequently, Wilms tumor. B. Thyroid gland - The thyroid gland is derived from the endoderm, not the intermediate mesoderm. C. Papillary muscles - These are part of the heart and are derived from the splanchnic mesoderm, not the intermediate mesoderm. D. Anterior pituitary - The anterior pituitary is derived from the ectoderm, not the intermediate mesoderm. The final answer is A.\"}",
