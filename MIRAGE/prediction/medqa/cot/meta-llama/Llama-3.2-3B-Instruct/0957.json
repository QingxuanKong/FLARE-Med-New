    "question": "A 23-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 28 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a routine prenatal examination. Her previous pregnancy was uncomplicated and she gave birth to a healthy boy. Her blood group is A, Rh-negative. The father's blood group is B, Rh-positive. Administration of which of the following is most appropriate at this time?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Anti-A IgG",
        "B": "Anti-D IgG",
        "C": "Anti-B IgG",
        "D": "Anti-D IgM"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate choice, let's break down the key points from the scenario: 1. The patient is Rh-negative and has given birth to a healthy boy. Since the baby is a boy, he inherits his Y chromosome from the father, and the Y chromosome does not carry the gene for the Rh blood type. Therefore, the baby is also Rh-negative. 2. The father is Rh-positive. Since the father is Rh-positive and the baby is Rh-negative, there is a risk of the baby developing Rh incompatibility, which can lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). To prevent this, the mother's immune system needs to be sensitized to the Rh-positive blood of the father. 3. The mother is Rh-negative, so she already has anti-Rh antibodies in her system. These antibodies are IgG, which can cross the placenta and attack the Rh-positive baby's red blood cells, leading to HDN. 4. To prevent sensitization and the formation of more antibodies, the mother needs to be given a treatment that will neutralize her existing antibodies and prevent further production of new antibodies. Given these points, the most appropriate choice is the one that will neutralize the mother's existing anti-Rh antibodies and prevent further sensitization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
