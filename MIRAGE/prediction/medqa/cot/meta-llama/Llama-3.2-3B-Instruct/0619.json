    "question": "Eight weeks after starting a new weight-loss medication, a 43-year-old woman with obesity comes to the physician because of greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, and flatulence. She also complains of progressively worsening night-time vision. She has had no fever, chills, or vomiting. Physical examination shows dry, scaly skin on her extremities and face. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of action of the drug she is taking?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Stimulation of monoamine neurotransmitter release",
        "B": "Inhibition of serotonin reuptake",
        "C": "Stimulation of norepinephrine release",
        "D": "Inhibition of lipase"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the symptoms and the potential side effects of the medication. 1. **Symptoms**: - Greasy diarrhea - Excessive belching - Flatulence - Night-time vision problems - Dry, scaly skin on the extremities and face 2. **Possible Side Effects of Common Weight-Loss Medications**: - Greasy diarrhea and flatulence are common side effects of medications that affect gut motility or intestinal absorption. - Night-time vision problems could be related to medications that affect neurotransmitter release or absorption. - Dry, scaly skin could be related to medications that affect lipids or lipid metabolism. 3. **Medications and Their Mechanisms**: - **A. Stimulation of monoamine neurotransmitter release**: This mechanism is associated with antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs) and stimulants (e.g., amphetamines). These medications are not typically associated with the gastrointestinal side effects described. - **B. Inhibition of serotonin reuptake**: This is a mechanism of action for antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs). While some antidepressants can cause gastrointestinal side effects, they are not typically associated with the specific combination of gastrointestinal and dermatological symptoms described. - **C. Stimulation of norepinephrine release**: This is also a mechanism of action for certain antidepressants and stimulants. Like option A, these medications are not typically associated with the gastrointestinal and dermatological side effects described. - **D. Inhibition of lipase**: This would affect fat absorption. Medications that inhibit lipase, such as orlistat, can cause gastrointestinal side effects like greasy diarrhea and flatulence due to malabsorption of fats. Additionally, orlistat can cause skin problems, such as dry, scaly skin, due to the malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins. **Conclusion**: The combination of gastrointestinal side effects (greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, and flatulence) and dermatological side effects (dry, scaly skin) strongly suggests that the medication the patient is taking is a lipase inhibitor, such as orlistat. **Answer Choice**: D. Inhibition of lipase",
