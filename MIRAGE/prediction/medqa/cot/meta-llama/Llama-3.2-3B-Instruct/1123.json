    "question": "A 72-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of frequent headaches, double vision, fatigue, and myalgias. Physical examination shows pallor, tenderness to palpation over the temples, and inward deviation of the left eye. Laboratory studies show an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 65 mm/h. Temporal artery biopsy shows transmural granulomatous inflammation and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina. Treatment with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids is begun. The patient's condition puts her at greatest risk of developing which of the following complications?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Pulmonary hypertension",
        "B": "Lower extremity gangrene",
        "C": "Palpable purpura",
        "D": "Thoracic aortic aneurysm"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), a large vessel vasculitis that primarily affects the branches of the external carotid artery, particularly the temporal artery. The patient's age, symptoms, and biopsy results support this diagnosis. High-dose intravenous corticosteroids are commonly used to treat GCA. The complications associated with GCA include: - Visual loss due to ischemia of the optic nerve - Aortic aneurysm due to inflammation of the aorta - Aortic dissection - Pulmonary hypertension due to inflammation of the pulmonary arteries Considering the options provided, the patient's condition puts her at greatest risk of developing pulmonary hypertension due to the inflammation of the pulmonary arteries, which can lead to increased blood pressure in the lungs and potentially life-threatening complications. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Pulmonary hypertension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
