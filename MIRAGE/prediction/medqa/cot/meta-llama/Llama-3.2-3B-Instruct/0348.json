She states that her limbs feel heavy all the time and that completing any activity takes tremendous effort. She no longer finds any happiness in activities that she previously enjoyed. She also states that she really struggles to sleep and at times can't sleep for several days. The patient is started on appropriate first-line therapy and sent home. She returns 1 week later stating that her symptoms have not improved. She is requesting help as her performance at work and school is suffering. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",
    "options": {

        "C": "Continue current therapy",
        "D": "Electroconvulsive therapy"
    },

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of depression, including persistent fatigue, anhedonia, and heavy limbs, which are indicative of a depressive disorder. The patient has not responded to first-line therapy, which suggests that the initial treatment approach may not be effective. The patient's symptoms are severe enough to impact her daily functioning, as evidenced by her struggles with work and school performance. The American Psychiatric Association's Practice Guideline for Depression recommends that treatment should be adjusted if there is no improvement after 4-6 weeks of initial treatment. Therefore, the next step in management should involve a reassessment of the treatment plan and potential adjustments to improve symptom response.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
