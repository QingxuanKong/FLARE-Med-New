    "question": "A 3-year-old male was brought to the pediatrician with severe lip lacerations, with a portion of his tongue appearing to be bitten off, as well as missing portions of the fingers on his right hand. A family history is notable for two similar cases in male cousins on the mother's side. A urinalysis revealed a high level of uric acid. Which of the following is the mode of inheritance for this disorder?",
    "options": {
        "A": "X-linked recessive",
        "B": "X-linked dominant",
        "C": "Autosomal dominant",
        "D": "Maternally inherited mitochondrial defect"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key details in this case are the severe lip lacerations, tongue bite, and missing fingers, as well as the family history of similar cases in male cousins on the mother's side. The high level of uric acid in the urinalysis is also a significant finding. These symptoms and findings point towards a disorder that affects the connective tissue and is possibly related to uric acid metabolism. The condition that comes to mind based on these symptoms is Hereditary Angioedema (HAE), but the mention of uric acid levels makes me consider a different condition: X-linked hyperuricemia. However, the primary condition that fits the symptoms is Hereditary Angioedema with Deficiency of C1 inhibitor (HAE), but the high uric acid levels and the specific family history make me lean towards X-linked dominant inheritance. The mention of a family history of similar cases in male cousins on the mother's side is a strong indication of X-linked inheritance. X-linked recessive disorders typically affect males more severely and are often more severe in males, but they usually do not have a family history of affected females, which is not the case here. X-linked dominant disorders can affect both males and females but typically have a milder phenotype in females. However, the severity of the symptoms and the family history suggest a more severe X-linked disorder. The mention of uric acid levels is less typical for most HAE cases, but it can be seen in some cases of X-linked disorders, such as X-linked hyperuricemia. Maternally inherited mitochondrial defects are not typically associated with the symptoms described. Therefore, the mode of inheritance that best fits the symptoms and family history is X-linked dominant.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
