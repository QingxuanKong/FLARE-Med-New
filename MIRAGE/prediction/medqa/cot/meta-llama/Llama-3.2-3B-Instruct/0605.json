    "question": "A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by police. He was found at a local celebration acting very strangely and was reported by other patrons of the event. The patient is very anxious and initially is hesitant to answer questions. He denies any substance use and states that he was just trying to have a good time. The patient's responses are slightly delayed and he seems to have difficulty processing his thoughts. The patient tells you he feels very anxious and asks for some medication to calm him down. The patient has a past medical history of psoriasis which is treated with topical steroids. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. On physical exam, you note an anxious young man. HEENT exam reveals a dry mouth and conjunctival injection. Neurological exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with normal strength and sensation in his upper and lower extremities. Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia, and pulmonary exam is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely intoxication in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Alcohol",
        "B": "Marijuana",
        "C": "Cocaine",
        "D": "Phencyclidine"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely intoxication in this patient, let's analyze the provided information step by step: 1. The patient is described as acting strangely and having difficulty processing his thoughts, which suggests a central nervous system (CNS) depressant or stimulant effect. 2. The patient denies substance use but asks for medication to calm down, which could indicate a substance-induced anxiety. 3. The patient has a history of psoriasis treated with topical steroids, but this information is not directly relevant to the current presentation. 4. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia (elevated heart rate), which is a common effect of stimulants. 5. The physical exam reveals a dry mouth and conjunctival injection, which can be associated with stimulant use, particularly cocaine. 6. The neurological exam is mostly intact, with normal strength and sensation in the upper and lower extremities, which suggests that the substance is not causing significant peripheral neuropathy. 7. The absence of significant impairment in cranial nerves II-XII and normal sensation in the extremities makes it less likely that the patient is experiencing a severe CNS depressant effect. Considering these points, the most likely intoxication in this patient is cocaine, as it is a CNS stimulant that can cause anxiety, tachycardia, and physical signs such as dry mouth and conjunctival injection, without significant CNS depression or peripheral neuropathy.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
