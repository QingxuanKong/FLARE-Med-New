    "question": "A 65-year-old woman presented to the emergency room due to progressive dyspnea. She is a known hypertensive but is poorly compliant with medications. The patient claims to have orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and easy fatigability. On physical examination, the blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. There is prominent neck vein distention. An S3 gallop, bibasilar crackles, and grade 3 bipedal edema were also detected. A 2d echo was performed, which showed a decreased ejection fraction (32%). Which of the following drugs should not be given to this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Furosemide",
        "B": "Nesiritide",
        "C": "Metoprolol",
        "D": "Digoxin"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings to determine the underlying condition. The patient presents with progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, easy fatigability, and signs of heart failure (prominent neck vein distention, S3 gallop, bibasilar crackles, and grade 3 bipedal edema). The echocardiogram reveals a decreased ejection fraction of 32%, indicating heart failure. Given these findings, the patient likely has congestive heart failure (CHF).\\n\\nConsidering the patient's heart failure status, we need to evaluate the potential effects of each medication option on her condition.\\n\\nFurosemide (A) is a loop diuretic commonly used in the treatment of CHF to reduce fluid overload and alleviate symptoms. It is a suitable option for this patient.\\n\\nNesiritide (B) is a B-type natriuretic peptide analogue that also reduces fluid overload and is used in the treatment of acute decompensated CHF. It can be considered for this patient.\\n\\nMetoprolol (C) is a beta-blocker that can help reduce the heart rate and decrease the workload on the heart, making it a suitable option for CHF management.\\n\\nDigoxin (D) is a digitalis glycoside that increases the force of cardiac contractions, but it is contraindicated in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), as it can worsen the condition by increasing the heart's workload and potentially leading to arrhythmias.\\n\\nBased on the patient's decreased ejection fraction, the correct answer is D. Digoxin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
