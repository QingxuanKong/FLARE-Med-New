    "question": "A 48-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his son with a fever over the past day. The patient\u2019s son adds that his father has been having some behavioral problems, as well, and that he was complaining about bugs crawling over his skin this morning even though there were no insects. Past medical history is unremarkable. No current medications. The patient was an alcoholic for several years but abruptly quit drinking 5 days ago. The patient\u2019s temperature is 40.0\u00b0C (104.0\u00b0F), pulse is 130/min, blood pressure is 146/88 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical examination, he is confused, restless, agitated, and lacks orientation to time, place or person. Which of the following the most appropriate initial course of treatment of this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Chlorpromazine",
        "B": "Clonidine",
        "C": "Diazepam",
        "D": "Haloperidol"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's symptoms, which include fever, confusion, agitation, and hallucinations (as evidenced by the complaint of bugs crawling over his skin), along with a recent history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal symptoms (abrupt cessation of alcohol consumption 5 days ago), the primary concern is delirium tremens (DTs), a severe form of alcohol withdrawal. DTs can cause significant autonomic instability, leading to hypertension, tachycardia, and fever. The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with this diagnosis. The initial treatment for DTs typically involves the administration of benzodiazepines, which are effective in reducing the severity of withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, hallucinations, and autonomic instability. Among the options provided, Clonidine is not typically used as a first-line treatment for DTs, as it can actually worsen the symptoms of hypertension. Chlorpromazine and Diazepam can be used in the treatment of DTs, but Diazepam is more commonly used due to its rapid onset of action and effectiveness in managing seizures and autonomic instability. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, can also be used in the treatment of DTs, particularly if there are prominent psychotic symptoms, but it is not the first choice due to the risk of exacerbating the patient's confusion and agitation. The most appropriate initial treatment choice among the options provided is Diazepam, as it is effective in reducing the severity of DTs and can be administered intravenously, which is crucial in an acute setting like the emergency department.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
