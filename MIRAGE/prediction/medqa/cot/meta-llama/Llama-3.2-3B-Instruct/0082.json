    "question": "A 44-year-old African-American woman comes to the physician for a routine examination. She is concerned about cancer because her uncle died of metastatic melanoma 1 year ago. She has no history of serious illness and does not take any medication. She has been working in a law firm for the past 20 years and travels to the Carribean regularly with her husband. Examination of her skin shows no abnormal moles or warts. This woman is at greatest risk of which of the following types of melanoma?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Desmoplastic",
        "B": "Nodular",
        "C": "Acral lentiginous",
        "D": "Superficial spreading"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To determine the type of melanoma the woman is at greatest risk of, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step: 1. **Family History of Melanoma**: The woman has a first-degree relative (uncle) who died from metastatic melanoma. This increases her risk of developing melanoma, especially if the relative was diagnosed at an early age. 2. **Skin Examination**: The examination shows no abnormal moles or warts. This is a good sign as most melanomas arise from pre-existing moles or warts. 3. **Occupation and Lifestyle**: Working in a law firm for 20 years and traveling to the Caribbean regularly might increase her exposure to UV radiation, which is a known risk factor for melanoma. However, the duration and intensity of sun exposure are not specified, making it difficult to assess its impact. 4. **Ethnicity**: Being African-American increases the risk of certain types of melanoma, particularly Acral lentiginous melanoma. Considering these factors, the risk factors are more closely aligned with **Acral lentiginous melanoma**. Acral lentiginous melanoma is more common in individuals with darker skin types (like African-Americans) and is often associated with a higher risk in individuals with a family history of melanoma. It typically arises on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or under the nails. Therefore, the answer is: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The woman's African-American ethnicity and family history of melanoma, combined with no other significant risk factors, make Acral lentiginous melanoma the most likely type she is at risk of developing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" } ```",
