    "question": "A 3-week-old male newborn is brought to the physician because of an inward turning of his left forefoot. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation by cesarean section because of breech presentation. The pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios. Examination shows concavity of the medial border of the left foot with a skin crease just below the ball of the great toe. The lateral border of the left foot is convex. The heel is in neutral position. Tickling the lateral border of the foot leads to correction of the deformity. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the left foot shows an increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Foot abduction brace",
        "B": "Arthrodesis of the forefoot",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The newborn has an inward turning of the left forefoot, also known as adduction or inversion of the foot. This is accompanied by a skin crease just below the ball of the great toe, which is a classic sign of congenital vertical talus. The heel is in a neutral position, and the lateral border of the foot is convex. 2. **Prenatal History**: The patient was born at 38 weeks' gestation via cesarean section due to breech presentation and had oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid levels). 3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The presence of a concavity of the medial border of the foot with a skin crease just below the ball of the great toe, along with the correction of the deformity when the lateral border is tickled, suggests a congenital vertical talus. 4. **Radiographic Findings**: The X-ray shows an increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones, which is consistent with a congenital vertical talus. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a congenital vertical talus or rocker-bottom foot, which is a deformity of the foot characterized by an abnormal alignment of the tibia and fibula, leading to an increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones. Now, let's consider the management options: - **A. Foot abduction brace**: This might be considered for some cases of foot deformities but is not typically the first-line treatment for congenital vertical talus. - **B. Arthrodesis of the forefoot**: This surgical procedure involves fusing the joints in the foot, which is not typically considered a first-line treatment for congenital vertical talus. - **C. Reassurance**: Given the presence of a significant deformity and radiographic evidence of an increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones, reassurance is not an appropriate management strategy. - **D. Tarsometatarsal capsulotomy**: This surgical procedure involves releasing the ligaments that connect the tarsal and metatarsal bones to improve the alignment of the foot. It is a common treatment for congenital vertical talus. **Answer Choice**: D. Tarsometatarsal capsulotomy is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient due to the presence of a significant deformity and radiographic evidence of an increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones. ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key points from the scenario include a congenital vertical talus with a classic presentation of an inward turning of the foot, skin crease, and increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones on X-ray. The most appropriate management strategy for congenital vertical talus is surgical intervention to correct the deformity. Tarsometatarsal capsulotomy is a common treatment for this condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
