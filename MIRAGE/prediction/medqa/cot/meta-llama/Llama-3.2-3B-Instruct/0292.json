    "question": "A 28-year-old female visits her physician for workup of a new onset diastolic murmur found on physical examination. Past medical history is insignificant. Her temperature is 37.0 degrees C, blood pressure is 115/75 mm Hg, pulse is 76/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. The patient denies dyspnea, fatigue, and syncope. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a large, pedunculated tumor in the left atrium. This patient is most at risk for:",

        "A": "Abrupt hypotension",
        "B": "Sudden cardiac death",
        "C": "Acute arterial occlusion",
        "D": "Septic embolism"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's presentation of a new onset diastolic murmur and a large, pedunculated tumor in the left atrium on transthoracic echocardiography, the most likely diagnosis is a left atrial myxoma. This type of tumor can obstruct blood flow through the mitral valve, leading to a diastolic murmur. The patient's symptoms are non-specific and do not indicate acute obstruction or significant hemodynamic compromise, which reduces the risk of sudden cardiac death (B). While left atrial myxomas can cause embolic events, the patient's lack of symptoms such as syncope, dyspnea, or fatigue makes septic embolism (D) less likely. The tumor is pedunculated, which means it is attached to the left atrial wall by a stalk, and is less likely to cause acute arterial occlusion (C). This type of tumor is more likely to cause intermittent obstruction of blood flow, leading to intermittent symptoms. Therefore, the most likely complication of this patient's condition is abrupt hypotension (A) due to intermittent obstruction of blood flow through the mitral valve, which can lead to a sudden drop in blood pressure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
