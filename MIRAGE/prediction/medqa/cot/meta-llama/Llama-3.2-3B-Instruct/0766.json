    "question": "A 16-year-old healthy female presents to her pediatrician concerned that she has not had a menstrual period. She has no past medical history and takes no medications. She plays volleyball and gets good grades in school. Her BMI is 22 kg/m2. Physical examination reveals normal female external genitalia and pubic hair along the mons pubis and superomedial thighs. Her breasts appear normal. Transabdominal ultrasound reveals an absent uterus. Serum testosterone levels is within the normal range for females. What is the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Pituitary tumor",
        "B": "Absence of second X chromosome",
        "C": "Androgen receptor mutation",
        "D": "Failure of paramesonephric duct development"

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's consider the key points from the patient's presentation and the potential causes listed as options. The patient is a 16-year-old female with primary amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) and normal female external genitalia and pubic hair. The absence of a uterus on transabdominal ultrasound is a crucial finding. This suggests a possible issue with the development of the reproductive system. Option A, a pituitary tumor, is unlikely as it would not typically cause the absence of the uterus. Pituitary tumors can affect hormone production, but they would not directly affect the development of the uterus. Option B, the absence of the second X chromosome, is a possible cause of Turner syndrome, which is characterized by short stature, delayed puberty, and ovarian dysgenesis. However, the patient's normal BMI and breast development suggest that she does not have Turner syndrome. Option C, an androgen receptor mutation, would likely result in a phenotype with male secondary sexual characteristics, which is not consistent with the patient's normal female external genitalia and pubic hair. Option D, failure of paramesonephric duct development, is a plausible cause of Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, which is a condition characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the uterus and vagina in individuals with a 46,XX karyotype. This condition is often associated with normal female external genitalia and normal hormone levels. Given the patient's normal female external genitalia, normal pubic hair, and absence of a uterus, the most likely cause of her condition is MRKH syndrome, which is associated with failure of paramesonephric duct development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
