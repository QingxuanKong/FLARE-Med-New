    "question": "A 25-year-old woman presents to her physician with a four month history of fatigue and weakness. The weakness has been progressive to the point where she cannot climb stairs and stand from a sitting position. She has only had one menstrual period in the last four months and has never been pregnant. She smokes a pack of cigarettes every day and does not take any medications. Her temperature is 98\u00b0F (36.7\u00b0C), blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 15/min. She is obese with a significant pannus. Abdominal striae are present. Her laboratory workup is notable for the following:\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 142 mEq/L\nCl-: 102 mEq/L\nK+: 3.9 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 25 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 314 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.1 mg/dL\nCa2+: 10.1 mg/dL\nAST: 9 U/L\nALT: 8 U/L\n24-hour urinary cortisol: 470 \u00b5g (< 300 \u00b5g)\nSerum cortisol 30 \u00b5g/mL (5-23 \u00b5g/dL)\nSerum adrenocorticotropin-releasing hormone (ACTH) 2 pg/mL (> 5 pg/mL)\n\nA 48-hour high dose dexamethasone suppression trial shows that her serum cortisol levels do not decrease. What is the best next step in management?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, including weight gain, hypertension, hirsutism, and hyperglycemia. The laboratory results are consistent with Cushing's syndrome, as evidenced by elevated cortisol levels and lack of suppression on high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The next step in management is to determine the source of the excess cortisol production. The most common causes of Cushing's syndrome are adrenal tumors (most commonly adrenal adenomas), ectopic ACTH-producing tumors, and pituitary tumors. Given the lack of suppression on high-dose dexamethasone suppression test, it is less likely that the source is a pituitary tumor. The next step is to evaluate the adrenal glands for a tumor. An MRI of the adrenal glands is the most appropriate next step to evaluate for an adrenal adenoma or other adrenal abnormalities.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
