    "question": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. Over the past 8 months, his mother reports difficulty understanding the boy's speech. On occasion during this period, she has noticed that he does not respond when called by name and cannot follow 1-step instructions. He has a history of recurrent ear infections treated with antibiotics since birth. He is at the 60th percentile for length and 50th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. His speech is quiet and difficult to understand. Otoscopic examination shows retracted tympanic membranes bilaterally that are immobile on pneumatic otoscopy. Nasopharyngoscopy shows mild adenoid hypertrophy. Pure tone audiometry shows a conductive hearing loss of 26 dB on the right side and 28 dB on the left side. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Adenoidectomy",
        "B": "Tympanostomy tube insertion",
        "C": "Antihistamine therapy",
        "D": "Corticosteroid therapy\n\""
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 3-year-old boy presenting with symptoms of progressive hearing loss and speech difficulties, which are likely due to otitis media with effusion (OME). The key findings include retracted tympanic membranes, immobile tympanic membranes on pneumatic otoscopy, and conductive hearing loss on pure tone audiometry. The presence of adenoid hypertrophy on nasopharyngoscopy suggests a possible link to the development of OME. Given the child's age and symptoms, the most appropriate next step in management would be to consider surgical intervention to alleviate the Eustachian tube dysfunction, which is likely contributing to the hearing loss and OME.\\n\\nThe other options are not the most appropriate next step in management:\\n\\nAdenoidectomy (A) may be considered as an adjunctive treatment to improve Eustachian tube function, but it is not the primary treatment for OME.\\n\\nAntihistamine therapy (C) is not typically used to treat OME or conductive hearing loss.\\n\\nCorticosteroid therapy (D) is not indicated for the treatment of OME or conductive hearing loss.\\n\\nTympanostomy tube insertion (B) is the most appropriate next step in management as it will help to alleviate the Eustachian tube dysfunction, reduce the risk of further complications, and improve hearing and speech development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
