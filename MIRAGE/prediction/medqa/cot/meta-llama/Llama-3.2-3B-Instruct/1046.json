    "question": "An investigator is studying the frequency of polycythemia in a population of a remote, mountainous region. A representative sample of 100 men shows a normal distribution of hemoglobin concentration with a mean concentration of 17 g/dL and a standard error of 0.1 g/dL. Which of the following best represents the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL?",
    "options": {
        "A": "30%",
        "B": "15%",
        "C": "95%",
        "D": "99%"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To solve this problem, we need to understand what a normal distribution is and how to calculate probabilities. Given: - Mean (\u03bc) = 17 g/dL - Standard Error (SE) = 0.1 g/dL - Sample size (n) = 100 We are looking for the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL. Step 1: Calculate the Z-score for a hemoglobin concentration of 18 g/dL. Z = (X - \u03bc) / SE Z = (18 - 17) / 0.1 Z = 1 Step 2: Use a standard normal distribution table (Z-table) to find the probability that a value is greater than Z = 1. The Z-table typically shows the area to the left of a given Z-score. To find the area to the right (i.e., the probability that a value is greater than Z = 1), we subtract the value in the table from 1. The Z-table for Z = 1 shows an area of approximately 0.8413 to the left of the Z-score. Therefore, the area to the right (probability of a value greater than Z = 1) is: 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587 However, we need to convert this value into a percentage. Multiply by 100: 0.1587 * 100 = 15.87% Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get approximately 16%. None of the provided options match our calculated probability. However, the closest answer is B. 15%. ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we calculated the Z-score for a hemoglobin concentration of 18 g/dL and used a standard normal distribution table to find the probability that a value is greater than Z = 1.
