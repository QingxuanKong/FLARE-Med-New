    "question": "A 37-year-old woman presents to the clinic with pain and swelling of her legs. She states that she first noticed the swelling 6 weeks ago. Initially, the swelling was minimal, but now she is finding it difficult to walk and she can\u2019t fit into any of her shoes. Her medical history is significant for systemic lupus erythematosus. She takes ibuprofen and hydroxychloroquine. Her temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 153/86 mmHg, and pulse is 88 beats/min. Pitting edema to bilateral knees is noted on physical examination. Urinalysis reveals proteinuria. The patient is started on an immunosuppressant. Two days later the patient returns to clinic complaining of blood in her urine. A urinalysis reveals moderate erythrocytes but is negative for leukocyte esterase, nitrites, or crystals. Diffuse oozing of the bladder mucosa with neovascularization is seen on cystoscopy. Which of the following could have prevented the patient\u2019s condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Ifosfamide",
        "B": "Mesna",
        "C": "Methotrexate",
        "D": "Nitrofurantoin"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we first need to identify the patient's condition. The patient presents with pain, swelling, and difficulty walking, which suggests a possible diagnosis of nephropathy, likely due to her underlying systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The presence of proteinuria and hematuria (blood in the urine) further supports this diagnosis. The patient is started on an immunosuppressant, which is a common treatment for SLE. However, the development of hematuria after starting the immunosuppressant is a concerning side effect. The key to this question is the presence of diffuse oozing of the bladder mucosa with neovascularization on cystoscopy, which is indicative of hemorrhagic cystitis. This condition is a known side effect of certain immunosuppressive medications. The correct answer can be determined by identifying the medication that is most commonly associated with hemorrhagic cystitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
