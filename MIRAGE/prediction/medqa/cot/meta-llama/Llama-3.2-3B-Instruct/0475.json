    "question": "A 63-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of retrosternal chest pain. He describes it as 7 out of 10 in intensity. He has coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications are aspirin, simvastatin, metformin, and enalapril. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 33 years. On arrival, his pulse is 136/min and irregular, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Coronary angiogram",
        "B": "Intravenous esmolol",
        "C": "Intravenous amiodarone",
        "D": "Synchronized cardioversion"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with retrosternal chest pain, a classic symptom of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which is further exacerbated by his history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His tachycardia (pulse of 136/min) and hypotension (blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg) suggest a possible acute coronary syndrome or a cardiac arrhythmia. The patient's irregular pulse and low blood pressure may indicate a life-threatening arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. The ECG results are not provided, but given the clinical presentation, a cardiac arrhythmia is a strong possibility. The patient's symptoms and signs warrant immediate attention and stabilization before further diagnostic testing. The most appropriate next step is to stabilize the patient's hemodynamics before considering further diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. The patient's current medications (aspirin, simvastatin, metformin, and enalapril) do not directly address his acute symptoms. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to administer a medication to control the patient's tachycardia and restore a normal heart rate. Esmolol, a beta-blocker, is commonly used to control tachyarrhythmias and is often the first-line treatment for this purpose. The other options (coronary angiogram, intravenous amiodarone, and synchronized cardioversion) are more invasive or require further stabilization of the patient's hemodynamics before proceeding with these procedures. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to administer intravenous esmolol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
