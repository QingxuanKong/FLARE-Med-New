    "question": "A 62-year-old woman with a pancreatic insulinoma is being prepared for a laparoscopic enucleation of the tumor. After induction of general anesthesia, preparation of a sterile surgical field, and port placement, the surgeon needs to enter the space posterior to the stomach to access the pancreatic tumor. Which of the following ligaments must be cut in order to access this space?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Phrenoesophageal ligament",
        "B": "Gastrohepatic ligament",
        "C": "Phrenicocolic ligament",
        "D": "Ligamentum venosum"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To access the space posterior to the stomach and the pancreatic tumor, we need to understand the anatomy of the abdominal cavity and the relationship between the stomach and the surrounding structures. The phrenoesophageal ligament is a fibrous ligament that connects the lower border of the diaphragm to the lower border of the esophagus. The gastrohepatic ligament is a fibrous ligament that connects the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach. The phrenicocolic ligament is a fibrous ligament that connects the liver to the spleen. The ligamentum venosum is a fibrous ligament that connects the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava. To access the space posterior to the stomach, the surgeon needs to enter the lesser sac, also known as the omental bursa, which is located behind the stomach. The lesser sac is separated from the rest of the abdominal cavity by the free edge of the lesser omentum, which is formed by the hepatoduodenal ligament, the cystic duct, and the common bile duct. The hepatoduodenal ligament is attached to the liver and the lesser curvature of the stomach by the gastrohepatic ligament. Therefore, to access the lesser sac, the surgeon needs to cut the gastrohepatic ligament, which is attached to the liver and the lesser curvature of the stomach. This will allow the surgeon to enter the lesser sac and access the space posterior to the stomach.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
