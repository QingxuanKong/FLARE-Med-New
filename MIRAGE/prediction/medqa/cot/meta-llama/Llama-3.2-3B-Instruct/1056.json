    "question": "A 29-year-old man diagnosed with schizophrenia 4 years ago presents for follow-up to discuss his medication. The patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia 4 years ago and has since tried several antipsychotic medications, none of which have been able to treat his negative symptoms. He has changed to clozapine 2 weeks ago and says that he does feel better. His physical exam is unremarkable, and he is responding appropriately to questioning. If this patient\u2019s current medication is to be continued, which of the following laboratory tests should be ordered at this time?\n ",
    "options": {
        "A": "Slit-lamp examination",
        "B": "Electrocardiogram",
        "C": "Prolactin level",
        "D": "Complete blood count"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's current medication and potential side effects. Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication that is commonly used to treat treatment-resistant schizophrenia, including negative symptoms. One of the potential side effects of clozapine is agranulocytosis, a potentially life-threatening decrease in white blood cells. This side effect is more common in patients taking clozapine long-term. Given that the patient has been on clozapine for 2 weeks, it is essential to monitor for this potential side effect. The other options are not directly related to the potential side effects of clozapine. A slit-lamp examination is typically used to evaluate eye problems, an electrocardiogram is used to evaluate heart function, and a complete blood count (CBC) is a general blood test that can be used to evaluate a wide range of conditions. However, a CBC is not specific to clozapine and would not provide any additional information that would change the management of this patient's care. Therefore, the most appropriate test to order at this time is a CBC to monitor for agranulocytosis, which is a potential side effect of clozapine.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
