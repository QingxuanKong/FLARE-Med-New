    "question": "A 4-year-old previously healthy boy presents with 4 days of intermittent vomiting and 5-6 daily loose stools. His mother noted bloody stools and decreased oral intake of food and water over the last 24 hours. He is normally in daycare; however, he has been home for the past 3 days. On physical exam his temperature is 102.2\u00b0F (39\u00b0C), blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min and O2 saturation is 99% on room air. He has dry mucous membranes. On abdominal exam you note diffuse tenderness to palpation without rebound or guarding. There are no masses, hepatosplenomegaly, and bowel sounds are hyperactive. Ultrasound of the right lower quadrant is negative for appendicitis. Stool is guaiac positive. He receives 15mg/kg acetaminophen and fluids are started. The next day, he complains of lower extremity weakness and tingling. On repeat exam, lower extremity strength is 3/5 with diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following lab findings would most likely be seen in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Gram stain positive CSF",
        "B": "Peripheral eosinophilia",
        "C": "Xanthochromia on cerebrospinal fluid analysis",
        "D": "Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell count"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the patient's presentation and history: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 4-year-old boy with vomiting, loose stools, fever, abdominal tenderness, and decreased oral intake. He has been home for the past 3 days, which might indicate a non-infectious cause. 2. **Physical Exam Findings**: - Fever and abdominal tenderness without rebound or guarding suggest an infectious or inflammatory process. - The presence of guaiac-positive stools indicates gastrointestinal bleeding. - Dry mucous membranes and decreased oral intake might indicate dehydration. - The patient's vital signs are elevated, with tachycardia (increased heart rate) and hypertension (elevated blood pressure). 3. **Developmental Consideration**: The patient is in daycare, which increases the risk of infectious diseases, but the absence of masses, hepatosplenomegaly, and negative ultrasound for appendicitis makes a typical infectious cause less likely. 4. **New Symptoms**: The next day, the patient develops lower extremity weakness and tingling, with diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes. This suggests a neurological component to the illness. Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is **Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS)**, an autoimmune disorder that can follow a gastrointestinal infection. GBS is characterized by ascending paralysis, often starting in the lower extremities, and can be associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. Given this diagnosis, the most likely lab finding is: **\"D. Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell count\"** Explanation: In GBS, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein level is typically elevated due to the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and the presence of inflammatory cells. However, the cell count is usually normal, as the inflammation is primarily due to the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier rather than an infection. The other options are less likely: - A. Gram stain positive CSF would be more suggestive of a bacterial infection, which is not supported by the clinical presentation. - B. Peripheral eosinophilia might be seen in various conditions, but it is not a specific finding for GBS. - C. Xanthochromia on CSF analysis is typically seen in bacterial meningitis, which is not supported by the clinical presentation. Therefore, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is most consistent with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, which is characterized by ascending paralysis, gastrointestinal symptoms, and elevated CSF protein levels without a significant increase in cell count.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
