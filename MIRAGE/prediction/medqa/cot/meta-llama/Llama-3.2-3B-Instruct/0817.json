    "question": "A multi-specialty physician practice is meeting to determine which compensation scheme would best serve the practice and its patient population. Which of the following are true in regards to physician compensation?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Capitation poses the least financial risk to physicians",
        "B": "Fee-for-service pays physicians a set amount of money per unit time for every patient under their care",
        "C": "Fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization irrespective of quality",
        "D": "Fee-for-service poses the most amount of financial risk to physicians"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer: **Step 1:** Understand the concept of capitation and fee-for-service compensation schemes. - Capitation is a payment model where a physician practice is paid a fixed amount per patient, regardless of the actual services provided. - Fee-for-service is a model where physicians are paid for each service they provide, such as office visits, surgeries, or tests. **Step 2:** Analyze the financial risk associated with each option. - Capitation is considered a relatively low-risk model because the physician practice is guaranteed a certain amount of money per patient, regardless of the services provided. - Fee-for-service can be considered high-risk because the physician's income is directly tied to the number of services they provide. If they don't see many patients, they may not earn enough to cover their costs. **Step 3:** Consider how each compensation scheme may incentivize physician behavior. - Capitation may incentivize physicians to provide efficient care and avoid unnecessary tests or procedures, as they are paid a fixed amount regardless of the services provided. - Fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization, as they are paid more for each service provided. This could lead to overuse of services and increased healthcare costs. **Step 4:** Evaluate the statements based on the analysis. - A: Capitation poses the least financial risk to physicians, as it provides a guaranteed income per patient. - B: Fee-for-service pays physicians a set amount of money per unit time for every patient under their care, which is not accurate. Fee-for-service pays for each individual service provided, not per unit time. - C: Fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization irrespective of quality, which is true. - D: Fee-for-service poses the most amount of financial risk to physicians, as their income is directly tied to the number of services provided. **Answer:** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The correct answer is C. Fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization irrespective of quality. This is because fee-for-service pays for each individual service provided, which can lead to overuse of services and increased healthcare costs. The other options are not accurate: capitation poses the least financial risk to physicians, fee-for-service does not pay per unit time, and fee-for-service poses a significant financial risk to physicians.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
