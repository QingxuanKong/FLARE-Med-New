    "question": "A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of a painless, nonpruritic skin lesion on her right thigh. She initially thought it was an insect bite, but it has slowly increased in size over the past weeks. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98\u00b0F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a 0.8-cm hyperpigmented papule. When the skin lesion is squeezed, the surface retracts inwards. A photograph of the lesion is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Dermatofibroma",
        "B": "Cherry hemangioma",
        "C": "Actinic keratosis",
        "D": "Seborrheic keratosis"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and physical examination: 1. **Age and sex**: The patient is a 38-year-old woman. 2. **Symptoms**: A painless, nonpruritic (itchy) skin lesion on her right thigh that has been present for 1 month and has slowly increased in size. 3. **Physical examination findings**: - The lesion is a 0.8-cm hyperpigmented papule (a small, raised, darkened area of skin). - When the skin lesion is squeezed, the surface retracts inwards. 4. **Vital signs**: The patient's temperature, pulse, and blood pressure are within normal limits. Considering these points, let's evaluate the options: - **A. Dermatofibroma**: Dermatofibroma is a common skin growth that typically presents as a firm, painless, and usually solitary nodule. It is often caused by a minor injury, such as a pinprick or a scratch. While it can occur on the thigh, the key distinguishing feature is that it is usually firm and not hyperpigmented. The retraction upon squeezing doesn't fit well with dermatofibroma. - **B. Cherry hemangioma**: Cherry hemangiomas are benign vascular lesions that are usually bright red, shiny, and dome-shaped. They can be painful if they become inflamed but are generally not hyperpigmented or retractable upon squeezing. The description provided doesn't match this condition. - **C. Actinic keratosis**: Actinic keratosis is a precursor to squamous cell carcinoma, typically appearing as a rough, scaly patch or plaque, often on sun-exposed areas of the skin. The lesions are usually not hyperpigmented papules, and they are not typically retractable upon squeezing. - **D. Seborrheic keratosis**: Seborrheic keratoses are benign growths that are usually brown or black, flat or slightly raised, and often have a warty or wart-like appearance. They can be tender to the touch, especially if irritated, and can be retractable upon squeezing due to their fibrous nature. The description of a hyperpigmented papule that retracts upon squeezing fits well with this condition. Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Considering the patient's age, symptoms, and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a seborrheic keratosis. The key features that support this diagnosis are the hyperpigmented papule, which is a common presentation for seborrheic keratosis, and the retraction upon squeezing, which is also characteristic of this condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
