    "question": "A prominent male politician has secret homosexual desires. However, rather than engaging in homosexual behavior, he holds rallies against gay rights and regularly criticizes gay people. The politician is displaying which of the following defense mechanisms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Repression",
        "B": "Reaction formation",
        "C": "Denial",
        "D": "Displacement"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this, let's analyze the given situation step by step. 1. The politician has secret homosexual desires, which indicates he has an unconscious thought or feeling that he does not want to acknowledge or accept. 2. However, he is expressing these desires through opposition to gay rights and criticism of gay people, which seems to be the opposite of what one would expect from someone with homosexual desires. 3. This discrepancy between his secret desires and his public actions suggests that the politician is using a defense mechanism to cope with his unconscious feelings. 4. Now, let's examine the options: - Repression (A) involves pushing uncomfortable thoughts or feelings into the unconscious mind, which doesn't seem to be the case here as the politician is actively expressing his feelings through public statements. - Reaction formation (B) involves behaving in a way that is the opposite of one's true feelings, often as a way to cope with the anxiety or discomfort associated with those feelings. This seems to fit the situation. - Denial (C) involves refusing to acknowledge a reality or feeling, which doesn't apply here as the politician is openly expressing his feelings through public statements. - Displacement (D) involves redirecting emotions or desires from one object or situation to another, which doesn't seem to be the case here as the politician is targeting gay people directly. 5. Based on the analysis, the politician is using reaction formation as a defense mechanism to cope with his secret homosexual desires by behaving in a way that is the opposite of what one would expect from someone with those desires.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
