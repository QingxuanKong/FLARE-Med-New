    "question": "A 72-year-old man develops reduced urine output and a serum creatinine concentration of 2.9 mg/dL three days after being hospitalized for acute diverticulitis. On admission, a complete blood count showed a hemoglobin concentration of 15.5 g/dL and a leukocyte count of 14,000/mm3. Urinalysis showed 2+ proteinuria, and serum studies showed a blood glucose of 145 mg/dL and a creatinine concentration of 1.2 mg/dL. A CT scan of the abdomen confirmed the diagnosis. Therapy with intravenous ketoprofen, piperacillin, and tazobactam was begun, and the patient was placed on bowel rest. He has a history of hypertension, chronic constipation, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin, metoprolol, and losartan. Today, his temperature is 37.7\u00b0C (99.9\u00b0F), pulse is 97/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 135/87 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft on physical examination, and there is tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current renal findings?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Gastrointestinal blood loss",
        "B": "Adverse drug reaction",
        "C": "Dehydration",
        "D": "Contrast administration"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's clinical presentation and history in the context of the treatment he has received. The patient has developed reduced urine output and a significant increase in serum creatinine concentration (from 1.2 mg/dL to 2.9 mg/dL in 3 days), which suggests acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient has been treated with intravenous ketoprofen, piperacillin, and tazobactam, and has been placed on bowel rest. The patient has a history of hypertension, chronic constipation, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient's current medications include insulin, metoprolol, and losartan. The patient's vital signs are stable, with no signs of acute infection or sepsis. The physical examination is notable for tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant, which is consistent with the diagnosis of diverticulitis. Considering the patient's treatment with intravenous antibiotics, the most likely cause of his current renal findings needs to be evaluated. Option A, gastrointestinal blood loss, is unlikely as the patient is on bowel rest and has no other signs of significant blood loss. Option C, dehydration, is also unlikely as the patient's vital signs do not indicate dehydration, and the patient is receiving intravenous fluids. Option D, contrast administration, is not relevant as the patient has not received any contrast studies. Option B, adverse drug reaction, is the most likely cause of the patient's current renal findings. The patient is receiving intravenous ketoprofen, which is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) known to cause renal impairment, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or those taking other nephrotoxic medications. The patient's history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension also increases his risk for renal impairment. The patient's elevated serum creatinine concentration and reduced urine output are consistent with acute kidney injury due to NSAID toxicity. The patient's hemoglobin concentration of 15.5 g/dL is also low, which may be related to the patient's renal impairment and the potential for NSAID-induced anemia. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's current renal findings is an adverse drug reaction to ketoprofen.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
