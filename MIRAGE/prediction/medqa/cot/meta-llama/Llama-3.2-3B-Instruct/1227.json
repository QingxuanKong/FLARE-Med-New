    "question": "A 58-year-old male is diagnosed with hypertension and started on daily propranolol after failing antihypertensive therapy with other medications. Three months later, his blood pressure appears to be adequately controlled on this therapy. While working in his garden one afternoon, the patient is stung by a wasp and experiences a severe anaphylactic reaction that is subsequently treated with epinephrine. Which of the following effects would be expected upon administration of this epinephrine treatment?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Decreased bronchodilation",
        "B": "Increased motility of the gastrointestinal tract",
        "C": "Decreased heart rate",
        "D": "Increased heart rate"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break it down step by step. The patient is taking propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, for hypertension. Propranolol blocks the effects of epinephrine (adrenaline) at beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors. Beta-1 receptors are primarily found in the heart, causing an increase in heart rate and contractility. Beta-2 receptors are found in smooth muscle, causing relaxation and increased blood flow. The patient experiences a severe anaphylactic reaction and is treated with epinephrine. Epinephrine is a sympathomimetic agent that stimulates both alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors. The effects of epinephrine on the heart are as follows: - It stimulates beta-1 receptors, increasing heart rate and contractility. - It stimulates alpha-1 receptors, causing vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Given that the patient is already on propranolol, which blocks beta-1 receptors, we can expect that the beta-1 blocking effects of propranolol will counteract the beta-1 stimulating effects of epinephrine. However, the key point here is that epinephrine also has effects on the heart that are not blocked by propranolol, such as stimulating alpha-1 receptors, leading to vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Now, looking at the options provided: A. Decreased bronchodilation: Epinephrine actually increases bronchodilation through beta-2 receptors, which is not blocked by propranolol. So, this option is incorrect. B. Increased motility of the gastrointestinal tract: Epinephrine actually decreases gastrointestinal motility through alpha-2 receptors, which is not blocked by propranolol. So, this option is incorrect. C. Decreased heart rate: As explained earlier, epinephrine increases heart rate through beta-1 receptors, and propranolol blocks these receptors, so this option is incorrect. D. Increased heart rate: This is the correct answer. Epinephrine stimulates beta-1 receptors, increasing heart rate, and this effect is not blocked by propranolol, which blocks beta-1 receptors. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Increased heart rate.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
