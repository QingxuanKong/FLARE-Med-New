    "question": "A 40-year-old businessman who was previously well is brought into the emergency department by his assistant with a complaint of left-sided weakness after a chiropractic neck manipulation. He has never felt like this before. Past medical history is insignificant. His blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg, pulse 86/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F). A T2-weighted MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. The patient is treated with cervical immobilization, a course of steroids, and physical therapy. What other finding will most likely be seen in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion",
        "B": "Right-sided Horner's syndrome",
        "C": "Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement",
        "D": "Right-sided analgesia"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with sudden onset of left-sided weakness after a chiropractic neck manipulation. This suggests a traumatic injury to the spinal cord, which is consistent with a spinal cord lesion. 2. **MRI Findings**: The T2-weighted MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. This indicates a lesion affecting the spinal cord at the level of C5 (fifth cervical vertebra). This is a specific and localized lesion, which helps narrow down the possible causes. 3. **Possible Causes**: Given the traumatic origin of the lesion, possible causes include spinal cord compression, hemorrhage, or transection. However, the presence of a hemicord lesion suggests a more localized injury, possibly a compression injury. 4. **Symptoms and Signs**: The patient presents with left-sided weakness, which is a common symptom of spinal cord lesions. The weakness is likely due to the compression or injury of the corticospinal tract, which carries motor signals from the brain to the muscles. 5. **Options Analysis**: - A. Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion: This is possible but not the most likely finding. Spastic paralysis typically occurs when the lesion is above the level of the lesion, and the patient would exhibit weakness or paralysis below the level of the lesion. - B. Right-sided Horner's syndrome: This is unlikely as the lesion is on the left side, and Horner's syndrome typically affects the ipsilateral (same side) eye and face. - C. Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement: This is the most likely finding. The corticospinal tract crosses at the level of the medulla, so a lesion at C5 would affect the right corticospinal tract, causing right-sided weakness. - D. Right-sided analgesia: This is unlikely as the lesion is on the left side, and analgesia (numbness or loss of pain sensation) would be expected on the contralateral (opposite) side. **Answer**: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and MRI findings suggest a localized spinal cord lesion. The corticospinal tract crosses at the level of the medulla, so a lesion at C5 would affect the right corticospinal tract, causing right-sided weakness. This makes option C the most likely finding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
