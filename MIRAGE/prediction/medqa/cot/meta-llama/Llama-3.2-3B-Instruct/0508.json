    "question": "A 21-year-old old college student is brought to the emergency department by his roommates because he has been \"acting strangely.\" Over the last 7 months, he has claimed to hear voices telling him that he must prepare for the end of the world. He used to be a straight A student but started failing exams recently due to his erratic behavior. Furthermore, there are periods of time where he does not sleep for several days and redecorates the entire apartment. During those times he spends huge amounts of money on online shopping. These periods usually last for about 2 weeks and happen every other month. On physical exam, he appears unkept and irritated. He seems to respond to invisible stimuli, and he jumps from topic to topic without clear focus. Which of the following is most consistent with this patient's presentation?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Brief psychotic disorder",
        "B": "Schizoaffective disorder",
        "C": "Schizophreniform disorder",
        "D": "Schizotypal personality disorder"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking: 1. **Duration and onset of symptoms**: The patient's symptoms have been present for 7 months, which is a significant duration for a psychotic disorder. This suggests a more chronic condition rather than an acute episode. 2. **Nature of symptoms**: The patient reports hearing voices, which is a hallmark symptom of psychotic disorders. However, the voices are described as telling him to \"prepare for the end of the world,\" which is a delusional theme. 3. **Disorganization and disorganized thinking**: The patient's erratic behavior, lack of sleep, and jumping from topic to topic without clear focus are indicative of disorganized thinking and behavior, which is consistent with psychotic disorders. 4. **Impact on functioning**: The patient's academic performance has declined significantly, and he has been spending excessive amounts of money on online shopping, indicating a significant impact on his daily functioning. 5. **Substance use or other medical conditions**: There is no mention of substance use or other medical conditions that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms. 6. **Schizotypal personality disorder**: While the patient exhibits some social anxiety (appearing unkept and irritated), this is not sufficient to support a diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder, which requires a pattern of odd thinking and behavior that is pervasive across multiple contexts. 7. **Brief psychotic disorder**: This diagnosis is less likely due to the duration of symptoms (7 months) and the presence of delusions and disorganized thinking. 8. **Schizophreniform disorder**: This diagnosis is more likely, as it involves a period of at least 1 month but less than 6 months of symptoms, including hallucinations and disorganized thinking, with a significant impact on functioning. The patient's symptoms have been present for 7 months, which is close to the threshold for schizophrenia, but the duration is still within the range for schiziform disorder. Considering these points, the most appropriate diagnosis is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms, including hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and significant impact on functioning, are most consistent with schiziform disorder due to the duration of symptoms (7 months) and the presence of delusions and disorganized thinking.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
