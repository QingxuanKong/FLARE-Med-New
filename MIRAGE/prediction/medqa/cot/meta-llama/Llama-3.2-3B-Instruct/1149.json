    "question": "A 21-month-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. His mother noticed deformities in both of his legs since he started walking independently. He has been healthy apart from an upper respiratory tract infection 6 months ago. He was delivered at 38 weeks' gestation. His 6-year-old sister was treated for developmental dysplasia of the hip. He can kick a ball and say a 2-word phrase. He plays well with other children at his day care. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 40th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows closed anterior and posterior fontanelles. The knees do not stay together when both the feet and ankles are placed together. The gait is unremarkable. The mother is concerned that he has a growth disorder. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Vitamin D supplementation",
        "B": "Reassurance and follow-up",
        "C": "X-ray of the lower extremities",
        "D": "Bracing of the lower extremities"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this case, let's consider the key points provided: 1. The child is 21 months old and was born at 38 weeks' gestation, which is slightly premature. 2. The child has been experiencing deformities in both legs since he started walking independently, which is a significant developmental milestone. 3. The child's 6-year-old sister was treated for developmental dysplasia of the hip, which increases the likelihood of a similar condition in the younger sibling. 4. The child's height and weight percentiles are within normal limits, which suggests that there is no overt evidence of a growth disorder. 5. The child's vital signs are within normal limits, and the examination shows closed anterior and posterior fontanelles, indicating normal skull development. 6. The child can kick a ball and say a 2-word phrase, which suggests normal cognitive and motor development. 7. The child plays well with other children at his day care, indicating social development is on track. 8. The knees do not stay together when both the feet and ankles are placed together, which is a key clinical finding. Given these points, the most likely diagnosis is Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH), which is a common condition in young children. The child's family history of DDH in a sibling further increases the risk. The next step in management should be to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the condition. X-ray of the lower extremities is the most appropriate next step in management, as it will provide a definitive diagnosis and help in planning further treatment if necessary. Vitamin D supplementation, reassurance and follow-up, and bracing of the lower extremities are not the most appropriate next steps in management, as they do not address the underlying diagnosis and may not provide any benefits in this case. Therefore, the correct answer is C. X-ray of the lower extremities.\"}",
