    "question": "A 38-year-old G4P3 presents to her obstetrician\u2019s office for her 20-week anatomy ultrasound. She reports that she feels well and has not experienced any contractions or vaginal bleeding. She also reports good fetal movement. The patient declined prenatal screening earlier in the pregnancy for religious reasons but would now like an anatomy ultrasound to ensure the fetus is growing appropriately. The patient\u2019s previous pregnancies were uncomplicated, and she delivered three healthy babies at full term. On the ultrasound, the technician observes a male fetus with likely intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). She also notes microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, and clenched fists with overlapping fingers. The technician further notes a medium-sized ventricular septal defect (VSD). The amniotic fluid index (AFI) is 26 cm.\n\nWhich of the following additional findings is most likely to be observed in this fetus?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Cleft palate",
        "B": "Epicanthal folds",
        "C": "Micropthlamia",
        "D": "Prominent occiput"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the ultrasound findings of microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, and a medium-sized ventricular septal defect (VSD), the patient's fetus is likely to have Down syndrome (Trisomy 21). The presence of Down syndrome is often associated with other physical characteristics, such as epicanthal folds, which are skin folds of the upper eyelid that extend onto the white part of the eye. The other options listed are not as strongly associated with Down syndrome. Cleft palate is a common finding in Down syndrome, but it is not as specific as epicanthal folds. Microphthalmia is a rare ocular anomaly that can be associated with Down syndrome, but it is not as commonly found as epicanthal folds. Convex-rounded feet and clenched fists with overlapping fingers are also characteristic of Down syndrome, but they are not as specific as epicanthal folds. Prominent occiput is a common feature of Down syndrome, but it is not as specific as epicanthal folds in distinguishing the condition. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this fetus is epicanthal folds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
