    "question": "Patients with the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia make a specific type of hemoglobin known as HgbS. This mutation results in the sickling of their red blood cells when exposed to inciting factors such as hypoxic conditions. Patients are often treated with hydroxyurea, which has which of the following direct effects on their hemoglobin physiology?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Decreases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin",
        "B": "Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)",
        "C": "Decreases levels of HgbS",
        "D": "Decreases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break down the effects of hydroxyurea on hemoglobin physiology in patients with sickle cell anemia. Hydroxyurea is a medication commonly used to manage sickle cell anemia. It works by increasing the production of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF), which is a type of hemoglobin that is not affected by the sickling process. By increasing HgbF levels, hydroxyurea helps to reduce the frequency of sickling events and alleviate symptoms of the disease. The other options are incorrect because hydroxyurea does not directly decrease oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin (A), nor does it directly decrease or increase levels of HgbS (C and D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
