    "question": "A 40-year-old male presents to your office complaining that he is too weak to climb stairs or brush his hair. He denies any headaches or change in vision. A muscle biopsy reveals CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Systemic lupus erythematosus",
        "B": "Polymyalgia rheumatica",
        "C": "Polymyositis",
        "D": "Dermatomyositis"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking: 1. The patient presents with muscle weakness, which is a key symptom of several muscle-related conditions. However, the specific symptoms of weakness in daily activities like climbing stairs or brushing hair suggest a condition that affects muscle function and strength. 2. The patient denies any headaches or change in vision, which makes conditions like polymyalgia rheumatica (B) less likely, as it often presents with morning headaches and visual disturbances. 3. The presence of CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium is a critical clue. CD8+ T cells are typically associated with cell-mediated immunity, and their presence in the endomysium suggests an autoimmune process. 4. Systemic lupus erythematosus (A) is a systemic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the muscles. However, it is not typically associated with CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium. 5. Polymyositis (C) is an inflammatory muscle disease that affects the muscle fibers, but it is typically associated with CD4+ lymphocyte infiltration, not CD8+. 6. Dermatomyositis (D) is an inflammatory muscle disease characterized by skin rash and muscle weakness. It is often associated with CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium, which is consistent with the biopsy findings in this patient. Based on these considerations, the most likely diagnosis is dermatomyositis. ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's muscle weakness, lack of headaches or visual disturbances, and CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium point towards dermatomyositis.
