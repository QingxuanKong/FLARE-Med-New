    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider concerned that she may be pregnant. She has a history of regular menstruation every 4 weeks that lasts about 4 days with mild to moderate bleeding, but she missed her last period 2 weeks ago. A home pregnancy test was positive. She has a 6-year history of hyperthyroidism that is well-controlled with daily methimazole. She is currently asymptomatic and has no complaints or concerns. A blood specimen is taken and confirms the diagnosis. Additionally, her thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is 2.0 \u03bcU/mL. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Continue methimazole",
        "B": "Discontinue methimazole, start propylthiouracil",
        "C": "Add glucocorticoids",
        "D": "Refer for radioiodine therapy"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this patient's situation, we need to consider the potential risks and benefits of continuing or adjusting her thyroid medication during pregnancy. First, it's essential to note that hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland produces excess thyroid hormones, which can pose risks to the fetus if left untreated. The patient's TSH level of 2.0 \u03bcU/mL indicates that her hyperthyroidism is not overtly active, but it's still a concern. The patient is currently on methimazole, which is a commonly used antithyroid medication during pregnancy. However, propylthiouracil (PTU) is generally preferred over methimazole in the first trimester due to a lower risk of hepatotoxicity. The American Thyroid Association recommends that women with hyperthyroidism on methimazole during pregnancy should be switched to PTU if possible. Therefore, option B (Discontinue methimazole, start propylthiouracil) is the most appropriate next step. Option A (Continue methimazole) is not recommended due to the potential risks associated with continued methimazole use during pregnancy. Option C (Add glucocorticoids) is not relevant to the management of hyperthyroidism and is not indicated in this scenario. Option D (Refer for radioiodine therapy) is not suitable during pregnancy as it involves exposure to radioactive iodine, which can harm the fetus. Therefore, the correct answer is B (Discontinue methimazole, start propylthiouracil).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
