    "question": "A previously healthy 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents because of fever and a rash for 6 days. His temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102\u00b0F). Examination shows right-sided anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, bilateral conjunctival injection, erythema of the tongue and lips, and a maculopapular rash involving the hands, feet, perineum, and trunk. Which of the following is the most common complication of this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Coronary artery aneurysm",
        "B": "Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis",
        "C": "Hearing loss",
        "D": "Retinopathy"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To approach this question, I will break down the clinical presentation and consider the potential diagnosis, then evaluate the complications listed as options. 1. **Clinical Presentation Analysis**: - Fever and rash in a previously healthy 3-year-old boy - Right-sided anterior cervical lymphadenopathy - Bilateral conjunctival injection - Erythema of the tongue and lips - Maculopapular rash involving the hands, feet, perineum, and trunk This presentation is highly suggestive of **Kawasaki Disease (KD)**, a systemic vasculitis that primarily affects children under the age of 5. The classic criteria for KD include fever for more than 5 days, bilateral conjunctival injection, erythema of the oral mucosa, changes in the lips, rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy. The rash in KD is typically maculopapular and can appear anywhere on the body, but often starts on the trunk and spreads to the extremities. 2. **Complications of Kawasaki Disease**: - Coronary artery aneurysms are a well-known and potentially life-threatening complication of KD. The inflammation in KD can cause damage to the coronary arteries, leading to aneurysm formation. - Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is not typically associated with KD. - Hearing loss is not a common complication of KD. - Retinopathy can occur in KD but is not as common or as immediately life-threatening as coronary artery aneurysms. 3. **Conclusion**: Given the clinical presentation consistent with Kawasaki Disease, the most common complication listed is coronary artery aneurysm. **Answer Choice:** ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of Kawasaki Disease, a systemic vasculitis primarily affecting children under 5.
