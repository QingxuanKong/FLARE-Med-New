    "question": "A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of mild left-sided abdominal pain when lifting heavy objects that has developed over the past 6 months. He has had a weight loss of 41 kgs (90 lbs) in the past year. Physical examination shows a soft bulge inferior and lateral to the navel on the left. A CT scan of the abdomen of a patient with the same condition is shown. Which of the following muscles is located directly medial to the pathology seen on the CT scan?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Psoas major",
        "B": "External oblique",
        "C": "Rectus abdominis",
        "D": "Transverse abdominal\n\""
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this question, we need to analyze the symptoms and the CT scan findings. Step 1: The patient presents with mild left-sided abdominal pain when lifting heavy objects and has experienced significant weight loss over the past year. This suggests a possible abdominal mass or tumor. Step 2: The physical examination reveals a soft bulge inferior and lateral to the navel on the left. This location is consistent with a mass or tumor in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen. Step 3: The question mentions a CT scan of the abdomen, but we don't have the actual image. However, based on the location of the bulge (inferior and lateral to the navel), we can infer that the pathology is likely in the lower abdominal wall. Step 4: The location of the bulge suggests that the pathology is likely in the lower abdominal wall, which is where the external oblique muscle is located. The external oblique muscle is one of the three flat muscles of the abdominal wall, and it is located on the surface of the abdomen, making it the most likely candidate. Step 5: The psoas major muscle is a deep muscle in the abdominal wall, located in the posterior abdominal wall, which is not consistent with the location of the bulge. Step 6: The rectus abdominis muscle is a midline muscle in the abdominal wall, which is also not consistent with the location of the bulge. Step 7: The transverse abdominal muscle is a deep muscle in the abdominal wall, located below the external oblique muscle, which is also not consistent with the location of the bulge. Conclusion: Based on the symptoms and the location of the bulge, the most likely muscle to be located directly medial to the pathology seen on the CT scan is the external oblique muscle. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with abdominal pain and weight loss, which suggests a possible abdominal mass or tumor.
