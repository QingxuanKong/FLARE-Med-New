    "question": "A 54-year-old man presents with the acute onset of seizures and hallucinations. The patient\u2019s wife says that he had been on a camping trip a few months earlier to study bats but otherwise has not traveled recently. Past medical history is significant for hypertension, managed medically with hydralazine and enalapril. The patient\u2019s condition rapidly deteriorates, and he passes away. An autopsy is performed and a histologic stained section of the brain is shown in the image. Which of the following receptors are targeted by the pathogen most likely responsible for this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "CCR5",
        "B": "Acetylcholine receptor",
        "C": "ICAM-1",
        "D": "GABA"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with acute onset of seizures and hallucinations, which suggests a neurological condition. The patient's recent history of studying bats is a significant clue, as it may indicate exposure to a zoonotic infection (a disease transmitted from animals to humans). 2. **Autopsy Result**: Although we can't see the image, the fact that an autopsy was performed implies that the cause of death is likely related to a pathological condition affecting the brain. 3. **Patient's Medical History**: The patient has hypertension, which is managed with hydralazine and enalapril. This information is useful to know, but it doesn't directly relate to the acute neurological symptoms. 4. **Pathogen Infection**: Given the patient's exposure to bats and the acute neurological symptoms, we should consider zoonotic infections that can cause such symptoms. One such infection is **Lyssavirus**, which includes rabies. Rabies is a viral disease that affects the central nervous system and can cause seizures, hallucinations, and death. 5. **Receptor Targeted by the Pathogen**: Lyssavirus, the causative agent of rabies, targets the **NMDA receptor** (not listed as an option), but another receptor that is also relevant to the symptoms is the **GABA receptor**. Some studies have suggested that rabies virus can bind to and modulate the activity of GABA receptors, which could contribute to the neurological symptoms observed in the patient. Given the options provided, the best answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Considering the patient's exposure to bats, the acute onset of seizures and hallucinations, and the potential for a zoonotic infection, the most likely pathogen responsible for this patient's condition is rabies. Rabies virus can modulate GABA receptors, which could contribute to the observed symptoms. Although NMDA receptors are also relevant, they are not listed as an option.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
