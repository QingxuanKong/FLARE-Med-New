    "question": "A 38-year-old woman undergoes a partial thyroidectomy for an enlarged thyroid gland compressing the trachea. During surgery, a young surgeon ligates the inferior thyroid arteries as close to the poles as possible to prevent intraoperative hemorrhage. 2 weeks later, the patient presents to the outpatient clinic with hoarseness. What could be the most likely cause of her hoarseness?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Internal laryngeal nerve injury",
        "B": "Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury",
        "C": "External laryngeal nerve injury",
        "D": "Laryngeal edema"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key elements and analyze the situation step by step.\\n\\nThe patient underwent a partial thyroidectomy, which involves the removal of a portion of the thyroid gland. The inferior thyroid arteries were ligated close to the poles during the surgery. This is a common practice to minimize bleeding during the procedure.\\n\\nThe patient presents with hoarseness 2 weeks post-surgery, which suggests a potential injury to a structure related to the larynx (voice box).\\n\\nThe nerves involved in voice production are the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) and the external laryngeal nerve (ELN). The RLN is responsible for most of the movements of the vocal cords, while the ELN primarily controls the tension of the vocal cords.\\n\\nGiven that the inferior thyroid arteries were ligated close to the poles of the thyroid gland, there is a high risk of injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which runs close to these arteries. The RLN is more susceptible to injury during thyroid surgery due to its proximity to the surgical field.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely cause of the patient's hoarseness is an injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.\\n\\nConsidering the options provided,\\n\\nA. Internal laryngeal nerve injury - This nerve is not typically affected by the surgical procedure described.\\nB. Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury - This is the most likely cause given the proximity of the nerve to the ligated inferior thyroid arteries.\\nC. External laryngeal nerve injury - This nerve is less likely to be injured during the described procedure.\\nD. Laryngeal edema - This is unlikely to cause persistent hoarseness, as edema would typically resolve on its own within a few days.\\n\\nAnswer: B\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
