    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the side effect profile of Risperidone, a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic medication commonly used to treat schizophrenia. Risperidone is known for its efficacy in managing symptoms of schizophrenia but also carries a range of potential side effects. Let's evaluate each option given in the context of Risperidone therapy.\\n\\nA. Agranulocytosis - This is a potentially life-threatening decrease in white blood cells, which is a rare side effect of many antipsychotics, including Risperidone. However, it is not the most commonly associated side effect with Risperidone.\\n\\nB. Shortened QT interval - Risperidone can actually prolong the QT interval, which is a measure of the time it takes for the heart's ventricles to prepare for a new heartbeat. This is a known side effect of Risperidone, particularly at high doses or in patients with a history of QT prolongation.\\n\\nC. Gynecomastia - This is a condition where men develop breast tissue in the chest. Risperidone can cause hyperprolactinemia, which may lead to gynecomastia. This is a well-documented side effect of Risperidone, especially at higher doses or in males.\\n\\nD. Weight gain - Risperidone can cause weight gain in some patients, but this is not as commonly associated with Risperidone as some other antipsychotics. Weight gain is more commonly seen with other atypical antipsychotics like Olanzapine or Clozapine.\\n\\nConsidering the options, the most likely adverse effect of Risperidone therapy for this patient is gynecomastia, due to its association with hyperprolactinemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
