    "question": "A 60-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of sudden, painless loss of vision in her right eye that occurred 30 minutes ago while watching TV. She has coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus; she has had trouble adhering to her medication regimen. Her blood pressure is 160/85 mm Hg. Examination shows 20/50 vision in the left eye and no perception of light in the right eye. Direct pupillary reflex is present in the left eye, but absent in the right eye. Accommodation is intact bilaterally. Intraocular pressure is 16 mm Hg in the left eye and 18 mm Hg in the right eye. Fundoscopic examination of the right eye shows a pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula. The optic disc appears normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Retinal detachment",
        "B": "Central retinal artery occlusion",
        "C": "Acute angle-closure glaucoma",
        "D": "Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this case, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and examination findings. The patient presents with sudden, painless loss of vision in one eye, which suggests an acute ocular emergency. The absence of light perception in the affected eye and the presence of a pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula on fundoscopy are key findings. These findings suggest a vascular etiology for the vision loss. The patient's history of hypertension and coronary artery disease also raises the possibility of vascular disease affecting the eye. The absence of pain and the presence of a bright red area within the macula are particularly suggestive of a central retinal artery occlusion. The normal optic disc appearance and normal intraocular pressure also support this diagnosis. The patient's trouble adhering to her medication regimen may also be relevant, as uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes can increase the risk of vascular events, including retinal artery occlusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
