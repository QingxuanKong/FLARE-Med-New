    "question": "A 30-year-old man presents to the emergency room complaining of malaise. Two hours prior to presentation, he developed muscle cramps and nausea. He has had 3 episodes of non-bloody watery stools since his symptoms started. He reports that he has experienced similar symptoms multiple times over the past 5 years since he started working at his local zoo as a reptilian caretaker. His medical history is unremarkable. He takes fish oil and a multivitamin daily. His temperature is 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 17/min. On exam, he demonstrates sensitivity to bright light. He is tired-appearing but alert and fully oriented. A stool sample and culture demonstrates abundant non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-negative, and H2S-producing gram-negative bacilli. The pathogen responsible for this patient\u2019s condition relies on a virulence factor with which of the following mechanisms of action?",
    "options": {
        "A": "ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2",
        "B": "Blocking antibody attack on the O antigen",
        "C": "Cleaving immunoglobulin A molecules",
        "D": "Cleaving lecithin"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with malaise, muscle cramps, nausea, and episodes of non-bloody watery stools. These symptoms have recurred over the past 5 years, suggesting a chronic condition. 2. **Occupational History**: The patient works at a local zoo as a reptilian caretaker. This suggests exposure to reptiles, which is a common risk factor for certain bacterial infections. 3. **Laboratory Findings**: The stool sample culture demonstrates abundant non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-negative, and H2S-producing gram-negative bacilli. This description is consistent with Campylobacter species, which are commonly found in poultry and reptiles. 4. **Sensitivity to Bright Light**: The patient's sensitivity to bright light is a classic symptom of campylobacteriosis, which can cause photophobia. Given these clues, the pathogen is likely Campylobacter jejuni, a common cause of campylobacteriosis in humans. 5. **Virulence Factors**: Campylobacter jejuni relies on a virulence factor that involves ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2. This process inhibits protein synthesis, allowing the bacteria to survive within the host cell. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the clinical presentation, occupational history, and laboratory findings, the pathogen is likely Campylobacter jejuni. Campylobacter jejuni relies on the virulence factor that involves ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2, which inhibits protein synthesis and allows the bacteria to survive within the host cell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
