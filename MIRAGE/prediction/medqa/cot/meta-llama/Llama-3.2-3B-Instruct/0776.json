    "question": "A clinical trial is conducted to test the efficacy of a new drug, A, to treat tinea versicolor. A total of 500 participants are recruited for the study and are randomized into 2 groups in equal numbers. Group 1, the study treatment group, is given drug A, while group 2, the control group, is given the current standard antifungal therapy. After the completion of therapy, 190 participants from the study treatment group and 165 participants from the control group are cured. Which calculation below represents the number needed to treat for the new drug?",
    "options": {
        "A": "25/250",
        "B": "250/25",
        "C": "190/250",
        "D": "355/500"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To determine the number needed to treat (NNT) for the new drug, we need to calculate the number of participants that need to be treated with the new drug to prevent one additional case of tinea versicolor. Step 1: Calculate the number of participants cured in the control group (standard treatment). Number of participants cured in the control group = 165 Step 2: Calculate the number of participants cured in the study treatment group (new drug). Number of participants cured in the study treatment group = 190 Step 3: Calculate the relative risk reduction (RRR) for the new drug. RRR = ((Number of participants cured in the control group - Number of participants cured in the study treatment group) / Number of participants in the control group) * 100 RRR = ((165 - 190) / 165) * 100 RRR = (-25 / 165) * 100 RRR = -15.15% However, since we are looking for the number needed to treat, we need to consider the absolute risk reduction (ARR) instead of RRR. ARR = (Number of participants cured in the control group - Number of participants cured in the study treatment group) / Number of participants in the control group ARR = (165 - 190) / 165 ARR = -25 / 165 ARR = 0.1515 or 15.15% Step 4: Calculate the number needed to treat (NNT). NNT = 1 / ARR NNT = 1 / 0.1515 NNT = 6.62 However, since we cannot have a fraction of a participant, we can round up to the nearest whole number. But in this case, the options provided do not have a rounded value, so we'll stick to the exact fraction. Now, let's compare the calculated NNT with the given options: - Option A: 25/250 is not the NNT, but it is close to the value of 6.62. To get the NNT, we can convert it to a fraction with the same denominator as the options. - Option B: 250/25 is the inverse of NNT, not NNT. - Option C: 190/250 is close to the NNT, but not exact. - Option D: 355/500 is also not the NNT. However, option A is closest to the calculated NNT, so I will choose option A as the answer.",
