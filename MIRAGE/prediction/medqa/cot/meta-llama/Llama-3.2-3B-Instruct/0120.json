    "question": "A 60-year-old female presents to her gynecologist with vaginal bleeding. She underwent menopause ten years prior. She has a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. On physical examination, her uterus is uniformly enlarged. Ultrasound reveals a thickened endometrial stripe and tissue biopsy reveals neoplastic endometrial cells. A workup for metastatic disease is negative and the gynecologist recommends a laparoscopic hysterectomy. During the procedure, the surgeon ligates multiple vessels in order to remove the entire uterus. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient develops left-sided flank pain and oliguria. Serum creatinine is found to be 1.4 mg/dl whereas it was 1.0 mg/dl prior to the operation. Renal ultrasound is normal. Urinalysis is notable for hematuria. Ligation of which of the following vessels most likely contributed to this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Artery of Sampson",
        "B": "Ovarian artery",
        "C": "Superior vesical artery",
        "D": "Uterine artery"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's analyze the situation step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with left-sided flank pain and oliguria (reduced urine production) following a hysterectomy, which is a surgical procedure to remove the uterus. The patient also has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, which can increase the risk of renal complications. 2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The physical examination reveals a uniformly enlarged uterus, which is consistent with endometrial hyperplasia or cancer, as suggested by the biopsy results. The patient's past medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus further supports this. 3. **Surgical Intervention**: The surgeon ligates multiple vessels to remove the entire uterus, which could potentially compromise blood flow to surrounding organs, including the kidneys. 4. **Postoperative Complications**: The development of left-sided flank pain, oliguria, and hematuria (blood in the urine) in the immediate postoperative period suggests a renal complication. The increase in serum creatinine levels (from 1.0 to 1.4 mg/dl) indicates a decline in renal function. 5. **Anatomical Considerations**: The options provided include the following arteries: - A. Artery of Sampson: This artery is not a commonly referenced artery in the context of pelvic surgery. - B. Ovarian artery: While the ovarian arteries are involved in supplying blood to the ovaries, they are not typically ligated during a hysterectomy. - C. Superior vesical artery: This artery supplies blood to the bladder and is not directly related to the uterus. - D. Uterine artery: The uterine artery is a key vessel that supplies blood to the uterus. Ligation of this artery can compromise blood flow to the surrounding organs, including the kidneys. Considering the clinical presentation and anatomical considerations, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is the ligation of the **uterine artery**. This artery is closely associated with the uterus and its ligation during a hysterectomy can lead to reduced blood flow to the kidneys, resulting in renal complications such as flank pain, oliguria, and hematuria. **Answer Choice**: D. Uterine artery.",
