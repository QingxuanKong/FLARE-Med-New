    "question": "A 25-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for pain in his back. The patient describes the pain as feeling worse in the morning. He says it is a general stiffness that improves when he goes to the gym and lifts weights. He also states that his symptoms seem to improve when he leans forward or when he is cycling. The patient is a current smoker and is sexually active. He admits to having unprotected sex with many different partners this past year. The patient has no significant past medical history and is not currently taking any medications. On physical exam, the patient demonstrates notable kyphosis of the thoracic spine and decreased mobility of the back in all 4 directions. The patient\u2019s strength is 5/5 in his upper and lower extremities. The rest of his physical exam is within normal limits. Which of the following findings is associated with this patient\u2019s presentation?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Diminished pulses in the lower extremity",
        "B": "Narrowing of the spinal canal when standing upright",
        "C": "Pain with elevation of his leg while laying down",
        "D": "Punctate bleeding spots when dermatologic scales are removed"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings step by step: 1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with back pain that worsens in the morning, improves with weightlifting, and is relieved by leaning forward or cycling. These symptoms suggest a mechanical or musculoskeletal issue, possibly related to the spine. 2. **Physical Exam Findings**: - Notable kyphosis of the thoracic spine: This indicates an abnormal curvature of the upper back, which can be a sign of a structural issue, such as scoliosis or a herniated disc. - Decreased mobility of the back in all 4 directions: This suggests stiffness or limited range of motion in the spine. - Normal strength in the upper and lower extremities: This indicates that the patient's muscle strength is preserved, which is not typically seen in neurological conditions affecting the spinal cord or peripheral nerves. 3. **Risk Factors**: - Smoking: This is a risk factor for many musculoskeletal conditions, including spinal problems. - Unprotected sex with many partners: This increases the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but it is not directly related to the patient's back symptoms. 4. **Considering the Options**: - A. Diminished pulses in the lower extremity: This would be more indicative of peripheral arterial disease or a vascular issue, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms or physical exam findings. - B. Narrowing of the spinal canal when standing upright: This is a characteristic feature of kyphosis, which is consistent with the patient's physical exam findings. - C. Pain with elevation of his leg while laying down: This would be more suggestive of sciatica or a lumbar disc herniation, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms or physical exam findings. - D. Punctate bleeding spots when dermatologic scales are removed: This is more indicative of a skin condition, such as porphyria cutanea tarda, which is not related to the patient's back symptoms. Given the analysis, the most likely finding associated with this patient's presentation is **narrowing of the spinal canal when standing upright**, which is consistent with the patient's kyphosis of the thoracic spine.
