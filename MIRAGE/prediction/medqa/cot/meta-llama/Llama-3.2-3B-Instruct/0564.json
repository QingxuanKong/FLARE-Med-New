    "question": "A 35-year-old man visits your office for his annual health checkup. He was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder 6 months ago, which is being treated with citalopram. He comments that his symptoms have improved since initiating the prescribed therapy; however, in the past 2 months, he has been unable to have sexual intercourse due to weak tumescence and low libido. His blood pressure is 122/74 mm Hg, heart rate is 75/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. Physical examination reveals regular heart and lung sounds. What is the appropriate step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Lowering citalopram dose",
        "B": "Addition of bupropion",
        "C": "Switch to fluoxetine",
        "D": "Switch to selegiline"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To address the patient's concerns about weak tumescence and low libido, we need to consider the potential side effects of citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). SSRIs are known to cause sexual side effects, including decreased libido and erectile dysfunction, in a significant number of patients. The patient's symptoms of weak tumescence and low libido have developed 2 months after starting citalopram, which suggests that these side effects may be related to the medication. Therefore, the first step would be to assess the severity of the side effects and consider whether they are tolerable for the patient. However, given the severity of the symptoms, it may be necessary to adjust the dosage or consider alternative treatments. The other options, adding bupropion, switching to fluoxetine, or switching to selegiline, do not directly address the potential side effects of citalopram and may not be the most appropriate next steps in management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
