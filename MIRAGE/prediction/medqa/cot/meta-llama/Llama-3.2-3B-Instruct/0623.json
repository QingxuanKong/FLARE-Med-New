    "question": "A group of investigators is studying the association between a fire retardant chemical used on furniture and interstitial lung disease. They use hospital records to identify 50 people who have been diagnosed with interstitial lung disease. They also identify a group of 50 people without interstitial lung disease who are matched in age and geographic location to those with the disease. The participants' exposure to the chemical is assessed by surveys and home visits. Which of the following best describes this study design?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Case-control study",
        "B": "Case series",
        "C": "Retrospective cohort study",
        "D": "Randomized controlled trial"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To determine the study design, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Objective**: The investigators are studying the association between a fire retardant chemical and interstitial lung disease. This suggests that they want to examine the potential causal relationship between the exposure to the chemical and the development of the disease. 2. **Study population**: The investigators have identified 50 people with interstitial lung disease and 50 people without the disease, who are matched in age and geographic location. This indicates that the study is comparing two groups of people, but it's not a randomized sample. 3. **Data collection methods**: The investigators used hospital records, surveys, and home visits to assess exposure to the chemical. This suggests that the data is being collected retrospectively, as the investigators are looking back at existing records. 4. **Comparison group**: The study has a comparison group (50 people without interstitial lung disease) that is matched to the case group (50 people with interstitial lung disease) in terms of age and geographic location. This is a key characteristic of a case-control study. Based on these points, we can conclude that the study design is a **case-control study**.
