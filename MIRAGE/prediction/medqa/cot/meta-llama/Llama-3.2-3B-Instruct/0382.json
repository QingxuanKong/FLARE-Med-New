    "question": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because she feels depressed, has difficulty sleeping, a poor appetite, and low concentration for the past 3 months. During this time, she has also had low energy and lost interest in playing the guitar. During high school, the patient went through similar episodes of low mood and poor sleep. At that time, she would repeatedly engage in binge eating and purging behavior, for which she was referred to therapy. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. The physician offers to prescribe a medication for her current symptoms. Treatment with which of the following drugs should most be avoided in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Duloxetine",
        "B": "Trazodone",
        "C": "Bupropion",
        "D": "Citalopram"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's past history of binge eating and purging behavior, which suggests a history of bulimia nervosa. This condition is often associated with a higher risk of developing eating disorders, and certain medications can exacerbate this risk. The patient's current symptoms of depression, sleep disturbances, and low concentration also suggest a need for an antidepressant medication. The key to this question is to identify which medication is most likely to worsen the patient's condition. Let's evaluate each option: A. Duloxetine: This is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that is often used to treat depression, anxiety, and certain eating disorders. However, it can increase appetite and weight gain, which may be problematic for someone with a history of bulimia nervosa. B. Trazodone: This is an antidepressant that can cause weight gain, sedation, and increased appetite, which could exacerbate the patient's eating disorder symptoms. C. Bupropion: This is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) that is often used to treat depression and smoking cessation. It is not typically associated with weight gain or appetite increase, making it a safer option for someone with a history of bulimia nervosa. D. Citalopram: This is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is commonly used to treat depression. While SSRIs can be effective for depression, they are not typically associated with weight gain or appetite increase. Considering the patient's history of bulimia nervosa, the medication that should be avoided is the one that may exacerbate her eating disorder symptoms. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is A. Duloxetine, as it can increase appetite and weight gain, which could worsen the patient's condition.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"A\"",
