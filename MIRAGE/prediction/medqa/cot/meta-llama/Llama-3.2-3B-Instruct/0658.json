    "question": "In 2005, a group of researchers believed that prophylactically removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) in BRCA-mutation positive women would reduce the chance that they developed breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, they reviewed a database of women who were known to be BRCA-mutation positive and divided the group into those with breast cancer and those without breast cancer. They used data in the registry and surveys about peoples\u2019 surgical history to compare the proportion of each population that had undergone a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Based on this data, they reported that women undergoing the procedure had a lower chance of developing breast cancer later in life with an odds ratio of 0.46. This is an example of what type of study design?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Meta-analysis",
        "B": "Cross-sectional",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To determine the type of study design, let's break down the key elements of the scenario: 1. **Study population**: The study focuses on a specific group of women who are BRCA-mutation positive. 2. **Exposure**: The exposure is the prophylactic removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). 3. **Outcome**: The outcome is the development of breast cancer. 4. **Data collection**: The researchers used existing data from a registry and surveys about the surgical history of the participants. 5. **Comparison**: The study compares the proportion of women who underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with and without breast cancer. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. **Meta-analysis**: A meta-analysis is a statistical analysis that combines the results of multiple studies to draw a more general conclusion. This study is not a meta-analysis because it only involves a single dataset. B. **Cross-sectional**: A cross-sectional study observes a defined population at a single point in time or over a short period. This study is not cross-sectional because it does not involve observing the population at a single point in time. C. **Case-control**: A case-control study involves comparing people with a specific outcome (cases) with people without the outcome (controls) to identify potential risk factors. This study is a case-control study because it compares women with breast cancer (cases) with women without breast cancer (controls) to examine the association between bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and breast cancer risk. D. **Genome-wide association study**: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) examines the association between specific genetic variants and a particular disease or trait. This study is not a GWAS because it does not investigate the relationship between specific genetic variants and breast cancer risk. Therefore, the study design is a case-control study.
