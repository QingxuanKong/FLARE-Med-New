    "question": "A 36-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 42 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for induction of labor. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Her two other children were born after uncomplicated vaginal deliveries at 41 and 42 weeks' gestation, respectively. Her only medication is a prenatal vitamin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (200 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2. Her temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mmHg. Examination shows a nontender, soft uterus consistent in size with a 42-weeks' gestation. This patient's child is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Polyhydramnios",
        "B": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome",
        "C": "Meconium aspiration",
        "D": "Placental abruption"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the given information and the potential complications listed as options. The patient is at 42 weeks' gestation, which is near term, and has a history of uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries. Her BMI is 33 kg/m2, categorizing her as obese. This is important to consider when evaluating potential complications. Option A, polyhydramnios, is a condition characterized by an excessive amount of amniotic fluid. While it can be associated with various maternal and fetal complications, it is not directly related to the patient's BMI or gestational age. Option B, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by inflammation and injury to the lungs, often caused by infection or trauma. While it is a possibility in pregnancy, there is no indication in the provided information that would make this the most likely complication. Option C, meconium aspiration syndrome, occurs when the baby inhales meconium during delivery, which can cause respiratory distress. This is a concern in patients at or near term, especially if there are signs of fetal distress. The patient's BMI is 33 kg/m2, which is considered obese, and obesity is a known risk factor for meconium-stained amniotic fluid and meconium aspiration syndrome. Option D, placental abruption, is a serious condition where the placenta separates from the uterus, which can cause bleeding and deprive the baby of oxygen and nutrients. While it is a potential complication of labor, there is no indication in the provided information that would make this the most likely complication. Given the patient's obesity and the fact that she is at 42 weeks' gestation, the patient is at increased risk for meconium-stained amniotic fluid, which increases the risk of meconium aspiration syndrome in the newborn. Therefore, the child is at greatest risk for meconium aspiration.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
