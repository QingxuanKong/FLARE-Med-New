    "question": "A 55-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presents to her primary care doctor with fever, fatigue, and bleeding gums for the past 3 days. She denies any sick contacts. Her temperature is 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 96/min, and respirations are 15/min. Physical exam reveals several oral mucosal petechiae, bleeding gums, bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Initial laboratory workup shows the following:\n\nLeukocyte count and differential:\nLeukocyte count: 6,600/mm^3\nSegmented neutrophils: 60%\nBands: 20%\nEosinophils: 9%\nBasophils: 1%\nLymphocytes: 0%\nMonocytes: 10%\nPlatelet count: 99,000/mm^3\n\nHemoglobin: 8.1 g/dL\nHematocrit: 25%\n\nProthrombin time: 25 sec\nPartial thromboplastin time: 50 sec\nInternational normalized ratio: 1.6\nD-dimer: 2,000 \u00b5g/mL\nFibrinogen: 99 mg/dL\n\nA bone marrow biopsy demonstrates 34% myeloblasts with Auer rods that are myeloperoxidase positive. What is best treatment option?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Ascorbic acid",
        "B": "Fresh frozen plasma",
        "C": "Retinoic acid",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer: **Step 1: Identify the key findings and symptoms** The patient presents with fever, fatigue, bleeding gums, submandibular lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and laboratory findings of anemia (low hemoglobin and hematocrit), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and prolonged coagulation times (prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time). The bone marrow biopsy shows 34% myeloblasts with Auer rods that are myeloperoxidase positive. **Step 2: Consider the differential diagnosis** The presence of Auer rods in myeloblasts is a hallmark of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, and prolonged coagulation times, are consistent with AML. The absence of lymphadenopathy and the presence of hepatosplenomegaly may suggest a more aggressive disease. **Step 3: Consider the subtypes of AML** The presence of Auer rods in myeloblasts is more commonly seen in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of AML. APL is associated with a specific genetic mutation, the PML-RARA fusion gene. **Step 4: Consider the treatment options** For APL, treatment typically involves all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in combination with chemotherapy. ATRA induces differentiation of the leukemic cells, while chemotherapy targets the remaining cancer cells. **Step 5: Evaluate the answer choices** - A. Ascorbic acid is not a standard treatment for AML. - B. Fresh frozen plasma is not a standard treatment for AML. - C. Retinoic acid (ATRA) is the correct treatment for APL, a subtype of AML. - D. Zoledronic acid is a bisphosphonate used to prevent bone loss in patients with cancer, but it is not a standard treatment for AML. **Answer** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has APL, a subtype of AML, and the best treatment option is all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in combination with chemotherapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
