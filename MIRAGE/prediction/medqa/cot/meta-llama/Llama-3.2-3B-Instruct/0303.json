    "question": "A 16-year-old female presents to her primary care physician due to lack of menstruation. She has never had a period and is anxious that she is not \u201ckeeping up\u201d with her friends. She states that her breasts began developing when she was 13, and she had a growth spurt around the same time. Review of systems reveals that she has also been getting headaches every few months over the last year with some photosensitivity and nausea each time. Ibuprofen relieves her symptoms. The patient is a competitive ice skater and has never been sexually active. Her mother has a history of migraine headaches, and her older sister has a history of bipolar disorder. Both underwent menarche at age 15. At this visit, the patient\u2019s temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C), pulse is 70/min, blood pressure is 118/65 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Her body mass index is 23.8 kg/m^2. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Both breasts are Tanner IV with no expressable discharge. Pelvic and axillary hair growth is also Tanner IV. The patient is unable to tolerate a full pelvic exam, but the part of the vaginal canal that is examined is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are ordered and are below:\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nK+: 4.1 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nUrea nitrogen: 12 mg/dL\nGlucose: 73 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 0.9 mg/dL\nCa2+: 9.7 mg/dL\nMg2+: 1.7 mEq/L\nAST: 11 U/L\nALT: 11 U/L\nFollicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH): 16.2 mIU/mL (4.7-21.5 mIU/ml)\nEstrogen: 240 pg/mL (64-357 pg/mL)\n\nAbdominal ultrasound is performed and shows a normal uterus and ovaries. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Hyperprolactinemia",
        "B": "Imperforate hymen",
        "C": "Vaginal septum",
        "D": "Normal development"

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results: 1. Primary amenorrhea (never having had a period) is a significant symptom, but it can be caused by various factors such as anatomical abnormalities, hormonal imbalances, or genetic disorders. 2. The patient's breast development and pubertal growth spurt around age 13 suggest normal pubertal development. 3. The patient experiences headaches, photosensitivity, and nausea, which are relieved by ibuprofen, indicating a possible migraine disorder, as her mother has a history of migraine headaches. 4. The patient is a competitive ice skater, which may contribute to her physical activity level and potential stress, but this is not directly related to her primary complaint. 5. The patient's BMI is 23.8 kg/m^2, which falls within the normal range for her age group. 6. The pelvic and axillary hair growth is Tanner IV, indicating normal pubertal development. 7. The unremarkable pelvic and abdominal exams, along with the normal ultrasound findings of a normal uterus and ovaries, suggest that there are no obvious anatomical abnormalities. 8. The laboratory results show elevated FSH levels (16.2 mIU/mL) and low estrogen levels (240 pg/mL), which are indicative of ovarian dysfunction or primary ovarian insufficiency. Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is a condition that affects ovarian function, leading to primary amenorrhea, elevated FSH levels, and low estrogen levels. Among the given options, the most plausible diagnosis is D. Normal development, as the patient's pubertal development and physical characteristics are consistent with normal development, and the laboratory results suggest primary ovarian insufficiency, which is a common cause of primary amenorrhea in young women. However, it's essential to note that this diagnosis is not entirely conclusive, and further evaluation, such as further testing for genetic disorders or hormonal imbalances, may be necessary to rule out other potential causes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
