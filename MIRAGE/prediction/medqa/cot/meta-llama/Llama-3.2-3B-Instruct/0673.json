    "question": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-week history of burning sensation in his mouth. One year ago, a peripheral blood smear performed during workup of fatigue revealed erythrocytes without central pallor. His father had gallstones, for which he underwent a cholecystectomy at the age of 26 years. Examination shows pallor of the mucosal membranes, mild scleral icterus, a swollen, red tongue, and several mouth ulcers. There is darkening of the skin over the dorsal surfaces of the fingers, toes, and creases of the palms and soles. His spleen is enlarged and palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.1 gm/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 104 \u03bcm3, and a reticulocyte count of 9%. Which of the following would most likely have prevented this patient's oropharyngeal symptoms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Red blood cell transfusions",
        "B": "Gluten-free diet",
        "C": "Vitamin B12 injections",
        "D": "Folic acid supplementation"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and examination findings: 1. **Burning sensation in the mouth**: This symptom could be related to several conditions, but when combined with other findings, it can point towards a specific diagnosis. 2. **Erythrocytes without central pallor on peripheral blood smear one year ago**: This suggests that the patient has a chronic condition affecting the production or destruction of red blood cells. 3. **Family history of gallstones**: This might initially seem unrelated, but gallstones can be associated with certain genetic conditions. 4. **Pallor of mucosal membranes, mild scleral icterus, swollen, red tongue, and mouth ulcers**: These findings suggest anemia and possibly a nutritional deficiency. 5. **Darkening of the skin over the dorsal surfaces of the fingers, toes, and creases of the palms and soles**: This is a characteristic finding in patients with megaloblastic anemia. 6. **Enlarged and palpable spleen**: This can be seen in various conditions, including megaloblastic anemia. 7. **Hemoglobin concentration of 9.1 gm/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 104 \u03bcm^3, and a reticulocyte count of 9%**: These lab findings are consistent with megaloblastic anemia, which is characterized by large red blood cells and a low reticulocyte count. Given these findings, the patient likely has megaloblastic anemia, which is most commonly caused by a deficiency in either vitamin B12 or folate. However, the patient's symptoms, such as the burning sensation in the mouth, are more suggestive of a deficiency in vitamin B12. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. **Red blood cell transfusions**: While transfusions can help manage anemia, they do not address the underlying cause and are not a preventive measure for the patient's oropharyngeal symptoms. B. **Gluten-free diet**: This is relevant for patients with celiac disease, which can cause anemia, but the patient's symptoms and lab findings do not support this diagnosis. C. **Vitamin B12 injections**: Vitamin B12 injections would likely alleviate the patient's anemia and oropharyngeal symptoms, as vitamin B12 deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia and can cause a burning sensation in the mouth. D. **Folic acid supplementation**: Folic acid supplementation would also be beneficial for patients with megaloblastic anemia, but it does not address the underlying cause of vitamin B12 deficiency. **Answer:** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest a diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia, which is most likely caused by a deficiency in vitamin B12. Therefore, the most effective preventive measure for the patient's oropharyngeal symptoms would be vitamin B12 injections.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
