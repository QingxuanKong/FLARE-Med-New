    "question": "A 67-year-old white man presents to his primary care provider for an annual examination. He notes a pink bump that has rapidly developed on his forehead over the last month. In the past, he has had significant sun exposure including multiple blistering sunburns. The physical examination reveals a 2 cm dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug (as shown in the image). Excisional biopsy of the lesion reveals an exophytic nodule with central invagination, full of keratin. Keratinocyte atypia is minimal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Keratoacanthoma",
        "B": "Basal cell carcinoma",
        "C": "Seborrheic keratosis",
        "D": "Kaposi's sarcoma"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the provided information step by step: 1. The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of significant sun exposure, including multiple blistering sunburns. This is a crucial piece of information as it points towards a skin condition that is often associated with sun exposure. 2. The physical examination reveals a 2 cm dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug, which is a key finding. The description of the lesion as dome-shaped and with a central keratin plug is highly suggestive of a specific type of skin growth. 3. The excisional biopsy results show an exophytic nodule with central invagination, full of keratin, and minimal keratinocyte atypia. The presence of keratin is a significant finding, as it indicates that the lesion is composed of keratin-containing cells. 4. Now, let's evaluate the options: a. Keratoacanthoma: This is a type of skin tumor that typically presents as a rapidly growing, dome-shaped nodule with central keratin plug. It is often associated with sun exposure and has a characteristic histopathological appearance, which matches the biopsy results. b. Basal cell carcinoma: While basal cell carcinoma is a common skin cancer, it typically has a more indurated and rolled edge, and the biopsy results do not mention any significant atypia or invasion. c. Seborrheic keratosis: This is a benign skin growth that can appear as a small, brown or black spot on the skin, but it does not typically present as a dome-shaped nodule with a central keratin plug. d. Kaposi's sarcoma: This is a type of cancer that typically presents as a purple, violaceous plaque or nodule, and the biopsy results do not mention any characteristic features of Kaposi's sarcoma. Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is a keratoacanthoma, which matches the patient's history of sun exposure and the characteristic histopathological findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
