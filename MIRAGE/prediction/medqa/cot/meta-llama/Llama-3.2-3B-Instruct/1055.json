    "question": "A 9-year-old male visited his primary care physician for a check-up three months after a throat infection. Upon examination, the patient exhibits painless subcutaneous nodules on the back of the wrist, the outside elbow, and the front of the knees, as well as inflammation in the joints of the lower extremities. Which of the following symptoms is most likely to also be present in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Renal failure",
        "B": "Hepatomegaly",
        "C": "Chorea",
        "D": "Pleural effusion"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms, such as painless subcutaneous nodules on the back of the wrist, the outside elbow, and the front of the knees, along with inflammation in the joints of the lower extremities, are highly suggestive of Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF). ARF is a complication of untreated or inadequately treated group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infections, such as strep throat. One of the major criteria for diagnosing ARF is the presence of migratory polyarthritis, which is inflammation of multiple joints, often accompanied by subcutaneous nodules and sometimes carditis, neurologic abnormalities, and chorea. The symptoms described in the question are consistent with major criterion 2, which is the presence of migratory polyarthritis. Chorea is a neurologic manifestation that can be present in ARF, which occurs in approximately 10-20% of patients. Therefore, the symptom most likely to also be present in this patient is chorea.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
