    "question": "A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a headache. He states that this is the worst headache he has ever had and that his symptoms have not been improving. The patient complains of pain in his jaw that is worse when he chews. He has a past medical history of insomnia and is currently taking alprazolam. His temperature is 98.2\u00b0F (36.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 157/98 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for tenderness over the patient's scalp, jaw, and temporal area. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "CT head",
        "B": "Ibuprofen",
        "C": "IV steroids",
        "D": "Lumbar puncture"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's symptoms of a severe headache that is worsened by chewing, jaw tenderness, and a history of insomnia, the clinical presentation is highly suggestive of a condition known as cluster headache. Cluster headaches are characterized by severe, one-sided orbital, supraorbital, or temporal pain, often accompanied by autonomic symptoms such as nasal congestion, lacrimation, and conjunctival injection. Given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the presence of jaw tenderness, a diagnosis of cluster headache should be considered. The next step in management should be to confirm the diagnosis through imaging to rule out other potential causes of severe headache, such as a subarachnoid hemorrhage or tumor. A CT head is the most appropriate imaging study in this scenario due to its availability, speed, and lack of radiation exposure. Ibuprofen may provide some relief for mild to moderate headaches, but it is unlikely to be effective for cluster headaches. IV steroids may be considered for subarachnoid hemorrhage or other conditions that require rapid reduction of inflammation, but they are not the first-line treatment for cluster headache. A lumbar puncture is not indicated in this scenario as there is no suspicion of meningitis or other central nervous system infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
