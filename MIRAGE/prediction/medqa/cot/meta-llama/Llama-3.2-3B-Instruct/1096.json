    "question": "A 7-year-old woman presents shortly after her birthday with red scaly plaques over both ears. Her mother reports that the patient recently received a pair of fashionable silver earrings from her older sister as a birthday present. Physical examination is only significant for erythema and tenderness over the lobules of the ears bilaterally. Her vital signs show a blood pressure of 121/73 mm Hg, heart rate of 72/min, and a respiratory rate of 21/min. Her medical history is non-significant. Of the following options, which is the mechanism of this reaction?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Type I\u2013anaphylactic hypersensitivity reaction",
        "B": "Type III\u2013immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction",
        "C": "Type IV\u2013cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction",
        "D": "Type III and IV\u2013mixed immune complex and cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To determine the mechanism of this reaction, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with red scaly plaques over both ears, specifically over the lobules. This presentation is characteristic of contact dermatitis, a type of skin reaction that occurs in response to an external allergen or irritant. 2. **Recent Exposure**: The patient recently received a pair of silver earrings from her sister. This is a clear trigger for the reaction, indicating an external allergen or irritant. 3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The presence of erythema (redness) and tenderness over the lobules of the ears are consistent with an inflammatory response, which is typical of a hypersensitivity reaction. 4. **Vital Signs**: The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, indicating that the reaction is not severe and is likely a localized, acute response. 5. **Medical History**: The patient's medical history is non-significant, suggesting that this is an isolated incident and not part of a pre-existing condition. Given these points, the most likely mechanism of the reaction is a **Type IV\u2013cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction**. Here's the JSON response: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with clinical features of contact dermatitis, a type of skin reaction to an external allergen (the silver earrings). The reaction is localized, acute, and not severe, indicating a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction, which is mediated by T cells and typically occurs 48-72 hours after exposure to the allergen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
