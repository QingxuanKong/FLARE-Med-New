    "question": "A 17-year-old male presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient was an unrestrained driver in a head-on collision. He has a past medical history of asthma, depression, and anxiety. He is not currently taking any medications. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. The patient is breathing on his own and has strong distal pulses. Ultimately, the patient is discharged with follow up instructions after no significant fractures or injuries are found. The patient then presents 4 months later to his primary doctor with weakness. The patient's strength in his upper extremities is 1/5. He has reduced sensation in his upper extremities as well. The patient's lower extremities reveal 5/5 strength with intact sensation. A chest radiograph and basic labs are ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Cervical spine fracture",
        "B": "Intracranial hemorrhage",
        "C": "Syringomyelia",
        "D": "Conversion disorder"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and physical examination: 1. The patient was involved in a head-on collision, which could potentially cause various injuries, including cervical spine fractures, intracranial hemorrhages, or other trauma-related injuries. 2. The patient was not restrained, which increases the risk of severe injuries, particularly to the cervical spine. 3. The initial examination revealed no significant injuries or symptoms, which might suggest that the patient was fortunate to have escaped more severe harm. 4. Four months later, the patient presents with weakness in the upper extremities and reduced sensation, but with normal strength and sensation in the lower extremities. 5. The patient's symptoms are localized to the upper extremities, which suggests a focal lesion. Considering these points, let's evaluate the options: A. Cervical spine fracture: While the patient was unrestrained, the initial examination was normal, and there were no significant fractures or injuries found. However, it's possible that a fracture could have caused nerve damage, leading to the patient's current symptoms. B. Intracranial hemorrhage: The patient's symptoms are not consistent with an intracranial hemorrhage, as there are no signs of increased intracranial pressure, altered mental status, or focal neurological deficits in the lower extremities. C. Syringomyelia: This is a condition characterized by the formation of a fluid-filled cavity within the spinal cord, which can cause loss of sensation and motor function in a specific dermatomal distribution. The patient's symptoms of weakness and reduced sensation in the upper extremities, with normal strength and sensation in the lower extremities, are consistent with syringomyelia. D. Conversion disorder: This condition is characterized by the presence of neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by a medical condition. While the patient's symptoms are focal, there is a clear traumatic event that could have caused the injury, making conversion disorder less likely. Based on the patient's symptoms and the evaluation of the options, the most likely diagnosis is syringomyelia.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
