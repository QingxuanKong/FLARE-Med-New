    "question": "An otherwise healthy 29-year-old man presents to his family physician with a slowly growing left neck mass for the past 5 weeks. He denies fever or recent upper respiratory tract infections. His temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.7\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 115/72 mm Hg, and the pulse are 82/min. On examination, a 4-cm (1.5 in), firm, non-tender mass is detected on the mid-left neck. Excisional biopsy of the mass reveals Hodgkin\u2019s cells. The patient is referred to the oncology department and chemotherapy is started. After the first cycle of chemotherapy, the patient notices that his urine becomes red. The urine tests are positive for blood on further analysis. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Bleomycin",
        "B": "Cyclophosphamide",
        "C": "Doxorubicin",
        "D": "Etoposide"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the immune system, and is being treated with chemotherapy. The patient's urine becomes red after the first cycle of chemotherapy, indicating hematuria (blood in the urine). This side effect is a common occurrence in patients receiving certain chemotherapy agents. To determine the most likely cause, let's review the properties of the chemotherapy agents listed: - Bleomycin: It is known to cause pulmonary toxicity and can cause hemoptysis (coughing up blood), but it is not typically associated with hematuria. - Cyclophosphamide: This agent is a nitrogen mustard alkylating agent that can cause hemorrhagic cystitis, a condition characterized by bleeding in the bladder. This is due to its toxic effects on the urothelial lining of the bladder. - Doxorubicin: It is an anthracycline antibiotic that can cause cardiotoxicity, but it is not commonly associated with hematuria. - Etoposide: This agent is a topoisomerase inhibitor that can cause myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity, but it is not typically linked to hematuria. Given the patient's symptoms and the side effect profile of the listed chemotherapy agents, the most likely cause of the patient's hematuria is cyclophosphamide, which is known to cause hemorrhagic cystitis.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
