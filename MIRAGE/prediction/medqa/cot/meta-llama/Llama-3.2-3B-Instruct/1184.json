    "question": "A 62-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency room with severe substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, and nausea. Imaging reveals transmural myocardial infarction in the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. Which of this patient's coronary arteries is most likely occluded?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Left circumflex",
        "B": "Diagonal perforators",
        "C": "Septal perforators",
        "D": "Right main"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the location of the myocardial infarction and relate it to the coronary artery anatomy. The patient has a transmural myocardial infarction in the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. This location is key to determining which coronary artery is most likely occluded. The left circumflex artery (A) supplies the lateral and posterior walls of the left ventricle, including the septum. The diagonal branches of the left circumflex artery, including the septal perforators, supply the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. The diagonal perforators (B) are small branches of the left circumflex artery that supply the anterior and posterior walls of the left ventricle, but they are not the primary source of blood supply to the posterior 1/3 of the septum. The septal perforators (C) are small branches of the right coronary artery that supply the anterior and posterior walls of the interventricular septum, but they are not the primary source of blood supply to the posterior 1/3 of the septum. The right main coronary artery (D) is not typically associated with the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. Based on this analysis, the most likely coronary artery to be occluded is the left circumflex artery, which supplies the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
