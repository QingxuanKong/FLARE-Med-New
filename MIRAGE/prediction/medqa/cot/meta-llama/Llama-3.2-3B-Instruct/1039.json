    "question": "A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician because of difficulty falling asleep for the past 2 months. She wakes up frequently during the night and gets up earlier than desired. She experiences discomfort in her legs when lying down at night and feels the urge to move her legs. The discomfort resolves when she gets up and walks around or moves her legs. She has tried an over-the-counter sleep aid that contains diphenhydramine, which worsened her symptoms. She exercises regularly and eats a well-balanced diet. She admits that she has been under a lot of stress lately. Her brother has similar symptoms. The patient appears anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and iron studies are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Amitryptiline",
        "B": "Pramipexole",
        "C": "Codeine",
        "D": "Escitalopram"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms, let's break down the key points from the case: 1. The patient experiences difficulty falling asleep, frequent nighttime wakings, and discomfort in her legs when lying down, which resolves with movement. These symptoms are characteristic of restless legs syndrome (RLS). 2. The patient has tried an over-the-counter sleep aid containing diphenhydramine, which worsened her symptoms. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine with sedative properties, which is not ideal for RLS. 3. The patient exercises regularly, eats a well-balanced diet, and has no abnormalities on physical examination. These factors suggest that lifestyle modifications and basic medical evaluations have been ruled out as causes of her symptoms. 4. The patient's brother has similar symptoms, which suggests a possible genetic component to her condition. 5. The complete blood count and iron studies are within the reference range, ruling out iron deficiency as a cause of her symptoms. Given these points, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms is a medication that targets RLS. Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist that is commonly used to treat RLS and other movement disorders. It works by stimulating dopamine receptors in the brain, which helps to reduce the urge to move the legs. The other options are not the best choices: A. Amitryptiline is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used to treat depression, anxiety, and some sleep disorders, but it is not the first-line treatment for RLS. C. Codeine is an opioid that can be used to treat pain, but it is not typically used to treat RLS. D. Escitalopram is an SSRI that is primarily used to treat depression and anxiety disorders, but it is not typically used to treat RLS. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms is B. Pramipexole.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
