    "question": "A 43-year-old man comes to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and progressive perioral numbness for the past 24 hours. 3 days ago, he underwent a total thyroidectomy for treatment of papillary thyroid cancer. His only medication is a multivitamin supplement. He appears fatigued. While measuring the patient's blood pressure, the nurse observes a spasm in the patient's hand. Physical examination shows a well-healing surgical wound on the neck. Which of the following ECG findings are most likely in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Torsade de pointes",
        "B": "QT prolongation",
        "C": "Peaked T waves",
        "D": "PR prolongation"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and medical history to determine the most likely ECG finding. The patient has a history of recent thyroid surgery and is now presenting with nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, progressive perioral numbness, and fatigue. The patient also has a history of taking a multivitamin supplement. The key symptom that stands out is the progressive perioral numbness, which suggests a possible issue with the nerves in the face. This symptom is often associated with hypocalcemia, which is a decrease in calcium levels in the blood. Thyroid surgery can lead to hypocalcemia due to damage to the parathyroid glands, which are responsible for regulating calcium levels in the blood. The patient's symptoms of nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and fatigue are also consistent with hypocalcemia. The patient's recent thyroidectomy and symptoms suggest that he may have developed hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia can cause a range of ECG abnormalities, but one of the most common is QT prolongation. QT prolongation is a condition where the time it takes for the heart to recover between beats is longer than normal, which can increase the risk of arrhythmias. The other options are not as directly related to the patient's symptoms and medical history. Torsade de pointes is a specific type of abnormal heart rhythm that is more commonly associated with electrolyte imbalances, but it is not the most likely finding in this patient. Peaked T waves are a sign of hyperkalemia, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms. PR prolongation is a sign of first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, which is not indicated by the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the most likely ECG finding in this patient is QT prolongation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
