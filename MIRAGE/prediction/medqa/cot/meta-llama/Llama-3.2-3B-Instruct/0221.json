    "question": "A 2,300 g (5 lb) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this infant?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Administer zidovudine",
        "B": "HIV DNA testing",
        "C": "HIV RNA testing",
        "D": "Reassurance and follow-up"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer: **Step 1: Assess the situation** The newborn is a 2,300 g male infant born to an HIV-positive mother who received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. The mother's HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery, which is considered low and well-managed. The labor and delivery were uncomplicated, and the newborn has no physical abnormalities. **Step 2: Consider the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV** Although the mother's HIV viral load is well-managed, there is still a risk of MTCT of HIV, especially if the baby was exposed to the virus during labor and delivery. However, the risk is lower with effective antiretroviral therapy. **Step 3: Evaluate the need for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) or antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the newborn** Given the mother's well-managed HIV viral load and the uncomplicated delivery, the risk of MTCT is relatively low. However, it is still essential to assess the newborn's HIV status to determine if any PEP or ART is needed. **Step 4: Choose the most appropriate next step** Considering the low risk of MTCT and the need to assess the newborn's HIV status, the most appropriate next step is to perform HIV RNA testing to determine if the baby is HIV-positive or negative. **Answer Choice:** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The mother's well-managed HIV viral load and uncomplicated delivery reduce the risk of MTCT of HIV. However, it is essential to assess the newborn's HIV status to determine if any PEP or ART is needed. HIV RNA testing is the most appropriate next step to determine the baby's HIV status.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
