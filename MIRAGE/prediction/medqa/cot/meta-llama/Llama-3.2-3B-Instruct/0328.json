    "question": "A 27-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 40 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. The patient reports severe pelvic pain. Pregnancy has been complicated by gestational diabetes. Pregnancy and delivery of her first child were uncomplicated. Current medications include insulin, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Vital signs are within normal limits. The cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated; the vertex is at -1 station. The fetal heart rate is reactive with no decelerations. Epidural anesthesia is performed and the patient's symptoms improve. Ten minutes later, the patient has dizziness. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's hypotension?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Sympathetic block",
        "B": "Hypovolemia",
        "C": "Acute pulmonary hypertension",
        "D": "Aortocaval compression"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the underlying cause of the patient's hypotension, let's analyze the given information step by step. 1. The patient is in active labor and has a history of gestational diabetes, which can affect blood sugar levels and potentially lead to hypoglycemia. However, the patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and the dizziness and hypotension occur after epidural anesthesia, making hypoglycemia less likely. 2. Epidural anesthesia can cause vasodilation, which may lead to a decrease in blood pressure. However, the patient's blood pressure was normal before the epidural, and the hypotension occurs after the procedure, suggesting that the epidural itself is not the primary cause. 3. Hypovolemia is unlikely, as the patient is receiving intravenous fluid resuscitation, and there is no indication of bleeding or fluid loss. 4. Acute pulmonary hypertension is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and is not a common complication in this scenario. 5. Aortocaval compression, also known as supine hypotension syndrome, is a condition that occurs when the weight of the uterus compresses the inferior vena cava, reducing venous return to the heart and subsequently decreasing cardiac output. This condition is common in late pregnancy, especially after the onset of labor. Given the patient's symptoms of dizziness and hypotension after epidural anesthesia, the most likely underlying cause is aortocaval compression due to the weight of the uterus compressing the inferior vena cava.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
