    "question": "A 24-year-old woman gravida 2, para 1 at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal visit. She feels well. Her earlier pregnancy was uncomplicated. This is her 4th prenatal visit. She had an ultrasound scan 2 weeks ago that showed a live intrauterine pregnancy consistent with a 22-week gestation with no anomalies. She had a normal Pap smear 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 24-week gestation. Her blood group and type is B positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Oral glucose challenge test",
        "B": "Cardiotocography",
        "C": "Swab for GBS culture",
        "D": "Tdap vaccination"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's history and current status, the next step in management should be to assess for Group B streptococcus (GBS) colonization, as this is a common cause of neonatal sepsis and is often screened for in pregnant women at 35-37 weeks' gestation. The patient is at a gestation of 24 weeks, which is still early for the standard GBS screening, but it is recommended to start screening at 35 weeks in a primigravida (first-time mother) or 35 weeks in a multigravida (multiple pregnancies). However, since the patient is a multigravida, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends starting screening at 35 weeks of gestation. Given that the patient is only 2 weeks past the recommended screening time, but is a multigravida, the most appropriate next step would be to schedule the GBS screening test for 35 weeks of gestation. However, among the options provided, the closest and most appropriate next step in management would be to schedule the GBS screening test, which is not explicitly listed, but can be inferred as option C, Swab for GBS culture, as it is a step towards screening for GBS colonization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
