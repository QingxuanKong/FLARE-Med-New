    "question": "A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent episodes of heart palpitations for 3 weeks. The palpitations are accompanied by chest pain that is sharp and localized to the left 3rd intercostal space. The patient does not smoke. She drinks one to two glasses of wine on the weekends. She appears nervous. Her pulse is 110/min and irregularly irregular, and blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg. Examination shows a fine tremor on both hands and digital swelling. There is retraction of the left upper eyelid. A systolic ejection murmur is heard along the right upper sternal border. The extremities are warm, and pulses are 2+ bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Propranolol",
        "B": "Digoxin",
        "C": "Amiodarone",

    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and history: 1. **Symptoms**: The patient is experiencing intermittent episodes of heart palpitations, chest pain localized to the left 3rd intercostal space, and has an irregularly irregular pulse. The palpitations are accompanied by a fine tremor on both hands and digital swelling. 2. **Past Medical History**: The patient does not smoke and consumes moderate amounts of alcohol (1-2 glasses of wine per weekend). 3. **Physical Examination Findings**: - Fine tremor on both hands - Digital swelling - Retraction of the left upper eyelid (exophthalmos) - Systolic ejection murmur along the right upper sternal border - Warm extremities - Bilateral pulses are 2+ (normal) Considering these findings, the patient's presentation suggests hyperthyroidism, which is a common cause of palpitations, tremors, exophthalmos, and an increased pulse rate. The systolic ejection murmur may be related to the increased heart rate and contractility associated with hyperthyroidism. Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be a beta-blocker to control the tachycardia and tremors associated with hyperthyroidism. **Answer Choice**: A. Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that is commonly used to treat symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as tachycardia, tremors, and anxiety. It works by blocking the effects of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine, thereby reducing the heart rate and tremors. **JSON Output**: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation suggests hyperthyroidism, which is a common cause of palpitations, tremors, exophthalmos, and an increased pulse rate.
