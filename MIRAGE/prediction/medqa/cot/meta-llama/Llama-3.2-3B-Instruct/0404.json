    "question": "A healthy, full-term 1-day-old female is being evaluated after birth and is noted to have a cleft palate and a systolic ejection murmur at the second left intercostal space. A chest radiograph is obtained which reveals a boot-shaped heart and absence of a thymus. An echocardiogram is done which shows pulmonary stenosis with a hypertrophic right ventricular wall, ventricular septal defect, and overriding of the aorta. Which of the following additional features is expected to be seen in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Seizures due to hypocalcemia",
        "B": "Catlike cry",
        "C": "Hyperthyroidism from transplacental antibodies",
        "D": "Increased phenylalanine in the blood"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key findings in this case are a cleft palate, boot-shaped heart on chest radiograph, absence of the thymus, pulmonary stenosis, hypertrophic right ventricular wall, ventricular septal defect, and overriding of the aorta. These features are highly suggestive of DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome). DiGeorge syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by thymic hypoplasia or aplasia, leading to immunodeficiency and increased risk of infections. It is also associated with congenital heart defects, cleft palate, and other anomalies. One of the characteristic features of DiGeorge syndrome is hypocalcemia due to parathyroid gland hypoplasia or aplasia, which can cause seizures. The other options are not directly related to the primary features of DiGeorge syndrome. Catlike cry is more commonly associated with Williams syndrome, hyperthyroidism is not a typical feature of DiGeorge syndrome, and increased phenylalanine in the blood is associated with phenylketonuria, a different genetic disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
