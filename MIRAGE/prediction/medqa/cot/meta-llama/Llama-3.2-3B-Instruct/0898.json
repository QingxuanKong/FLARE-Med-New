    "question": "A 38-year-old woman presents to the office for a routine examination. She has no complaints and offers very little information voluntarily. She answers each question with soft, short sentences and avoids eye contact. She appears timid, anxious and admits that this is one of the very few times she has left the house in the last several years. Medical history is significant for essential hypertension. She takes hydrochlorothiazide and a daily vitamin. She has worked from home as a web graphic designer for 20 years. Questions about her social life reveal that she is very shy with few friends, and she often makes excuses to avoid parties and social gatherings. Despite this, she expresses a strong desire to be in a relationship. Today, her blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg, heart rate is 95/min, respiratory rate is 18/min, and temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical examination, her heart has a regular rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Which of the following is most consistent with her behavior?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Schizoid personality disorder",
        "B": "Avoidant personality disorder",
        "C": "Antisocial personality disorder",
        "D": "Agoraphobia"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the patient's presentation and history: 1. The patient is a 38-year-old woman who appears timid, anxious, and has a history of avoiding social interactions, including parties and social gatherings. This suggests a pattern of social avoidance. 2. She has been working from home for 20 years, which may indicate a preference for solitude or avoidance of social interactions. 3. She expresses a strong desire to be in a relationship, but this desire is not matched by her actual social behavior. 4. Her medical history is notable for essential hypertension, but this does not directly relate to her social behavior or personality traits. Considering these points, we can evaluate the options: A. Schizoid personality disorder: Characterized by a pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of emotional expression in interpersonal settings. While the patient is described as shy and avoids social interactions, there is no mention of a lack of emotional expression or a general detachment from social relationships. B. Avoidant personality disorder: Characterized by a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to criticism or rejection. The patient's avoidance of social interactions, desire to be in a relationship, and shyness are all consistent with this diagnosis. C. Antisocial personality disorder: Characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for others' rights, lack of empathy, and impulsivity. There is no evidence in the patient's presentation to support this diagnosis. D. Agoraphobia: Characterized by an intense, irrational fear of being in public places or situations that might cause panic, helplessness, or embarrassment. While the patient avoids social interactions, her avoidance is not specifically related to fear of being in public places or situations. Based on the patient's presentation, the most consistent diagnosis is avoidant personality disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
