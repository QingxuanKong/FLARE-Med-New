    "question": "A 27-year-old male presents for emergency surgery to reattach his left arm, severed during a high-speed car accident, and has lost significant amounts of blood. His wife arrives within minutes to the hospital exclaiming that under no circumstance should he receive any blood transfusions during surgery. After reviewing his medical chart, you see also see an annotation indicating no blood transfusions for religious reasons. Knowing that he needs a blood transfusion to save his life, what do you do?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Administer a blood transfusion to save the patient's life",
        "B": "Call the ethics board of the hospital to discuss the issue",
        "C": "Respect the patient's written instructions and do not adminster a blood transfusion",
        "D": "Convince the wife to administer a blood transfusion to her husband"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this situation, it's essential to consider the patient's autonomy, the medical necessity of the blood transfusion, and the hospital's policies and protocols regarding religious accommodations. Firstly, the patient is 27 years old and in need of a life-saving intervention. The medical necessity of the blood transfusion is clear, as it will help stabilize his vital signs and prevent further complications. Secondly, the patient has provided a written instruction not to receive any blood transfusions due to religious reasons. However, this instruction may not necessarily override the medical necessity of the transfusion. Thirdly, the hospital's policies and protocols should be considered. Hospitals have a duty to provide care that is in the best interest of the patient, even if it means going against the patient's personal beliefs or values. Lastly, the patient's wife's request to convince her to administer the transfusion is not a viable solution, as it is not the patient's decision to make. The patient has already provided clear instructions regarding his preferences. Given these considerations, the most appropriate course of action is to administer the blood transfusion to save the patient's life, while also documenting the patient's religious objections and any efforts made to accommodate his wishes. This approach respects the patient's autonomy while prioritizing his medical needs.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"A\"",
