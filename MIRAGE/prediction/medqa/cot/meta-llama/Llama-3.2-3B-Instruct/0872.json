    "question": "An 18-year-old male presents to the emergency department trauma bay with a gunshot wound to the abdomen. The patient undergoes an exploratory laparotomy, during which, it is discovered that his splenic artery was damaged at its origin from the celiac trunk. The surgeon ligates the splenic artery at its origin. Which of the following arteries will now be hypoperfused as a result?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Left gastric artery",
        "B": "Gastroduodenal artery",
        "C": "Left gastroepiploic artery",
        "D": "Common hepatic artery"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's analyze the arterial supply of the spleen and the branches of the celiac trunk. The celiac trunk is the first major branch of the abdominal aorta and gives off three main branches: the left gastric artery, the common hepatic artery, and the splenic artery. The left gastric artery primarily supplies the stomach, the common hepatic artery supplies the liver, and the splenic artery supplies the spleen. The gastroduodenal artery is a branch of the common hepatic artery, which means it supplies the stomach and the duodenum. The left gastroepiploic artery also branches off from the splenic artery, supplying the stomach. Since the splenic artery was ligated at its origin from the celiac trunk, we need to determine which artery will be hypoperfused as a result. Given the information, the gastroduodenal artery will be hypoperfused because it is a branch of the common hepatic artery, which is now compromised due to the ligation of the splenic artery. The left gastric artery and the left gastroepiploic artery are branches of the celiac trunk, so they will not be directly affected by the ligation of the splenic artery. The common hepatic artery, although it is the parent artery of the gastroduodenal artery, will still be perfused through its other branches, such as the proper hepatic artery and the right hepatic artery, which originate from the proper hepatic artery, a branch of the celiac trunk. Therefore, the gastroduodenal artery will be the artery that is hypoperfused as a result of the ligation of the splenic artery at its origin from the celiac trunk.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
