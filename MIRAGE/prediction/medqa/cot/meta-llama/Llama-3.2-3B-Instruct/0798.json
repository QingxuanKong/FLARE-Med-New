    "question": "A 29-year-old G1P0 female presents at 22 weeks gestation for her first prenatal care appointment. Physical exam demonstrates a uterine size greater than expected for her gestational age and taut, shiny skin with scattered striae on her abdomen. Ultrasound examination of the fetus reveals 2.5 L of amniotic fluid (normal 1.5-2.0 L) with an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 34 (normal AFI 20-25). Which of the following fetal abnormalities or dysfunctions could have contributed to these abnormal ultrasound findings?",

        "A": "Renal agenesis",
        "B": "Pulmonary hypoplasia",
        "C": "Duodenal atresia",
        "D": "Posterior urethral valve"

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the clinical presentation and ultrasound findings. The patient is a 29-year-old G1P0 female at 22 weeks gestation with a uterine size greater than expected for her gestational age and taut, shiny skin with scattered striae on her abdomen. The ultrasound examination reveals 2.5 L of amniotic fluid (normal 1.5-2.0 L) with an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 34 (normal AFI 20-25). These findings suggest polyhydramnios, which is a condition characterized by an excessive amount of amniotic fluid. Polyhydramnios can be associated with several fetal abnormalities or dysfunctions. We need to consider the options provided to determine which one could have contributed to these abnormal ultrasound findings.\", \"options\": [ {\"text\": \"A.
