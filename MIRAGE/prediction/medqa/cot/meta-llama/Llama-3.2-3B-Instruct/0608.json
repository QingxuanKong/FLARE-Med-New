    "question": "A 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his grandparents. He is in a wheelchair with soft restraints because he has been violent and had been trying to hurt himself that day. The child\u2019s parents died in a car accident 1 month ago. His grandparents also brought the medications he stopped taking after his parents\u2019 death, including multivitamins, allopurinol, and diazepam. They say that their grandson has been using these medications for many years; however, they are unable to provide any medical history and claim that their grandson has been behaving strangely, exhibiting facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements for the past few days. They also note that he has had no teeth since the time they first met him at the age of 2. An intramuscular medication is administered to calm the boy down prior to drawing blood from him for laboratory tests. Which of the following biochemical pathway abnormalities is the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the pyrimidine metabolism pathway",
        "B": "Aminolevulinic acid synthetase of the heme metabolism pathway",
        "C": "Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the purine metabolism pathway",
        "D": "Thymidylate synthetase of the pyrimidine metabolism pathway"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the symptoms and the patient's history to identify the underlying biochemical pathway abnormality. The patient is a 10-year-old boy with a history of facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, writhing movements, and no teeth. He is also taking medications for multivitamins, allopurinol, and diazepam. The patient's parents died in a car accident 1 month ago, which may indicate a genetic disorder. The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest a possible diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). This enzyme is involved in the purine metabolism pathway. The patient's symptoms, such as facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements, are consistent with the symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The patient's lack of teeth may also be related to the disorder, as HGPRT deficiency can cause dental abnormalities. Allopurinol, which is being taken by the patient, can also exacerbate the symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The administration of diazepam to calm the patient down may also be related to the underlying neurological symptoms. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase of the purine metabolism pathway.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
