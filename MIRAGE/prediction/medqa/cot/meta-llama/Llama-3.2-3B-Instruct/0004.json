    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of itchy, watery eyes for the past week. He has also been sneezing multiple times a day during this period. He had a similar episode 1 year ago around springtime. He has iron deficiency anemia and ankylosing spondylitis. Current medications include ferrous sulfate, artificial tear drops, and indomethacin. He works as an elementary school teacher. His vital signs are within normal limits. Visual acuity is 20/20 without correction. Physical examination shows bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge. The pupils are 3 mm, equal, and reactive to light. Examination of the anterior chamber of the eye is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Erythromycin ointment",
        "B": "Ketotifen eye drops",
        "C": "Warm compresses",
        "D": "Fluorometholone eye drops"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate treatment, let's consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient presents with itchy, watery eyes and sneezing, which suggests an allergic reaction. He has a history of similar episodes around springtime, which is a common time for allergic reactions. His symptoms are consistent with allergic conjunctivitis. Considering his occupation as an elementary school teacher, he is likely exposed to various allergens such as dust, pollen, or pet dander. His medical history of ankylosing spondylitis may be relevant, but it is not directly related to his eye symptoms. The patient is taking ferrous sulfate for iron deficiency anemia and indomethacin for ankylosing spondylitis. There is no indication that these medications are contributing to his eye symptoms. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and his visual acuity is 20/20 without correction, indicating no significant impact on his vision. The physical examination shows bilateral conjunctival injection and watery discharge, which is consistent with allergic conjunctivitis. Given these factors, the most appropriate treatment would be to address the allergic reaction. Erythromycin ointment (A) is typically used to treat bacterial infections, not allergic reactions. Ketotifen eye drops (B) are an antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer, which can be effective in treating allergic conjunctivitis. Warm compresses (C) may provide temporary relief but are not a primary treatment for allergic reactions. Fluorometholone eye drops (D) are a corticosteroid, which can be used to reduce inflammation, but they may not be the first-line treatment for allergic conjunctivitis due to potential side effects and the fact that the patient is already taking indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Therefore, the most appropriate treatment is Ketotifen eye drops (B), which can help alleviate the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
