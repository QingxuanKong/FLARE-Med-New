    "question": "A 3-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of fever, cough, purulent nasal discharge. She has experienced 7 similar episodes, each lasting 2\u20135 days in the previous 2 years. She has also had intermittent abdominal cramps and recurrent episodes of foul-smelling greasy diarrhea in the past year. She is at the 55th percentile for height and 35th percentile for weight. Her temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows an erythematous oropharynx without exudate and tenderness over the frontoethmoidal sinuses. The abdomen is distended, nontender, and tympanitic to percussion. Bowel sounds are increased. Stool microscopy shows pear-shaped multi-flagellated organisms. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Anaphylactic transfusion reactions",
        "B": "Cutaneous granulomas",
        "C": "Non-Hodgkin lymphoma",
        "D": "Disseminated tuberculosis"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms, such as recurrent episodes of fever, cough, purulent nasal discharge, abdominal cramps, and foul-smelling greasy diarrhea, are suggestive of a chronic infection. The presence of pear-shaped multi-flagellated organisms in stool microscopy is a key finding. This finding is indicative of Whipple's disease, a rare, systemic bacterial infection caused by *Tropheryma whipplei*. Whipple's disease primarily affects the small intestine, leading to malabsorption and symptoms like those described. The patient's recurrent episodes and the presence of these organisms increase her risk for complications and associated conditions.\\n\\nThe patient's age and symptoms also raise the possibility of other conditions, but the combination of recurrent infections and the presence of *Tropheryma whipplei* makes Whipple's disease the most likely diagnosis. Considering the options provided, the patient is at increased risk for *Non-Hodgkin lymphoma*, as there is a known association between Whipple's disease and an increased risk of developing certain types of lymphoma, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\\n\\nThe other options are less likely given the patient's symptoms and diagnosis. Anaphylactic transfusion reactions are not directly related to Whipple's disease. Cutaneous granulomas are more commonly associated with sarcoidosis or other conditions, not directly linked to Whipple's disease. Disseminated tuberculosis is not indicated by the patient's symptoms or the presence of *Tropheryma whipplei*.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
