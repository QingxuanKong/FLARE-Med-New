    "question": "A 28-year-old male presents to the emergency department with chest pain. He reports that one hour ago he was climbing the stairs in his home when he suddenly developed excruciating chest pain. He describes the pain as ripping and radiating to the back. The patient\u2019s past medical history is significant for a heart murmur that is being followed by his outpatient cardiologist. He takes no medications. The patient works as a carpenter and reports being monogamous with his wife. He denies any history of intravenous drug use or recent travel. In the emergency department, the patient\u2019s temperature is 99.4\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 94/56 mmHg, pulse is 121/min, and respirations are 14/min. On physical exam, the patient appears to be in moderate distress and is clutching his chest. He is tall and has joint hypermobility. His breath sounds are equal and full bilaterally and has weak distal pulses.\n\nWhich of the following is most likely to be found in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Holosystolic, high-pitched blowing murmur at the lower left sternal border",
        "B": "Late systolic crescendo murmur at the apex with mid-systolic click",
        "C": "Mid-diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border",
        "D": "Systolic ejection murmur at the right second intercostal space"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings step by step: 1. **Patient's symptoms**: The patient presents with sudden onset of chest pain radiating to the back, which is a classic symptom of aortic dissection. The pain is described as \"ripping\" and is a significant concern for this diagnosis. 2. **Vital signs**: The patient's blood pressure is low (94/56 mmHg), pulse is tachycardic (121/min), and respirations are slightly decreased (14/min). These findings suggest shock, which is consistent with aortic dissection. 3. **Physical exam findings**: The patient appears to be in moderate distress, clutching his chest, and has weak distal pulses. The presence of weak distal pulses is a concerning sign, as it may indicate decreased perfusion to the lower extremities due to aortic dissection. 4. **Past medical history and physical exam findings**: The patient has a history of a heart murmur, which is being followed by his cardiologist. However, the physical exam does not reveal any abnormalities that would suggest a cardiac cause for his current symptoms. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is aortic dissection, which is a medical emergency. Now, let's consider the options: A. **Holosystolic, high-pitched blowing murmur at the lower left sternal border**: This murmur is consistent with aortic regurgitation, which is not the primary concern in this patient. B. **Late systolic crescendo murmur at the apex with mid-systolic click**: This murmur is consistent with mitral stenosis or mitral valve prolapse, which is not the primary concern in this patient. C. **Mid-diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border**: This murmur is consistent with aortic stenosis, which is not the primary concern in this patient. D. **Systolic ejection murmur at the right second intercostal space**: This murmur is consistent with aortic stenosis, but the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are more suggestive of aortic dissection. However, none of the options directly mention aortic dissection. Since aortic dissection is not listed among the options, I will choose the closest option that could be associated with aortic dissection: The closest option that could be associated with aortic dissection is a systolic ejection murmur, which can be heard in aortic stenosis, but it's worth noting that aortic stenosis is not the primary concern in this patient. However, since none of the options directly mention aortic dissection, I will choose the closest one. The answer is D.",
