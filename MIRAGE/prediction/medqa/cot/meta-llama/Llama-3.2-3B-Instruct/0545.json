    "question": "A 24-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a severe headache. She states it is 10/10 in intensity and states that it is associated with chewing. She describes it as a dull pain over the sides of her head. The patient is otherwise healthy and is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 97.0\u00b0F (36.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 111/74 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for pain and tenderness over the mandibular and temporal region that is worsened when the patient opens and closes their mouth. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Migraine headache",
        "B": "Temporal arteritis",
        "C": "Temporomandibular joint dysfunction",
        "D": "Tension headache"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the key elements of the patient's presentation. The patient reports a severe headache (10/10 intensity) that is associated with chewing, which suggests that the pain is related to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The location of the pain over the sides of the head, particularly the mandibular and temporal region, further supports this. The physical exam findings of pain and tenderness in this area, worsened by opening and closing the mouth, are classic signs of TMJ dysfunction. Additionally, the patient's otherwise healthy status and lack of medication use make TMJ dysfunction a more likely diagnosis than other options such as tension headache or migraine headache. Temporal arteritis is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms such as jaw claudication, visual disturbances, or fever. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is temporomandibular joint dysfunction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
