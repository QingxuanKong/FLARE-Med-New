    "question": "A 42-year-old woman with a history of depression and headaches presents to the emergency room with severe, pulsating pain around the crown of her head beginning 12 hours ago. She last took ibuprofen 2 hours ago but did not feel any improvement in the pain. She has been nauseous and unable to get out of bed and is currently laying in the dark with the lights off. Her depression has improved, and she has stopped taking her sertraline 2 months ago. Other than ibuprofen as needed, she is not currently taking any additional medications. Which of the following would be the best treatment for her acute symptoms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "No treatment necessary",
        "B": "100% oxygen",
        "C": "Propranolol",
        "D": "Sumatriptan"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's symptoms of severe, pulsating pain around the crown of her head, nausea, and inability to get out of bed, it is essential to consider the possibility of a migraine. The patient's history of depression and recent stoppage of sertraline may be relevant, but the acute symptoms presented are more suggestive of a migraine. The patient's lack of response to ibuprofen after 2 hours also raises concerns about the potential for a more severe migraine. The presence of nausea and inability to get out of bed may indicate a migraine with aura, which can cause significant disability. The patient's symptoms do not suggest an acute coronary syndrome or other cardiac conditions that would require immediate attention. Therefore, option A (No treatment necessary) is not the best choice. Option C (Propranolol) is a beta-blocker that is often used for migraine prophylaxis, but it is not typically used as a treatment for acute migraine attacks. Option D (Sumatriptan) is a triptan that is commonly used to treat acute migraine attacks. It works by constricting blood vessels and blocking pain pathways in the brain. Given the patient's severe symptoms and lack of response to ibuprofen, sumatriptan is a reasonable option for acute treatment. Option B (100% oxygen) may be beneficial in certain cases of migraine with aura, but it is not the most effective treatment for this patient's symptoms. Therefore, the best treatment for her acute symptoms would be option D (Sumatriptan).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
