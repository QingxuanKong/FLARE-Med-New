    "question": "A 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department 1 hour after falling from his bicycle. The boy was racing with his cousin when he lost control and fell onto his right side. He has nausea and severe pain in the right shoulder. He is in acute distress. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. Examination shows swelling and tenderness over the right clavicle and pain exacerbated by movement; range of motion is limited. The skin over the clavicle is intact. The radial pulse in the right arm is intact. Sensory examination of the right upper limb shows no abnormalities. An x\u2011ray of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's shoulder?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Perform tension banding",
        "B": "Apply a simple shoulder sling",
        "C": "Obtain an MRI of the right shoulder",
        "D": "Perform arteriography"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's shoulder, we need to consider the clinical presentation and the radiographic findings. The patient is a 15-year-old boy who has fallen from a bicycle and presents with severe pain and swelling in the right shoulder, with limited range of motion. The skin over the clavicle is intact, and the radial pulse in the right arm is intact, indicating no immediate concern for vascular compromise. The absence of abnormalities in the sensory examination of the right upper limb suggests that there is no neurological injury. Given the mechanism of injury and the physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a clavicular fracture, which is further supported by the x-ray findings (though the actual x-ray results are not provided). The key consideration is to stabilize the fracture to allow for healing and prevent further injury or complications. Among the options provided, tension banding is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's shoulder fracture. Tension banding is a surgical technique used to treat displaced or unstable fractures, especially in children and adolescents, as it provides stable fixation and promotes healing. It is particularly useful for clavicular fractures, which are common in this age group. A simple shoulder sling may provide some support, but it would not be sufficient to stabilize the fracture. Obtaining an MRI of the right shoulder may be considered if there is concern for a more complex injury, such as a rotator cuff injury, but it is not the immediate next step in managing a suspected clavicular fracture. Performing arteriography is not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of vascular compromise or suspicion of an arterial injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
