    "question": "A 39-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of a sharp pain that radiates along his right hemithorax, which worsens with deep inspiration. He says this started abruptly about 6 hours ago. He says that he has not noticed that anything that makes his pain better or worse. He also denies any other symptoms. He works as a long-haul truck driver, and he informs you that he recently returned to the east coast from a trip to Utah. His medical history is significant for gout, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia from when he was a child. He currently smokes 2 packs of cigarettes/day, drinks a 6-pack of beer/day, and he denies any illicit drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 98/min, and respiratory rate 23/min. His physical examination shows minimal bibasilar rales, but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, normal heart sounds, and a benign abdominal physical examination. Which of the following is the most reasonable 1st step towards ruling out the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in a low-risk patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "ECG",
        "B": "V/Q scan",
        "C": "D-dimer",
        "D": "CT pulmonary angiogram with IV contrast"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sudden onset of sharp pain radiating to the right hemithorax, which worsens with deep inspiration, a classic symptom of pleuritic chest pain. This presentation, combined with his history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) risk factors (long-haul truck driving, recent long-distance travel, and smoking), makes pulmonary embolism (PE) a possible diagnosis. However, the patient is described as a low-risk patient for PE, as he is not a smoker, does not have a history of previous DVT, and does not have any other high-risk factors. The key is to identify a test that can quickly and accurately rule out PE in this low-risk patient. The D-dimer test is a useful initial screening tool for PE, as it is sensitive and specific for acute DVT and PE. However, it is not specific and can result in false positives. Therefore, a negative D-dimer would not definitively rule out PE, but a positive result would prompt further testing. A V/Q scan or CT pulmonary angiogram with IV contrast are more specific tests for PE, but are not typically used as initial screening tests due to their higher cost and radiation exposure. An ECG is not directly relevant to diagnosing PE, but it can be used to rule out other cardiac causes of chest pain. Given the patient's low-risk status, the most reasonable first step is to order the D-dimer test to quickly and non-invasively assess for DVT and PE.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
