    "question": "A 17-year-old girl is brought to the physician because she has not attained menarche. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She is 168 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 63 kg (139 lb); BMI is 22.3 kg/m2. Examination shows normal breast development. Scant axillary hair is present. Abdominal examination shows a firm, nontender left inguinal mass. Pelvic examination shows a blind vaginal pouch. Ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "5-\u03b1 reductase deficiency",
        "B": "Sex chromosome mosaicism",
        "C": "Sex chromosome monosomy",
        "D": "Androgen insensitivity"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the key findings and analyze them step by step: 1. **Primary amenorrhea**: The patient has not attained menarche, which is the first menstrual period, at the age of 17. Primary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menarche by the age of 16 years in girls with normal secondary sexual characteristics or by the age of 14 years in girls with delayed puberty. 2. **Normal breast development**: The patient has normal breast development, which suggests that there is adequate estrogen production. Estrogen is responsible for the development of breast tissue. 3. **Scant axillary hair**: The lack of axillary hair suggests that there is not enough androgen (male hormone) production or sensitivity. 4. **Firm, nontender left inguinal mass**: This finding is suggestive of a testicular mass or a disorder of sex development. 5. **Blind vaginal pouch**: This finding is consistent with Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, a condition where there is a congenital absence or underdevelopment of the vagina and uterus. 6. **Ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries**: This confirms the absence of a uterus and ovaries, which is consistent with MRKH syndrome. Given these findings, let's evaluate the options: - **A. 5-\u03b1 reductase deficiency**: This condition is characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme responsible for converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, a potent androgen. Patients with 5-\u03b1 reductase deficiency typically have normal or increased axillary hair and clitoral size, which is not the case in this patient. - **B. Sex chromosome mosaicism**: This condition occurs when there is a mixture of normal and abnormal cells in the body. While it can cause various reproductive tract abnormalities, it does not directly explain the patient's lack of axillary hair. - **C. Sex chromosome monosomy**: This condition involves the presence of only one X chromosome in cells, which is not the case in this patient. The patient has a normal karyotype, as indicated by the absence of a uterus or ovaries. - **D. Androgen insensitivity**: This condition occurs when the body's cells are insensitive to androgens, leading to a lack of axillary hair and clitoral development. However, the patient has normal breast development, which suggests that androgen sensitivity is not the primary issue. Considering these points, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is **B. Sex chromosome mosaicism**, which can lead to various reproductive tract abnormalities, including MRKH syndrome, and does not affect androgen sensitivity. ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's normal breast development and lack of axillary hair suggest that androgen sensitivity is not the primary issue.
