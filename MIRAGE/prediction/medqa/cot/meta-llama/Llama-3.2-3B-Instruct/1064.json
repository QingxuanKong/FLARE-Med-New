    "question": "A 22-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of swelling in her face, hands, and neck with occasional abdominal pain. The symptoms usually resolve in 2 to 3 days. She has had these swelling events her whole life; however, they have become more debilitating recently. Last week she had an event that restricted her ability to eat and swallow.  Past medical history is noncontributory. Her father is alive and well with no significant medical history. Her mother and her maternal aunt have a similar condition. Today, her physical exam is within normal limits. She brought a picture of her swollen hand as seen in the picture. The treating physician has a strong suspicion of an inherited disorder. C1-inhibitor levels are ordered and found to be extremely low. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Chediak-Higashi syndrome",
        "B": "Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome",
        "C": "Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria",
        "D": "Hereditary angioedema"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and physical exam: 1. The patient is a 22-year-old woman with recurrent episodes of swelling in her face, hands, and neck that resolve in 2-3 days. This suggests a condition that is episodic and self-limiting. 2. The swelling events have been present her whole life, but have worsened recently, and one episode was severe enough to restrict her ability to eat and swallow. 3. The family history is notable for her mother and maternal aunt having a similar condition, suggesting an inherited pattern. 4. The low C1-inhibitor levels strongly point towards a disorder of the complement system, specifically one that affects the regulation of C1-inhibitor. Given these points, let's evaluate the options: A. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by albinism, immunodeficiency, and bleeding tendency, but it doesn't typically present with episodic swelling. B. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and immune deficiency, but it doesn't typically present with episodic swelling. C. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is a rare disorder of the complement system that causes hemolytic anemia, but it doesn't typically present with episodic swelling. D. Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of C1-inhibitor, leading to recurrent episodes of swelling, particularly in the face, hands, and neck. The episodic nature of the swelling, family history, and low C1-inhibitor levels make this the most likely diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is D. Hereditary angioedema.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
