    "question": "A 23-year-old college student presents to the clinic with a history of intermittent chest discomfort. He reports that, about once per month for the past 8 or 9 months, he's had episodes of \"feeling like my chest is going to explode.\" During these episodes, he also feels shortness of breath, feels shakiness throughout his arms and legs, and sweats so heavily that he needs to change his shirt. He is unsure of any clear precipitating factors but thinks they may occur more often around important exams or when big school projects are due. He shares that, as these episodes continue to recur, he has had mounting anxiety about having one when he is in class or at a restaurant. As a result, he is leaving the house less and less. He has no past medical history; the physical exam is unremarkable. Which of the following is the best medication for the long-term management of this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Citalopram",
        "B": "Lithium",
        "C": "Propranolol",
        "D": "Quetiapine"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the patient's symptoms and history: 1. **Symptoms**: The patient experiences episodes of chest discomfort, shortness of breath, shakiness in arms and legs, and heavy sweating, which are accompanied by a fear of having a heart attack or other serious cardiac event. These episodes are recurrent, occurring about once a month for the past 8-9 months. 2. **Triggers**: The patient is unsure of any clear precipitating factors, but they seem to be related to periods of increased stress or anxiety, such as exams or big school projects. 3. **Physical Exam**: The physical exam is unremarkable, indicating no underlying cardiac or other medical issues that could explain the symptoms. 4. **Psychological Impact**: The patient's symptoms have led to avoidance behaviors, such as leaving the house less often, due to anxiety about experiencing an episode. Based on these observations, the patient's symptoms are characteristic of **panic attacks**, which are episodes of intense fear or discomfort that reach a peak within minutes and include symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, and fear of dying or losing control. Now, let's evaluate the medication options: A. **Citalopram** is an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), primarily used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. While it may help with anxiety symptoms, it's not the most effective treatment for panic attacks. B. **Lithium** is a mood stabilizer, primarily used to treat bipolar disorder. It's not typically used to treat anxiety disorders or panic attacks. C. **Propranolol** is a beta-blocker, which can be effective in reducing the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as tremors and palpitations, during panic attacks. However, it does not address the underlying psychological symptoms of anxiety. D. **Quetiapine** is an atypical antipsychotic, primarily used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. While it has anxiolytic effects, it's not the first-line treatment for panic disorder. Given the patient's symptoms and history, the best medication for long-term management of this patient's condition is **C. Propranolol**, as it can help alleviate the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as tremors and palpitations, and is often used as an adjunctive treatment for panic disorder. **{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are characteristic of panic attacks, which require a medication that addresses both physical and psychological symptoms. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, is effective in reducing the physical symptoms of anxiety, making it the best choice for long-term management of this patient's condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
