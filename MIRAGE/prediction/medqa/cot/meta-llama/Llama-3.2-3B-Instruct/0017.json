    "question": "A 3-month-old boy is brought the emergency department by his parents after an episode of cyanosis and muscle hypotonia that resolved after 2 minutes. Diagnostic evaluation fails to discover an exact etiology of the boy's symptoms and the episode is classified as a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). The risk profile for BRUE in infants remains largely unknown. The pediatrician who saw the boy in the emergency department is trying to identify risk factors for BRUE. She is aware of several confounders, including age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She recruits 75 infants under 1 year of age with BRUE and 75 infants without BRUE of the same age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She then compares the two groups with regard to history of feeding problems and history of recent upper respiratory infection. Which of the following methods was conducted to control confounding bias in the study?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Blinding",
        "B": "Restriction",
        "C": "Randomization",
        "D": "Matching"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's break down the process step by step: 1. **Identify the confounding variable**: In this case, the confounding variables are history of feeding problems and history of recent upper respiratory infection, as they can affect the likelihood of BRUE. The pediatrician wants to control for these variables to isolate the effect of BRUE. 2. **Consider the study design**: The pediatrician is comparing two groups of infants (those with BRUE and those without BRUE) and wants to control for the confounding variables. 3. **Analyze the options**: - **A. Blinding**: Blinding is a technique used to prevent bias by ensuring that the researcher or outcome assessor is unaware of the group assignment. However, in this case, the outcome (BRUE) is already known, so blinding is not applicable. - **B. Restriction**: Restriction refers to limiting the study population to a specific group or characteristic. While restriction can help reduce confounding, it doesn't necessarily control for the confounding variable. - **C. Randomization**: Randomization is a technique used to assign participants to groups randomly, which can help minimize confounding. However, in this case, the confounding variables (feeding problems and recent upper respiratory infection) are not randomly assigned. - **D. Matching**: Matching involves pairing participants with similar characteristics in both groups (e.g., matching infants with BRUE to those without BRUE based on history of feeding problems or recent upper respiratory infection). This method can help control for confounding variables by ensuring that the groups are similar in terms of these characteristics. 4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the method that was conducted to control confounding bias in this study is matching. Here is the output in json format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pediatrician conducted matching to control confounding bias by pairing infants with BRUE to those without BRUE based on history of feeding problems and recent upper respiratory infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
