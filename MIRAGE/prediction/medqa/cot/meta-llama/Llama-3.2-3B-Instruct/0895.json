    "question": "A 2-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician by his parents for a routine visit. Since his 18-month visit, the parents have become concerned that his speech does not seem to be developing appropriately. The parents report that the patient\u2019s vocabulary is still limited to fewer than 10 words, and he is still only using single words to describe things. The parents say that his motor milestones do not seem to be affected, as the patient is very physically active and can run and kick a ball. At times the patient seems hyperactive and can be difficult to redirect. On exam, his temperature is 98.4\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 14/min. The rest of the exam is unremarkable, except that the patient\u2019s face appears to be abnormally long and narrow. The patient is further referred to a geneticist, as he is believed to have a trinucleotide repeat disorder. Which of the following is the most likely inheritance pattern of this disorder?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Autosomal dominant",
        "B": "Autosomal recessive",
        "C": "Noninherited somatic mutation",
        "D": "X-linked dominant"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 2-year-old boy with limited vocabulary, using only single words to describe things, and hyperactive behavior. The face appears abnormally long and narrow. 2. **Developmental Concerns**: The boy's speech development is a significant concern, as his vocabulary is limited and he is using only single words. This could be indicative of a neurodevelopmental disorder. 3. **Physical Examination**: The boy's face appears abnormally long and narrow, which could suggest a genetic disorder affecting growth and development. 4. **Referred to a Geneticist**: The patient is referred to a geneticist due to concerns about a trinucleotide repeat disorder. Trinucleotide repeat disorders are a group of genetic disorders caused by expansions of trinucleotide repeats in specific genes, leading to various neurological and developmental issues. 5. **Inheritance Patterns**: - **Autosomal Dominant (A)**: A disorder that can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern if one copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the condition. This could be a possible inheritance pattern, given the patient's developmental concerns and physical abnormalities. - **Autosomal Recessive (B)**: A disorder that requires two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to manifest. This might not fit with the boy's presentation, as he only has one parent with the disorder (implied, not explicitly stated). - **Noninherited Somatic Mutation (C)**: A mutation that occurs in non-reproductive cells, not passed on to offspring. This could be a possible explanation for the boy's condition, but it doesn't fit with the referral to a geneticist for a trinucleotide repeat disorder. - **X-linked Dominant (D)**: A disorder that is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern, where a single copy of the mutated gene on the X chromosome is sufficient to cause the condition. This is less likely, as the disorder is not specified to be on the X chromosome. Considering the boy's developmental concerns, physical examination findings, and referral to a geneticist for a trinucleotide repeat disorder, the most likely inheritance pattern is **Autosomal Dominant (A)**. This is because trinucleotide repeat disorders are typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, and the boy's presentation is consistent with this type of disorder. **Output:** ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The boy's developmental concerns, physical examination findings, and referral to a geneticist for a trinucleotide repeat disorder suggest an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.
