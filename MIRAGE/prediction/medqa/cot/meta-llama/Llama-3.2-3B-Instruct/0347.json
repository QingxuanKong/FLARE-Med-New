    "question": "A 66-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider with several days of left flank pain radiating to the abdomen and groin. The patient states that she has noticed a pink tinge to her urine as well. Of note, she has not had any fevers, but endorses several months of fatigue and constipation. The patient was previously healthy except for mild untreated hypertension. On exam, her temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/84 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 12/min. On further workup, the patient is found to have calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis with hypercalciuria. Blood studies demonstrate increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) and hypercalcemia. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Primary hyperparathyroidism",
        "B": "Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism",
        "C": "Secondary hyperparathyroidism",
        "D": "Tertiary hyperparathyroidism"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results to determine the most likely cause of her hyperparathyroidism. The patient presents with left flank pain radiating to the abdomen and groin, which is a classic symptom of kidney stones, specifically nephrolithiasis. The presence of calcium oxalate stones and hypercalciuria (excessive calcium in the urine) further supports this diagnosis. The patient's fatigue and constipation are also common symptoms associated with kidney stones. The patient's blood studies show increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) and hypercalcemia (elevated calcium levels in the blood). This suggests that the patient has hyperparathyroidism, a condition characterized by an overproduction of PTH. Now, let's consider the types of hyperparathyroidism: Primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by a parathyroid gland disorder, such as a parathyroid adenoma or hyperplasia, which leads to excessive PTH production. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is caused by a decrease in calcium levels in the blood, which stimulates the parathyroid glands to produce more PTH. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is a complication of chronic kidney disease, where the parathyroid glands become overactive in response to prolonged hypocalcemia (low calcium levels). Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism is a rare genetic disorder that affects the parathyroid glands, but it is not typically associated with hyperparathyroidism. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely cause of her hyperparathyroidism is secondary hyperparathyroidism, as the excessive calcium in the urine and hypercalciuria may be a result of chronic kidney disease or other underlying conditions that have led to hypocalcemia, which in turn stimulated the parathyroid glands to produce more PTH.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
