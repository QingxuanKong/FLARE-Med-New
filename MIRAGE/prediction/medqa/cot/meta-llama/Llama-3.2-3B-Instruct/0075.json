    "question": "A 5-year-old female is brought to a speech therapist for continuing work on improving her communication skills. She is only able to verbalize two word sentences and has generalized developmental delay. When she was born it was noticed that she had a high pitched mewing cry and subsequent physical exam revealed microcephaly, prominent epicanthal folds, and a holosystolic murmur best heard in the left 5th intercostal space near the sternum. An abnormality of which of the following chromosomes is most likely responsible for this patient's disorder?",
    "options": {
        "A": "5",
        "B": "7",
        "C": "18",
        "D": "21"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To determine the most likely chromosomal abnormality responsible for this patient's disorder, let's analyze the provided symptoms: 1. **Verbalization of only two-word sentences and generalized developmental delay**: This suggests a possible intellectual disability or cognitive impairment, which can be associated with various genetic conditions. 2. **High-pitched mewing cry**: This is a distinctive feature of Down syndrome, a condition caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 (Trisomy 21). 3. **Microcephaly (small head size)**: This is another common feature of Down syndrome. 4. **Prominent epicanthal folds**: These are also a common finding in individuals with Down syndrome. 5. **Holosystolic murmur best heard in the left 5th intercostal space near the sternum**: This cardiac finding is also consistent with Down syndrome, as it can be associated with atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD), a common congenital heart defect in individuals with Down syndrome. Considering these symptoms, the most likely chromosomal abnormality responsible for this patient's disorder is **Trisomy 21**, also known as Down syndrome. Therefore, the answer is: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms, including verbalization of only two-word sentences, microcephaly, prominent epicanthal folds, and a holosystolic murmur, are consistent with Down syndrome, which is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 (Trisomy 21).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" } ```",
