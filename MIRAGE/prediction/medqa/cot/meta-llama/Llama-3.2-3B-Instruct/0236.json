    "question": "A 7-month-old male infant is brought to the pediatrician by his mother. She reports that the child develops severe sunburns every time the infant is exposed to sunlight. She has applied copious amounts of sunscreen to the infant but this has not helped the problem. On examination, there are multiple areas of reddened skin primarily in sun exposed areas. The child\u2019s corneas appear irritated and erythematous. Which of the following processes is likely impaired in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Nucleotide excision repair",
        "B": "Non-homologous end joining",
        "C": "Homologous recombination",
        "D": "Mismatch repair"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the key information provided and relate it to the potential answers: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The infant develops severe sunburns, especially in sun-exposed areas, and has irritated and erythematous corneas. This suggests an issue with DNA damage caused by UV radiation, which is a hallmark of a condition known as xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). 2. **Understanding Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP)**: XP is a rare genetic disorder characterized by an increased sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun and other sources. This sensitivity leads to severe sunburns, blistering, and skin cancer. One of the hallmarks of XP is the inability to repair UV-induced DNA damage. 3. **DNA Repair Mechanisms**: - **Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER)**: This pathway is responsible for repairing UV-induced DNA damage, including cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PPs). These are types of DNA damage caused by UV radiation. - **Non-homologous End Joining (NHEJ)**: This pathway is primarily involved in repairing double-strand breaks in DNA. - **Homologous Recombination**: This pathway is crucial for repairing double-strand breaks through the use of a template to repair the break. - **Mismatch Repair (MMR)**: This pathway corrects errors in DNA replication and recombination. Given the information about the infant's condition and the role of each DNA repair mechanism, we can deduce that the impaired process in this patient is most likely related to repairing UV-induced DNA damage. **Step-by-Step Thinking**: - UV radiation causes DNA damage, specifically cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PPs). - The repair of these types of damage is primarily through Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER). - Since the infant has severe sunburns and corneal irritation, it indicates a significant impairment in the repair of UV-induced DNA damage. **Conclusion**: The process that is likely impaired in this patient, given the clinical presentation of severe sunburns and corneal irritation, is the repair of UV-induced DNA damage, which is primarily mediated by Nucleotide Excision Repair. **Answer Choice**: A. Nucleotide Excision Repair",
