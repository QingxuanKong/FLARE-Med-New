    "question": "A 33-year-old G2P1 woman presents to the office because of poor diabetic control. She is currently at 18 weeks gestation and admits to having poor control of her type 1 diabetes before becoming pregnant. Her family history is non-contributory. The physical examination shows a pregnant woman with a fundal height of 20 cm (7.9 in). An abdominal ultrasound is ordered. Which of the following is the most likely congenital abnormality shown on the ultrasound?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Amelia",
        "B": "Sacral agenesis",
        "C": "Spina bifida",
        "D": "Ventricular septal defect"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and the ultrasound findings. The patient is a pregnant woman with poor control of her type 1 diabetes at 18 weeks gestation, and the physical examination shows a fundal height of 20 cm (7.9 in). This is higher than the expected range for gestational age, which may indicate fetal macrosomia. Fetal macrosomia is often associated with maternal diabetes. Considering the patient's history of poor diabetic control, the ultrasound findings are likely to be related to the effects of diabetes on fetal development. The options provided are congenital abnormalities that can be detected on an ultrasound. We need to consider which one is most likely to be associated with fetal macrosomia and maternal diabetes. A. Amelia is a rare congenital anomaly where the entire upper limb is absent. It is not typically associated with maternal diabetes. B. Sacral agenesis is a congenital anomaly where there is a failure of the development of the lower spine. It can be associated with maternal diabetes, but it is not the most likely finding in this case. C. Spina bifida is a congenital anomaly where the spine and spinal cord do not properly form. It can be associated with maternal diabetes, and the risk is increased in pregnancies complicated by diabetes. The ultrasound finding of spina bifida is a strong indicator of this association. D. Ventricular septal defect is a congenital heart defect where there is an opening in the wall between the heart's two lower chambers. It is not typically associated with maternal diabetes. Given the patient's history of poor diabetic control and the ultrasound findings, the most likely congenital abnormality is spina bifida, which is often associated with maternal diabetes and fetal macrosomia.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
