    "question": "A 51-year-old man presents to his primary care provider for intermittent shaking of his hands. He reports that for the last several years he has noticed this \"shaking\" when he brushes his teeth and prepares a cup of coffee in the morning. The shaking then gradually improves over the course of the day. His past medical history is otherwise notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His only home medication is pravastatin. The patient smokes half a pack per day of cigarettes and drinks 2-3 beers throughout the day. His family history is significant for Parkinson disease in his father. On physical exam, his blood pressure is 159/84, pulse is 74/min, and respirations are 12/min. He has a high frequency bilateral hand tremor elicited on finger-to-nose testing. His neurological exam is otherwise unremarkable. This patient should be started on which of the following medications?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Alprazolam",
        "B": "Primidone",
        "C": "Propranolol",
        "D": "Trihexyphenidyl"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this patient's case, we need to consider the symptoms and history provided. The patient presents with a high-frequency bilateral hand tremor that improves over the course of the day, which is a classic description of a resting tremor. The tremor is most prominent during activities such as brushing teeth and preparing coffee, which suggests that it is likely a action tremor or a postural tremor, but the improvement over the course of the day suggests it may also have a resting component. The patient's past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, as well as his family history of Parkinson's disease, are important considerations. However, the patient's medication list does not include any anticholinergic or dopaminergic agents, which are commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease. The patient's smoking history is also noted, which may be relevant in the context of his hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but it is not directly relevant to his tremor. Given these considerations, the most likely diagnosis is essential tremor, which is a common and often treatable cause of action tremors. The treatment options for essential tremor include beta blockers, primidone, and other anti-seizure medications, as well as lifestyle modifications such as reducing caffeine and nicotine intake. The patient's tremor is most likely a primary tremor rather than a side effect of his hypertension or hyperlipidemia, so a medication that is effective for essential tremor would be the most appropriate choice. Primidone is a first-line treatment for essential tremor and is effective for both action and resting tremors, making it a good choice for this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
