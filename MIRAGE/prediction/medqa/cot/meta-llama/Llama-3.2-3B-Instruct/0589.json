    "question": "A 36-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 2, comes to the emergency department because of sudden-onset, severe right flank pain. She was in her aerobics class when the pain started but denies any trauma to the region. She has a history of recurrent ovarian cysts. Menses occur regularly at 28-day intervals. Her temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (99.3\u00b0F). Abdominal examination shows tenderness in the right lower quadrant with guarding. Pelvic ultrasound shows a large simple cyst on the right ovary. Right ovarian artery flow is detectable on Doppler, but there is no flow detected in the right ovarian vein. Which of the following ligaments is most likely to have been involved?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Broad ligament",
        "B": "Ovarian ligament",
        "C": "Cardinal ligament",
        "D": "Infundibulopelvic ligament"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and examination findings. The patient presents with sudden-onset, severe right flank pain, which is a common presentation for ovarian torsion. The history of recurrent ovarian cysts and the presence of a large simple cyst on the right ovary support this diagnosis. The absence of trauma and the regular menstrual cycle also make ovarian torsion a more likely cause of the pain. The key finding is the absence of flow in the right ovarian vein, which is a red flag for ovarian torsion. Ovarian torsion can occur when the ovary becomes twisted, cutting off its blood supply. The right ovarian artery flow is detectable, but the ovarian vein is not, indicating that the torsion is likely to be complete. The ligaments that support the ovary are the infundibulopelvic ligament, the suspensory ligament of the ovary, and the broad ligament. The infundibulopelvic ligament is the most critical ligament in maintaining the position of the ovary, and its involvement would lead to ovarian torsion. Therefore, the most likely ligament involved in this case is the infundibulopelvic ligament.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
