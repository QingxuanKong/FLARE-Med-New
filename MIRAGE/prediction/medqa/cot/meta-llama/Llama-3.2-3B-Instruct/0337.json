    "question": "A 22-year-old woman from a rural area who recently discovered she was pregnant is referred for a cardiology consultation due to cyanosis, dyspnea, and a cardiac murmur revealed at the initial prenatal visit. She is gravida 1, para 0 with an estimated gestational age of 19 weeks. She says that the murmur was found in her childhood, and the doctor at that time placed her under observation only. However, she has been lost to follow-up and has not had proper follow up in years. Currently, she complains of dizziness and occasional dyspnea on exertion which has gradually increased during her pregnancy. Prior to her pregnancy, she did not have any symptoms. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/60 mm Hg, heart rate 81/min, respiratory rate 13/min, and temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F). Her examination is significant for acrocyanosis and a fixed splitting of S2 and grade 3/6 midsystolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border. Which of the following physiological pregnancy changes is causing the change in this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Increase in heart rate",
        "B": "Decrease in systemic vascular resistance",
        "C": "Increase in cardiac output",
        "D": "Increase in blood volume"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a possible diagnosis of a congenital heart defect, specifically an atrial septal defect (ASD) or a ventricular septal defect (VSD), which was previously undiagnosed or untreated. The fixed splitting of S2 and the midsystolic murmur are consistent with this diagnosis. During pregnancy, the physiological changes that may contribute to the worsening of the patient's condition include an increase in cardiac output, which can increase the volume load on the heart and potentially exacerbate the underlying defect. Additionally, the increased blood volume and cardiac output can lead to increased pulmonary blood flow and potentially worsen the symptoms of dyspnea and dizziness. However, the most significant factor in this case is the increase in cardiac output, which can increase the pressure gradient across the defect, leading to increased flow and potentially worsening the symptoms. The patient's symptoms have gradually increased during pregnancy, suggesting that the underlying condition is not being adequately managed. The correct answer is the one that is most directly related to the worsening of the patient's symptoms during pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
