    "question": "A 2-month-old infant is brought to the emergency department by her mother due to a fall. Tearfully, the patient\u2019s mother describes witnessing her child fall from the changing table. The patient was born prematurely at 36 weeks estimated gestational age via vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery. The patient is afebrile. Her vital signs include: blood pressure of 94/60 mm Hg, pulse 200/min, and respiratory rate 70/min. Physical examination reveals a subconjunctival hemorrhage in the left eye and multiple bruises on the chest and back. Which of the following is the best initial step in management of this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "CT scan of the head",
        "B": "Involvement of social services",
        "C": "Family counseling",
        "D": "Rule out medical conditions"

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this case, we need to consider the patient's age, history, and presentation. The patient is a 2-month-old infant who was born prematurely and has suffered a fall from a changing table. The mother's tearful description of the incident and the presence of a subconjunctival hemorrhage, multiple bruises on the chest and back, and tachycardia suggest a potential for non-accidental trauma (shaken baby syndrome). Shaken baby syndrome is a serious condition that occurs when an infant is violently shaken, which can cause brain injury, fractures, and other internal injuries. Given the age and presentation of the patient, the primary concern is to assess for any potential internal injuries and to initiate an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the fall. The initial step in management should be to rule out any potential medical conditions that may be causing the patient's symptoms, such as a head injury that may require imaging. However, given the suspicion of non-accidental trauma, the primary concern should be to assess for any potential internal injuries and to initiate an investigation. A CT scan of the head (A) may be necessary later in the evaluation, but it is not the best initial step. Involvement of social services (B) is crucial in cases of suspected child abuse, but it should not be the first step in management. Family counseling (C) may be necessary, but it is not the initial step in management. Therefore, the best initial step in management is to rule out medical conditions (D) that may be causing the patient's symptoms, such as a head injury, while also initiating an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the fall and considering involvement of social services if necessary.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
