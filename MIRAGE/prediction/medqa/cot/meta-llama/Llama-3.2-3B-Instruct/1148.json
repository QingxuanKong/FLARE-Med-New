    "question": "A researcher evaluates healthy breast tissue from 100 women, 50 women that were pregnant at the time of the study and 50 age-matched non-pregnant women. The breast tissue in pregnant women contained an increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation compared to the non-pregnant women. Which process caused this change?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Hyperplasia",
        "B": "Hypertrophy",
        "C": "Atrophy",
        "D": "Metaplasia"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's analyze the information step by step: 1. **Understanding the context**: The question is about the change in breast tissue in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women. Specifically, it mentions an increase in the number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation. 2. **Defining key terms**: - **Hyperplasia**: An increase in the number of cells in an organ or tissue, which can lead to an increase in the size of the organ or tissue. - **Hypertrophy**: An increase in the size of cells, which can lead to an increase in the size of the organ or tissue. - **Atrophy**: A decrease in the size of cells, which can lead to a decrease in the size of the organ or tissue. - **Metaplasia**: A change in the type of cells in an organ or tissue, where one type of cell is replaced by another type. 3. **Analyzing the information**: The question states that the breast tissue in pregnant women has an increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation. This indicates an increase in the number of cells (hyperplasia) rather than an increase in the size of the cells (hypertrophy) or a decrease in the size of the cells (atrophy). 4. **Conclusion**: Based on the information provided, the process that caused the change in breast tissue is an increase in the number of cells, which is characteristic of hyperplasia. **Answer**: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The change in breast tissue in pregnant women is an increase in the number of cells, which is characteristic of hyperplasia. This is the correct answer because hyperplasia involves an increase in the number of cells, whereas the other options involve changes in the size of cells or the type of cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"} ```",
