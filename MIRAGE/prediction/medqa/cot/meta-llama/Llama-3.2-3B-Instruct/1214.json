    "question": "Ten days after undergoing a cadaveric renal transplant, a 21-year-old man has pain in the right lower abdomen and generalized fatigue. During the past 2 days, he has had decreasing urinary output. He passed 5 liters of urine on the second postoperative day and serum studies showed a creatinine concentration of 2.1 mg/dL. He has adult polycystic kidney disease and was on maintenance hemodialysis for 2 months prior to transplantation. Current medications include azathioprine, cyclosporine, prednisone, and enalapril. He appears lethargic. His temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 164/94 mm Hg. Examination shows a healing surgical incision in the right lower abdomen. The graft site shows tenderness to palpation. His blood urea nitrogen concentration is 52 mg/dL, creatinine concentration is 4.1 mg/dL. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows tubulitis. C4d staining is negative. Which of the following is the most likely responsible for this patient's findings?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Recipient T-cells in the graft",
        "B": "Drug-induced nephrotoxicity",
        "C": "Fibrosis of the glomerular vessels",
        "D": "Newly formed anti-HLA antibodies\n\""
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results after a cadaveric renal transplant. The patient presents with abdominal pain, generalized fatigue, decreased urinary output, and a rising creatinine concentration, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient has a history of adult polycystic kidney disease and was on hemodialysis prior to transplantation, which increases the risk of complications such as delayed graft function. The presence of tubulitis in the biopsy of the transplanted kidney suggests an immune-mediated process. C4d staining is negative, which makes acute rejection less likely. Acute cellular rejection is often associated with C4d positivity, so this finding does not support rejection. The patient is on immunosuppressive medications, including azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone, which can cause nephrotoxicity. However, the rising creatinine concentration and the presence of tubulitis suggest a more specific cause. Fibrosis of the glomerular vessels is not directly related to the patient's current presentation. Considering the patient's history of adult polycystic kidney disease and the presence of tubulitis, the most likely cause of the patient's findings is drug-induced nephrotoxicity, specifically due to cyclosporine. Cyclosporine is known to cause nephrotoxicity, which can manifest as acute kidney injury, and can be associated with tubulitis. This is a common side effect of cyclosporine, especially in the early postoperative period. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Drug-induced nephrotoxicity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
