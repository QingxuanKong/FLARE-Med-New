    "question": "A 78-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with weight loss, abdominal pain, and jaundice. CT demonstrates a mass in the head of the pancreas, and biopsy is planned for the following day. The patient's daughter approaches you outside the room to request that the results of the biopsy not be shared with the patient. She asks that the results instead be shared with her and her brother, who is the patient's documented health care proxy. She explains that she and her brother have discussed the situation and decided that it is best to not inform the patient that she has cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy the next morning confirms the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Which of the following is the best response to the patient's daughter's request?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Ask the patient's son, the documented health care proxy, how he would like to handle the situation",
        "B": "Inquire why the patient's daughter feels her mother should not be informed of the diagnosis",
        "C": "Offer to explain the diagnosis to the patient without using the word \"cancer\"",
        "D": "Tell the patient's daughter that the patient must be informed of the diagnosis"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's daughter is requesting that the patient, who is the documented health care proxy, not be informed of her own diagnosis, and instead be informed by her brother, who is also the documented health care proxy. This is a classic example of a conflict of interest and a violation of the principles of patient autonomy and informed consent. The patient has the right to know their own diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options, regardless of who their health care proxy is. The health care proxy's role is to make decisions on behalf of the patient, not to withhold information from the patient. The patient's daughter's request may be motivated by a desire to avoid distress or to spare the patient's feelings, but it is ultimately the patient's right to make their own decisions about their care. As a healthcare provider, it is essential to prioritize the patient's autonomy and dignity. The patient's brother, as the documented health care proxy, may not be able to make decisions on behalf of the patient if the patient objects to his involvement. Therefore, it is not necessary to involve him in this situation. The patient's daughter's request should be declined, and the patient should be informed of their diagnosis in a compassionate and empathetic manner. The patient's brother should not be involved in this decision, and the patient's autonomy and dignity should be respected.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
