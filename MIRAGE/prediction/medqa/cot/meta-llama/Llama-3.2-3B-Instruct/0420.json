    "question": "A 15-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation of a learning disability. His teachers have reported hyperactivity during class, difficulties with social interaction, and poor scores on reading and writing assessments. Molecular analysis shows an increased number of CGG trinucleotide repeats. Which of the following findings are most likely to be seen on physical examination of this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Frontal balding and cataracts",
        "B": "Long face and large everted ears",
        "C": "Almond-shaped eyes and downturned mouth",
        "D": "Thin upper lip and receding chin"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to identify the condition suggested by the symptoms and molecular analysis. The increased number of CGG trinucleotide repeats is a hallmark of Fragile X syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects 1 in 4000 males and is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability. The symptoms described, such as hyperactivity, difficulties with social interaction, and learning disabilities, are also consistent with Fragile X syndrome. Now, let's review the physical examination findings associated with Fragile X syndrome:\\n\\nFragile X syndrome is characterized by physical features that can vary in severity, but common findings include a long face, large ears, and a prominent jaw. Among the options provided, option B, which mentions a long face and large everted ears, is the most consistent with the physical examination findings of Fragile X syndrome.\\n\\nThe other options are not typically associated with Fragile X syndrome. Frontal balding and cataracts (option A) are more commonly seen in other conditions, such as androgenetic alopecia and cataracts due to aging. Thin upper lip and receding chin (option D) are features of other conditions, such as Down syndrome and other genetic disorders.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely finding on physical examination of this patient is a long face and large everted ears, option B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
