    "question": "A 19-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of severe right shoulder pain and inability to move the shoulder after a fall while climbing outdoors. Examination shows the right upper extremity is externally rotated and slightly abducted. There is loss of the the normal rounded appearance of the shoulder. The right humeral head is palpated below the coracoid process. Sensation to pinprick over which of the following skin areas is most likely to be reduced?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Medial aspect of the upper arm",
        "B": "Lateral aspect of the shoulder",
        "C": "Skin above the clavicle",
        "D": "Dorsal aspect of forearm and hand"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 19-year-old man presenting with severe right shoulder pain and inability to move the shoulder after a fall. This suggests a possible shoulder injury, possibly a dislocation or fracture. 2. **Physical Examination Findings**: - The right upper extremity is externally rotated and slightly abducted. This indicates that the humerus (upper arm bone) is displaced from its normal position, which could be due to a dislocation or fracture. - The loss of the normal rounded appearance of the shoulder suggests that the humeral head (the rounded end of the humerus) is no longer in its normal position, which is consistent with a dislocation. - The humeral head is palpated below the coracoid process, which is the bony prominence at the top of the shoulder. This indicates that the humeral head has displaced downward, likely into the axilla (the armpit). 3. **Nerve Distribution and Sensation**: The question asks about the sensation to pinprick over which skin area would be most likely affected by a reduced (impacted) humeral head. Given the displacement of the humeral head below the coracoid process, the nerves that supply sensation to the affected area would be at risk. - The axillary nerve is responsible for sensation over the lateral aspect of the shoulder and the area above the deltoid muscle. It runs close to the humerus and is at risk in shoulder dislocations, especially when the humeral head is displaced below the coracoid process. - The median nerve supplies sensation to the medial aspect of the upper arm, but this is less likely to be affected by a humeral head displacement below the coracoid process. - The radial nerve runs down the back of the humerus and forearm but is not directly related to the displacement of the humeral head below the coracoid process. - The dorsal aspect of the forearm and hand is primarily supplied by the radial nerve, which is not directly affected by the displacement of the humeral head. Considering these points, the sensation to pinprick over the **lateral aspect of the shoulder** would be most likely affected by a reduced humeral head due to the close proximity of the axillary nerve to the area of potential injury. **Output in JSON format:** ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation and physical examination findings suggest a humeral head dislocation. The axillary nerve, which supplies sensation to the lateral aspect of the shoulder, is at risk due to the displacement of the humeral head below the coracoid process.
