    "question": "A 43-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her brother for severe chest pain. The patient recently lost her husband in a car accident and is still extremely shocked by the event. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 105/67 mm Hg, the heart rate is 96/min and regular, breathing rate is 23/min, and the pulse oximetry is 96%. An S3 heart sound and rales in the lower right and left lung lobes are heard. A 12-lead ECG shows no significant findings. Echocardiography shows an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium. The patient is stabilized and informed about the diagnosis and possible treatment options. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Atrial fibrillation",
        "B": "Constrictive pericarditis",
        "C": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy",
        "D": "Restrictive cardiomyopathy"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key information provided: 1. The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a recent history of severe emotional stress (recently lost her husband in a car accident). 2. The patient presents with severe chest pain, which is a common symptom for several cardiac conditions. 3. The physical examination reveals an S3 heart sound, which is often associated with heart failure or cardiomyopathy. 4. Rales in the lower lung lobes suggest pulmonary congestion, which can be a sign of heart failure. 5. The echocardiography shows an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium, which indicates left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis can be narrowed down. A. Atrial fibrillation is a type of arrhythmia that can cause chest pain and heart failure symptoms, but the echocardiography findings do not specifically support this diagnosis. B. Constrictive pericarditis is a condition where the pericardium becomes stiff and prevents the heart from expanding, leading to heart failure. However, the echocardiography findings do not specifically support this diagnosis. C. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as broken heart syndrome, is a condition where the heart muscle becomes weakened due to intense emotional stress. This condition can present with chest pain, heart failure symptoms, and echocardiographic findings of left ventricular dysfunction, making it a strong candidate for the diagnosis. D. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a condition where the heart muscle becomes stiff, but the echocardiography findings do not specifically support this diagnosis. Based on the patient's recent emotional stress, echocardiography findings, and symptoms, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is the most likely diagnosis.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
