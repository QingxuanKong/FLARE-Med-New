    "question": "A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report",
        "B": "Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake",
        "C": "Report the physician to the ethics committee",
        "D": "Refuse to dictate the operative report"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this scenario, let's analyze the situation step by step. The resident has made a medical error during the carpal tunnel repair, specifically cutting a flexor tendon, which is a significant complication. The attending physician is instructing the resident not to report this error in the operative report, citing the concern of unnecessary patient worry. However, as a medical professional, it is essential to prioritize transparency and honesty in reporting medical errors, especially those that involve a significant complication like this. In medical ethics, the principle of informed consent is crucial. Patients have the right to know about any complications or errors that may arise during their treatment. Reporting this error would allow the patient to make informed decisions about their care and potential future treatment options. Furthermore, not reporting the error could be seen as a breach of the resident's duty to report significant complications, as outlined in various medical codes of ethics, such as the Joint Commission's Sentinel Event Policy. The resident has a responsibility to report this error to the attending physician, but also to the patient, as it is their right to know about their treatment. The attending physician's request to the resident not to report the error may be seen as an attempt to cover up the mistake, which could compromise the resident's professional integrity and the trust between the healthcare provider and patient. Therefore, the correct course of action for the resident is to disclose the error to the patient and include it in the operative report. This approach upholds the principles of transparency, informed consent, and professional integrity.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"A\"",
