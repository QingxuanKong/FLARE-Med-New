    "question": "A 50-year-old woman with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) presents to your clinic with complaints of left eye pain and reduced vision. She notes that she was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to presentation when she noticed some mild tenderness around her left eye, unrelieved by any pain relievers. This morning when she woke up she was unable to see out of her left eye and made an appointment to come see you. Other than SLE, her medical history is unremarkable. She has had no additional symptoms other than pain and vision loss. Her vital signs are all within normal limits. On exam, she has no vision in her left eye, but 20/30 visual acuity in her right eye. When you shine a light in her left eye there is no response. What response would you expect when you shine a light in her right eye?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Bilateral miosis",
        "B": "Miosis of the right eye only",
        "C": "Miosis of the left eye only",
        "D": "Mydriasis of the left eye"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient has SLE and presents with left eye pain, reduced vision, and no response to light in the left eye. This suggests an issue with the left eye, possibly related to the SLE. 2. **Common Complications of SLE**: SLE can cause various ocular complications, including uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis. Given the patient's symptoms, it's likely that the issue is related to the eye. 3. **Anisocoria**: The patient has no response to light in the left eye, which is a sign of anisocoria (unequal pupil size). Anisocoria can be caused by a third cranial nerve palsy (CN III) or other conditions. 4. **Pupil Size**: In this context, miosis (pupil constriction) is a common response to light in the affected eye, as the iris sphincter muscle is affected by the third cranial nerve. However, in the case of CN III palsy, the pupil on the affected side (left eye) is typically dilated (mydriasis) due to the loss of parasympathetic innervation. 5. **Expected Response**: Given the patient's presentation of anisocoria and the likely diagnosis of CN III palsy, we would expect the pupil on the affected side (left eye) to be dilated (mydriasis) when shining a light in that eye. Therefore, the expected response when shining a light in the patient's right eye is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has anisocoria due to CN III palsy, which is likely caused by SLE. The pupil on the affected side (left eye) is dilated (mydriasis), and the pupil on the unaffected side (right eye) will constrict (miosis) in response to light due to intact parasympathetic innervation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
