    "question": "A 46-year-old man presents with worsening pain in multiple joints for the past 2 weeks. He says the pain is most severe in the proximal parts of his fingers and his wrists, but it has now spread to his elbows, and, occasionally, his knees. He says the joint involvement is symmetric. He also complains of morning joint stiffness that improves with activity and reports feeling fatigued during the day. He started taking ibuprofen 2 months ago for the pain which initially subsided, but, over the last few weeks, it has worsened despite the medication. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 1 year ago and has had difficulty controlling his blood glucose levels. The patient denies any smoking history, alcohol, or recreational drug use. A review of systems is significant for a weight loss of 3.0 kg (6.6 lb) over the last 3 months despite no change in diet or activity level. Which of the following is the most likely 1st-line medication in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Infliximab",
        "B": "Anakinra",
        "C": "Methotrexate",
        "D": "High-dose prednisone for 60 days"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient presents with worsening joint pain in multiple joints, particularly in the proximal parts of his fingers, wrists, elbows, and knees, which is symmetric. He also experiences morning joint stiffness that improves with activity, fatigue, and has a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient's weight loss is also a significant finding. Given the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by joint inflammation and pain. RA is more common in individuals with a family history of the disease and is often associated with other autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes. In the treatment of RA, the first-line medications are disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). DMARDs are used to slow down disease progression and reduce joint damage. The options provided include infliximab, anakinra, methotrexate, and high-dose prednisone. Infliximab is a biologic DMARD that targets tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a protein involved in inflammation. While it is effective in treating RA, it is typically used as a second-line treatment after DMARDs have failed or in patients with severe disease. Anakinra is also a biologic DMARD that targets IL-1, another pro-inflammatory cytokine. It is used in the treatment of RA but is typically used as a second-line treatment. High-dose prednisone is a corticosteroid that can be used to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. However, it is not a first-line treatment for RA due to its side effects and the risk of osteoporosis. Methotrexate is a traditional DMARD that has been shown to be effective in treating RA. It is often used as a first-line treatment due to its efficacy and relatively favorable side effect profile. Considering the patient's symptoms and medical history, methotrexate is the most likely first-line medication in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
