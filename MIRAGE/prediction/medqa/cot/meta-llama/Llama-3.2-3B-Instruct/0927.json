    "question": "A 56-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-day history of sudden severe pain in his right great toe. Four months ago, he had an episode of severe joint pain involving his left knee that lasted several days and resolved with over-the-counter analgesics. He has a history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide and nephrolithiasis. Examination shows erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness of the right metatarsophalangeal joint; range of movement is limited by pain. His serum uric acid is 12 mg/dL. Arthrocentesis yields cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 18,500/mm3 (80% segmented neutrophils). Polarized light microscopy of the synovial fluid is shown. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Increased conversion of uric acid to allantoin",
        "B": "Inhibition of phospholipase A",
        "C": "Inhibition of xanthine oxidase",
        "D": "Increased renal excretion of urate"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break down the information provided: 1. **Patient's symptoms**: The patient presents with sudden severe pain in his right great toe, erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness of the right metatarsophalangeal joint, and limited range of movement due to pain. These symptoms are characteristic of gout, a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. 2. **Medical history**: The patient has a history of severe joint pain in the left knee that resolved with over-the-counter analgesics. This could be a previous episode of gout, as gout can cause acute joint inflammation. 3. **Lab results**: The patient's serum uric acid level is elevated at 12 mg/dL, which is above the normal range (typically < 6.0 mg/dL). The arthrocentesis (joint fluid analysis) shows cloudy fluid with a high leukocyte count (18,500/mm3) and a predominance of segmented neutrophils, indicating an inflammatory response. Polarized light microscopy of the synovial fluid would likely show monosodium urate crystals, which are a hallmark of gout. 4. **Pharmacotherapy options**: - A. Increased conversion of uric acid to allantoin: This is not a common or recommended mechanism for treating gout. - B. Inhibition of phospholipase A: This is not a well-established mechanism for gout treatment. - C. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase: This is the correct mechanism of action for allopurinol, a commonly used medication for long-term management of gout. Allopurinol works by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, an enzyme involved in the production of uric acid in the body. - D. Increased renal excretion of urate: This is not a direct mechanism of action for common gout treatments, although some medications may indirectly affect renal urate excretion. Given the information, the most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition (gout) is the inhibition of xanthine oxidase, as it reduces uric acid production. **Answer**: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and lab results are consistent with gout. Allopurinol, which inhibits xanthine oxidase, is a commonly used medication for long-term management of gout. The correct answer is C. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
