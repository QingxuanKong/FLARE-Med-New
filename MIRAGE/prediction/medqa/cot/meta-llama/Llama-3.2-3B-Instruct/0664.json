    "question": "A 9-year-old boy is brought in by his mother because of bruising on his torso and limbs. The patient\u2019s mother denies any other symptoms and says he is otherwise healthy. Physical examination shows multiple petechiae and bruising on the torso and extremities bilaterally. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. A complete blood count is normal. His coagulation profile reveals:\nProthrombin time (PT) 12 sec\nActivated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 60 sec\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia",
        "B": "Immune thrombocytopenic purpura",
        "C": "Von Willebrand disease",
        "D": "Hemophilia A"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 9-year-old boy presenting with bruising on his torso and limbs, which suggests a coagulation disorder. The presence of petechiae (small, pinpoint spots of bleeding under the skin) and bruising bilaterally indicates a problem with the blood's ability to form clots. 2. **Normal Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: A normal CBC suggests that the patient does not have an underlying condition that would cause a significant decrease in blood cell counts, such as leukemia or anemia. This helps to narrow down the differential diagnosis. 3. **Coagulation Profile**: - **Prothrombin Time (PT) of 12 seconds**: This is slightly elevated, which indicates a problem with the extrinsic pathway of coagulation, which involves factors II, V, VII, X, and fibrinogen. However, an isolated prolongation of PT can also be seen in liver disease or warfarin therapy. - **Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) of 60 seconds**: This is significantly prolonged, indicating a problem with the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, which involves factors II, IV, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII. A prolonged aPTT can be seen in disorders of the intrinsic pathway, such as deficiencies of factor VIII or IX. 4. **Differential Diagnosis**: - **A. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)**: Unlikely, as the CBC is normal, and ALL is more commonly associated with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis. - **B. Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)**: Unlikely, as ITP is characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia, which is not present here. - **C. Von Willebrand Disease**: Possible, as this is the most common hereditary coagulation disorder, and a mild elevation in aPTT can be seen in von Willebrand disease due to the deficiency of von Willebrand factor, which affects both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. - **D. Hemophilia A**: Possible, as Hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of factor VIII, which primarily affects the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and is characterized by a prolonged aPTT. Considering the above points, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is **C. Von Willebrand Disease**, given the mild prolongation of both PT and aPTT, which can be seen in von Willebrand disease due to the role of von Willebrand factor in stabilizing factor VIII and participating in platelet adhesion. This diagnosis is also supported by the absence of other symptoms and a normal CBC. ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's clinical presentation and coagulation profile suggest a coagulation disorder.
