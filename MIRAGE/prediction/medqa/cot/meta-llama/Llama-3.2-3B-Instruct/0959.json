    "question": "A 65-year-old male presents to his primary care physician for stiffness in his arm. He states that he has been having trouble combing his hair and reaching objects that are high on the shelf. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, and hypertension. His current medications include metformin, insulin, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. The patient admits to leading a sedentary life in which he tends to stay home and watch television. He does not engage in any physical or strenuous activity. On physical exam the patient has decreased passive and active range of motion of his shoulder. Strength of the patient's upper extremity is 4/5. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Rotator cuff impingement",
        "B": "Adhesive capsulitis",
        "C": "Glenohumeral osteoarthritis",
        "D": "Subacromial bursitis"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this case, let's consider the patient's symptoms and history. 1. The patient presents with stiffness in his arm, specifically trouble combing his hair and reaching high objects, which suggests a limitation in shoulder mobility. This is a key symptom that points towards a condition affecting the shoulder joint. 2. The patient's age (65 years) and sedentary lifestyle increase his risk for degenerative joint diseases, such as osteoarthritis. 3. The patient's past medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, and hypertension also contribute to the development of osteoarthritis, as these conditions can accelerate joint wear and tear. 4. The physical exam findings of decreased passive and active range of motion of the shoulder, as well as strength of 4/5, further support the presence of a degenerative joint disease. 5. Rotator cuff impingement (A) typically presents with pain and weakness in the shoulder, but the primary complaint is usually related to activity-specific pain, such as lifting or overhead activities. This does not seem to match the patient's complaints. 6. Adhesive capsulitis (B), also known as frozen shoulder, typically presents with a gradual onset of pain and stiffness in the shoulder, but it usually affects both shoulders symmetrically and is often accompanied by pain at night. 7. Subacromial bursitis (D) typically presents with pain and tenderness over the shoulder, usually related to overhead activities, and is not as commonly associated with significant range of motion limitations. 8. Glenohumeral osteoarthritis (C) is the most likely diagnosis, given the patient's age, sedentary lifestyle, and symptoms of stiffness, limited range of motion, and strength. Osteoarthritis is a common cause of shoulder pain and stiffness in older adults, especially those with a history of joint wear and tear.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
