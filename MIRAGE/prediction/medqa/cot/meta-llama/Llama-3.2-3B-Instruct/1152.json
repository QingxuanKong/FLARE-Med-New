    "question": "A 51-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of fatigue, weight loss, and intermittent fevers for the past 6 months. He has had sexual intercourse with multiple men and women over the past year and does not use barrier protection. His last screen for sexually transmitted diseases was 10 years ago and was normal. His past medical history is notable for well-controlled asthma. He was involved in a motorcycle accident 2 years ago and suffered multiple fractured bones in his upper and lower extremities, all of which have healed. He has a distant history of cocaine abuse. He drinks 5-6 glasses of wine per week. His temperature is 100.8\u00b0F (38.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/75 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, he appears cachectic but is pleasant and appropriately interactive. An HIV differentiation assay and follow-up Western blot are performed and are positive. The patient is started on tenofovir, abacavir, and efavirenz. However, the patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, so the decision is made to replace this medication with ritonavir. Which of the following adverse effects is this patient at greatest risk for as a result of this change in medication regimen?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Hepatotoxicity",
        "B": "Lipodystrophy",
        "C": "Myelosuppression",
        "D": "Peripheral neuropathy"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.\\n\\nThe patient has been started on a new antiretroviral regimen consisting of tenofovir, abacavir, and efavirenz. However, the patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, which requires a replacement medication.\\n\\nThe patient is switched to ritonavir, which is a protease inhibitor.\\n\\nNow, let's consider the potential adverse effects of ritonavir:\\n\\nRitonavir is known to cause several side effects, including hepatotoxicity, but it is not the most common side effect.\\n\\nRitonavir can also cause lipodystrophy, which is a condition characterized by the abnormal distribution of body fat, particularly in the face, arms, and legs. This side effect is more common with certain antiretroviral medications, including protease inhibitors like ritonavir.\\n\\nRitonavir can also cause myelosuppression, but this is more commonly associated with other protease inhibitors, such as indinavir.\\n\\nPeripheral neuropathy is not a commonly reported side effect of ritonavir.\\n\\nConsidering the options, the patient is at greatest risk for lipodystrophy as a result of this change in medication regimen.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
