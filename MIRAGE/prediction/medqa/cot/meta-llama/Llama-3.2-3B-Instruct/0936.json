    "question": "A 23-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain. The patient states she has pain in the right side of her abdomen which started yesterday and has been worsening. She has experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea during this time. The patient has a past medical history of constipation which is treated with fiber supplements. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/68 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, you note a young woman who appears to be in pain. Cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. Abdominal exam is notable for right lower quadrant pain that is reproducible when the left lower quadrant is palpated. The patient is given morphine. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Abdominal radiograph",
        "B": "\u00df-hCG",
        "C": "CT scan",
        "D": "Stool occult blood"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's presentation of right lower quadrant pain that is reproducible when the left lower quadrant is palpated, a high index of suspicion for appendicitis should be raised. The patient's symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea may be indicative of an inflammatory process. The patient's past medical history of constipation could be a contributing factor, but it is not the primary concern in this acute presentation. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but the tachycardia and mild fever are consistent with an inflammatory process. The morphine administered may help alleviate the patient's pain, but it does not address the underlying cause of the pain. Considering the potential diagnosis of appendicitis, the next best step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis with imaging. An abdominal radiograph (A) may not be the best initial choice as it may not provide sufficient detail to confirm appendicitis. A \u00df-hCG (B) test is not indicated in this scenario as there is no suspicion of pregnancy. A CT scan (C) would be the preferred imaging modality as it provides detailed images of the abdomen and can help confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis. Stool occult blood (D) test may be useful in evaluating for gastrointestinal bleeding, but it is not directly relevant to the diagnosis of appendicitis. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis and rule out other potential causes of abdominal pain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
