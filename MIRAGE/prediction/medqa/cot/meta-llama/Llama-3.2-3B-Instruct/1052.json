    "question": "A 7-day-old infant boy presents to an emergency department due to poor feeding. His parents are recent immigrants to the United States. He was born in a traditional home birth and has never seen a medical provider. Mom had no prenatal care, has no medical issues, and is unvaccinated. The baby had been breastfeeding well until 24 hours ago when mom noticed he started having trouble latching. In the last 12 hours, he has completely refused to feed. He has had a decreased number of wet diapers and has stooled twice in the last 24 hours. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C), pulse is 180/min, respirations are 52/min, and blood pressure is 70/50 mmHg. On exam, the infant has increased tone, a clenched jaw, no head lag, and clenched hands. Initial screening bloodwork is normal. What is the most likely organism causing this infant's presentation?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Clostridium botulinum",
        "B": "Clostridium tetani",
        "C": "Group B streptococcus",
        "D": "Listeria monocytogenes"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the clinical presentation of the infant and the potential causes of botulism, tetanus, group B streptococcus infection, and listeriosis in a newborn. The key features of this case include the infant's refusal to feed, decreased wet diapers, and clenched jaw, which are all indicative of a neuromuscular disorder. The presence of increased tone, clenched hands, and a clenched jaw are also suggestive of a neuromuscular block. The normal temperature and lack of other systemic symptoms such as fever or diarrhea help to narrow the differential diagnosis. The fact that the infant was born in a traditional home birth without prenatal care and has not received any vaccinations makes the risk of certain infections higher. The baby's refusal to feed and decreased wet diapers suggest a potential intestinal obstruction or infection, but the lack of other symptoms such as vomiting or abdominal pain makes this less likely. The initial screening bloodwork is normal, which reduces the likelihood of a systemic infection. The most concerning features of this case are the neuromuscular symptoms and the lack of a clear source of infection. Considering these factors, the most likely cause of this infant's presentation is botulism, which is a neurotoxin-mediated disorder that can cause neuromuscular symptoms without systemic symptoms or fever. Botulism is more likely in infants who are not vaccinated and are exposed to the bacteria in a non-traditional setting, such as a home birth without proper sanitation and hygiene. The baby's refusal to feed and neuromuscular symptoms are classic signs of botulism, making option A the most likely cause of this infant's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
