    "question": "A 27-year-old gentleman is brought into the ED after being stabbed in the back by a knife. In addition to the pain from the wound, he complains of weakness in his left leg. Upon physical examination you find that he has no other visible injuries; however, he has 2/5 strength in the left lower extremity. Complete neurologic exam also finds a deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity as well as a loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity. Which of the following lesions would result in the syndrome described?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Anterior cord lesion",
        "B": "Posterior cord lesion",
        "C": "Right cord hemisection",
        "D": "Left cord hemisection"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's break down the symptoms and relate them to the possible lesions: 1. **Weakness in the left leg**: This suggests an injury to the motor pathway that controls the left leg. The motor pathway for the left leg is located in the **corticospinal tract**, which is part of the central nervous system (CNS). 2. **Loss of vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity**: These sensory deficits suggest an injury to the sensory pathway that carries these sensations, which is the **dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway**. This pathway is also part of the CNS. 3. **Loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity**: This suggests an injury to the **spinothalamic tract**, which is also part of the CNS. The spinothalamic tract is responsible for transmitting pain and temperature sensations. Given these symptoms, we can relate them to the spinal cord anatomy: - The **anterior cord** contains the corticospinal tract (motor) and the spinothalamic tract (pain and temperature). A lesion in the anterior cord would affect the motor function of the left leg and the pain and temperature sensation of the right leg, but not the vibration sense of the left leg. - The **posterior cord** contains the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway (vibration sense and light touch). A lesion in the posterior cord would affect the vibration sense and light touch of the left leg, but not the motor function of the left leg or the pain and temperature sensation of the right leg. - A **cord hemisection** (either left or right) would result in the loss of motor function of the opposite leg (contralateral hemiparesis) and the loss of pain and temperature sensation of the opposite leg (ipsilateral hemianesthesia). Since the patient has weakness in the left leg and loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right leg, a cord hemisection on the left would be the correct answer. Therefore, the lesion that results in the syndrome described is a **left cord hemisection**. Here is the output in json format: ``` {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has weakness in the left leg, loss of vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity, and loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity.
