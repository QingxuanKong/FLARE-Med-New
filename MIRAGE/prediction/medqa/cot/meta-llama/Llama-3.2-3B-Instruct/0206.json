    "question": "Researchers are studying the inheritance pattern of mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene, the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis. It is believed that, in addition to the commonly found \u0394F508 mutation, a novel mutation in this gene is found in a particular population under study. Which of the following would most likely suggest that these two loci have a high probability of being closely linked?",
    "options": {
        "A": "LOD Score < 1",
        "B": "LOD Score < 2",
        "C": "LOD Score > 3",
        "D": "LOD Score = 0"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To determine if two loci are closely linked, we need to analyze the Lod (Log of Odds) score, which is a measure of the likelihood that two genes are inherited together. A higher Lod score indicates a higher probability of linkage. Here's the step-by-step thinking: 1. **Understanding Lod Score**: The Lod score is calculated using the following formula: Lod = log2(OR), where OR is the odds ratio. The odds ratio is the ratio of the probability of inheriting two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to the probability of inheriting two normal copies of the gene. 2. **Interpreting Lod Score Values**: - A Lod score of 0 indicates no linkage (the genes are not inherited together). - A Lod score of 1 or greater indicates a moderate to strong likelihood of linkage. - A Lod score of 2 or greater typically indicates a very strong likelihood of linkage. 3. **Analyzing the Options**: - Option A (LOD Score < 1): This indicates no linkage, which would not suggest that the two loci are closely linked. - Option B (LOD Score < 2): This also indicates no linkage, which is not consistent with the scenario where two loci are closely linked. - Option C (LOD Score > 3): This indicates a very strong likelihood of linkage, which is consistent with the scenario where two loci are closely linked. - Option D (LOD Score = 0): This indicates no linkage, which is the opposite of what we're looking for. 4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the Lod score > 3 (Option C) is the most likely to suggest that the two loci have a high probability of being closely linked.
