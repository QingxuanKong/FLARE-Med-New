    "question": "A 42-year-old man presents to establish care with a family physician after having progressively worsening back pain. He has recently migrated from Sweden and has not had any checkups in the last 3 years. He first started having back pain 3 years ago, but his pain has begun to be excruciating in the mornings. He is no longer able to get relief with over the counter medications. He also feels stiff every morning and this usually lasts between 30 minutes and an hour. Both of his knees are also very painful, particularly upon standing up from a seated position. His pain improves when he moves around, so he tries to be somewhat physically active. He also reports that he cannot use his hands for long periods of time due to joint pain and stiffness. His father and sister also have joint issues, and his mother was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis. He has been a smoker for 13 years. Upon physical examination, his wrist and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints are warm and swollen. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Testing for serum Ca and PTH",
        "B": "Calcium and Vitamin D prescription",
        "C": "Testing for serum ESR and autoantibodies",
        "D": "Testing for serum ferritin"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with worsening back pain, morning stiffness, and joint pain and stiffness, particularly in the knees, wrists, and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. He has a family history of joint issues and his mother has osteoporosis. The physical examination findings of warm and swollen joints are suggestive of an inflammatory process. Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the differential diagnosis should include rheumatologic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or osteoarthritis (OA), as well as other inflammatory arthropathies. The patient's smoking history also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the presence of morning stiffness lasting for 30 minutes to an hour and the involvement of multiple joints, including the PIP joints, are more suggestive of RA. The patient's lack of response to over-the-counter medications also raises the suspicion of an inflammatory process. Therefore, the next best step in management would be to test for serum ESR and autoantibodies, which are commonly elevated in RA and can help confirm the diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
