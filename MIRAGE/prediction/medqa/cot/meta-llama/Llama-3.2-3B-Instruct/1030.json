    "question": "A 3466-g (7-lb, 10-oz) female newborn is delivered at 38 weeks' gestation to a 32-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1. Apgar scores are 7 and 8, at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother has a history of schizophrenia and was treated with lithium until 5 weeks' gestation, when she found out that she was pregnant. The mother was treated for alcohol abuse disorder 2 years ago. She has been sober for 14 months now. Examination shows that the child has micrognathia, a broad nasal bridge, a short philtrum, and small, low-set ears. Examination of the mouth shows a cleft palate. A grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur can be heard over the left sternal border. Echocardiography shows a single overriding great vessel arising from the heart. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Low levels of parathyroid hormone in serum",
        "B": "Double bubble sign on abdominal x-ray",
        "C": "Chromosome 5p deletion on FISH studies",
        "D": "Bilateral cataracts on ocular examination"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the key findings and consider the potential underlying conditions. 1. **Micrognathia, broad nasal bridge, short philtrum, and small, low-set ears**: These physical characteristics are suggestive of a genetic syndrome. 2. **Cleft palate**: This is another feature commonly associated with genetic syndromes. 3. **Single overriding great vessel arising from the heart**: This is a significant cardiovascular finding that points towards a specific group of genetic syndromes. 4. **Family history of schizophrenia and treatment with lithium**: Lithium is known to have teratogenic effects, particularly when taken during the first trimester. However, the fact that the mother was treated for only 5 weeks suggests that the exposure to lithium is likely minimal. 5. **History of alcohol abuse disorder**: While this could potentially contribute to fetal development issues, the fact that the mother has been sober for 14 months makes this less likely to be the primary cause of the current findings. Considering these findings, the most likely diagnosis is **22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome)**. This condition is characterized by: - **Cardiovascular anomalies**, including a single overriding aortic arch (or great vessel), which matches the echocardiography findings. - **Facial dysmorphia**, including micrognathia, broad nasal bridge, short philtrum, and small, low-set ears. - **Cleft palate**, which is a common feature of DiGeorge syndrome. - **Immunodeficiency**, which could be related to the parathyroid gland hypoplasia, but this is not directly related to the options provided. Now, considering the options: A. **Low levels of parathyroid hormone in serum**: This is a common finding in DiGeorge syndrome due to parathyroid gland hypoplasia. The parathyroid glands are located near the thymus, which is also affected in DiGeorge syndrome. The thymic hypoplasia leads to T-cell immunodeficiency, and parathyroid gland hypoplasia can result in hypoparathyroidism, characterized by low parathyroid hormone levels. B. **Double bubble sign on abdominal x-ray**: This is more commonly associated with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) or other chromosomal abnormalities, not typically with DiGeorge syndrome. C. **Chromosome 5p deletion on FISH studies**: This is associated with Cri-du-chat syndrome, a different genetic disorder. D. **Bilateral cataracts on ocular examination**: This is not a typical feature of DiGeorge syndrome. Therefore, the most likely finding in this case is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of DiGeorge syndrome, which is characterized by a single overriding great vessel, facial dysmorphia, cleft palate, and hypoparathyroidism. The parathyroid gland hypoplasia is a common feature of DiGeorge syndrome, leading to low levels of parathyroid hormone in serum.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
