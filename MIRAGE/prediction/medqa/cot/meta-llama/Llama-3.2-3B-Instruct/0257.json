    "question": "A routine newborn screening test for phenylketonuria in a male neonate shows a serum phenylalanine concentration of 44 mg/dL (N < 20). He is started on a special diet and the hyperphenylalaninemia resolves. At a routine well-child examination 4 months later, the physician notices that he has persistent head lag. On examination, he has blue eyes, pale skin, blonde hair, and generalized hypotonia. His serum prolactin level is markedly elevated. Supplementation of which of the following substances is most likely to prevent further complications of this patient's condition?",

        "A": "Tyrosine",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and lab results. The patient has a history of phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder characterized by elevated serum phenylalanine levels due to impaired phenylalanine hydroxylase activity. The patient has been started on a special diet to manage the condition, which has resolved the hyperphenylalaninemia. However, the patient now presents with new symptoms such as head lag, blue eyes, pale skin, and generalized hypotonia. Elevated serum prolactin levels are also noted. These symptoms are suggestive of a condition known as phenylketonuria with elevated tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) levels, also known as hyper BH4 syndrome or phenylketonuria with BH4 deficiency. This condition is caused by mutations in the GTP cyclohydrolase I gene, which is involved in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor required for phenylalanine hydroxylase activity. The symptoms of hyper BH4 syndrome are thought to be due to the excess BH4 levels, which inhibit phenylalanine hydroxylase activity, leading to elevated phenylalanine levels and the associated symptoms. Given this understanding, the supplementation of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is the most likely to prevent further complications of this patient's condition. This is because BH4 supplementation can help restore normal phenylalanine hydroxylase activity and reduce phenylalanine levels, thereby alleviating the symptoms of hyper BH4 syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
