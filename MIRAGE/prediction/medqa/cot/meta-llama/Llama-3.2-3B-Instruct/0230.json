    "question": "An 11-year-old child complains of pain in the leg while playing. Blood pressure in the upper limb is 140/90 mm Hg and lower limbs are 110/70 mm Hg. There is a brachiofemoral delay in the pulse. Auscultation shows a loud S1, loud S2, and S4. There is a presence of an ejection systolic murmur in the interscapular area. Chest X-ray reveals the notching of the ribs. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Pulmonic stenosis",
        "B": "Coarctation of the aorta",
        "C": "Aortic stenosis",
        "D": "Transposition of great vessels"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the given clinical findings and see how they correlate with the potential diagnoses. 1. The patient is an 11-year-old child presenting with pain in the leg, which suggests a possible issue with blood flow to the lower limbs. 2. The blood pressure in the upper limb is higher than in the lower limbs (140/90 mm Hg vs 110/70 mm Hg), indicating a possible narrowing or obstruction of the aorta in the region where the blood pressure is being measured. 3. The presence of a brachiofemoral delay in the pulse further supports the idea of an obstruction in the aorta, as it indicates delayed blood flow from the upper limb to the lower limb. 4. The heart sounds are described as loud S1, loud S2, and S4, which is indicative of aortic stenosis. However, in this case, the presence of an ejection systolic murmur in the interscapular area is more suggestive of aortic stenosis or coarctation of the aorta. 5. The chest X-ray showing notching of the ribs is a classic radiographic finding in coarctation of the aorta, which is caused by the erosion of the superior and inferior borders of the ribs due to the abnormal flow of blood through collateral vessels. Considering all the above points, the most likely diagnosis is coarctation of the aorta. It is a congenital condition characterized by narrowing of the aorta at the junction of the aortic arch and the descending aorta, leading to the clinical findings presented in the scenario.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
