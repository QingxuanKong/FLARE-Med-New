    "question": "A mother brings her 18-year-old daughter to your office because she has not menstruated yet. They recently immigrated from another country, and do not have any previous medical records. The adolescent girl looks relatively short, but otherwise looks healthy. She has no complaints except for mild intermittent lower abdominal pain for the past year. On physical examination, vitals are within normal limits. There is the presence of axillary hair, breast development, and pubic hair at Tanner stage 5. You explain to the mother and the patient that you need to perform a complete vaginal examination, however, both of them declined the procedure and would prefer that lab test be performed. Her labs are significant for the following:\nFSH 7 mIU/mL\nNormal values:  \n   Follicular phase 3.1 \u2013 7.9 mIU/mL\n   Ovulation peak 2.3 \u2013 18.5 mIU/mL\n   Luteal phase 1.4 \u2013 5.5 mIU/mL\n   Postmenopausal 30.6 \u2013 106.3 mIU/mL\nEstradiol 28 pg/mL\nNormal values:  \n   Mid-follicular phase 27 \u2013 123 pg/mL\n   Periovulatory 96 \u2013 436 pg/mL\n   Mid-luteal phase 49 \u2013 294 pg/mL\n   Postmenopausal 0 \u2013 40 pg/mL\nTestosterone 52 ng/dL, 40 \u2013 60 ng/dL\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and lab results step by step: 1. The patient is an 18-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea, which means she has never menstruated. This is a significant symptom that warrants further investigation. 2. She has Tanner stage 5 breast and pubic hair development, indicating that she has entered puberty. However, the presence of these secondary sexual characteristics without primary amenorrhea suggests that there may be an underlying hormonal imbalance. 3. The patient's FSH levels are within the normal range for the follicular phase, but low for the luteal phase. This suggests that the ovaries may not be functioning properly. 4. The estradiol levels are also low for the mid-follicular and periovulatory phases, but normal for the mid-luteal phase. This further supports the idea that the ovaries are not functioning properly. 5. The testosterone level is elevated, which is unusual in a female. This could indicate an androgen-producing tumor or other underlying condition. Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is a disorder of sex development (DSD). Among the options provided, Muellerian agenesis (also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser syndrome) is a condition where the M\u00fcllerian ducts fail to develop, resulting in the absence of the uterus and upper part of the vagina. However, this condition is typically associated with normal or low estrogen levels, not elevated estrogen levels. Hyperprolactinemia is a condition characterized by elevated prolactin levels, which can suppress gonadotropin secretion and lead to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. However, this condition does not typically cause elevated testosterone levels. Turner syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that affects females, characterized by the partial or complete absence of one X chromosome. It can cause short stature, primary amenorrhea, and ovarian dysgenesis, but the patient's Tanner stage 5 breast and pubic hair development suggests that she has some ovarian function. Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a condition where an individual has XY chromosomes but is resistant to androgen hormones, resulting in female external appearance and reproductive system development. However, AIS typically presents with undervirilization, not virilization, and the patient's elevated testosterone level suggests virilization. Given the patient's elevated testosterone level and Tanner stage 5 breast and pubic hair development, the most likely diagnosis is DSD with virilization, but the specific subtype is not among the options. However, considering the options provided, the closest match is androgen insensitivity, but it is not the most likely diagnosis. Given the options provided, the closest match is androgen insensitivity, but it is not the most likely diagnosis. However, considering the options provided, the closest match is androgen insensitivity, but it is not the most likely diagnosis. Since this is not a perfect match, I would like to clarify that the most likely diagnosis is not explicitly listed among the options. However, I will choose the closest match based on the provided options. The closest match is D. Androgen insensitivity, but as mentioned earlier, it is not the most likely diagnosis. Given the options, I will select D as the answer, but please note that it is not the most accurate diagnosis. The actual diagnosis would require further evaluation and testing to determine the specific underlying condition.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",
