    "question": "A 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increasing shortness of breath and a non-productive cough for 2 months. She has been unable to perform her daily activities. She has had malaise and bilateral ankle pain during this period. She noticed her symptoms after returning from a vacation to Arizona. She is a research assistant at the university geology laboratory. She is originally from Nigeria and visits her family there twice a year; her last trip was 3 months ago. Her temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 112/72 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is no palpable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Her left eye is notable for ciliary injection and photophobia. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count is within the reference range. An x-ray of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Sarcoidosis",
        "B": "Pulmonary tuberculosis",
        "C": "Hodgkin's lymphoma",
        "D": "Histoplasmosis"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 2-month history of increasing shortness of breath, non-productive cough, malaise, and bilateral ankle pain. The symptoms worsened after returning from a vacation to Arizona, which is a region where histoplasmosis is endemic. The patient's exposure history to geology and her visits to Nigeria, where histoplasmosis is also endemic, further supports this diagnosis. The presence of ciliary injection and photophobia in the left eye is a classic sign of histoplasmosis. Additionally, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as bilateral ankle pain, are consistent with histoplasmosis. The chest x-ray may show bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, which is a common finding in histoplasmosis. Although sarcoidosis and Hodgkin's lymphoma can also present with similar symptoms, the patient's exposure history and physical examination findings make histoplasmosis the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
