    "question": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician for evaluation because his parents have been concerned by a number of troubling signs. Specifically, they have noticed that he has been exhibiting aggressive behavior as well as hyperactivity. In addition, he has had intellectual disability and is slow to hit developmental milestones. Physical exam reveals coarse facies, short stature, and joint stiffness. Eye exam reveals no abnormalities of the cornea or lens. Based on these findings, the patient is referred to a geneticist for further evaluation. Which of the following substances would most likely accumulate in the cells of this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Cerebroside sulfate",
        "B": "Galactocerebroside",
        "C": "Heparan sulfate",
        "D": "Sphingomyelin"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this question, we'll break it down step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 3-year-old boy presenting with aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, intellectual disability, and developmental delays. He also has coarse facies, short stature, and joint stiffness. 2. **Physical Exam Findings**: The physical exam reveals no abnormalities of the cornea or lens. 3. **Differential Diagnoses**: Based on the clinical presentation, one of the potential diagnoses that come to mind is Niemann-Pick disease, a group of genetic disorders caused by a deficiency of the enzyme sphingomyelinase. This enzyme is involved in breaking down sphingomyelin, a type of lipid found in cell membranes. 4. **Lipid Metabolism**: In Niemann-Pick disease, the accumulation of sphingomyelin in cells is due to the deficiency of sphingomyelinase. This leads to an accumulation of sphingomyelin in various tissues, including the brain, liver, spleen, and bone marrow. 5. **Answer Choice Analysis**: - A. Cerebroside sulfate: Accumulation is associated with Krabbe disease, not matching the clinical presentation. - B. Galactocerebroside: Accumulation is associated with Krabbe disease, not matching the clinical presentation. - C. Heparan sulfate: Accumulation is associated with mucopolysaccharidosis, not matching the clinical presentation. - D. Sphingomyelin: Accumulation is consistent with Niemann-Pick disease, which matches the clinical presentation. **Answer**: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is likely to have Niemann-Pick disease due to the accumulation of sphingomyelin in the cells, which matches the clinical presentation of aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, intellectual disability, and coarse facies. The absence of corneal or lens abnormalities further supports this diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
