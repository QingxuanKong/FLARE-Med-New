    "question": "A 53-year-old man presents to clinic with a six month history of shoulder pain that is especially bothersome at night. Over the weekend he \"strained his shoulder\" during a pick-up basketball game and reports an acute exacerbation of his pain symptoms. On exam, he complains of pain to palpation just below the acromion. You suspect he has torn his supraspinatus. If correct, which of these functional maneuvers would you expect to be deficient on physical exam?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Initiation of adduction",
        "B": "External rotation",
        "C": "Initiation of abduction",
        "D": "Internal rotation"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step: 1. **Patient's complaint**: The patient has a six-month history of shoulder pain, particularly at night, and an acute exacerbation of pain after a basketball game. This suggests a chronic condition with acute flare-ups, which is consistent with rotator cuff injuries. 2. **Location of pain**: The pain is located just below the acromion, which is a key anatomical landmark on the shoulder. This is a crucial clue, as the supraspinatus tendon runs beneath the acromion. 3. **Suspected diagnosis**: The patient is suspected to have a torn supraspinatus tendon. The supraspinatus tendon is one of the four muscles in the rotator cuff, which is a group of muscles and tendons that stabilize the shoulder joint. 4. **Function of the supraspinatus tendon**: The supraspinatus tendon plays a key role in the initiation of abduction of the arm, which is the movement of the arm away from the body. It is responsible for stabilizing the shoulder joint and helping to initiate abduction. 5. **Expected physical exam findings**: Given the suspected diagnosis of a torn supraspinatus tendon, we would expect to see a deficiency in the ability to initiate abduction of the arm. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Initiation of adduction: This is the movement of the arm towards the body, which is not the primary function of the supraspinatus tendon. B. External rotation: This movement is primarily controlled by the infraspinatus and teres minor muscles, not the supraspinatus tendon. C. Initiation of abduction: As discussed, the supraspinatus tendon plays a key role in the initiation of abduction, making this the most likely choice. D. Internal rotation: This movement is primarily controlled by the latissimus dorsi and teres major muscles, not the supraspinatus tendon. **Conclusion**: Based on the suspected diagnosis of a torn supraspinatus tendon and its role in the initiation of abduction, the expected functional maneuver to be deficient on physical exam is initiation of abduction. **Answer**: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The supraspinatus tendon plays a key role in the initiation of abduction, making this the most likely choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
