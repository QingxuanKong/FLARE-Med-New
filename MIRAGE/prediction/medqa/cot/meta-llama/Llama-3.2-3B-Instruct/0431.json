    "question": "A 24-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of an inability to urinate. She states that this has been one of many symptoms she has experienced lately. At times she has had trouble speaking and has noticed changes in her vision however these episodes occurred over a month ago and have resolved since then. Two days ago she experienced extreme pain in her face that was exacerbated with brushing her teeth and plucking out facial hairs. The patient has no relevant past medical history, however, the patient admits to being sexually abused by her boyfriend for the past year. Her current medications include ibuprofen for menstrual cramps. On physical exam it is noted that leftward gaze results in only the ipsilateral eye gazing leftward. The patient's initial workup is started in the emergency department. Her vital signs are within normal limits and you note a pale and frightened young lady awaiting further care. Which of the following is the best initial test for this patient's chief complaint?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Head CT",
        "B": "Head MRI",
        "C": "Lumbar puncture",
        "D": "Domestic abuse screening and exploring patient's life stressors"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a chief complaint of an inability to urinate, which is a symptom that requires immediate attention. The patient also reports a history of sexual abuse, which raises concerns for potential complications such as pelvic trauma, urinary tract injuries, or even pregnancy. The physical exam finding of leftward gaze resulting in only the ipsilateral eye gazing leftward suggests a possible third cranial nerve palsy, which could be related to the patient's symptoms. Given the patient's history of abuse and the physical exam findings, it is essential to prioritize her safety and address potential life-threatening conditions. The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings do not immediately suggest a neurological emergency that would require a head CT or MRI. A lumbar puncture is not indicated in this scenario as there is no indication of meningismus or other conditions that would require spinal fluid analysis. The most appropriate initial step is to prioritize the patient's safety and well-being by conducting a thorough assessment of her life stressors and potential risks, including domestic abuse. This should be done in a safe and supportive environment, possibly with a social worker or advocate present. This initial step can help identify potential risks and allow for further evaluation and treatment of the patient's physical symptoms once her safety is ensured.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
