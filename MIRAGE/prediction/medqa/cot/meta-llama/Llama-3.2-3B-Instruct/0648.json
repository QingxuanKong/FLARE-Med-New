    "question": "A 1-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his parents for a regular check-up. His weight, height, and head size were found to be in the lower percentile ranges on standard growth curves. His hair is tangled and has a dry, brittle texture. Genetic testing reveals that the patient has a connective tissue disorder caused by impaired copper absorption and transport. The patient\u2019s disorder is caused by a mutation in which of the following genes?",
    "options": {
        "A": "ATP7A",
        "B": "COL5A1",
        "C": "FBN1",
        "D": "ATP7B"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Identify the key clinical features**: The patient is a 1-year-old boy with growth delays (lower percentile ranges for weight, height, and head size), and his hair is tangled and has a dry, brittle texture. 2. **Understand the underlying condition**: The patient has a connective tissue disorder caused by impaired copper absorption and transport. 3. **Relate the condition to the options**: The key to solving this question is recognizing that the patient's disorder is related to impaired copper absorption and transport. Copper is an essential trace element involved in various bodily functions, including the production of connective tissue. 4. **Analyze the options**: - A. **ATP7A**: This gene encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase that plays a crucial role in the transport of copper across cell membranes. Mutations in ATP7A are associated with Menkes disease, a disorder characterized by impaired copper absorption and transport, leading to growth delays, sparse and coarse hair, and other connective tissue abnormalities. - B. **COL5A1**: This gene encodes a type V collagen alpha 1 chain, which is involved in the production of collagen, a major component of connective tissue. Mutations in COL5A1 are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a group of disorders affecting the body's connective tissue, but Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is not specifically linked to impaired copper absorption and transport. - C. **FBN1**: This gene encodes fibrillin-1, a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of elastic fibers found in connective tissue. Mutations in FBN1 are associated with Marfan syndrome, a disorder affecting the body's connective tissue, but it is not directly related to impaired copper absorption and transport. - D. **ATP7B**: This gene encodes a copper-transporting P-type ATPase that plays a crucial role in the transport of copper across cell membranes. Mutations in ATP7B are associated with Wilson disease, a disorder characterized by excessive accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, and other organs, but it is not specifically linked to impaired copper absorption and transport in the context of connective tissue disorders. 5. **Conclusion**: Based on the clinical features and the relationship between copper absorption and transport, the patient's disorder is most likely caused by a mutation in the **ATP7A** gene, which is associated with Menkes disease. **Output in JSON format**: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's disorder is related to impaired copper absorption and transport, and Menkes disease is a disorder characterized by impaired copper absorption and transport, leading to growth delays, sparse and coarse hair, and other connective tissue abnormalities.
