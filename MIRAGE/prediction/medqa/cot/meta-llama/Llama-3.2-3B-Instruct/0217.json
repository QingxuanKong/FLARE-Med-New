    "question": "A 37-year-old primigravid woman at 12 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and dull suprapubic pain for 3 hours. She has had spotting during the last 3 days. Her medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 89/65 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a dilated cervical os and a uterus consistent in size with an 11-week gestation. Ultrasonography shows an embryo of 4 cm in crown-rump length and no fetal cardiac activity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Misoprostol therapy",
        "B": "Methotrexate therapy",
        "C": "Dilation and curettage",
        "D": "Complete bed rest"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings, the most likely diagnosis is a missed abortion or a nonviable pregnancy. The patient is at 12 weeks' gestation with a dilated cervical os and a uterus consistent in size with an 11-week gestation, which suggests that the pregnancy has not progressed as expected. The lack of fetal cardiac activity on ultrasound further supports this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms of vaginal bleeding and dull suprapubic pain are also consistent with a miscarriage. The patient's medical history of smoking may increase the risk of miscarriage, but this is not the primary concern in this scenario. The patient's medications, including folic acid and multivitamin, are not relevant to the management of a missed abortion. The patient's vital signs, including a pulse of 110/min and blood pressure of 89/65 mm Hg, are within normal limits. The options for management of a missed abortion include misoprostol therapy, methotrestol acetate therapy, or dilation and curettage (D\\&C). Misoprostol therapy is typically used for medical management of first-trimester miscarriage, but it is not the best option in this scenario due to the patient's nonviable pregnancy. Methotrexate therapy is also not recommended for missed abortion, as it is typically used for ectopic pregnancy. Dilation and curettage is the most appropriate next step in management, as it will allow for the removal of the nonviable pregnancy tissue and reduce the risk of infection. Complete bed rest is not an appropriate management strategy for missed abortion, as it is unlikely to resolve the issue and may increase the risk of complications. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is dilation and curettage.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
