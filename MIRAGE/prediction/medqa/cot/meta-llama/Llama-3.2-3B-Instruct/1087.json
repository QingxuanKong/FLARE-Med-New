    "question": "A 39-year-old man seeks an evaluation in the emergency room due to an episode of syncope at work. He says that he has felt increasing shortness of breath while exercising over the past 6 months. He is a well-built man in mild distress. The vital signs include heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 18/min, temperature 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F), and blood pressure 135/90 mm Hg. The cardiac examination is significant for a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border which is accentuated by forceful expiration against a closed airway. Palpation of the carotid artery shows 2 closely spaced pulses which occur during systole. Which of the following is most consistent with these findings?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Aortic stenosis",
        "B": "Cardiac tamponade",
        "C": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy",
        "D": "Third-degree heart block"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient presents with syncope, increasing shortness of breath during exercise, and a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border. The murmur is accentuated by forceful expiration against a closed airway, which suggests that it may be dynamic. The patient is also tachycardic with a heart rate of 98/min and has 2 closely spaced pulses in the carotid artery during systole, which indicates a narrow pulse pressure. Considering the age of the patient and the physical examination findings, we can narrow down the differential diagnosis. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common cause of dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in young to middle-aged adults, which can lead to syncope and shortness of breath during exercise. The harsh systolic ejection murmur is consistent with HCM, and the narrow pulse pressure is also consistent with HCM due to the increased peripheral resistance and decreased cardiac output. Aortic stenosis is less likely in this patient, as it typically presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms and a different type of murmur (pulsus parvus et tardus). Cardiac tamponade is unlikely, as it typically presents with hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and a distended neck vein, which are not present in this case. Third-degree heart block is also unlikely, as it would not explain the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
