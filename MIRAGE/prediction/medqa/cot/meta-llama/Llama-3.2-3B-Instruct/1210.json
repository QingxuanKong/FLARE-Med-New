    "question": "A 23-year-old man comes to the clinic for yellowing of his eyes. The patient has been relatively healthy and just recently started \u201cintermittent fasting\u201d to try to lose weight. He recalls a similar episode 4 years ago when he was recovering from an emergency appendectomy. The patient denies smoking but endorses an episode of binge drinking 2 days ago. He is sexually active with both men and women. His physical examination is unremarkable besides scleral icterus. What is the most likely explanation for this patient\u2019s symptoms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Autoimmune-mediated fibrosis of biliary tract",
        "B": "Chronic viral infection of the liver",
        "C": "Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase",
        "D": "Defective bilirubin excretion"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and physical examination: 1. **Age and sex**: The patient is a 23-year-old man. This demographic information is relevant because certain liver conditions are more prevalent in younger individuals. 2. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with yellowing of the eyes (jaundice), which is a sign of elevated bilirubin levels in the blood. 3. **Recent changes in lifestyle**: The patient has recently started intermittent fasting to lose weight. Intermittent fasting can affect liver function, particularly the metabolism of bilirubin. 4. **Past medical history**: The patient had a similar episode of jaundice 4 years ago, which was during recovery from an emergency appendectomy. This could suggest a transient condition or an underlying predisposition to liver dysfunction. 5. **Alcohol use**: The patient reported an episode of binge drinking 2 days ago. While alcohol can cause liver damage, the patient denies regular alcohol consumption. 6. **Sexual activity**: The patient is sexually active with both men and women, which is relevant for considering infectious causes of liver disease. Given these points, let's evaluate the options: - **A. Autoimmune-mediated fibrosis of the biliary tract**: This is a rare condition that can cause jaundice, but it is less likely in a young, otherwise healthy individual without a clear family history or other symptoms. - **B. Chronic viral infection of the liver**: While possible, there's no clear indication of chronic viral hepatitis (e.g., HIV, hepatitis B, or C) based on the information provided. - **C. Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase**: This enzyme is involved in bilirubin conjugation. Intermittent fasting can lead to a decrease in this enzyme's activity, causing a buildup of unconjugated bilirubin, which can cause jaundice. This option seems plausible. - **D. Defective bilirubin excretion**: This option is less likely since the patient's bilirubin levels are elevated (indicated by jaundice), suggesting an issue with bilirubin production or uptake rather than excretion. Considering these points, the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms is a decrease in the activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, which is a common consequence of intermittent fasting. ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's recent initiation of intermittent fasting, a common practice for weight loss, is the most likely cause of his jaundice. Intermittent fasting can lead to a decrease in UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity, resulting in elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels and jaundice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" } ```",
