    "question": "A 30-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a recent episode of chest pain. She says she was previously well and denies any history of similar symptoms. She reports that, at onset, she felt as if she was going to die and says her heart beating has been beating really fast. There was also profuse sweating, and she says she feels short of breath. She could not recall how long the event lasted but can remember that the symptoms did go away on their own by the time she arrived at the emergency department. Her vitals rapidly returned to normal while giving her medical history and she begins to look and act more calm. No significant past medical history or current medications.  Physical examination is unremarkable. Her electrocardiogram and initial cardiac enzymes are normal. Which the following is necessary to confirm the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "1 month of associated symptoms ",
        "B": "Disruptive events lasting > 30 minutes on 2 separate occasions",
        "C": "Family history",
        "D": "Agoraphobia"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's presentation and the provided options to determine the most likely diagnosis. The patient presents with a recent episode of chest pain, palpitations, sweating, shortness of breath, and a feeling of impending doom, which resolved on its own. The absence of significant past medical history, normal vitals, and initial cardiac enzymes suggest that the cause of her symptoms may not be related to a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack. The fact that her symptoms resolved on their own also points away from a serious cardiac issue. The patient's symptoms of palpitations, sweating, and shortness of breath are also common in panic attacks, which are episodes of intense fear or discomfort that peak within minutes and include symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, and shortness of breath. The key to this question is to determine if the patient's symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for a panic attack. The diagnostic criteria for a panic attack include a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort that peaks within minutes, at least four of the following symptoms: palpitations, sweating, shortness of breath, chest pain or discomfort, abdominal distress, chills, trembling or shaking, feeling of impending doom, derealization or depersonalization, and fear of losing control or going crazy. Given the patient's symptoms, option B is the most likely correct answer as it describes a 'disruptive events lasting > 30 minutes on 2 separate occasions', which is one of the diagnostic criteria for panic disorder. Options A, C, and D are not directly relevant to the patient's symptoms and diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
