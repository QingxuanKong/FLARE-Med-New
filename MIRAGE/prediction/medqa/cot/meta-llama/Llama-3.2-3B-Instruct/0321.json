    "question": "A 55-year-old man recovering from knee replacement surgery complains of breathlessness in the postoperative ward. He has been confined to bed for the past 5 days and is under observation. He felt a sudden difficulty in breathing and called for the ward nurse. He says that he is unable to take deep breaths and has a sharp pain on the right side of his chest with each inspiration. His temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), the pulse is 111/min, the respirations are 31/min, and the blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. He experiences pain in his right calf on dorsiflexion. There are no other prominent findings on physical examination. His chest X-ray does not show anything significant. The ECG reveals sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the best course of management at this time?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Subcutaneous fondaparinux",
        "B": "Inferior vena cava filter",
        "C": "Ventilation-perfusion scan",
        "D": "Lower extremity doppler"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with symptoms of acute respiratory distress, as evidenced by breathlessness and sharp pain on the right side of the chest with each inspiration. The patient's oxygen saturation and respiratory rate are elevated, indicating respiratory distress. The patient's blood pressure is low, which is a concerning sign. The patient's calf pain on dorsiflexion is also a significant finding, which may suggest deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Given the patient's recent knee replacement surgery, the risk of DVT is increased. The ECG showing sinus tachycardia further supports the possibility of a cardiovascular issue. Considering the patient's symptoms and risk factors, the most likely diagnosis is a pulmonary embolism (PE), which is a known complication of DVT. The chest X-ray is normal, which does not rule out PE. A ventilation-perfusion scan is the best initial test to diagnose PE, as it can show areas of the lung that are ventilated but not perfused, indicating a PE. Therefore, the best course of management at this time is to order a ventilation-perfusion scan to confirm the diagnosis of PE and guide further treatment. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
