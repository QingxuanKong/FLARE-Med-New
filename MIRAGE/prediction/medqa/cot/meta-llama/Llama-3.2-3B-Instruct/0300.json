    "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of an irregular gait 3 days after receiving age-appropriate vaccinations. Examination of the lower extremities shows no redness or swelling. When the child stands on his right leg, his left leg drops and his pelvis tilts towards the left. Sensation to light touch is normal in both legs. This patient's symptoms are most likely due to the injection of the vaccine into which of the following locations?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Inferolateral quadrant of the right buttock",
        "B": "Inferomedial quadrant of the right buttock",
        "C": "Inferomedial quadrant of the left buttock",
        "D": "Superomedial quadrant of the right buttock"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to consider the possible side effects of vaccine injections and the anatomy of the lower extremities. The child is experiencing an irregular gait and the left leg drops when the right leg is lifted, indicating a weakness or paralysis in the muscles of the right leg. This suggests that the vaccine was administered in a location that caused irritation or damage to the sciatic nerve, which runs from the lower back down to the legs. The sciatic nerve is located in the lower back and runs down the back of the leg, and it is most closely associated with the inferior (inferior) aspect of the buttock. The sensation to light touch is normal in both legs, which suggests that the nerve damage is not widespread, but rather localized to the motor nerves that control the muscles of the right leg. Given these clues, we can eliminate options C and D, which are the inferomedial quadrants of the left and right buttock respectively. The inferior aspect of the buttock is the most likely location for a vaccine to cause irritation or damage to the sciatic nerve, resulting in the symptoms described. Therefore, the correct answer is the inferior aspect of the buttock, which is option A. However, since the question asks for the location of the vaccine, we need to consider the typical injection site for the vaccine that would cause this reaction. The vaccine that is most commonly associated with this type of reaction is the MMR vaccine, which is typically administered in the left buttock. Therefore, the correct answer is the inferolateral quadrant of the left buttock, which is option B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
