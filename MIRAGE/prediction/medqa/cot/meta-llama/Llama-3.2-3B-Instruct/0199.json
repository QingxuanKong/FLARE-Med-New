    "question": "A 2-year-old girl with recurrent urinary tract infections is brought to the physician for a follow-up examination. Renal ultrasound shows bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis. A voiding cystourethrography shows retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition. Histologic examination of a kidney biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Glomerular crescents with macrophages",
        "B": "Matrix expansion with mesangial proliferation",
        "C": "Cortical thinning with tubular atrophy",
        "D": "Thickened glomerular capillary loops"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the key points and analyze the symptoms and diagnostic findings: 1. **Patient Profile**: A 2-year-old girl with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) suggests a possible underlying urinary tract anomaly or condition. 2. **Renal Ultrasound Findings**: Bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis indicates an obstruction or obstruction-like condition affecting the flow of urine from the kidneys to the bladder. 3. **Voiding Cystourethrography Findings**: Retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition suggests a vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), where urine flows from the bladder back up into the ureters, potentially causing infections and damage to the kidneys. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR). VUR can lead to chronic kidney damage, including scarring and fibrosis, which can be reflected in the histologic examination of a kidney biopsy. Now, let's analyze the options: A. **Glomerular crescents with macrophages**: This finding is more characteristic of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, which is not directly related to VUR. B. **Matrix expansion with mesangial proliferation**: This is a hallmark of mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, which can be seen in various conditions, including infections, but it's not the most specific finding for VUR. C. **Cortical thinning with tubular atrophy**: This is a common finding in chronic kidney disease, including scarring from recurrent infections and VUR, which fits with the clinical presentation. D. **Thickened glomerular capillary loops**: This finding is more typical of membranous nephropathy, an immune-mediated glomerulonephritis, which is not directly related to VUR. Based on the analysis, the most likely histologic finding in a kidney biopsy of a patient with VUR is cortical thinning with tubular atrophy, reflecting chronic damage from recurrent infections and scarring.
