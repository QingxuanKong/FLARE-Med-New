    "question": "A 55-year-old male with a history of stage I colon cancer status-post left hemicolectomy presents to your office for follow-up. You intend to discuss the results from his recent surveillance colonoscopy, which showed no remaining cancer, no polyps, and a well-healed anastmosis. During your meeting, you note that the patient is exhibiting the defense mechanism of suppression. Which of the following statements from the patient is consistent with your impression?",
    "options": {
        "A": "\"Last week I volunteered for the local Cancer Society. Helping other cancer patients just makes me feel better.\"",
        "B": "\"Oh, doctor, I'm just so grateful to be seeing you. I just know you've cured my cancer. I probably don't even need to check anymore.\"",
        "C": "\"I'm sorry I was late today. I also didn't get any of the labs you asked for.\"",
        "D": "\"I really haven't thought about the colonoscopy until today. Worrying before getting the results wasn't going to help anything.\""
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To determine which statement is consistent with the defense mechanism of suppression, let's break down the concept of suppression and analyze each option: Defense mechanism of suppression: This defense mechanism involves pushing uncomfortable thoughts, feelings, or memories into the unconscious mind, thereby avoiding dealing with the anxiety or stress associated with the original issue. It's a way of coping with stress or anxiety by diverting attention away from the source of the discomfort. Now, let's analyze each option: A. \"Last week I volunteered for the local Cancer Society. Helping other cancer patients just makes me feel better.\" - This statement seems to be an attempt to redirect attention away from the patient's own anxiety or fear about his cancer by focusing on helping others. This could be a defense mechanism of sublimation, not suppression. B. \"Oh, doctor, I'm just so grateful to be seeing you. I just know you've cured my cancer. I probably don't even need to check anymore.\" - This statement is an example of denial, not suppression. The patient is trying to convince himself that the cancer is gone, rather than dealing with the reality of his situation. C. \"I'm sorry I was late today. I also didn't get any of the labs you asked for.\" - This statement appears to be an attempt to divert attention from the anxiety about the colonoscopy results by focusing on a minor issue (being late) and a task (getting labs). This could be a defense mechanism of distraction. D. \"I really haven't thought about the colonoscopy until today. Worrying before getting the results wasn't going to help anything.\" - This statement suggests that the patient is aware of his anxiety and is attempting to suppress it by telling himself that worrying won't change the outcome. This is a classic example of the defense mechanism of suppression. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Defense mechanism of suppression involves pushing uncomfortable thoughts or feelings into the unconscious mind to avoid dealing with anxiety or stress. In this case, the patient is aware of his anxiety and is trying to suppress it by telling himself that worrying won't change the outcome. Option D is the only statement that accurately describes this defense mechanism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
