    "question": "A six-year-old boy with a history of asthma currently uses an albuterol inhaler as needed to manage his asthma symptoms. His mother brings him into your office because she feels she has had to increase the patient\u2019s use of his inhaler to four times per week for the past month. She also reports that he has woken up three times during the night from his symptoms this month. The boy reports that he is upset because he can\u2019t always keep up with his friends in the playground. His past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis. The patient\u2019s temperature is 98\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% O2 on room air. Auscultation of his lungs reveals bilateral late expiratory wheezes.\n\nWhat changes should be made to his current asthma treatment regimen?",

        "A": "Maintain current therapy",

        "C": "Add salmeterol twice daily",
        "D": "Add zileuton twice daily"

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best course of action for this patient, let's analyze the given information: 1. The patient's symptoms have worsened, requiring more frequent use of his albuterol inhaler (4 times/week) and nocturnal awakenings due to symptoms. 2. The patient's asthma symptoms are impacting his daily activities, such as playing with his friends, which is a concern for his quality of life. 3. The patient's past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis, which can be a contributing factor to asthma symptoms. 4. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a normal temperature, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. Given these points, the patient's asthma symptoms are not well-controlled on his current regimen, and we need to consider adding a controller medication to his treatment. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Maintaining the current therapy is not an option, as the patient's symptoms are not well-controlled. B. Adding fluticasone daily is a reasonable option, as it is a corticosteroid that can help control inflammation in the airways. C. Adding salmeterol twice daily may not be the best option, as it is a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) that can mask symptoms and potentially lead to over-reliance on the inhaler. It's usually recommended to use LABAs in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for long-term control. D. Adding zileuton twice daily is not a standard treatment for asthma and is not a commonly recommended medication for this patient's condition. Considering the patient's symptoms and the options available, adding fluticasone daily is the most appropriate choice to help control his asthma symptoms and improve his quality of life.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
