    "question": "A 70-year-old man with chronic heart failure presents to the emergency department due to difficulty in breathing. The patient is a known hypertensive for 20 years maintained on amlodipine and telmisartan. The physician notes that he is also being given a diuretic that blocks the Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule. Which drug is being referred to in this case?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Furosemide",
        "B": "Hydrochlorothiazide",
        "C": "Triamterene",
        "D": "Acetazolamide"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing, which is a common symptom of heart failure. Diuretics are commonly used in the treatment of heart failure to reduce fluid overload and alleviate symptoms. 2. The patient is being given a diuretic that blocks the Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule. This information is crucial in identifying the type of diuretic. 3. Furosemide (A) is a loop diuretic that works by inhibiting the Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. It does not specifically block Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule. 4. Hydrochlorothiazide (B) is a thiazide diuretic that acts by inhibiting the Na+-Cl- cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, not the cortical collecting tubule. 5. Triamterene (C) is a potassium-sparing diuretic that works by blocking the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the collecting duct. This matches the description given in the question, as it blocks Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule. 6. Acetazolamide (D) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that is used primarily in the treatment of glaucoma and epilepsy, not for heart failure or as a diuretic. Therefore, based on the information provided, the correct answer is C. Triamterene.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
