    "question": "A 37-year-old man with no significant past medical history is rear-ended in a motor vehicle accident. He reported significant neck pain to emergency responders, but otherwise denies weakness, numbness or tingling in his extremities. His vitals on presentation to the ED are HR 90, BP 140/80, RR 20, SpO2 98%. What is the most appropriate next step upon presentation to the emergency room?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Lateral cervical film",
        "B": "Cervical immobilization",
        "C": "IV methylprednisolone",
        "D": "Observation overnight"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's presentation of significant neck pain after a motor vehicle accident, the primary concern is potential cervical spine injury, particularly cervical spine fracture or dislocation. The patient's symptoms of neck pain do not suggest neurological deficits such as weakness, numbness, or tingling in the extremities, which might indicate spinal cord injury. However, the patient's high heart rate (HR 90) and blood pressure (BP 140/80) are within normal limits, but the respiratory rate (RR 20) is elevated, which might indicate stress or anxiety. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2 98%) is normal. The most appropriate next step in the emergency department (ED) is to ensure the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) are stable before investigating the cervical spine. The patient's vital signs do not indicate any immediate life-threatening conditions, but cervical immobilization is still crucial to prevent further injury to the cervical spine. Lateral cervical film (A) might be considered if the patient's neurological examination is abnormal or if the patient has a high-risk mechanism of injury, but it is not the immediate next step. IV methylprednisolone (C) is not indicated in the acute management of suspected cervical spine injury without evidence of neurological deficits. Observation overnight (D) may be considered if the patient's condition is stable and there are no signs of worsening, but this should be done after cervical immobilization. Cervical immobilization (B) is the most appropriate next step to prevent further injury to the cervical spine and to allow for a thorough neurological examination. This should be done using a cervical collar or other immobilization device, and the patient should be transported to the CT scanner for imaging of the cervical spine in a neutral position, if available.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
