    "question": "A 22-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by police after he was found undressing himself outside in 110\u00b0F weather. The patient refuses to answer any questions as he suspects that his care team is spying on him. The patient recently started college and has presented to the emergency department once before for polysubstance intoxication. The patient attempts to assault a nurse, is restrained, and given diphenhydramine and haloperidol. When the patient is able to be examined, he is somnolent and non-responsive. His temperature is 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C), blood pressure is 147/98 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. He does not comply with any commands, and it is not possible to freely manipulate his extremities due to rigidity. His mucous membranes are dry. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "A": "Catatonic schizophrenia",
        "B": "Heat stroke",
        "C": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient is presenting with high fever (104\u00b0F), tachycardia (120/min), hypertension (147/98 mmHg), and rigidity, which are all classic signs of a severe systemic disorder. The patient's refusal to answer questions and somnolence are also indicative of a significant alteration in mental status. The patient's recent history of polysubstance intoxication and the administration of diphenhydramine and haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic medication, are also important clues. The patient's inability to freely manipulate his extremities due to rigidity and dry mucous membranes further support the presence of a severe systemic disorder. Considering these factors, the most likely diagnosis is Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a life-threatening side effect of antipsychotic medications. NMS is characterized by fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic dysfunction. The patient's symptoms align with this diagnosis, and it is essential to promptly initiate treatment with benzodiazepines, bromocriptine, and supportive care to manage the symptoms and prevent further complications.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
