    "question": "A 45-year-old woman presents to the physician with a history of headache, palpitations, and episodic diaphoresis. She was diagnosed with hypertension in the past and is now regularly taking antihypertensive medication (amlodipine 10 mg once daily). She has had a diffuse thyroid swelling for the past 4 months. She complains of pain in the long bones of her arms and legs for the past 3 months. She is slightly built, appears thin, and is anxious and apprehensive. Her skin is moist and warm. Her weight is 45 kg (99.2 lb) and height is 146 cm (4 ft 7 in); BMI is 21.12 kg/m2. Her pulse is 116/min, the blood pressure is 196/102 mm Hg, the respiratory rate is 29/min, and the temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F). Diffuse and firm thyromegaly is present. Her upper extremities exhibit fine tremors during an anxiety attack. The laboratory test results reveal elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines. Serum epinephrine, calcitonin, and parathormone levels are also elevated. Hypercalcemia and hyperglycemia are also noted. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome",
        "B": "Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A",
        "C": "Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2B",
        "D": "Neurofibromatosis"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a combination of symptoms and laboratory findings that suggest a multisystem disorder. The elevated 24-hour urinary VMA (vanillylmandelic acid) and metanephrines are indicative of excessive catecholamine production, which is a hallmark of pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal gland. The presence of hypercalcemia and hyperglycemia further supports this diagnosis. The diffuse thyroid swelling and elevated calcitonin levels suggest medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), which is also a component of MEN 2 syndromes. The fine tremors in the upper extremities during anxiety attacks may be related to the increased catecholamine levels. The patient's anxiety and apprehension, along with her thin build and moist skin, may be related to the excess catecholamines and possibly the hyperthyroidism. The elevated parathormone levels are consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism, which is also seen in MEN 2 syndromes. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are most consistent with MEN 2B, which is a subset of MEN 2 syndromes characterized by the presence of MTC, pheochromocytoma, and other features such as marfanoid habitus, mucosal neuromas, and intestinal ganglioneuromatosis. The absence of other features such as neurofibromas or renal abnormalities makes MEN 2A less likely. Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is a different disorder that typically presents with hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma, among other features. Neurofibromatosis is a disorder characterized by neurofibromas, caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, and other features that are not present in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
