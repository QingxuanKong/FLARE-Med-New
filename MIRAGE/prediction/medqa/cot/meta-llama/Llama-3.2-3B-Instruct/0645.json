    "question": "A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician with a lump on her throat that has steadily increased in size over the past 5 months. She does not have difficulties swallowing, dyspnea, or changes in voice. Examination shows a 3-cm, hard swelling on the left side of her neck that moves with swallowing. There is no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Thyroid functions tests are within the reference range. Ultrasound of the neck shows an irregular, hypoechogenic mass in the left lobe of the thyroid. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy is inconclusive. The surgeon and patient agree that the most appropriate next step is a diagnostic lobectomy and isthmectomy. Surgery shows a 3.5-cm gray tan thyroid tumor with invasion of surrounding blood vessels, including the veins. The specimen is sent for histopathological examination. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on microscopic examination of the mass?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Undifferentiated giant cells",
        "B": "Capsular invasion",
        "C": "Infiltration of atypical lymphoid tissue",
        "D": "Orphan Annie nuclei\n\""

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the provided clinical scenario and histopathological findings step by step. 1. The patient presents with a thyroid lump that has been steadily increasing in size over 5 months, with no symptoms such as dyspnea, swallowing difficulties, or voice changes. This suggests a slowly growing thyroid tumor. 2. The physical examination reveals a hard, movable swelling on the left side of the neck that moves with swallowing, which is consistent with a thyroid mass. The absence of cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy reduces the likelihood of metastasis. 3. Thyroid function tests are within the reference range, which suggests that the tumor is not causing significant hormonal imbalances. 4. The ultrasound findings of an irregular, hypoechogenic mass in the left lobe of the thyroid further support the presence of a thyroid tumor. 5. The fine-needle aspiration biopsy results are inconclusive, which is not uncommon in cases of thyroid nodules, especially if the tumor is not highly cellular or has a complex architecture. 6. The surgical specimen shows a 3.5-cm gray, tan thyroid tumor with invasion of surrounding blood vessels, including veins. This finding is highly suggestive of an aggressive thyroid tumor. 7. Now, let's consider the histopathological options: - A. Undifferentiated giant cells: This is more commonly associated with giant cell thyroid carcinoma, which is a rare type of thyroid cancer. However, the clinical scenario does not strongly support this diagnosis. - B. Capsular invasion: This is a hallmark of follicular carcinoma, which is the most common type of thyroid cancer. The presence of capsular invasion in the surgical specimen strongly supports this diagnosis. - C. Infiltration of atypical lymphoid tissue: This is more commonly seen in lymphoma or other types of cancer that involve lymphoid tissue, which is not the primary concern in this case. - D. Orphan Annie nuclei: This term is not a standard histopathological term and is likely a distractor. It is not relevant to the diagnosis of thyroid cancer. Based on the clinical and histopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is follicular carcinoma of the thyroid, which is characterized by capsular invasion.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
