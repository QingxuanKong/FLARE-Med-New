    "question": "A 44-year-old woman with hypothyroidism comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of tingling in her feet and poor balance. Her only medication is levothyroxine. Physical examination shows conjunctival pallor and an ataxic gait. Proprioception and sense of vibration are decreased in her toes bilaterally. Laboratory studies show macrocytic anemia and normal thyroid hormone levels. Histological evaluation of tissue samples obtained by esophagogastroduodenoscopy reveals atrophic changes of the gastric body and fundus with normal antral mucosa. Which of the following structures is most likely being targeted by antibodies in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Islet cell cytoplasm",
        "B": "Deamidated gliadin peptide",
        "C": "Parietal cells",
        "D": "Smooth muscle"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step: 1. **Patient's symptoms and history**: The patient is a 44-year-old woman with hypothyroidism, presenting with tingling in her feet, poor balance, conjunctival pallor, and ataxic gait. These symptoms, especially the neurological symptoms (tingling, poor balance), are suggestive of a neurological disorder that affects the peripheral nerves. 2. **Laboratory findings**: The patient has macrocytic anemia, which indicates a disorder affecting red blood cell production. However, the normal thyroid hormone levels suggest that the hypothyroidism is not directly related to the anemia. 3. **Histological findings**: The esophagogastroduodenoscopy reveals atrophic changes in the gastric body and fundus with normal antral mucosa. This is indicative of a condition that primarily affects the stomach, specifically the gastric body and fundus. 4. **Connection to the symptoms and laboratory findings**: The presence of macrocytic anemia and neurological symptoms (tingling, poor balance) in a patient with gastric atrophy points towards a condition that affects both the stomach and the nervous system. Considering the options provided: - **A. Islet cell cytoplasm**: This is related to insulin production, which is not directly linked to the patient's symptoms or the histological findings. - **B. Deamidated gliadin peptide**: This is related to celiac disease, a condition that causes an immune response to gluten, leading to damage in the small intestine, not the stomach. - **C. Parietal cells**: These cells are responsible for the production of intrinsic factor, which is crucial for vitamin B12 absorption. The atrophic changes in the gastric body and fundus, along with macrocytic anemia, suggest a deficiency in vitamin B12, which is a result of impaired intrinsic factor production due to atrophy of the parietal cells. - **D. Smooth muscle**: This option is not directly related to the symptoms or the histological findings. Given the above analysis, the correct answer is **C. Parietal cells**, as they are responsible for the production of intrinsic factor, which is essential for vitamin B12 absorption, and their atrophy is linked to the patient's macrocytic anemia and neurological symptoms.",
