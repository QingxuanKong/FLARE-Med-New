    "question": "A 61-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of excessive thirst, frequent urination, and partial visual loss in both eyes for 1 day. His family history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus in his mother and cousin. His weight is 112 kg ( 246.9 lb), height 187 cm (6 ft 1 in), blood pressure: 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate: 89/min, respiratory rate: 14/min, and temperature: 36.7\u2103 (98.4\u2109). The physical examination is significant for dry skin, a pustular rash over the patient\u2019s shoulders and back, an accentuated second heart sound (S2) best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border, and distal loss of vibration sensitivity in both feet. A fundoscopic examination shows small red dots in the superficial retinal layers suggestive of microaneurysms. The HbA1c is 9% and the urinalysis shows the following:\nColor Pale yellow (light/pale-to-dark/deep amber)\nClarity Cloudy\npH 6.6\nSpecific gravity 1.010\nGlucose 199 mg/dl\nKetones None\nNitrites Negative\nLeukocyte esterase Negative\nBilirubin Negative\nUrinary bilirubin Traces\nRed blood cells 3 RBCs\nProtein 120 mg/d\nRBCs \u2264 2 RBCs/hpf\nWBCs 22 WBCs/hpf\nEpithelial cells 27 squamous epithelial cells/hpf\nCasts 5 hyaline casts/lpf\nCrystals Occasional\nBacteria None\nYeast Present\nWhich of the following statements best describes the cause of this patient\u2019s glucosuria?",
    "options": {
        "A": "There is a disruption of primary active transport of glucose in the proximal renal tubules",
        "B": "Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules",
        "C": "There is a disruption of passive transport of the glucose in the proximal renal tubules",
        "D": "Glucosuria results from increased glomerular filtration rate"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To determine the cause of glucosuria in this patient, let's analyze the information provided step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with excessive thirst, frequent urination, and partial visual loss in both eyes, which are classic symptoms of diabetes mellitus. The presence of a pustular rash and dry skin may suggest a secondary infection or a complication of diabetes. 2. **Laboratory Findings**: - **HbA1c**: 9% - This indicates that the patient has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. - **Urinalysis**: The presence of glucose in the urine (glucosuria) is a hallmark of diabetes mellitus. The glucose level is elevated at 199 mg/dl, which is consistent with the patient's clinical presentation. 3. **Pathophysiology of Diabetes Mellitus**: In normal individuals, the kidneys reabsorb glucose from the filtrate back into the bloodstream through a process called secondary active transport. This process is mediated by sodium-glucose cotransporters in the proximal renal tubules. In diabetes mellitus, the high glucose levels lead to: - Damage to the renal tubules, particularly the proximal tubules. - Impaired function of the sodium-glucose cotransporters, leading to a failure to reabsorb glucose effectively. Considering these points, let's evaluate the options: - **A. There is a disruption of primary active transport of glucose in the proximal renal tubules**: This is incorrect because the primary active transport of glucose in the proximal renal tubules is not directly affected in diabetes mellitus. - **B. Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules**: This option is correct. The impaired function of sodium-glucose cotransporters in the proximal renal tubules due to diabetes mellitus leads to the failure to reabsorb glucose, resulting in glucosuria. - **C. There is a disruption of passive transport of the glucose in the proximal renal tubules**: This is incorrect because the primary mechanism of glucose reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules is active transport, not passive transport. - **D. Glucosuria results from increased glomerular filtration rate**: This is incorrect because glucosuria is a direct result of the impaired glucose reabsorption in the renal tubules, not an increase in glomerular filtration rate. Therefore, the correct answer is: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's glucosuria is best described by option B, as the impaired function of sodium-glucose cotransporters in the proximal renal tubules due to diabetes mellitus leads to the failure to reabsorb glucose effectively.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"} ```",
