    "question": "A 31-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 32 weeks' gestation presents to the emergency department for clear vaginal discharge that started roughly 26 hours ago. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Her first child was born at term by vaginal delivery. She has no history of any serious illnesses. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. Current medications include vitamin supplements. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (98.9\u00b0F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 128/82 mm Hg. Speculum examination demonstrates clear fluid at the cervical os. The fetal heart rate is reactive at 160/min with no decelerations. Tocometry shows uterine contractions. Nitrazine testing is positive. She is started on indomethacin. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Administer ampicillin and perform amnioinfusion",
        "B": "Administer ampicillin and progesterone",
        "C": "Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with cesarean section",
        "D": "Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with induction of labor"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of preterm labor, as indicated by clear vaginal discharge and uterine contractions, which is confirmed by tocometry. The presence of a positive nitrazine test further supports this diagnosis, as nitrazine is used to test for the presence of amniotic fluid. The fetal heart rate is reactive, and the fetal well-being is not immediately concerning. Given the gestational age of 32 weeks, the primary goal is to stabilize the patient and delay preterm birth. The use of indomethacin is appropriate to reduce uterine contractions. The next step should focus on treating any potential infection and preparing the patient for delivery. Ampicillin is administered to cover for potential group B streptococcal infection, which is a common cause of preterm labor. Progesterone is also administered to help delay preterm birth, as it has been shown to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women with a history of preterm labor or a previous preterm birth. A cesarean section is not immediately indicated, as the patient is stable and the fetal well-being is not concerning. Induction of labor is not the best option at this time, as it may precipitate preterm birth. Betamethasone is not indicated in this scenario, as it is used to accelerate fetal lung maturation, but the patient is already at 32 weeks, and the primary concern is stabilizing the patient and delaying preterm birth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
