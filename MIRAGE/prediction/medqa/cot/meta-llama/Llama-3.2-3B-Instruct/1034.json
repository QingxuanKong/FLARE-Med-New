    "question": "A 34-year-old woman presents to the plastic surgery office 3 months following a rhinoplasty procedure. The patient has been recovering well. However, she has noticed a small whistling noise when she respires through her nose, which you appreciate on physical exam. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this phenomenon?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Post-operative swelling",
        "B": "A septal hematoma causing a perforation",
        "C": "A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow",
        "D": "Excessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the situation step by step. The patient presents 3 months post-rhinoplasty, which indicates that the initial swelling and edema have resolved. The presence of a whistling noise when breathing through the nose suggests a significant alteration in nasal airflow. Option A, post-operative swelling, is unlikely because the patient has been recovering well and the swelling should have resolved by this stage. Option D, excessive columellar show, would not directly cause a whistling noise. Option B, a septal hematoma causing a perforation, is a possible complication of rhinoplasty, but it would typically present with more severe symptoms such as nasal bleeding, pain, or difficulty breathing. A perforation would not cause a whistling noise. Option C, a deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow, is the most plausible explanation. During rhinoplasty, the nasal septum can be corrected or realigned. If the septum becomes straight, it can cause turbulent airflow, resulting in a whistling noise. This is a common complication of rhinoplasty, and the patient's symptoms match this possibility. Therefore, the most likely cause of the whistling noise is a deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
