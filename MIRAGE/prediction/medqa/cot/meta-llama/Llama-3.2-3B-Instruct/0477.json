    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of a tingling sensation in his right forearm. He reports that his symptoms started after he lifted heavy weights at the gym. Physical examination shows loss of sensation on the lateral side of the right forearm. Sensation over the thumb is intact. Range of motion of the neck is normal. His symptoms do not worsen with axial compression or distraction of the neck. Further examination of this patient is most likely to show weakness of which of the following actions?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Elbow flexion",
        "B": "Forearm pronation",
        "C": "Index finger flexion",
        "D": "Wrist extension"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break down the information provided: 1. **Location of symptoms**: The patient reports a tingling sensation in the right forearm, specifically on the lateral side. This suggests a nerve-related issue. 2. **Sensation intact**: The sensation over the thumb is intact, which is an important clue. The median nerve, which supplies sensation to the thumb, index, and middle fingers, is likely not involved. 3. **Normal range of motion**: The normal range of motion of the neck suggests that the cervical spine is not the source of the problem. 4. **Symptoms do not worsen with axial compression or distraction of the neck**: This further supports the idea that the problem is not related to the cervical spine. 5. **Symptoms after lifting heavy weights**: The onset of symptoms after lifting heavy weights at the gym suggests a musculoskeletal or nerve-related issue related to the muscles or nerves of the arm. Given these clues, the most likely diagnosis is a radial nerve injury or compression. The radial nerve is responsible for motor function to the extensor muscles of the wrist and fingers, as well as sensation to the back of the arm and forearm. The lateral side of the forearm is innervated by the radial nerve. Considering the options: A. Elbow flexion is primarily controlled by the biceps brachii muscle, which is innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve, not the radial nerve. B. Forearm pronation is primarily controlled by the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor carpi radialis muscles, which are innervated by the ulnar nerve, not the radial nerve. C. Index finger flexion is primarily controlled by the flexor digitorum profundus, which is innervated by the ulnar nerve, not the radial nerve. D. Wrist extension is primarily controlled by the extensor carpi radialis brevis and extensor carpi radialis longus muscles, which are innervated by the radial nerve. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is likely experiencing a radial nerve injury or compression, which would lead to weakness of wrist extension. The radial nerve is responsible for controlling wrist extension, and the symptoms described are consistent with this diagnosis. The radial nerve runs down the back of the arm and forearm, making it susceptible to compression or injury, especially after heavy lifting or bending.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
