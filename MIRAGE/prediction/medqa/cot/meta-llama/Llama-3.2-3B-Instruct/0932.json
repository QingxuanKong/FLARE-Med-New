    "question": "A 64-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with a complaint of bilateral knee pain that has been present for the past several years but has worsened recently. He reports pain with climbing stairs and with extended walks of greater than 100 yards. The pain worsens with activity throughout the day and is alleviated by periods of rest. He states that he has minimal morning stiffness, lasting approximately 5-10 minutes after waking up most days. Physical examination reveals tenderness to palpation of the bony structures on the medial aspect of the bilateral knees as well as crepitus and a decreased range of motion, limited at the extremes of flexion and extension. Both knee joints are cool to touch and exhibit bony enlargement upon palpation of the medial joint line. Which of the following studies would be indicated for further work-up of this patient's presenting condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Complete blood count (CBC)",
        "B": "Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)",
        "C": "MRI of the knee",
        "D": "No further work-up needed"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this patient's condition, we need to consider the symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient presents with bilateral knee pain that worsens with activity and is alleviated by rest, which is a classic pattern for osteoarthritis (OA). The presence of tenderness to palpation of the bony structures on the medial aspect of the bilateral knees, crepitus, and decreased range of motion are also consistent with OA. Additionally, the bony enlargement upon palpation of the medial joint line is a hallmark of OA. Given these findings, the primary goal of further work-up would be to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the disease. The complete blood count (CBC) may be useful in ruling out other potential causes of knee pain, such as anemia or infection, but it is not necessary for the diagnosis of OA. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a non-specific marker of inflammation and may be elevated in various conditions, including OA, but it is not specific for OA. An MRI of the knee can provide detailed images of the joint and surrounding soft tissues, which can be useful in assessing the extent of joint damage and detecting any potential underlying causes of the pain, such as meniscal tears or ligamentous injuries. However, in the absence of any red flags or systemic symptoms, an MRI may not be immediately necessary. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the work-up would be to perform a plain radiograph (X-ray) to confirm the diagnosis of OA and assess the severity of joint space narrowing and joint deformity. This information can help guide further management decisions, such as the need for physical therapy, medication, or surgical intervention.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
