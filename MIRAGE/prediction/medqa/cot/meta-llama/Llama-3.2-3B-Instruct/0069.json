    "question": "A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension, obesity, and alcoholic cirrhosis is seen in clinic for follow-up. He feels well and currently drinks 5 glasses of wine each night. Medications include atenolol and lisinopril. On physical exam, temperature is 98.1 deg F (36.7 deg C), blood pressure is 151/82 mmHg, pulse is 71/min, and respirations are 14/min. He has spider angiomata on his chest; no asterixis, jaundice, ascites, or peripheral edema is noted. Screening ultrasound reveals a new liver nodule, and follow up CT demonstrates a 2 cm right hepatic lobe lesion with enhancement in the arterial phase. No hypodense attenuation is seen on the venous or delayed phase. What is the next step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Proceed with liver biopsy",
        "B": "Refer for surgical resection",
        "C": "Refer for radiofrequency ablation",
        "D": "Observe and get follow-up imaging in 3 months"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis, liver nodule size of 2 cm, and lack of hypodense attenuation on the venous or delayed phase, we need to consider the likelihood of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The patient's liver function status and the presence of spider angiomata are also indicative of chronic liver disease. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (ASLD) guidelines suggest that the next step in management for a patient with a liver nodule in a patient with cirrhosis is to obtain a tissue diagnosis. This is because the risk of HCC is increased in patients with cirrhosis, and a definitive diagnosis is necessary to guide treatment decisions. Liver biopsy is the most appropriate next step in management. The other options are not suitable as the initial next step: surgical resection is not recommended for a 2 cm nodule, radiofrequency ablation is not the standard treatment for HCC, and observation alone is not sufficient given the patient's high risk of HCC. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Proceed with liver biopsy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
