    "question": "A 70-year-old hypertensive and hyperlipidemic woman comes to the emergency department with chief complaints of acute onset of impaired speech and comprehension with a right-sided weakness for the last 1.5 hours. The patient was on 2 antihypertensive medications and a statin, but she was not receiving any antiplatelet drugs. She has a blood pressure of 136/94, heart rate of 84/min, and respiratory rate of 15/min. Initial examination shows global aphasia, right homonymous hemianopia, and hemisensory loss. An acute ischemic stroke caused by distal left internal carotid artery occlusion with salvageable penumbral tissue is diagnosed based on a non-contrast CT scan, brain MRI, and catheter cerebral angiogram. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is given as treatment within 3 hours of presentation. Which of the following cellular processes is typical of the section of reversible injury noted in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Mitochondrial permeability",
        "B": "Caspase activation",
        "C": "Lysosomal rupture",
        "D": "Decreased ATP"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the key points: 1. **Patient's symptoms and diagnosis**: The patient has acute onset of impaired speech and comprehension, right-sided weakness, and visual disturbances, consistent with a left hemisphere stroke due to distal left internal carotid artery occlusion. The presence of salvageable penumbral tissue suggests that some areas of the brain are still viable but not functioning properly. 2. **Pathophysiology of ischemic stroke**: Ischemic strokes occur when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, leading to a lack of oxygen and nutrients. This causes cellular damage and death in the affected area. 3. **Cellular processes in ischemic stroke**: - **Mitochondrial permeability (A)**: During ischemia, the lack of oxygen and nutrients can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and increased permeability, releasing cytochrome c and initiating the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. - **Caspase activation (B)**: Caspases are enzymes involved in apoptosis (programmed cell death). While caspase activation is a key event in apoptosis, it is more associated with irreversible cell death, which is not typical of salvageable penumbral tissue. - **Lysosomal rupture (C)**: Lysosomal rupture can occur in ischemic injury, but it is not the primary cellular process associated with salvageable tissue. - **Decreased ATP (D)**: Ischemia leads to a significant decrease in ATP production due to the lack of oxygen and nutrients. This decrease in ATP is a hallmark of ischemic injury and is a key factor in the development of cellular damage. Considering these points, the cellular process that is typical of the salvageable penumbral tissue in this patient is a decrease in ATP due to the ischemic insult. This decrease in ATP can trigger a cascade of events leading to cellular damage and death, but in salvageable tissue, the goal of treatment (e.g., thrombolysis with tPA) aims to restore blood flow and minimize damage. **Answer choice**: D. Decreased ATP",
