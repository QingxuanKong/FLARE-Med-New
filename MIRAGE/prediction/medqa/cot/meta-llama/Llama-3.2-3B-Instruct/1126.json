    "question": "A 34-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department following a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was the restrained driver. On arrival, she has a cervical collar in place and is unresponsive. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98\u00b0F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 131/76 mm Hg. Her pupils are dilated and not reactive to light. She is unresponsive to noxious stimuli. She is intubated, and mechanical ventilation is begun. Serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within the reference range. Toxicology screening is negative. A CT scan of the head without contrast shows a massive intracranial bleed and a cervical spine injury at the level of C3. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing brain death?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Electroencephalography",
        "B": "Magnetic resonance angiography",
        "C": "Deep tendon reflex testing",
        "D": "Corneal reflex test"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To diagnose brain death, it is essential to assess the absence of brainstem function, as the brainstem is responsible for controlling vital functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation, so we can rule out hypoxia as a cause of her unresponsiveness. The patient's pupils are dilated and not reactive to light, which is a sign of brainstem dysfunction. The patient is also unresponsive to noxious stimuli, which further supports the presence of brainstem dysfunction. Given these findings, the next step should focus on confirming the absence of brainstem function. The corneal reflex test is a bedside test that can be used to assess the integrity of the brainstem. It involves gently stroking the cornea to elicit a reflexive blink response. If the reflex is absent, it suggests brainstem dysfunction. Electroencephalography (EEG) can also be used to assess brain activity, but it is not as specific for diagnosing brain death as the corneal reflex test. Magnetic resonance angiography is not relevant to diagnosing brain death, and deep tendon reflex testing is not a reliable indicator of brainstem function in this context.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
