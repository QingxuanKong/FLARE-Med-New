    "question": "A 3-year-old girl is brought to the cardiologist because of sweating and respiratory distress while eating. She is at the 30th percentile for height and 15th percentile for weight. Echocardiography shows a defect in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum and a moderately decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. Physical examination is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the symptoms and echocardiography findings provided. The patient is a 3-year-old girl presenting with sweating and respiratory distress during eating, which suggests that she is experiencing chest pain or discomfort. The low percentile for height and weight indicates that she is likely malnourished. The echocardiography findings reveal a defect in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum. This is a key piece of information as it points towards a specific type of congenital heart defect. The moderately decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) indicates that the left ventricle is not pumping blood efficiently, which can be a consequence of various cardiac defects. Given these findings, we need to consider which of the provided options is most consistent with these symptoms and echocardiography findings. Option A, a systolic murmur that increases with hand clenching, is typically associated with aortic stenosis, which is not directly related to the interventricular septal defect. Option B, a systolic murmur that increases with forced exhalation against a closed glottis, is characteristic of a ventricular septal defect (VSD), which is a defect in the interventricular septum. This is the most likely diagnosis given the echocardiography findings. Option C, a diastolic murmur preceded by an opening snap, is typically associated with mitral stenosis, which is not directly related to the interventricular septal defect. Option D, a continuous murmur that is loudest at the second heart sound, is typically associated with patent ductus arteriosus, which is a different type of congenital heart defect. Therefore, based on the symptoms and echocardiography findings, the most likely diagnosis is a ventricular septal defect, and the physical examination is most likely to show a systolic murmur that increases with forced exhalation against a closed glottis.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
