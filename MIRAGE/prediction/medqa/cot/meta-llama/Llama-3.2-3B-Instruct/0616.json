    "question": "A 31-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with fevers, chills, and night sweats. After a physical exam and a series of laboratory tests, the patient undergoes a lymph node biopsy (Image A). Three days later, while awaiting treatment, he presents to his physician complaining of generalized swelling and is found to have 4+ protein in his urine. Which of the following pathological findings is most likely to be found on renal biopsy in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Rapidly progresive glomerulonephritis",
        "B": "Amyloidosis",
        "C": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis",
        "D": "Minimal change disease"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of fevers, chills, and night sweats, which are classic signs of an infectious process. The patient underwent a lymph node biopsy, which suggests that the underlying cause may be related to a systemic infection. The development of proteinuria (4+ protein in urine) after the biopsy indicates kidney involvement. Given the combination of systemic symptoms and renal involvement, we need to consider infections that can cause both systemic symptoms and kidney damage.\\n\\nThe patient's symptoms and the presence of proteinuria after the lymph node biopsy suggest that the underlying condition is likely an infection that has spread to the kidneys. One such infection is tuberculosis (TB), which is known to cause systemic symptoms such as fevers, chills, and night sweats, and can also cause kidney damage leading to proteinuria.\\n\\nIn the context of TB, the renal involvement is often seen in the form of renal TB, which can cause a range of pathological changes in the kidneys, including amyloidosis.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely pathological finding on renal biopsy in this patient is amyloidosis, which is a condition characterized by the deposition of abnormal proteins in the kidneys, leading to kidney damage and dysfunction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
