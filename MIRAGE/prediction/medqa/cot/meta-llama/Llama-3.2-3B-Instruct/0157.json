    "question": "A 13-month-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. Physical examination shows hepatosplenomegaly. A venous blood sample obtained for routine screening tests is milky. After refrigeration, a creamy supernatant layer appears on top of the sample. Genetic analysis shows a mutation in the apolipoprotein C-II gene (APOC2) on chromosome 19. This patient is at greatest risk for developing which of the following complications?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Acute pancreatitis",
        "B": "Myocardial infarction",
        "C": "Corneal arci",
        "D": "Cerebrovascular accident"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we first need to identify the condition described. The presence of hepatosplenomegaly and a milky appearance of the venous blood sample with a creamy supernatant layer after refrigeration is suggestive of abetalipoproteinemia, a rare genetic disorder. Abetalipoproteinemia is caused by mutations in the APOA1, APOC2, or APOE genes. The mutation in the APOC2 gene on chromosome 19 is consistent with this diagnosis. Abetalipoproteinemia is characterized by impaired absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins, leading to various clinical manifestations. One of the key features of abetalipoproteinemia is the risk of developing corneal arcus senilis (or corneal arcus), which is a deposit of calcium in the cornea, often seen in older adults. However, the question asks about the patient's greatest risk, and given the age of the patient (13 months), it is more likely that the patient will develop complications related to fat malabsorption and its consequences rather than corneal arcus. Among the options provided, the most likely complication is related to fat malabsorption, which can lead to a variety of issues, including pancreatitis due to the accumulation of lipids in the pancreas. Therefore, the patient is at greatest risk for developing acute pancreatitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
