    "question": "A 64-year-old man with coronary artery disease and hypertension comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. His blood pressure ranged from 160/100 mm Hg to 150/94 mm Hg on his previous 3 visits over the past 4 months. Current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol. Three weeks ago, he was also started on amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 158/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no other abnormalities. Renal duplex ultrasonography shows 90% occlusion of the right renal artery. Decreased renal blood flow is most likely to cause which of the following?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells",
        "B": "Dilation of efferent arteriole",
        "C": "Decreased prostaglandin synthesis by macula densa",
        "D": "Decreased reabsorption of bicarbonate at proximal tubule"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the given information and analyze the effects of decreased renal blood flow on the kidney's function. 1. The patient has 90% occlusion of the right renal artery, which means that the blood flow to the right kidney is significantly reduced. This can lead to decreased renal blood flow. 2. The kidney's primary function is to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. Decreased renal blood flow can lead to a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is the rate at which the kidneys filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. 3. The macula densa cells in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney detect changes in the concentration of sodium chloride in the tubular fluid and send signals to the juxtaglomerular cells to regulate renin release. Renin is an enzyme that stimulates the production of angiotensin II, which increases blood pressure. 4. With decreased renal blood flow, the macula densa cells detect decreased sodium chloride concentration and send signals to the juxtaglomerular cells to release more renin. This leads to increased angiotensin II production, which causes vasoconstriction of the efferent arteriole. The efferent arteriole supplies blood to the glomerulus, so vasoconstriction reduces blood flow to the glomerulus, exacerbating the decrease in GFR. 5. The decrease in GFR leads to decreased sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, resulting in increased sodium excretion in the urine. This can lead to metabolic acidosis, which is not directly related to the options provided. Considering these points, the correct answer is B. Dilation of efferent arteriole, as it is the most direct consequence of decreased renal blood flow and the body's compensatory mechanism to maintain blood pressure.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
