    "question": "A 16-year-old teenager presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe pain in his right knee. He describes the pain as the worst pain he has ever felt. He denies any recent trauma or injury to the knee. The joint appears red and swollen and is hot to the touch. He denies any lower extremity numbness. There is no family history of joint or connective tissue disorders. The teenager is otherwise healthy. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 124/82 mm Hg, respirations are 17/min, pulse is 104/min, and temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.4\u00b0F). On palpation of the affected joint, there is evidence of tenderness and capsular swelling; the joint is red and warm. Laboratory studies show increased serum CRP and procalcitonin levels. Which of the following will most likely found with analysis of his synovial fluid?",
    "options": {
        "A": "WBC/mm3 1,600; % PMN > 25%; Viscosity N",
        "B": "WBC/mm3 53,000; % PMN > 75%; Viscosity low",
        "C": "WBC/mm3 160; % PMN < 20%; Viscosity high",
        "D": "WBC/mm3 2,400; % PMN < 20%; Viscosity low"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the key information provided and analyze it step by step: 1. **Age and Presentation**: A 16-year-old teenager presents with sudden onset of severe pain in the right knee, which is the worst pain he has ever felt. This acute presentation is concerning for a few potential diagnoses, including septic arthritis, given the sudden onset and severity of the pain. 2. **Symptoms and Signs**: The knee is described as red, swollen, and hot to the touch, with tenderness and capsular swelling. The absence of lower extremity numbness and the presence of systemic signs such as fever (39.1\u00b0C or 102.4\u00b0F) and tachycardia (104/min) suggest an infectious or inflammatory process. 3. **Laboratory Findings**: Elevated serum CRP (C-reactive protein) and procalcitonin levels indicate an acute inflammatory response. These markers are often elevated in conditions like septic arthritis. 4. **Analysis of Options**: - Option A: WBC/mm^3 1,600; % PMN > 25%; Viscosity N. This option does not indicate an acute inflammatory response as suggested by the clinical presentation. - Option B: WBC/mm^3 53,000; % PMN > 75%; Viscosity low. This option suggests a high white blood cell count with a predominance of neutrophils, which is consistent with a bacterial infection, such as septic arthritis. The low viscosity also indicates the fluid is likely to be serosanguinous or purulent, consistent with an acute infection. - Option C: WBC/mm^3 160; % PMN < 20%; Viscosity high. This option does not indicate an acute inflammatory response as suggested by the clinical presentation. - Option D: WBC/mm^3 2,400; % PMN < 20%; Viscosity low. This option suggests a low white blood cell count with a low percentage of neutrophils, which is not consistent with the clinical presentation of septic arthritis. **Conclusion**: Based on the acute onset of severe pain, the clinical signs of inflammation (redness, swelling, warmth, tenderness), the elevated inflammatory markers (CRP and procalcitonin), and the laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is septic arthritis. The analysis of synovial fluid would most likely show a high WBC count with a predominance of neutrophils (Option B), which is consistent with a bacterial infection. **Answer Choice**: B",
