    "question": "A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain. She states that she was walking up the stairs at work when she felt sudden and severe abdominal pain followed by nausea and vomiting. Her past medical history is non-contributory and she is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 99.7\u00b0F (37.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 122/78 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of abdominal tenderness, a left adnexal mass, and left adnexal tenderness. A transvaginal ultrasound demonstrates free fluid surrounding the ovary with edema and the presence of doppler flow. A urinary pregnancy test is negative. The patient's symptoms persisted after ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Laparoscopy",
        "B": "Laparotomy",
        "C": "MRI of the pelvis",
        "D": "Observation and serial abdominal exams"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking: **Step 1: Assess the patient's symptoms and history** The patient presents with sudden and severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting after physical exertion. These symptoms, combined with the patient's age and the absence of a known medical history, suggest a possible ovarian torsion or ruptured ovarian cyst. **Step 2: Evaluate the physical exam findings** The physical exam is notable for left adnexal tenderness and edema, which is consistent with an ovarian pathology. The absence of abdominal tenderness may be due to the fact that the pain is more localized to the adnexal region. **Step 3: Interpret the imaging findings** The transvaginal ultrasound demonstrates free fluid surrounding the ovary with edema and Doppler flow, which is highly suggestive of a ruptured ovarian cyst. The presence of free fluid and Doppler flow indicates that the cyst has ruptured and there is bleeding into the peritoneal cavity. **Step 4: Consider the patient's symptoms and imaging findings** Given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a ruptured ovarian cyst. The patient's symptoms persisted after initial pain management with ibuprofen and acetaminophen, indicating that the condition is acute and requires prompt intervention. **Step 5: Choose the best next step in management** Considering the acute nature of the condition and the need for prompt intervention, the best next step in management is to perform a laparoscopic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the injury. **Answer Choice:** A.
