    "question": "A 10-year-old Caucasian female with Turner's syndrome underwent an abdominal imaging study and was discovered that the poles of her kidneys were fused inferiorly. Normal ascension of kidney during embryological development would be prevented by which of the following anatomical structures?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Superior mesenteric artery",
        "B": "Inferior mesenteric artery",
        "C": "Celiac artery",
        "D": "Splenic artery"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to understand the embryological development of the kidneys and how their ascent is influenced by surrounding structures. In normal development, the kidneys ascend from their initial position in the pelvis to their final position in the lumbar region. This ascent is guided by the downward growth of the inferior vena cava and the upward growth of the aorta. However, the inferior mesenteric artery plays a crucial role in preventing the kidneys from ascending too far. The inferior mesenteric artery emerges from the aorta below the renal arteries and provides a 'brake' to the ascent of the kidneys, ensuring they do not ascend too far and end up in an abnormal position. The other options do not directly influence the ascent of the kidneys in this way. The superior mesenteric artery and celiac artery are involved in supplying blood to the intestines, while the splenic artery supplies blood to the spleen. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that directly prevents the kidneys from ascending too far during development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
