    "predict": "To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and history: 1. **Chief Complaint and History of Present Illness**: The patient is an 18-year-old college student complaining of excessive daytime sleepiness, which has worsened since starting college. He reports difficulty sleeping, napping during classes, and waking up feeling exhausted despite a significant amount of sleep. This pattern suggests a disorder of excessive daytime sleepiness. 2. **Sleep Pattern**: The patient goes to bed at 9 p.m. and wakes up at 8 a.m., napping for 4 hours during the day, and sleeps up to 20 hours on weekends. This indicates a significant sleep debt and suggests a disorder of excessive daytime sleepiness. 3. **Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Score**: The patient's ESS score is 17, which is in the moderate to severe range. The ESS is a validated measure of excessive daytime sleepiness, and a score of 17 indicates significant daytime sleepiness. 4. **Additional Symptoms**: The patient reports episodes of sudden generalized body weakness, ptosis (drooping eyelids), and difficulty speaking that occurred after becoming angry. These symptoms are suggestive of cataplexy, a condition often associated with narcolepsy. 5. **Diagnosis**: Based on the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is narcolepsy with cataplexy. Now, considering the treatment options: - **A. Clomipramine**: Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant with some sedative properties, but it is not the first-line treatment for narcolepsy with cataplexy. - **B. Dextroamphetamine**: Dextroamphetamine is a stimulant medication that can be used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy. However, it is not the most effective treatment for cataplexy. - **C. Modafinil**: Modafinil is a wakefulness-promoting agent that is FDA-approved for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy. It is also effective in treating cataplexy and has a favorable side-effect profile. - **D. Sleep Deprivation**: Sleep deprivation is not a treatment for narcolepsy or cataplexy; in fact, it can exacerbate symptoms. **Conclusion**: Based on the patient's symptoms and history, the best next step in therapy is to initiate treatment with a wakefulness-promoting agent that is effective in treating narcolepsy with cataplexy. **Answer Choice**: C. Modafinil",
