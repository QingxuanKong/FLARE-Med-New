    "question": "A previously healthy 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 10-day history of unsteady gait, frequent falls, and twitching of the extremities. Physical examination shows bilateral saccadic eye movement in all directions and brief, involuntary muscle contractions of the trunk and limbs. There is an ill-defined, nontender mass in the upper right abdomen. He undergoes surgical resection of the tumor. Histopathologic examination of this mass is most likely to show which of the following?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Numerous immature lymphocytes in a starry sky pattern",
        "B": "Abortive glomeruli and tubules in a spindle cell stroma",
        "C": "Small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil",
        "D": "Hepatocytes in fetal and embryonic stages of differentiation"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the clinical presentation and relate it to the potential answers. 1. **Clinical Presentation:** - Age: 2 years old - Symptoms: Unsteady gait, frequent falls, twitching of the extremities - Physical examination findings: Bilateral saccadic eye movements, brief, involuntary muscle contractions of the trunk and limbs - Ill-defined, nontender mass in the upper right abdomen 2. **Differential Diagnosis:** - The symptoms suggest a neurological disorder, given the gait disturbance, eye movement abnormalities, and muscle twitching. The presence of a mass in the abdomen could indicate a neuroblastoma, which is a common extracranial solid tumor in children. 3. **Neuroblastoma:** - Neuroblastoma is a cancer of the sympathetic nervous system, most commonly arising in the adrenal glands but can also occur in other locations, such as the neck, chest, or pelvis. - It is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children. - Neuroblastoma can cause a range of symptoms depending on the tumor's location and the amount of catecholamine production, including hypertension, tachycardia, and other signs of catecholamine excess. 4. **Histopathological Features of Neuroblastoma:** - The characteristic histological feature of neuroblastoma is the presence of **small, blue, round cells (small blue cells) in a spindle cell stroma**. These cells are neuroblasts that have not yet differentiated into neurons. Given this analysis, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The clinical presentation and the common association of neuroblastoma with abdominal masses and neurological symptoms lead to the conclusion that the histopathological examination of the tumor is most likely to show numerous immature lymphocytes in a starry sky pattern (A) is incorrect. Abortive glomeruli and tubules in a spindle cell stroma (B) are features of Wilms tumor, not neuroblastoma. Hepatocytes in fetal and embryonic stages of differentiation (D) could be seen in hepatocellular adenoma or hepatocellular carcinoma. The correct answer is C, as small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil are characteristic of neuroblastoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
