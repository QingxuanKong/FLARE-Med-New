    "question": "A 3550-g (7.8-lb) male newborn is delivered at term to a 27-year-old, gravida 1, para 1 woman (Rh+). Within the first 24 hours after birth, the newborn develops fever and a yellow discoloration of skin and sclerae. Examination shows loss of flexion in the extremities, splenomegaly, and cyanosis. Laboratory studies show decreased haptoglobin levels and increased LDH levels. A photomicrograph of a peripheral blood smear is shown. Which of the following is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Decrease in the reduced form of glutathione",
        "B": "Maternal antibodies against the rhesus D antigen",
        "C": "Deficiency of ATP",
        "D": "Osmotically fragile erythrocytes"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the clinical presentation and laboratory findings: 1. **Clinical Presentation:** - Fever and yellow discoloration of skin and sclerae in a newborn - Loss of flexion in the extremities (may indicate hypotonia or weakness) - Splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) - Cyanosis (blue discoloration of the skin due to inadequate oxygenation) 2. **Laboratory Findings:** - Decreased haptoglobin levels - Increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels - The presence of a photomicrograph of a peripheral blood smear is mentioned, but its description is not provided. However, these findings, combined with the clinical presentation, suggest hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells). Considering these findings, we can narrow down the possible causes: - **Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN)** is a condition where maternal antibodies against the RhD antigen (or ABO) cause destruction of the newborn's red blood cells. This condition can present with jaundice, anemia, and other signs of hemolysis, which matches the newborn's symptoms. The presence of splenomegaly and decreased haptoglobin levels further supports this diagnosis. - **Decrease in the reduced form of glutathione (A)** is not directly related to the clinical presentation of hemolysis in this context. - **Deficiency of ATP (C)** can cause various conditions, but it doesn't directly relate to the acute presentation of hemolysis in this newborn. - **Osmotically fragile erythrocytes (D)** might be involved in conditions like hereditary spherocytosis, but the acute presentation and laboratory findings in this case do not support this diagnosis. Given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is the maternal antibodies against the RhD antigen, leading to Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN). **Answer Choice:** B. Maternal antibodies against the rhesus D antigen",
