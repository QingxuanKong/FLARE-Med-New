    "question": "A 55-year-old man presents to a rheumatologist with bilateral wrist and knee pain that has been present for the last 10 years. The patient was a professional athlete who retired at age 50. He also notes morning stiffness in his joints that lasts approx. 50 minutes. He denies joint swelling, color changes in his digits, dryness of mucous membranes, and constitutional symptoms such as fever and chills. On physical exam, the physician notes several non-tender nodules on the left 1st, 3rd, and 4th distal interphalangeal joints. There is also tenderness with palpation at the base of both thumbs. The patient\u2019s knees are enlarged, bilaterally, and he has pain and crepitus on passive range of motion. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Ankylosing spondylitis",
        "B": "Gout",
        "C": "Osteoarthritis",
        "D": "Fibromyalgia"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this case, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and history: 1. **Duration and pattern of joint pain**: The patient has had bilateral wrist and knee pain for 10 years, which suggests a chronic condition. 2. **Morning stiffness**: The patient experiences morning stiffness lasting approximately 50 minutes, which is a hallmark symptom of inflammatory arthritis. 3. **Denial of joint swelling, color changes, dryness of mucous membranes, and constitutional symptoms**: This suggests that the patient's condition is not likely due to an infectious or inflammatory cause. 4. **Physical exam findings**: The presence of non-tender nodules on the distal interphalangeal joints (DIP joints) and tenderness at the base of both thumbs, along with bilateral knee enlargement and crepitus on passive range of motion, are key findings. 5. **Patient's history as a professional athlete**: This suggests that the patient may have experienced repetitive joint stress and wear and tear. Considering these points, let's evaluate the options: - **Ankylosing Spondylitis (A)**: Typically presents with back pain and stiffness, which is not the primary complaint in this case. While it can affect other joints, the absence of spinal involvement makes it less likely. - **Gout (B)**: Characterized by acute, episodic joint pain, often accompanied by swelling and redness. The patient's presentation does not match this profile. - **Fibromyalgia (D)**: Primarily presents with widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. While the patient experiences pain, the physical exam findings and duration of symptoms do not align with fibromyalgia. - **Osteoarthritis (C)**: The patient's history as a professional athlete, chronic nature of the pain, and physical exam findings (non-tender nodules, tenderness at the base of thumbs, and crepitus) are all consistent with osteoarthritis, particularly the DIP joints. Given the chronic nature of the symptoms, physical exam findings, and the patient's history, osteoarthritis is the most likely diagnosis.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",
