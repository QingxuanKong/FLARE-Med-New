    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe dyspnea, wheezing, and palpitations. His symptoms began approx. 20 minutes after being stung by a bee on the left arm. Past medical history is significant for hypertension for which he takes labetalol. While being questioned, the patient becomes obtunded. His vital signs include: temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F); blood pressure 85/55 mm Hg; pulse 110/min; respiratory rate 31/min; and oxygen saturation 90% on room air. On physical examination, an area of severe edema and erythema is noted on the extensor surface of the left forearm, and there is severe angioedema of the face and neck. The patient is intubated, and aggressive fluid resuscitation and intramuscular epinephrine are administered. A repeat blood pressure is 90/55 mm Hg, despite these efforts. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Administer dopamine",
        "B": "Administer glucagon",
        "C": "Administer dexamethasone",
        "D": "Administer norepinephrine"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with severe anaphylaxis, as evidenced by symptoms such as severe dyspnea, wheezing, palpitations, and angioedema of the face and neck, which began shortly after a bee sting. The patient's hypotension (blood pressure 85/55 mmHg) and tachycardia (pulse 110/min) are also consistent with anaphylaxis. The patient's respiratory rate is elevated at 31/min, and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air, indicating respiratory compromise. The administration of intramuscular epinephrine and fluid resuscitation has been attempted, but the patient remains hypotensive. The patient's symptoms and hemodynamic instability suggest that the anaphylaxis is not responding to initial treatment. The next best step in management is to consider adding additional vasopressor support to help maintain blood pressure and perfusion of vital organs. Dopamine (A) is a vasopressor that can be used to support blood pressure, but it is not the first choice in anaphylaxis. Glucagon (B) is not typically used in the management of anaphylaxis. Dexamethasone (C) is an anti-inflammatory agent that may be used in some cases of anaphylaxis, but it is not the next best step in managing this patient's hypotension. Norepinephrine (D) is a potent vasopressor that is commonly used to treat severe hypotension in anaphylaxis. It can help maintain blood pressure and perfusion of vital organs, making it the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
