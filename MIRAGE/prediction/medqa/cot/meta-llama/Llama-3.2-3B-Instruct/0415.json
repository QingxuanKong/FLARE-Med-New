    "question": "A research group has created a novel screening test for a rare disorder. A robust clinical trial is performed in a group of 100 subjects comparing the new screening test against the gold standard. The results are given in the table below:\nScreening test\\gold standard Disease present Disease absent\nPositive 45 15\nNegative 5 35\nWhich of the following is most correct regarding the statistical power of this new screening test?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Repeating the study would have no effect on the statistical power of the screening test.",
        "B": "The power of the test is 0.8.",
        "C": "If the specificity of this screening test were increased, the statistical power would increase.",
        "D": "If the sensitivity of this screening test were decreased, the statistical power would decrease."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To determine the statistical power of the new screening test, we need to understand the terms involved. The sensitivity of a screening test is the proportion of true positives correctly identified by the test, while specificity is the proportion of true negatives correctly identified by the test. The power of a test is its ability to detect an effect if there is one to be detected. Step 1: Calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the screening test. - Sensitivity = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives) = 45 / (45 + 5) = 0.898 - Specificity = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Positives) = 35 / (35 + 15) = 0.700 Step 2: Calculate the odds ratio (OR) of the screening test. - OR = (True Positives / False Negatives) / (False Positives / True Negatives) = (45 / 5) / (15 / 35) = 3 Step 3: Calculate the statistical power of the test using the given information. However, we need to know the effect size or the prevalence of the disease in the population. Since the prevalence isn't given, we'll assume a common prevalence of 0.1% (1%) for the calculation. This assumption might not accurately reflect the real-world situation, but it's a common approach for such problems. - Prevalence of the disease (p) = 0.01 - Power of the test = 1 - (1 - 0.898)^(n * (1-p)) = 1 - (1 - 0.898)^(100 * (1-0.01)) \u2248 0.86 Now, comparing this calculated power to the options provided: - Option A: Repeating the study would have no effect on the statistical power of the screening test. This is incorrect because repeating the study could potentially increase the statistical power if the effect size is the same or larger. - Option B: The power of the test is approximately 0.86, not 0.8. - Option C: If the specificity of this screening test were increased, the statistical power would indeed increase because higher specificity means fewer false positives, making it easier to detect a true positive signal in the population. - Option D: If the sensitivity of this screening test were decreased, the statistical power would decrease because lower sensitivity means more false negatives, making it harder to detect a true positive signal in the population. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the statistical power of the new screening test, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the test. We then assumed a prevalence of 1% for the calculation. The power of the test was found to be approximately 0.86. This indicates that the test has a good ability to detect the disease if it is present. Repeating the study would increase the statistical power if the effect size is the same or larger. Decreasing the sensitivity would decrease the statistical power, while increasing the specificity would increase the statistical power. The power of 0.86 is not equal to 0.8, making option B incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
