    "question": "A 16-year-old male presents to his pediatrician with complaints of malaise, fatigue, sore throat, and fever over the last several days. His vital signs are as follows: T 39.1 C, HR 82, BP 122/76, RR 14, and SpO2 99%. Physical examination is significant for splenomegaly, tonsillar exudate, and posterior auricular lymphadenopathy. The tonsils are not notably enlarged. Laboratory work-up shows an elevated lymphocyte count, atypical lymphocytes on a peripheral blood smear, and a positive heterophile antibody screen. Which of the following is the best management of this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Bed rest and activity limitation",
        "B": "Ganciclovir",
        "C": "Amoxicillin",
        "D": "Prednisone"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of malaise, fatigue, sore throat, fever, splenomegaly, tonsillar exudate, and posterior auricular lymphadenopathy, which are suggestive of an infectious mononucleosis. The elevated lymphocyte count, atypical lymphocytes on peripheral blood smear, and positive heterophile antibody screen are also consistent with this diagnosis. Infectious mononucleosis is typically caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The management of infectious mononucleosis involves supportive care and symptom management rather than specific antiviral therapy. Bed rest and activity limitation can help alleviate symptoms and reduce the risk of complications. Antiviral medications such as ganciclovir are not typically used for the treatment of EBV infection. Antibiotics such as amoxicillin are not effective against viral infections. Corticosteroids like prednisone may be used in certain cases of infectious mononucleosis, but they are not the first-line treatment. The most appropriate management option for this patient is bed rest and activity limitation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
