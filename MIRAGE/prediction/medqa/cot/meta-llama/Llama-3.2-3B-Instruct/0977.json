    "question": "A 77-year-old man comes to your office for a routine visit. He is doing well, and his only complaint is the recent appearance of several brown greasy appearing lesions on his forehead (figure A) that he can't seem to peel off. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Melanoma",
        "B": "Seborrheic keratosis",
        "C": "Acanthosis nigricans",
        "D": "Erythema nodosum"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this case, let's consider the key details provided: \\n\\n The patient is a 77-year-old man with several brown, greasy-looking lesions on his forehead that he can't peel off. \\n\\n The patient's age and the description of the lesions are crucial in narrowing down the differential diagnosis. \\n\\n Seborrheic keratosis (B) is a common, benign skin growth that typically appears in older adults as brown or black spots, but it doesn't usually have a greasy appearance or be difficult to peel. \\n\\n Acanthosis nigricans (C) is a condition characterized by dark, velvety skin patches, often in the folds and creases of the body, and is more commonly associated with insulin resistance and obesity. The description of the lesions doesn't match this condition. \\n\\n Erythema nodosum (D) is an inflammatory condition characterized by red, painful nodules, typically on the shins, and is not associated with the appearance of brown, greasy lesions on the forehead. \\n\\n Melanoma (A) is a serious skin cancer that can appear as a new or changing mole, but the description of the lesions as brown, greasy, and easy to peel off doesn't fit the typical presentation of melanoma. \\n\\n Given the age of the patient and the description of the lesions, the most likely diagnosis is a seborrheic keratosis, but it's worth noting that the term'seborrheic keratosis' is not an option, so the closest correct answer would be a different condition that is similar in appearance, which is not listed. However, the closest answer from the provided options would be Seborrheic keratosis is not listed, but the next best answer would be \\n\\n \\nA can be close but is not the best answer in this case because the description does not match the typical presentation of melanoma. The best answer from the given options is not listed, but the closest answer would be a benign skin growth that could be similar in appearance to seborrheic keratosis, which is not listed. However, from the options given, B is the closest answer to seborrheic keratosis in terms of age and appearance, so I will choose B as the best answer from the given options. \\n\\nThe best answer is B.\"}",
