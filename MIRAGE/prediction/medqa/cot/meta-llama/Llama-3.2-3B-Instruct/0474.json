    "question": "A patient is unresponsive in the emergency department following a motor vehicle accident. The patient's written advance directive states that he does not wish to be resuscitated in the event of a cardiac arrest. The patient's wife arrives and demands that \"everything\" be done to keep him alive because she \"can't go on living without him.\" The patient's adult son is on his way to the hospital. If the patient arrests, which of the following should occur?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Respect the wife's wishes and resuscitate the patient",
        "B": "Respect the patient's prior wishes and do not resuscitate",
        "C": "Consult a judge for the final decision on whether or not to resuscitate",
        "D": "Consult the hospital ethics committee"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"In this scenario, the patient has clearly expressed his wishes regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) through his written advance directive. This directive is a legally binding document that outlines the patient's preferences for medical treatment in the event of a cardiac arrest or other life-threatening situations. The patient's advance directive should take precedence over the wife's emotional demands and the son's potential future wishes. The concept of 'everything' being done to keep the patient alive is not supported by the patient's advance directive. The directive specifically states that the patient does not wish to be resuscitated in the event of a cardiac arrest. Respecting the patient's prior wishes is essential to uphold his autonomy and adhere to the principles of patient-centered care. Consulting a judge or the hospital ethics committee may be necessary in certain situations, but in this case, the patient's advance directive clearly outlines his wishes. Therefore, the most appropriate course of action is to respect the patient's prior wishes and do not resuscitate him.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
