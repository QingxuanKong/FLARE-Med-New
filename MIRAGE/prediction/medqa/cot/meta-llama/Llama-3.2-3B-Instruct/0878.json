    "question": "A 17-year-old high school student was in shop class when he accidentally sawed off his pointer finger while making a bird house. He fainted when he realized his finger had been cut off. The teacher immediately transported the patient to the emergency department and he arrived within 20 minutes. He has a past medical history of asthma, and his only medication is an albuterol inhaler. The patient's current blood pressure is 122/78 mmHg. Analgesics are administered. The teacher states that he left the amputated finger in the classroom, but that the principal would be transporting it to the hospital. Which of the following is the correct method of transporting the amputated finger?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Submerge the finger in ice water",
        "B": "Wrap the finger in moist gauze",
        "C": "Wrap finger in moist gauze, put in a plastic bag, and place on ice",
        "D": "Wrap the finger in moist gauze and submerge in ice water"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To determine the correct method of transporting the amputated finger, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. **Time constraint**: The patient arrived at the emergency department within 20 minutes of the injury. Time is crucial in preserving the amputated tissue for surgical reattachment. 2. **Preservation of the amputated tissue**: The primary goal in transporting the amputated finger is to preserve it for potential reattachment surgery. This requires maintaining a cool temperature to slow down cellular metabolism and prevent tissue damage. 3. **Options analysis**: - A. Submerging the finger in ice water (A) may cause the tissues to freeze, leading to further damage due to ice crystal formation. - B. Wrapping the finger in moist gauze (B) is not sufficient for preserving the tissue, as it does not provide adequate cooling. - C. Wrapping the finger in moist gause, putting it in a plastic bag, and placing it on ice (C) is the most suitable option. The moist gauze helps maintain humidity and prevents drying out of the tissue, while the plastic bag prevents contamination and allows the finger to breathe. The ice helps keep the tissue cool. - D. Wrapping the finger in moist gauze and submerging it in ice water (D) is not the best option as submerging in ice water may cause the tissues to freeze. Given these considerations, the correct method of transporting the amputated finger is to wrap it in moist gauze, put it in a plastic bag, and place it on ice. ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The primary goal is to preserve the amputated tissue for potential reattachment surgery.
