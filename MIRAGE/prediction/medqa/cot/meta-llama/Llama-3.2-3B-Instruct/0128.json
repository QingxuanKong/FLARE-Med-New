    "question": "A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive muscle weakness for five months. She feels that the muscles in her shoulders and hips have been getting weaker and sometimes feel sore. She now has difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair. She has also noticed new difficulty with swallowing solid foods, but has no trouble with liquids. She has a 5-year history of hyperlipidemia controlled with fluvastatin. Her maternal uncle died at age 26 from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and her mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Vital signs are within normal limits. Neurologic examination shows moderate weakness in the arm abductors and hip flexors bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 13.7 g/dL\nLeukocytes 11,200/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 33 mm/h\nSerum\nCreatine kinase 212 U/L\nLactate dehydrogenase 164 U/L\nAST 34 U/L\nALT 35 U/L\nWhich of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\"",

        "A": "Intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy",
        "B": "Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and physical examination, and then correlate them with the laboratory results: 1. **Progressive muscle weakness** in the shoulders and hips, with difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair. This suggests a muscle disorder, possibly a myopathy. 2. **Family history**: The patient's maternal uncle died from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy at age 26, and her mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder, which means the patient is unlikely to be a carrier unless she is homozygous for the mutated gene, but this is not directly relevant to her symptoms. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder, which is not directly related to the patient's muscle weakness. 3. **Laboratory results**: Elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels suggest muscle damage. The mild elevation in AST and ALT indicates some degree of muscle injury or stress. 4. **Neurological examination**: Moderate weakness in the arm abductors and hip flexors bilaterally, with normal deep tendon reflexes. This pattern of weakness is typical of certain myopathies. Given these points, let's evaluate the options: A. **Intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy**: This finding is characteristic of myositis, particularly polymyositis or dermatomyositis, which are inflammatory myopathies. However, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not strongly suggest an inflammatory myopathy. B. **Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy**: This finding is more specific to myositis, such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis, which is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. C. **Positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies**: This finding is characteristic of myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the neuromuscular junction. However, the patient's symptoms do not include typical myasthenic features such as fluctuating weakness, fatigue, and diplopia. D. **Dystrophin gene mutation on genetic analysis**: This finding is characteristic of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, but the patient is female, making this diagnosis less likely. However, the patient's family history of a male relative with a similar age of onset and the fact that her mother has a history of an autoimmune disorder (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) might suggest a possible genetic component to her condition. Considering the patient's symptoms, family history, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is **Duchenne-like myopathy**, which is a condition that presents with progressive muscle weakness, similar to Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, but is more common in females. A muscle biopsy showing perifascicular and perivascular infiltration is more typical of this condition. Therefore, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's symptoms and family history, the most likely diagnosis is a Duchenne-like myopathy. The muscle biopsy showing perifascicular and perivascular infiltration is more typical of this condition. Although the patient is female, the presence of a family history of a male relative with a similar age of onset and the fact that her mother has an autoimmune disorder (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) might suggest a possible genetic component to her condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
