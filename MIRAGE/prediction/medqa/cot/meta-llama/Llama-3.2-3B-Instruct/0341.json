    "question": "A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 39 weeks gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. On examination, the cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated. After 5 minutes of pushing, there is a prolonged deceleration of the fetal heart rate to 90/min. A decision to perform an episiotomy is made to expedite vaginal delivery. The anesthesiologist locates the ischial spines by palpating the posterolateral vaginal sidewall and administers an anesthetic. Three minutes later, pinching the posterior vulva does not provoke pain. The anesthetized nerve most likely also supplies which of the following structures?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Skin of the lateral thigh",
        "B": "External anal sphincter",
        "C": "Skin of the mons pubis",
        "D": "Detrusor muscle"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Understanding the scenario**: The patient is in active labor, and the cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated. A prolonged deceleration of the fetal heart rate is detected, and an episiotomy is performed to expedite delivery. 2. **Understanding the procedure**: The anesthesiologist administers an anesthetic by palpating the posterolateral vaginal sidewall, which is the area where the ischial spines are located. The ischial spines are the bony projections on either side of the ischial tuberosities (the bony prominences at the back of the pelvis). 3. **Understanding the anesthetic effect**: The anesthetic blocks the nerves in the posterolateral vaginal sidewall, which is the area innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve (also known as the pudendal nerve's motor branch). This nerve also supplies the skin of the lateral thigh, the skin of the mons pubis, and the external anal sphincter. 4. **Eliminating options**: - The detrusor muscle is innervated by the pelvic splanchnic nerves, which are not related to the anesthetic procedure described. - Pinching the posterior vulva does not provoke pain, which suggests that the pudendal nerve's sensory branches are not affected, making option B (External anal sphincter) less likely. 5. **Conclusion**: The anesthetized nerve most likely also supplies the skin of the lateral thigh. **Answer**: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The anesthetized nerve most likely also supplies the skin of the lateral thigh due to its innervation by the inferior gluteal nerve (pudendal nerve's motor branch).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
