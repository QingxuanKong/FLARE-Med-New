    "question": "A 5-month-old boy is brought to the physician with a 3-day history of fever and cough. His mother reports that he has had multiple episodes of loose stools over the past 3 months. He has been treated for otitis media 4 times and bronchiolitis 3 times since birth. He was born at 37 weeks' gestation, and the neonatal period was uncomplicated. He is at the 10th percentile for height and 3rd percentile for weight. His temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F), pulse is 126/min, and respirations are 35/min. Examination shows an erythematous scaly rash over his trunk and extremities. The white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa bleed when scraped. Inspiratory crackles are heard in the right lung base. An X-ray of the chest shows an infiltrate in the right lower lobe and an absent thymic shadow. Which of the following is the most likely definitive treatment for this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Hematopoietic cell transplantation",
        "B": "Intravenous immune globulin",
        "C": "Leucovorin supplementation",
        "D": "Thymic transplantation"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of recurrent infections, such as otitis media and bronchiolitis, which suggests an immune deficiency. The presence of an erythematous scaly rash and white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa that bleed when scraped are characteristic of eczema croup, a condition often associated with DiGeorge syndrome. The absent thymic shadow on the chest X-ray further supports this diagnosis. DiGeorge syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a deletion of part of chromosome 22, leading to thymic hypoplasia or aplasia, which results in T-cell immunodeficiency. The patient's low birth weight and small size for age also support this diagnosis. The most common treatment for DiGeorge syndrome is hematopoietic cell transplantation, which can restore T-cell function and improve immune function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
