    "question": "A 44-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue, intermittent fever, a 4.0-kg (8.8-lb) weight loss, and a progressive, non-productive cough. She does not smoke. Physical examination shows mild wheezing over bilateral lung fields and enlarged supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes. A CT scan of the chest is shown. A biopsy specimen of a cervical lymph node shows organized epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without focal necrosis. The initial treatment of this patient's condition should include which of the following drugs?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Cisplatin",
        "B": "Lamivudine",
        "C": "Isoniazid",
        "D": "Prednisone"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the initial treatment for this patient's condition, let's analyze the provided information step by step. 1. The patient presents with fatigue, weight loss, and a progressive, non-productive cough, which are common symptoms of an infectious or inflammatory process. 2. The physical examination reveals mild wheezing over bilateral lung fields and enlarged supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes, suggesting involvement of the respiratory system and potential lymphadenopathy. 3. The CT scan of the chest is not explicitly described, but the biopsy of the cervical lymph node showing organized epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without focal necrosis is a key finding that points towards a specific diagnosis. 4. The presence of epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells is characteristic of sarcoidosis, a systemic granulomatous disease that can affect multiple organs, including the lungs, lymph nodes, and skin. 5. The treatment of sarcoidosis often involves immunosuppression to reduce inflammation and prevent organ damage. 6. Considering the options provided, Prednisone is a corticosteroid that is commonly used to treat sarcoidosis due to its anti-inflammatory properties. 7. Cisplatin is a chemotherapy agent used in the treatment of various cancers, not typically for sarcoidosis. 8. Lamivudine is an antiviral medication used to treat hepatitis B and HIV, not sarcoidosis. 9. Isoniazid is an antitubercular medication used to treat tuberculosis, which is not indicated by the biopsy findings in this case. Based on the analysis, the initial treatment of this patient's condition should include Prednisone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
