    "question": "A 3rd year resident in good standing with his residency training program would like to work more hours outside his residency obligations to gain more experience and pay for his medical school loans. He currently works and trains 60 hours per week as a resident and has a 10-hour shift external to his residency program on Saturdays. He is free of any educational and work obligations on Sundays. Based on the most recent standards set by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding this resident\u2019s moonlighting and patient safety?",
    "options": {
        "A": "He is already overcommitting and must reduce the number of hours",
        "B": "He is not allowed to work outside the scope of his residency training",
        "C": "He may work longer shifts",
        "D": "He may work up to 20 more hours"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To determine the most accurate statement regarding the resident's moonlighting and patient safety, let's break down the information step by step: 1. **ACGME Regulations**: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) sets standards for resident work hours to ensure resident well-being and patient safety. The ACGME has implemented rules to limit resident work hours to prevent fatigue and ensure that residents receive adequate rest and recovery time. 2. **Resident Work Hours**: The standard work hour limit for residents is typically 80 hours per week, with a maximum of 24 hours of continuous duty and 10 hours of night shifts. However, these rules can vary depending on the specific residency program and the resident's level of training. 3. **Current Resident Work Hours**: The resident in question currently works 60 hours per week as a resident and has a 10-hour shift on Saturdays. This totals 70 hours per week. 4. **Moonlighting**: Moonlighting refers to working outside of regular residency hours, often in a part-time or private capacity. This can include working for a private practice, teaching, or other non-residency-related activities. Given these points, let's evaluate the answer choices: - **A. He is already overcommitting and must reduce the number of hours**: This is a possible concern, but the ACGME regulations do not explicitly state that residents must reduce their hours solely because they are moonlighting. However, the resident's current workload (70 hours/week) is already at the maximum allowed by the ACGME. - **B. He is not allowed to work outside the scope of his residency training**: This is not entirely accurate. Moonlighting is not explicitly prohibited by the ACGME, but it is subject to certain guidelines and restrictions. - **C. He may work longer shifts**: This is incorrect. The ACGME regulations limit resident work hours to prevent fatigue and ensure patient safety. Working longer shifts can increase the risk of medical errors and decreased patient safety. - **D. He may work up to 20 more hours**: This is the most accurate statement. The ACGME allows residents to work additional hours beyond their regular 70 hours/week for moonlighting, but there are restrictions on the total number of hours they can work in a week. However, the exact number of additional hours is not specified. Typically, the ACGME allows residents to work up to 20-30 additional hours per week for moonlighting, but this can vary depending on the program and the resident's level of training. Therefore, the most accurate statement regarding the resident's moonlighting and patient safety is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The ACGME allows residents to work additional hours for moonlighting, but there are restrictions on the total number of hours they can work in a week. The resident in question may work up to 20 more hours for moonlighting, but this should be done in accordance with the specific guidelines and restrictions set by the residency program.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
