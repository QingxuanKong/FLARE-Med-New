    "question": "An 11-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother after she observed jerking movements of his arms and legs for about 30 seconds earlier that morning. He has not had fever, cough, or a runny nose. He has been healthy, except for occasional eczema. He was delivered at home in Romania. His mother had no prenatal care. She reports that he has required more time to reach developmental milestones compared to his older brother. The patient's immunization records are not available. He takes no medications. He appears pale with blue eyes and has a musty odor. He has poor eye contact. Which of the following would have most likely prevented the patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Levothyroxine therapy during pregnancy",
        "B": "Dietary restriction of phenylalanine",
        "C": "Daily allopurinol intake",
        "D": "Avoidance of fasting states"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario: 1. **Symptoms and Presentation**: The patient is an 11-month-old boy presenting with jerking movements of his arms and legs, which suggests a neurological issue. The absence of fever, cough, or runny nose makes an infectious cause less likely. 2. **Developmental Delays**: The boy's developmental delays, particularly in reaching milestones, could be related to his neurological condition. 3. **Physical Examination Findings**: His pale appearance, blue eyes, musty odor, and poor eye contact are significant findings that point towards a systemic or metabolic disorder. 4. **Prenatal and Immunization History**: The lack of prenatal care and unknown immunization status makes it difficult to identify a specific cause, but this doesn't rule out congenital conditions. 5. **Possible Causes**: Considering the symptoms and signs, a congenital disorder that affects metabolism and neurological function is likely. The most common condition that comes to mind is Phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder characterized by the inability to metabolize phenylalanine, an amino acid found in many protein-containing foods. Given the above analysis, let's evaluate the options: A. **Levothyroxine therapy during pregnancy**: This would be more relevant for treating hypothyroidism, which is not indicated by the symptoms provided. B. **Dietary restriction of phenylalanine**: This is the correct answer. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is responsible for converting phenylalanine into tyrosine. If untreated, PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, and other neurological symptoms, including the jerking movements described. Dietary restriction of phenylalanine is the primary treatment for PKU, which would have most likely prevented the patient's symptoms. C. **Daily allopurinol intake**: Allopurinol is used to treat gout and high uric acid levels. It is not related to the symptoms described. D. **Avoidance of fasting states**: Fasting states might be beneficial in some metabolic disorders, but it is not a treatment for PKU. Therefore, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient most likely has Phenylketonuria (PKU), a congenital disorder caused by the inability to metabolize phenylalanine. The symptoms and signs presented are consistent with untreated PKU. Dietary restriction of phenylalanine is the primary treatment for PKU, which would have most likely prevented the patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
