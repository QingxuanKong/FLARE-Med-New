    "question": "A 14-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with hand pain after falling from his skateboard one day ago. He reports that he lost his balance while attempting a new trick and fell on his outstretched hands. He has been icing his hand and taking several tablets of ibuprofen every few hours, but the pain and swelling have not improved. The patient reports that he has not been able to use the hand to take notes in school. His past medical history is significant for infectious mononucleosis last year and type 1 diabetes mellitus for which he has an insulin pump. On physical exam, there is mild swelling over the dorsal aspect of the hand and wrist. He has tenderness in the region between the extensor pollicus longus and the extensor pollicus brevis of the right hand.\n\nWhich of the following is the best next step in management?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Radiograph of the wrist",
        "B": "MRI of the wrist",
        "C": "Thumb spica cast",
        "D": "Radial gutter cast"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with hand pain and swelling after a fall, which suggests a possible fracture or sprain. Given the location of the tenderness (between the extensor pollicus longus and extensor pollicus brevis), it is likely that the injury is to the extensor pollicis brevis tendon. The patient's inability to use the hand to take notes and the lack of improvement with ibuprofen and icing suggest a more significant injury. The patient's history of infectious mononucleosis and type 1 diabetes mellitus are also important to consider, as these conditions may affect the healing process. However, the most critical step in management is to evaluate for a possible fracture, especially given the location of the tenderness. A radiograph of the wrist is the most appropriate next step as it can quickly and accurately diagnose a fracture or dislocation of the wrist. An MRI of the wrist may be considered if the radiograph is negative, but it is not the initial imaging modality of choice in this scenario. A thumb spica cast or radial gutter cast may be necessary for immobilization, but they are not the next step in management. The patient should also be evaluated for any other potential complications related to his diabetes, such as nerve injury or infection, but this is not directly related to the immediate next step in management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
