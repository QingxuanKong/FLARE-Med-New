    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care provider after feeling sad and depressed for the past several months. His wife divorced him about 6 months ago and took the kids and moved out of state. Since then he has had difficulty waking up in the morning and getting to work on time. He takes some comfort in food and has gained about 9.1 kg (20 lb). He eats out several times a week and sometimes consumes 2 whole meals in one sitting. Other than this new obsession with eating large quantities of food and excess sleeping he no longer enjoys doing things he liked doing in the past. Besides eating and sleeping he is always excited to see his children and looks forward to their visits. He says it's the one thing keeping him going. Additionally, he does not feel like he has the same drive or focuses at work. He reports that he has no interest in hurting himself or others. His blood pressure is 119/81 mm Hg, pulse rate is 85/min, respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F). His physical exam is normal. What other symptom is most likely present in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Leaden paralysis",
        "B": "Depressive symptoms that are worse in the morning",
        "C": "Stereotypies",
        "D": "Mania"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with several symptoms that are characteristic of depression, including persistent sadness, difficulty waking up in the morning, lack of interest in activities he used to enjoy, weight gain, and excessive sleeping. However, he also reports that his only motivation is seeing his children, which is a common phenomenon in depression. Another key symptom to consider is the patient's excessive eating habits, which is a common symptom of depression. Now, let's analyze the options given to determine which one is most likely present in this patient.\\n\\nOption A, Leaden paralysis, is a symptom of depression, but it is not the most likely option in this case. Leaden paralysis is a feeling of heaviness or weight in the limbs, which is not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.\\n\\nOption B, Depressive symptoms that are worse in the morning, is also a symptom of depression, but it is not the most likely option in this case. While the patient does have difficulty waking up in the morning, his symptoms are not specifically worse in the morning, but rather he has difficulty waking up in general.\\n\\nOption D, Mania, is not a likely option in this case. Mania is characterized by elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, and increased energy, which are not present in this patient's symptoms.\\n\\nOption C, Stereotypies, is a symptom that is more commonly associated with Tourette's syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. Stereotypies are repetitive movements or behaviors that are not purposeful, which is not present in this patient's symptoms. However, there is another symptom that is more closely related to the patient's symptoms, which is not listed as an option. One possible symptom that is not listed is psychomotor retardation, which is a symptom of depression characterized by slow movement and reduced productivity, which is consistent with the patient's difficulty focusing at work and lack of motivation.\\n\\nHowever, since psychomotor retardation is not an option, the closest symptom to the patient's symptoms from the options provided is Option B, Depressive symptoms that are worse in the morning. This is because the patient's symptoms of depression, such as lack of interest in activities and excessive sleeping, are not specifically worse in the morning, but his difficulty waking up in the morning is a symptom of depression that is worse in the morning, as it is a common symptom of depression to feel more tired in the morning and have difficulty getting out of bed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
