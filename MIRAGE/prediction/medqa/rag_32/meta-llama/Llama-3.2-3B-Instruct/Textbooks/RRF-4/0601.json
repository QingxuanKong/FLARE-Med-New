The question specifically asks what event occurs immediately prior to the release of neurotransmitters, which in this case is glutamate. The correct sequence of events involves the depolarization of the presynaptic membrane, which opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, allowing Ca2+ influx into the cell. This Ca2+ influx triggers the release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles. Given the options provided, we need to identify the event that occurs immediately prior to the release of neurotransmitters. The correct answer is the influx of calcium (D). This is because the influx of calcium ions is the trigger for the exocytosis of glutamate-containing vesicles and the subsequent release of glutamate into the synaptic cleft.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Glutamate is released into the synaptic cleft by Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. The released glutamate acts on postsynaptic glutamate receptors and is cleared by glutamate transporters present on surrounding glia (Figure 21\u20137). In glia, glutamate is converted to glutamine by glutamine synthetase, released from the glia, taken up by the nerve terminal, and converted back to glutamate by the enzyme glutaminase. The high concentration of glutamate in synaptic vesicles is achieved by the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT)."

Analyses of postmortem human and animal brains have failed to demonstrate a decline with age in the concentration of serotonin or its metabolites (McEntee and Crook). Accurate assessment of other neurotransmitters has been more difficult because of their marked lability in postmortem material. Data from experiments in rats suggest that the glutamate content of the brain and the number of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors diminish with age, but the functional significance of this finding is unclear.

The answer is that these channels, when open, are highly permeable to Ca2+, which acts as an intracellular signal in the postsynaptic cell, triggering a cascade of changes that are responsible for LTP. Thus, LTP is prevented when Ca2+ levels are held artificially low in the postsynaptic cell by injecting the Ca2+ chelator EGTA into it, and LTP can be induced by artificially raising intracellular Ca2+ levels in the cell. Among the long-term changes that increase the sensitivity of the postsynaptic cell to glutamate is the insertion of new AMPA receptors into the plasma membrane (Figure 11\u201344). In some forms of LTP, changes occur in the presynaptic cell as well, so that it releases more glutamate than normal when it is activated subsequently."

            "content": "The many investigations of the biochemical changes that underlie spasticity and the mechanisms of action of antispasticity drugs have been reviewed by Davidoff. Because glutamic acid is the neurotransmitter of the corticospinal tracts, one would expect its action on inhibitory interneurons to be lost. As mentioned earlier, GABA and glycine are the major inhibitory transmitters in the spinal cord; GABA functions as a presynaptic inhibitor, suppressing sensory signals from muscle and cutaneous receptors. Baclofen, a derivative of GABA, is thought to act by reducing the release of excitatory transmitters from the presynaptic terminals of primary afferent terminals. Diazepam and other benzodiazepines have a similar effect but by a different mechanism of potentiating postsynaptic GABA receptors. Actually, none of these agents is entirely satisfactory in the treatment of spasticity when administered orally; the administration of baclofen intrathecally at times has a more beneficial effect."

(B) Initial synapse formation is characterized by the accumulation of synaptic vesicles at the axon terminal and the formation of a specialized basal lamina in the synaptic cleft. (c) as the neuromuscular junction matures, the synaptic cleft accumulates basal lamina and extracellular matrix proteins, synaptic vesicles cluster at presynaptic release sites, and neurotransmitter receptors cluster at postsynaptic sites. Schwann (glial) cells accompany the motor axon and wrap around its terminus outside the region of synaptic contact. (D) transmission electron micrograph of the region of synaptic contact.

            "content": "The communication between neurons in the CNS occurs through chemical synapses in the majority of cases. (A few instances of electrical coupling between neurons have been documented, and such coupling may play a role in synchronizing neuronal discharge. However, it is unlikely that these electrical synapses are an important site of drug action.) The events involved in synaptic transmission can be summarized as follows."
