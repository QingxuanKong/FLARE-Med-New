She has a history of asthma and has frequent exacerbations despite receiving maximal medical therapy. Physical examination shows scattered expiratory wheezing. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 9,800/mm3 (13% eosinophils) and elevated serum concentration of immunoglobulin E. An x-ray of the chest shows thickened bronchial walls and perihilar opacities. Sputum culture shows scattered septate hyphae that branch at 45 degrees.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and radiographic findings. The patient has a history of asthma, which is exacerbated by the current symptoms of progressively worsening shortness of breath, scattered expiratory wheezing, and elevated serum concentration of immunoglobulin E. The laboratory results show a leukocyte count of 9,800/mm3 with 13% eosinophils, which suggests eosinophilia. The sputum culture shows scattered septate hyphae that branch at 45 degrees, which is indicative of Aspergillus infection. The radiographic findings of thickened bronchial walls and perihilar opacities are also consistent with bronchiectasis and Aspergillus infection. Given these findings, the patient is likely suffering from allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). ABPA is characterized by an immune response to Aspergillus fumigatus, which leads to the production of various cytokines and growth factors. One of the key cytokines involved in ABPA is IL-4, which is a type II helper T-cell cytokine that promotes the differentiation of eosinophils and the production of IgE. Therefore, the correct answer is D. IL-4.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

While lung biopsies show eosinophilic infiltration with acute and organizing diffuse alveolar damage, it is generally not necessary to proceed to biopsy to establish a diagnosis. Although patients present with an elevated white blood cell count, in contrast to other pulmonary eosinophilic syndromes, acute eosinophilic pneumonia is often not associated with peripheral eosinophilia upon presentation. However, between 7 and 30 days of disease onset, peripheral eosinophilia often occurs with mean eosinophil counts of 1700.

The airway mucosa is infiltrated with activated eosinophils and T lymphocytes, and there is activation of mucosal mast cells. The degree of inflammation is poorly related to disease 1672 severity and may even be found in atopic patients without asthma symptoms. This inflammation is usually reduced by treatment with ICS. There are also structural changes in the airways (described as remodeling). A characteristic finding is thickening of the basement membrane due to subepithelial collagen deposition. This feature is also found in patients with eosinophilic bronchitis presenting as cough who do not have asthma and is, therefore, likely to be a marker of eosinophilic inflammation in the airway as eosinophils release fibrogenic mediators.

May present classically or atypically. Classic symptoms: Sudden onset, fever, productive cough (purulent yellow-green sputum or hemoptysis), dyspnea, night sweats, pleuritic chest pain. Atypical symptoms: Gradual onset, dry cough, headaches, myalgias, sore throat. Lung exam may show \u2193 or bronchial breath sounds, rales, wheezing, dullness to percussion, egophony, and tactile fremitus. Elderly patients as well as those with COPD, diabetes, or immunocompromised status may have minimal or atypical signs on physical exam. Workup includes physical exam, CXR, CBC, sputum Gram stain and culture (see Figures 2.8-1 and 2.8-2), nasopharyngeal aspirate, blood culture, and ABG. Tests for specifc pathogens include the following:"

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

CXRs, although less sensitive, may reveal characteristic signs of bronchiectasis such as lung hyperinflation, bronchiectatic cysts, and dilated, thick-walled bronchi forming train track\u2013like pat-terns radiating from the lung hila. Sputum culture may identify characteristic pathogens.Sputum acid-fast bacillus smears/cultures should be performed to evaluate for nontuberculous mycobacteria, which is common in this setting. Spirometry provides assessment of the severity of airway obstruction and can be followed to track the course of disease. Management of Bronchiectasis Standard therapy includes optimizing airway clearance, use of bronchodilators to reverse any airflow limitation, and correction of reversible underly-ing causes whenever possible.94 Chest physiotherapy based on vibration, percussion, and postural drainage is widely accepted, although randomized trials demonstrating efficacy are lacking. Acute exacerbations should be treated"

Tachypnea and increased work of 1737 breathing result frequently in respiratory fatigue and ultimately in respiratory failure. Laboratory values are generally nonspecific and are primarily indicative of underlying clinical disorders. The chest radio-graph usually reveals alveolar and interstitial opacities involving at least three-quarters of the lung fields (Fig. 322-2). While characteristic for ARDS, these radiographic findings are not specific and can be indistinguishable from cardiogenic pulmonary edema (Chap. 326). Unlike the latter, however, the chest x-ray in ARDS rarely shows cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, or pulmonary vascular redistribution. Chest CT in ARDS reveals extensive heterogeneity of lung involvement (Fig. 322-4)."

            "content": "The history is essential for assessing the likelihood of underlying cardiac disease as well as for identification of one of the conditions associated with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. The physical examination in cardiogenic pulmonary edema is notable for evidence of increased intracardiac pressures (S3 gallop, elevated jugular venous pulse, peripheral edema) and rales and/or wheezes on auscultation of the chest. In contrast, the physical examination in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is dominated by the findings of the precipitating condition; pulmonary findings may be relatively normal in the early stages. The chest radiograph in cardiogenic pulmonary edema typically shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette, vascular redistribution, interstitial thickening, and perihilar alveolar infiltrates; pleural effusions are common. In noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, heart size is normal, alveolar infiltrates are distributed more uniformly throughout the lungs, and pleural effusions are uncommon."
