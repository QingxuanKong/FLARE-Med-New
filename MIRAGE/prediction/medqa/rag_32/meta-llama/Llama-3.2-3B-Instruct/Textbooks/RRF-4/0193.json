Important infections that are controlled by this function are tuberculosis and leprosy, which are caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. leprae, respectively. Mycobacteria survive intracellularly because they prevent the vesicles they occupy from fusing with lysosomes, which contain a variety of degradative enzymes and antimicrobial substances (Fig. 1.34).

Individuals with inherited mutations in any component of the TH1 pathway are extremely susceptible to infections with mycobacteria. Reactivation of the infection or reexposure to the bacilli in a previously sensitized host results in rapid mobilization of a defensive reaction but also increased tissue necrosis. Just as hypersensitivity and resistance appear in parallel, so, too, the loss of hypersensitivity (indicated by tuberculin negativity in a M. tuberculosis-infected patient) is an ominous sign of fading resistance to the organism."

Activated macrophages increase their expression of CD40 and of TNF receptors, and are stimulated to secrete TNF-\u03b1. This autocrine stimulus synergizes with IFN-\u03b3 secreted by TH1 cells to induce classical, or M1, macrophage activation characterized by the production of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O2\u2013). The macrophage also upregulates its B7 molecules in response to binding to CD40 ligand on the T cell, and increases its expression of MHC class II molecules in response to IFN-\u03b3, thus allowing further activation of resting CD4 T cells."

The combination of CD40-and IFN-\u03b3\u2013 mediated activation results in \u201cclassical\u201d macrophage activation (Chapter 3), leading to the induction of microbicidal substances in macrophages and the destruction of ingested microbes. TH2 cells produce IL-4, which stimulates B cells to differentiate into IgE-secreting plasma cells; IL-5, which activates eosinophils; and IL-13, which activates mucosal epithelial cells to secrete mucus, and induces the \u201calternative\u201d pathway of macrophage activation, which is associated with tissue repair and fibrosis (Chapter 3). Eosinophils bind to and kill IgE-coated pathogens such as helminthic parasites. TH17 cells, so called because the signature cytokine of these cells is IL-17, recruit neutrophils and monocytes, which destroy some extracellular bacteria and fungi and are involved in certain inflammatory diseases."

            "content": "Certain intravesicular bacteria, including some mycobacteria and Listeria monocytogenes, escape from phagocytic vesicles and enter the cytoplasm, where they are no longer susceptible to the microbicidal actions of activated macrophages. Their presence can, however, be detected by cytotoxic CD8 T cells. The pathogens released when macrophages are killed by these CTLs can be killed in the extracellular environment by antibody-mediated mechanisms, or can be phagocytosed by freshly recruited macrophages. In this circumstance, the provision of TH1-mediated \u2018help\u2019 for the development of CTLs, such as the provision of IL-2, may play an important role in coordinating the TH1 and CTL responses."
