    "question": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of intermittent loose stools and a 1.2-kg (2.6-lb) weight loss. She immigrated to the US from Uganda 6 weeks ago. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. The liver is firm and palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin, and the spleen is palpable just below the left costal margin. Her leukocyte count is 12,800/mm3 (12% eosinophils). Stool culture shows several oval-shaped eggs with lateral spines. Microscopic examination of a liver biopsy specimen shows granulomatous inflammation with periportal fibrosis. Exposure to which of the following is most likely to have played a role in the development of this patient's symptoms?",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: Step 1: Analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings. - The patient has a 3-week history of intermittent loose stools, weight loss, and abdominal tenderness with a firm and palpable liver. - The presence of eosinophilia (12% eosinophils) and granulomatous inflammation with periportal fibrosis in the liver biopsy specimen are key findings. - The patient immigrated to the US from Uganda, which may increase the risk of certain zoonotic infections. Step 2: Consider the patient's travel history and potential exposure to zoonotic infections. - The patient's recent immigration from Uganda increases the risk of exposure to certain zoonotic infections, including parasitic infections. Step 3: Evaluate the potential causes of the patient's symptoms. - The presence of granulomatous inflammation and eosinophilia in the liver biopsy specimen suggests a parasitic infection. - The patient's stool culture showing oval-shaped eggs with lateral spines is consistent with a parasitic infection. Step 4: Determine the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms based on the information provided. - The combination of granulomatous inflammation, eosinophilia, and the presence of eggs with lateral spines in the stool culture is most consistent with infection with a parasitic worm, specifically Schistosoma mansoni. Step 5: Eliminate the other options based on the analysis. - Undercooked pork meat (A) is more commonly associated with Trichinella spiralis. - Undercooked fish meat (B) is more commonly associated with Anisakis spp. - Dog feces (C) is more commonly associated with Echinococcus granulosus. Step 6: Select the correct answer based on the analysis. - Based on the analysis, the patient's symptoms are most likely caused by exposure to Schistosoma mansoni, which is associated with freshwater snails. Here is the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a parasitic infection, and the presence of eggs with lateral spines in the stool culture is consistent with Schistosoma mansoni.

CT with contrast medium typically shows inflamed bowel, often with concomitant obstruction, but a definitive diagnosis is usually made surgically with partial bowel resection. Pathologic study reveals a thickened bowel wall with eosinophilic granulomas surrounding the Angiostrongylus eggs. In nonsurgical cases, the diagnosis rests solely on clinical grounds because larvae and eggs cannot be detected in the stool. Medical therapy for abdominal angiostrongyliasis is of uncertain efficacy. Careful observation and surgical resection for severe symptoms are the mainstays of treatment."

Acute disease develops during parasite migration (1\u20132 weeks after infection) and includes fever, right-upper-quadrant pain, hepatomegaly, and eosinophilia. Computed tomography (CT) of the liver may show multiple parenchymal holes/or migratory tracks. Symptoms and signs usually subside as the parasites reach their final habitat. In individuals with chronic infection, bile duct obstruction and biliary cirrhosis are infrequently demonstrated. No relation to hepatic malignancy has been ascribed to fascioliasis. Diagnosis of infection with any of the biliary flukes depends on a high degree of suspicion, elicitation of an appropriate geographic history, and stool examination for characteristically shaped parasite ova. Additional evidence may be obtained by documenting peripheral-blood eosinophilia or imaging the liver. Serologic testing is helpful, particularly in lightly infected individuals."

Marked hepatomegaly is typical of cirrhosis, veno-occlusive disease, infiltrative disorders such as amyloidosis, metastatic or primary cancers of the liver, and alcoholic hepatitis. Careful assessment of the liver edge may also reveal unusual firmness, irregularity of the surface, or frank nodules. Perhaps the most reliable physical finding in the liver examination is hepatic tenderness. Discomfort when the liver is touched or pressed upon should be carefully sought with percussive comparison of the right and left upper quadrants. Splenomegaly, which occurs in many medical conditions, can be a subtle but significant physical finding in liver disease. The availability of ultrasound methods for assessment of the spleen allows confirmation of the physical finding."

Auscultation can detect bruits or friction rubs from vascular disease or hepatic tumors. Loss of bowel sounds signifies ileus, whereas high-pitched, hyperactive sounds characterize intestinal obstruction. Percussion assesses liver size and can detect shifting dullness from ascites. Palpation assesses for hepatosplenomegaly as well as neoplastic or inflammatory masses. Abdominal exam is helpful in evaluating unexplained pain. Intestinal ischemia elicits severe pain but little tenderness. Patients with visceral pain may exhibit generalized discomfort, whereas those with parietal pain or peritonitis have directed pain, often with involuntary guarding, rigidity, or rebound. Patients with musculoskeletal abdominal wall pain may note tenderness exacerbated by Valsalva or straight-leg lift maneuvers."

            "content": "Clinical Features The diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease requires an accurate history regarding both amount and duration of alcohol consumption. Patients with alcoholic liver disease can present with nonspecific symptoms such as vague right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, and malaise. Alternatively, they may present with more specific complications of chronic liver disease, including ascites, edema, or upper gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage. Many cases present incidentally at the time of autopsy or elective surgery. Other clinical manifestations include the development of jaundice or encephalopathy. The abrupt onset of any of these complications may be the first event prompting the patient to seek medical attention. Other patients may be identified in the course of an evaluation of routine laboratory studies that are found to be abnormal. On physical examination, the liver and spleen may be enlarged, with the liver edge being firm and"

            "content": "Laboratory Findings Most cases of ascariasis can be diagnosed by microscopic detection of characteristic Ascaris eggs (65 by 45 \u03bcm) in fecal samples. Occasionally, patients present after passing an adult worm\u2014 identifiable by its large size and smooth cream-colored surface\u2014in the stool or, much less commonly, through the mouth or nose. During the early transpulmonary migratory phase, when eosinophilic pneumonitis occurs, larvae can be found in sputum or gastric aspirates before diagnostic eggs appear in the stool. The eosinophilia that is prominent during this early stage usually decreases to minimal levels in established infection. Adult worms may be visualized, occasionally serendipitously, on contrast studies of the gastrointestinal tract. A plain abdominal film may reveal masses of worms in gas-filled loops of bowel in patients with intestinal obstruction. Pancreaticobiliary worms can be detected by ultrasound and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; the latter method"

The presence or absence of fecal incontinence, fever, weight loss, pain, certain exposures (travel, medications, contacts with diarrhea), and common extraintestinal manifestations (skin changes, arthralgias, oral aphthous ulcers) should be noted. A family history of IBD or sprue may indicate those possibilities. Physical findings may offer clues such as a thyroid mass, wheezing, heart murmurs, edema, hepatomegaly, abdominal masses, lymphadenopathy, mucocutaneous abnormalities, perianal fistulas, or anal sphincter laxity. Peripheral blood leukocytosis, elevated sedimentation rate, or C-reactive protein suggests inflammation; anemia reflects blood loss or nutritional deficiencies; or eosinophilia may occur with parasitoses, neoplasia, collagen-vascular disease, allergy, or eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Blood chemistries may demonstrate electrolyte, hepatic, or other metabolic disturbances. Measuring IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies may help"

(Courtesy of the Department of Radiology, UCSD Medical Center, San Diego; with permission.) Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of intestinal amebiasis includes bacterial diarrheas (Chap. 160) caused by Campylobacter (Chap. 192); enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (Chap. 186); and species of Shigella (Chap. 191), Salmonella (Chap. 190), and Vibrio (Chap. 193). Although the typical patient with amebic colitis has less prominent fever than in these other conditions as well as heme-positive stools with few neutrophils, correct diagnosis requires bacterial cultures, microscopic examination of stools, and amebic serologic testing. As has already been mentioned, amebiasis must be ruled out in any patient thought to have inflammatory bowel disease."

Abdominal bruits are noted in 6\u201325%, and ascites occurs in 30\u201360% of patients. Ascites should be examined by cytology. Splenomegaly is mainly due to portal hypertension. Weight loss and muscle wasting are common, particularly with rapidly growing or large tumors. Fever is found in 10\u201350% of patients, from unclear cause. The signs of chronic liver disease may often be present, including jaundice, dilated abdominal veins, palmar erythema, gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and peripheral edema. Budd-Chiari syndrome can occur due to HCC invasion of the hepatic veins, with tense ascites and a large tender liver (Chap. 365)."

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"
