    "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician\u2019s office by his parents after they noticed blood in his urine. The child has been complaining of difficulty in passing urine and has lower abdominal pain. He seems more bloated than usual. On some occasions, he starts crying while passing urine, primarily because of a burning sensation. A urinalysis is performed, and the results are as follows:\nUrine pH 6.2\nUrine specific gravity 1.010\nGlucose Negative\nKetones Negative\nRBCs 1-2/hpf\nWBCs 0-1/hpf\nCasts 2-3/hpf\nThe pediatrician believes the boy has a bladder infection with a double-stranded DNA virus. Which of the following conditions is also commonly associated with this viral infection?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and answer: Step 1: The patient presents with blood in his urine, difficulty passing urine, lower abdominal pain, and a burning sensation while urinating. These symptoms are suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Step 2: The urinalysis results show RBCs 1-2/hpf, WBCs 0-1/hpf, and casts 2-3/hpf, which are indicative of a UTI. Step 3: The urine pH is 6.2, which is within the normal range (5.5-8), and the specific gravity is 1.010, which is also within the normal range (1.010-1.030). Step 4: The presence of casts in the urine suggests that the infection is affecting the upper urinary tract, such as the kidneys. Step 5: The pediatrician suspects a viral infection, specifically a double-stranded DNA virus, which is commonly associated with Coxsackievirus A. Step 6: Coxsackievirus A is commonly associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), which is characterized by painful vesicles on the hands and feet, as well as a vesicular rash. Step 7: Among the options, painful dermatomal vesicles (B) is the condition most commonly associated with Coxsackievirus A infection. The final answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The pediatrician suspects a viral infection, specifically a double-stranded DNA virus, Coxsackievirus A, which is commonly associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), characterized by painful vesicles on the hands and feet, as well as a vesicular rash.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Hematuria with pyuria and bacteriuria is typical of infection and should be treated with antibiotics after appropriate cultures. Acute cystitis or urethritis in women can cause gross hematuria. Hypercalciuria and hyperuricosuria are also risk factors for unexplained isolated hematuria in both children and adults. In some of these patients (50\u201360%), reducing calcium and uric acid excretion through dietary interventions can eliminate the microscopic hematuria."

It was previously called chronic pyelonephritis because it was believed to result from recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in childhood. VUR stems from abnormal retrograde urine flow from the bladder into one or both ureters and kidneys because of mislocated and incompetent ureterovesical valves (Fig. 340-4). Although high-pressure sterile reflux may impair normal growth of the kidneys, when coupled with recurrent UTIs in early childhood, the result is patchy interstitial scarring and tubular atrophy. Loss of functioning nephrons leads to hypertrophy of the remnant glomeruli and eventual secondary FSGS. Reflux nephropathy often goes unnoticed until early adulthood when chronic kidney disease is detected during routine evaluation or during pregnancy. Affected adults are frequently asymptomatic, but may give a history of prolonged bed-wetting or recurrent UTIs"

GN, Glomerulonephritis; H&P, history and physical; Hgb, hemoglobin; RBCs, red blood cells; UTI, urinary tract infection. develop progressive renal failure and sensorineural hearing loss during adolescence and young adulthood. Females typically have a more benign course but usually have at least microscopic hematuria. Thin basement membrane disease (benign familial hematuria) is caused by more benign mutations leading to a thinning of the GBM. The mutation is often autosomal dominant, and therefore hematuria is often noted in first-degree relatives. As opposed to Alport syndrome, thin basement membrane disease is typically not progressive and usually has an excellent prognosis."

            "content": "In the clinic Urinary tract stones (calculi) occur more frequently in men than in women, are most common in people aged between 20 and 60 years, and are usually associated with sedentary lifestyles. The stones are polycrystalline aggregates of calcium, phosphate, oxalate, urate, and other soluble salts within an organic matrix. The urine becomes saturated with these salts, and small variations in the pH cause the salts to precipitate. Typically the patient has pain that radiates from the infrascapular region (loin) into the groin, and even into the scrotum or labia majora. Blood in the urine (hematuria) may also be noticed. Infection must be excluded because certain species of bacteria are commonly associated with urinary tract stones. The complications of urinary tract stones include infection, urinary obstruction, and renal failure. Stones may also develop within the bladder and produce marked irritation, causing pain and discomfort."

            "content": "Isolated hematuria without proteinuria, other cells, or casts is often indicative of bleeding from the urinary tract. Hematuria is defined as two to five RBCs per high-power field (HPF) and can be detected by dipstick. A false-positive dipstick for hematuria (where no RBCs are seen on urine microscopy) may occur when myoglobinuria is present, often in the setting of rhabdomyolysis. Common causes of isolated hematuria include stones, neoplasms, tuberculosis, trauma, and prostatitis. Gross hematuria with blood clots usually is not an intrinsic renal process; rather, it suggests a postrenal source in the urinary collecting system. Evaluation of patients presenting with microscopic hematuria is outlined in Fig. 61-2. A single urinalysis with hematuria is common and can result from menstruation, viral illness, allergy, exercise, or mild trauma. Persistent or significant hematuria (>3 RBCs/ HPF on three urinalyses, a single urinalysis with >100 RBCs, or gross hematuria) is associated with"

            "content": "The diagnosis of a UTI is confirmed by a positive urine culture, but this does not distinguish between upper tract andlower tract infection. Localization of a UTI is importantbecause upper UTI is associated more frequently with bacteremia and with anatomic abnormalities than is uncomplicated cystitis. The clinical manifestations of UTI do notreliably distinguish the site of infection in neonates, infants,and toddlers. Fever and abdominal pain may occur with either lower or upper UTI, although high fever, costovertebral tenderness, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leukocytosis, and bacteremia each suggest upper tract involvement.DMSA scan is sensitive for detecting acute pyelonephritisbut not commonly used."

He has hypertension, and during the last 8 years, he has been adequately managed with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH\u2019s problem? What information would you gather to confirm your diagnosis? What treatment steps would you initiate?"
