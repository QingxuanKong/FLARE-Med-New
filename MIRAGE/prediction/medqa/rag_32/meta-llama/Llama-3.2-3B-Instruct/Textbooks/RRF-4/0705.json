    "question": "A 35-year-old woman arrives to the clinic complaining of progressive urinary leakage that has occurred for the past 1 year. At first, she would notice leakage only during athletic exercise, but now the incontinence occurs even when she laughs or coughs. The patient states that she goes to the bathroom more frequently to try to prevent \u201cwetting myself.\u201d She wakes up once a night to urinate. She denies dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The patient has bipolar syndrome and takes lithium. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 years ago and a cesarean section 4 years ago. She has had no other surgeries. She drinks at least 6 glasses of water a day but may drink more on days she goes for a long run. She also has a large coffee in the morning and another coffee mid-day if she \u201cneeds to focus.\u201d The patient denies tobacco, alcohol, and other recreational drug use. Pelvic examination and speculum examination are unremarkable. When that patient is asked to Valsalva, leakage of urine is observed. A urinalysis, including specific gravity, is within normal limits. A beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with progressive urinary leakage that occurs even at rest, not just during athletic exercise or coughing. This suggests that the leakage is not due to physical stress on the bladder or urethra. The patient also wakes up once a night to urinate, which indicates nocturia. The patient's urine analysis and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin are normal, ruling out infection, pregnancy, or other obvious medical conditions. The patient's history of bipolar syndrome and lithium use is also not directly related to her urinary symptoms. The Valsalva maneuver, which increases abdominal pressure, causes urine leakage, suggesting a problem with bladder capacity or bladder muscle control. This suggests a condition such as overactive bladder syndrome, which is characterized by urinary urgency and frequency, often accompanied by nocturia. The patient's symptoms are consistent with overactive bladder syndrome, which is a common cause of urinary incontinence in women, especially those with a history of stress incontinence, as in this case. The patient's symptoms of urinary urgency, frequency, and nocturia, along with the presence of urinary incontinence, are all consistent with overactive bladder syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

It is essential to keep the patient\u2019s chief symptom at the forefront to avoid inappropriate management. Consider, for example, a woman whose chief concern is that once a month, while leading a business seminar, she has a sudden, overwhelming urge to void followed by complete bladder emptying. She finds this leakage devastating and is considering quitting her job because of her acute embarrassment. On occasion, she leaks a few drops of urine during exercise, but this minor leakage does not bother her. During the evaluation, urodynamics reveal minimal stress"

Most women have experienced these symptoms during times of voluntary delays in voiding or increased \ufb02uid intake. However, urinary urgency implies more than just the feeling that all normal women have if they voluntarily delay voiding beyond a reasonable time (8). When a woman presents for treatment, she generally reports an intrusive, bothersome, persistent need to urinate that takes her attention away from other activities. Increased daytime frequency is often brought up as an issue when a woman experiences a change in her own voiding pattern."

It is often referred to as OAB-dry when women with these symptoms do not leak urine, and OAB-wet when it is accompanied by incontinence. It is important to note that a woman with severe urgency and a sense of impending leakage who remains dry may have the exact same bladder pathology as one with severe urgency and concomitant leakage. A woman with a strong urethral sphincteric mechanism may be able to avoid leakage during uninhibited bladder contractions, and although one with a strong sphincter may remain dry, she still may be disturbed by the urgency and impending sense of leakage."

In addition, serum quantitative b-hCG testing is appropriate for evaluation of suspected ectopic pregnancy, gestational trophoblastic dis-ease, or ovarian mass in a young woman. In the case of ectopic pregnancy, serial levels are required when a pregnancy cannot be identified in the uterine cavity by imaging.

What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age. A 35-year-old woman visited her family practitioner because she had a \u201cbloating\u201d feeling and an increase in abdominal girth. The family practitioner examined the lower abdomen, which revealed a mass that extended from the superior pubic rami to the level of the umbilicus. The superior margin of the mass was easily palpated, but the inferior margin appeared to be less well defined. This patient has a pelvic mass. When examining a patient in the supine position, the observer should uncover the whole of the abdomen."

In this sense, measurement of a patient\u2019s voided urine volume and catheterization to determine her PVR volume are urodynamic studies. A frequency/volume chart is also a valuable urodynamic study. Obtaining clinically valuable information does not always require the use of expensive, complex technology. After basic testing, further testing is recommended in the following circumstances: the diagnosis is uncertain (for example, because of major discrepancies between the history, the voiding diary, and symptom scales); surgery is being considered; an elevated PVR volume, a neurologic condition that may complicate treatment (such as multiple sclerosis), marked pelvic organ prolapse, or numerous prior surgical attempts at correction. Bladder and kidney imaging should be considered if the patient has hematuria in the absence of an infection. Current"

Focused History: Ten days ago, CR had her spleen removed following a bicycle accident in which she fractured her tibial eminence, necessitating immobilization of the right knee. She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."

She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future.

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease.

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."
