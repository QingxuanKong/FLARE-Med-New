During this same period she states she has been constantly thirsty and does not have the same energy levels that she once had. The patient has a past medical history of anxiety and depression and is currently taking fluoxetine. She was recently treated for a middle ear infection and sinusitis with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid one week ago. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/58 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory values. The patient presents with abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, constant thirst, and decreased energy levels. These symptoms have been ongoing for weeks. The patient has a history of anxiety and depression, and she has been taking fluoxetine, which can cause gastrointestinal side effects like diarrhea. However, the presence of hypokalemia (low potassium level) and metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate level) suggests a more severe underlying condition. The laboratory values show a low potassium level, low bicarbonate level, and a high anion gap, which indicates a metabolic acidosis with an underlying metabolic acidosis. The presence of hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis suggests a condition that affects potassium absorption or excretion, or a condition that causes excessive potassium loss. The patient's symptoms and laboratory values are consistent with a diagnosis of malabsorption, specifically small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). SIBO can cause malabsorption of nutrients, leading to hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and diarrhea. The patient's history of anxiety and depression, as well as her use of fluoxetine, may also contribute to the development of SIBO. The recent treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid may have disrupted the normal gut flora, leading to the overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine and the development of SIBO. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Assessment of the patient\u2019s general appearance and vital signs, skin and soft tissue examination, and the neurologic evaluation are of particular importance. The patient may appear either anxious and agitated or lethargic and apathetic. Fever is usually present, although elderly patients and compromised hosts (e.g., patients who are uremic or cirrhotic and those who are taking glucocorticoids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be afebrile despite serious underlying infection. Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate helps determine the degree of hemodynamic and metabolic compromise.

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

The patient had noted progressive weakness over several days, to the point that he was unable to rise from bed. Past medical history was notable for small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, liver, and adrenals. The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced. Blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, increasing to 160/98 mmHg after 1 L of saline, with a JVP at 8 cm. There was generalized muscle weakness.

Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills.

Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."
