These trials are conducted in three progressive phases. Phase 1 trials are small, usually involving fewer than 100 volunteers. Their purposes are to provide a basic evaluation of safety and to identify common adverse events. Phase 2 trials, which are larger and may involve several hundred participants, collect additional information on safety and are usually designed to evaluate immunogenicity as well. Data gained from phase 2 trials can be used to determine the composition of the vaccine, the number of doses required, and a profile of common adverse events. Vaccines that appear promising are evaluated in phase 3 trials, which typically involve several hundred to several thousand volunteers and are generally designed to demonstrate vaccine efficacy and provide additional information on vaccine"

In addition to the effectiveness in controlling the functional hormonal state, long-acting somatostatin analogues such as octreotide and lanreotide are increasingly used for their antiproliferative effects. Whereas somatostatin analogues rarely decrease tumor size (i.e., 0\u201317%), these drugs have tumoristatic effects, stopping additional growth in 26\u201395% of patients with NETs. In a randomized, double-blind study in patients with metastatic midgut carcinoids (PROMID study) octreotide-LAR demonstrated a marked lengthening of time to progression (14.3 vs 6 months, p = .000072). This improvement was seen in patients with limited liver involvement. This study did not assess whether such treatment will extend survival.

A reasonable consideration in a disease with high rates of distant metastases is to begin with adjuvant chemotherapy, followed by radiation therapy in patients who do not progress, particularly in patients where there may be increased concern about local recurrence such as in patients with close margins.Remarkable results in adjuvant therapy were reported by the Virginia Mason Clinic with combination 5-FU, cisplatinum, interferon-\u3008, and external beam radiation.367 Although the toxic-ity was high (42% hospitalized for GI toxicity), the promising results prompted larger confirmatory studies. Unfortunately, one such study was stopped due to toxicity, and this protocol has not been widely adopted.

Thereafter, doses are tapered as rapidly as the clinical situation permits, usually to a maintenance dose ranging from 5 to 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day. Most patients with an episode of severe SLE require many years of maintenance therapy with low-dose glucocorticoids, which can be increased to prevent or treat disease flares. Frequent attempts to gradually reduce the glucocorticoid requirement are recommended because virtually everyone develops important adverse effects (Table 378-5). High-quality clinical studies regarding initiating therapy for severe, active SLE with IV pulses of high-dose glucocorticoids are not available. Most recent clinical trials in lupus nephritis have initiated therapy with high-dose IV glucocorticoid pulses (500\u20131000 mg daily for 3\u20135 days).

Furthermore, the addition of irinotecan to 5-FU and leucovorin (LV) (e.g., FOLFIRI) improves response rates and survival of patients with metastatic disease. The FOLFIRI regimen is as follows: irinotecan, 180 mg/m2 as a 90-min infusion on day 1; LV, 400 mg/m2 as a 2-h infusion during irinotecan administration; immediately followed by 5-FU bolus, 400 mg/m2, and 46-h continuous infusion of 2.4\u20133 g/m2 every 2 weeks. Diarrhea is the major side effect from irinotecan. Oxaliplatin, a platinum analogue, also improves the response rate when added to 5-FU and LV (FOLFOX) as initial treatment of patients with metastatic disease. The FOLFOX regimen is as follows: 2-h infusion of LV (400 mg/m2 per day) followed by a 5-FU bolus (400 mg/m2 per day) and 22-h infusion (1200 mg/m2) every 2 weeks, together with oxaliplatin, 85 mg/m2 as a 2-h infusion on"
