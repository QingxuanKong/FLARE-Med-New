Her last pap smear at age 22 showed no intraepithelial lesions nor malignancy of the cervical cells. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 4 days. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with one male partner. Her father died of colon cancer at the age of 75 years and her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40 years. She mentions that she is planning a backpacking trip through Europe in 2 months. Her routine immunizations are all up-to-date. Her temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.5\u00b0F) and her blood pressure is 94/58 mm Hg. Pelvic and speculum examination show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the best recommendation for the patient at this time?",

She is sexually active with one male partner and is planning a backpacking trip through Europe in 2 months. The patient's temperature and blood pressure are within normal limits, and the pelvic and speculum examination show no abnormalities. Given her age, sexual activity, and upcoming travel, the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is a concern. However, the patient has no previous cervical abnormalities and is not showing any symptoms of STIs. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that women between the ages of 21 and 29 years undergo screening for STIs every 3 years. Since the patient is planning a trip to Europe, it is recommended to screen for STIs before traveling to minimize the risk of acquiring an infection. The best option is to screen for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

In 2007 the American Cancer Society issued a set of clinical guidelines that remain relevant to the use of these agents (40). Under these guidelines, routine HPV vaccination is recommended for girls at 11 to 12 years of age, but may be provided as early as 9 years and as late as 18 years. For young women between the ages of 19 to 26, there are insufficient data to determine the value of universal vaccination. A decision to vaccinate a woman in that age group should be based on an informed discussion with her health care provider regarding her risk of previous HPV exposure and potential benefit and harm from the vaccination (41\u201344). Screening practices for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer should remain unchanged in both vaccinated and unvaccinated women."

The ages defining primary amenorrhea were decreased by 1 year to continue to represent two standard deviations above the mean age of developing secondary sexual characteristics and menses (1). Failure to begin breast development by age 13 warrants investigation. A woman who previously menstruated can develop secondary amenorrhea, which is defined as absence of menstruation for three normal menstrual cycles (2).

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

The diagnosis of IBS is usually based on history and physical examination, and although suggestive, especially in young women, the findings are not specific. A CBC, thyroid function study, stool sample to test for white cells and occult blood, and sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy or barium enema are usually required, particularly in older individuals and in young individuals who have not responded to initial treatment. The results of these studies are all normal in patients with IBS."

About 90% of women with endometrial carcinoma have vaginal bleeding or discharge as their only presenting symptom. Most women recognize the importance of this symptom and seek medical consultation within 3 months. Some women experience pelvic pressure or discomfort indicative of uterine enlargement or extrauterine disease spread. Bleeding may not have occurred because of cervical stenosis, especially in older patients, and may be associated with hematometra or pyometra, causing a purulent vaginal discharge. This finding is often associated with a poor prognosis (69). Less than 5% of women diagnosed with endometrial cancer are asymptomatic. In the absence of symptoms, endometrial cancer usually is detected as the result of investigation of abnormal Pap test results, discovery of cancer in a uterus"
