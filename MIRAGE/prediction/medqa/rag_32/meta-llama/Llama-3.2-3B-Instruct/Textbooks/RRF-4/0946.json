    "question": "A 49-year-old man comes to the physician because he has had multiple falls and multiple episodes of dizziness over the past 6 weeks. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. He drinks one pint of rum daily. He works as a foreman in a factory that produces industrial solvents. He is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. His temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.1\u00b0F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 108/70 mm Hg. Examination shows a wide-based gait. The patient is unable to stand with his feet together without support. There is a coarse tremor of the hands when he is asked to grab a pen. Muscle strength and tone are normal in all extremities. Sensation to pain, vibration, and position is intact bilaterally. Rapid alternating movements of the hands is impaired. Mental status examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",

He has no personal or family history of serious illness and consumes one pint of rum daily. Examination findings include a wide-based gait, inability to stand with feet together without support, coarse tremor of the hands, and impaired rapid alternating movements of the hands. \\n\\nThe key features that point towards the correct diagnosis are the wide-based gait, inability to stand with feet together without support, and impaired rapid alternating movements of the hands. These symptoms are characteristic of ataxia, which is a lack of muscle coordination which can affect speech, eye movements, and the ability to swallow, walk and perform other physical tasks. \\n\\nThe patient's history of alcohol consumption also raises the suspicion of Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is a condition caused by thiamine deficiency often seen in chronic alcoholics. Wernicke's encephalopathy is characterized by the triad of ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and confusion. However, the patient's mental status examination shows no abnormalities, making this diagnosis less likely. \\n\\nThe other options are less likely: Korsakoff syndrome is a condition characterized by memory loss and confabulation, which is not mentioned in the case. Methanol poisoning would present with more severe symptoms such as visual disturbances, abdominal pain, and cardiovascular instability, which are not present in this case. Cerebellar degeneration would present with more prominent ataxia and coordination problems, but the patient's gait and tremors are more suggestive of a different underlying pathology.\\n\\nGiven the combination of ataxia, impaired rapid alternating movements, and the patient's history of alcohol consumption, Wernicke's encephalopathy is the most likely cause of this patient's condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}}",

Alcohol intoxication is the most common cause of acute walking difficulty. Chronic toxicity from medications and metabolic disturbances can impair motor function and gait. Mental status changes may be found, and examination may reveal asterixis or myoclonus. Static equilibrium is disturbed, and such patients are easily thrown off balance. Disequilibrium is particularly evident in patients with chronic renal disease and those with hepatic failure, in whom asterixis may impair postural support. Sedative drugs, especially neuroleptics and long-acting benzodiazepines, affect postural control and increase the risk for falls. These disorders are especially important to recognize because they are often treatable."

He was recently incarcerated near Bakersfield, California and returned to Oakland about 3 months ago. He is currently experiencing one month of severe headache and double vision. He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

            "content": "CSPN is a diagnosis of exclusion, established after a careful medical, family, and social history; neurologic examination; and directed laboratory testing. Despite extensive evaluation, the cause of polyneuropathy in as many as 50% of all patients is idiopathic. CSPN should be considered a distinct diagnostic subset of peripheral neuropathy. The onset of CSPN is predominantly in the sixth and seventh decades. Patients complain of distal numbness, tingling, and often burning pain that invariably begins in the feet and may eventually involve the fingers and hands. Patients exhibit a distal sensory loss to pinprick, touch, and vibration in the toes and feet, and occasionally in the fingers. It is uncommon to see significant proprioception deficits, even though patients may complain of gait unsteadiness. However, tandem gait may be abnormal in a minority of cases. Neither subjective nor objective evidence of weakness is a prominent feature. Most patients have evidence of both largeand"

Extensor plantar responses (with normal tone in trunk and extremities), absence of deep tendon reflexes, and weakness (greater distally than proximally) are usually found. Loss of vibratory and proprioceptive sensation occurs. The median age of death is 35 years. Women have a significantly better prognosis than men. Cardiac involvement occurs in 90% of patients. Cardiomegaly, symmetric hypertrophy, murmurs, and conduction defects are reported. Moderate mental retardation or psychiatric syndromes are present in a small percentage of patients. A high incidence of diabetes mellitus (20%) is found and is associated with insulin resistance and pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction. Musculoskeletal deformities are common and include pes cavus, pes equinovarus, and scoliosis. MRI of the spinal cord shows atrophy (Fig. 450-2)."

One must attempt to learn precisely how each symptom began and progressed. Often the nature of the disease process can be decided from these data alone, such as the typical sudden onset of stroke. If such information cannot be supplied by the patient or his family, it may be necessary to judge the course of the illness by what the patient was able to do at different times (e.g., how far he could walk, when he could no longer negotiate stairs or carry on his usual work) or by changes in the clinical findings between successive examinations. 3."

Another unusual disorder affecting the body position during walking is camptocormia, a severe forward bending of the trunk at the waist that is symptomatic of either a dystonia, Parkinson disease, or one of several muscle diseases that focally weaken the extensors of the spine. Kyphosis due to spinal deformities does the same and all of these conditions cause the patient to walk while looking at the ground beneath the feet, but they rarely cause falling.

One of our patients, a large man, fell repeatedly, wrecking household furniture as he went down, yet careful examination provided no clue as to the basic defect in this \u201ctoppling\u201d phenomenon. Along with the oculomotor and balance disorders, there is a gradual stiffening and extension of the neck (in one of our patients it was sharply flexed in a manner consistent with camptocormia) but this is not an invariable finding. The face acquires a staring, \u201cworried\u201d expression with a furrowed brow (a result of the tonic contraction of the procerus muscle), made more striking by the paucity of eye movements. A number of our patients have displayed mild dystonic postures of a hand or foot, especially as the illness advanced but occasionally early on. The limbs may be slightly stiff and there are Babinski signs in a few cases."

            "content": "In the late established phase of the disease, now seldom seen, ataxia is the most prominent feature. A Romberg sign is grossly manifest. The patient totters and staggers while standing and walking. In mild form, it is best seen as the patient walks between obstacles or along a straight line, turns suddenly, or halts. To correct the instability, the patient places his feet and legs wide apart, flexes his body slightly, and repeatedly contracts the extensor muscles of his feet as he sways (la danse des tendons). In moving forward, the patient flings his stiffened leg abruptly, and the foot strikes the floor with a resounding thump in a manner quite unlike that seen in the ataxia of cerebellar disease. The patient clatters along in this way with eyes glued to the floor. If his vision is blocked, he is rendered helpless. When the ataxia is severe, walking becomes impossible despite relatively normal strength of the leg muscles."
