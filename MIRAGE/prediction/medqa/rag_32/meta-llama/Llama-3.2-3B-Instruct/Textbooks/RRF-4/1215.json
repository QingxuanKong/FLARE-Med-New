    "question": "A 58-year-old woman presents to the office for routine follow-up. She recently underwent routine screening for bone density due to a history of hypothyroidism. She also has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that is being treated with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) and more recently with a histamine2 receptor antagonist (H2RA), hypertension being treated with a thiazide diuretic, depression being treated with lithium, and hormone replacement therapy. Her results meet the criteria for osteopenia, with a T-score of -1.6. She is concerned about progressive bone loss and the risk of fractures. Which of the following medication classes should be discontinued?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has osteopenia with a T-score of -1.6, which indicates a moderate risk of fractures. The patient is taking a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), thiazide diuretic, lithium, and hormone replacement therapy. We need to evaluate which medication class should be discontinued to reduce the risk of fractures and promote bone health.\\n\\nFirst, let's consider the PPI. While PPIs can increase the risk of fractures, the evidence is not as strong as it is for some other medications. The effect of PPIs on bone density is still being studied, and some studies suggest that they may not significantly increase the risk of fractures.\\n\\nNext, let's consider the thiazide diuretics. Thiazide diuretics can decrease bone density and increase the risk of fractures, particularly in older adults. However, the risk is generally considered to be moderate, and the benefits of continuing the medication for hypertension may outweigh the risks.\\n\\nLithium can also affect bone health, but the evidence is not as strong as it is for some other medications. Lithium can decrease bone density, particularly in women, but the risk of fractures is still considered to be moderate.\\n\\nFinally, let's consider hormone replacement therapy (HRT). HRT can have both positive and negative effects on bone density, depending on the type and duration of treatment. However, HRT is generally considered to be safe for women with osteopenia, and the benefits of HRT may outweigh the risks.\\n\\nBased on the current evidence, the medication class that should be discontinued is the thiazide diuretic. Thiazide diuretics are known to decrease bone density and increase the risk of fractures, making them a potential contributor to the patient's osteopenia. Discontinuing the thiazide diuretic may help to reduce the risk of fractures and promote bone health.\\n\\nAnswer: B\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The current recommendation is that patients who show mild disease, as defined by specific criteria (Table 424-2), can be safely followed under management guidelines (Table 424-3).

Patients may present with multiple signs and symptoms, including recurrent nephrolithiasis, peptic ulcers, mental changes, and, less frequently, extensive bone resorption. However, with greater awareness of the disease and wider use of multiphasic screening tests, including measurements of blood calcium, the diagnosis is frequently made in patients who have no symptoms and minimal, if any, signs of the disease other than hypercalcemia and elevated levels of PTH. The manifestations may be subtle, and the disease may have a benign course for many years or a lifetime. This milder form of the disease is usually termed asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism. Rarely,"

Her vital signs include the following: temperature 99.8\u00b0F, blood pressure 132/64 mm Hg, pulse 78 bpm, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, she had left upper abdominal tenderness with evidence of hepatomegaly and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory data revealed the following: alanine aminotransferase, 527 IU/L (normal 10\u201335 IU/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 425 IU/L (normal < 35 IU/L); and bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL (normal 0.1\u20130.3 mg/dL).

KH, a 55-year-old woman, presents to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and complaints of new-onset flu symptoms over the past several days.

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

Gastrin levels will thus be high in patients using antisecretory agents for the treatment of acid peptic disorders and dyspepsia. H. pylori infection can also cause hypergastrinemia. Additional causes of elevated gastrin include retained gastric antrum; G cell hyperplasia; gastric outlet obstruction; renal insufficiency; massive small-bowel obstruction; and conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, vitiligo, diabetes mellitus, and pheochromocytoma. Although a fasting gastrin >10 times normal is highly suggestive of ZES, two-thirds of patients will have fasting gastrin levels that overlap with levels found in the more common disorders outlined above, especially if a PPI is being taken by the patient. The effect of the PPI on gastrin levels and acid secretion will linger several days after stopping the PPI; therefore, it"

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

Age <50 years was predic-tive of progression, and patients undergoing parathyroidectomy showed not only normalization of calcium and PTH levels but also improved BMD at the spine and hip. Based on these and other studies, the guidelines were reassessed at a second work-shop on asymptomatic PHPT held at the National Institutes of Health in 2002.76Since that time, additional studies have provided further insights into the natural history of treated and untreated HPT. Three of these were randomized, controlled, prospective studies ranging in duration from 1 to 3.5 years. One was an observa-tional study (a continuation of the Columbia University PHPT Project) but was notable for its long duration of follow-up of 15 years.77 These studies confirmed the relative stability of vari-ous biochemical indices, thus validating the need for guidelines.
