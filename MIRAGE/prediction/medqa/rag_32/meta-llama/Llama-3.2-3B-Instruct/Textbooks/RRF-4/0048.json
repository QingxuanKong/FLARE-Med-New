Her last ultrasound at 22 weeks' gestation was normal. On admission, fetal heartbeats cannot be detected by fetal doppler monitor. Ultrasound shows decreased amniotic fluid levels and no evidence of fetal movement, respiration, or heart activity. The patient gives birth to a 2296 g (5 lb 1 oz) male infant.

The patient is a 29-year-old primigravid woman at 35 weeks' gestation who has been admitted to the hospital in labor. The ultrasound shows decreased amniotic fluid levels and no evidence of fetal movement, respiration, or heart activity. The patient gives birth to a stillborn infant weighing 2296 g (5 lb 1 oz) with no visible malformations. The placenta is unremarkable. The most appropriate next step in management involves considering the cause of stillbirth and the need for further investigation to determine the underlying cause of the stillbirth. This may involve obtaining consent for parental genetic testing to identify any potential genetic abnormalities that may have contributed to the stillbirth. However, it is essential to consider the possibility of a non-genetic cause, such as a placental abruption or umbilical cord prolapse, which may require further investigation and management. The other options, such as performing karyotyping of amniotic fluid, recommending autopsy of the infant, or obtaining photographs, x-ray imaging, and MRI, may be considered later in the process but are not the most appropriate next step in management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Asking the patient when the baby first moved and if she is currently experiencing movement of the fetus is important. Determining fetal age is key for consider-ations of viability. Gestational age may be estimated by noting fundal height, with the fundus approximating the umbilicus at 20 weeks and the costal margin at 40 weeks. Discrepancy in dates and size may be due to uterine rupture or hemorrhage.Initial evaluation for abdominopelvic trauma in pregnant patients should proceed in the standard manner. Ultrasound (FAST)"

            "content": "Instruments incorporating Doppler ultrasound are often used to easily detect fetal heart action, and in the absence of maternal obesity, heart sounds are almost always detectable by 10 weeks with such instruments (Chap. 10, p. 213). he fetal heart rate ranges from 11e0 to 160 beats per minute and is typically heard as a double sound. Using a standard nonampliied stethoscope, the fetal heart is audible by 20 weeks in 80 percent of women, and by 22 weeks, heart sounds are expected to be heard in all (Herbert, 1987). Because the fetus moves freely in amni onic fluid, the site on the maternal abdomen where fetal heart sounds can be heard best will vary. Additionally, with ultrasonic auscultation, one may hear the unic soule, which is a sharp, whistling sound that is syn chronous with the fetal pulse. It is caused by the rush of blood through the umbilical arteries and may not be heard consistently."

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative."

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

            "content": "While we do not have the answers, we describe our strategies from Parkland Hospital as one approach to management. Our policies were developed in conjunction with the Division of Neonatal Medicine. Importantly, the decision not to perform cesarean delivery does not necessarily imply that care for the fetus is discounted. Neonatologists are consulted before delivery, and a trilateral discussion of survival and morbidity rates ensues with the woman and her family. A neonatologist attends each delivery and determines subsequent management. In our institution, traditional fetal indications for cesarean delivery are practiced in women at 25\u00b0/7 weeks or beyond. Cesarean delivery is not ofered for fetal indications before 24\u00b0/7 weeks. At 240r weeks, cesarean delivery is not ofered unless fetal weight is estimated at 750 g or greater. Aggressive obstetrical management is practiced in cases of growth restriction, wherein gestational age is used to guide management rather than fetal size."

            "content": "a second induction is performed within 3 days. lmost all women are delivered using this management plan, but in the unusual few who are not delivered, management decisions involve a third-or even more-induction versus cesarean delivery. Women classiied as having uncertain postterm pregnancies are managed with weekly nonstress fetal testing and assessment ofamnionic luid volume. Women with an AFI ;5 cm or with reports ofdiminished fetal movement undergo labor induction."
