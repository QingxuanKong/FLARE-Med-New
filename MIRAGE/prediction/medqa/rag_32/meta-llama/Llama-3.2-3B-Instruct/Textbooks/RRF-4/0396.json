She has not had any changes in diet or lifestyle but reports weight loss despite an increase in appetite. In addition, she has been experiencing chest palpitations, increased frequency of diarrhea, and heat intolerance. Physical exam of her thyroid is unremarkable but her TSH was found to be 0.21 mIU/L. A complex structure in her right ovary was detected on ultrasound. Her symptoms can be explained by which of the following?",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms such as weight loss despite increased appetite, chest palpitations, increased frequency of diarrhea, and heat intolerance, which are classic signs of hyperthyroidism. The low TSH level of 0.21 mIU/L further supports this diagnosis. The presence of a complex structure in her right ovary on ultrasound is a key finding that points towards a thyroid-related ovarian tumor. The options can be evaluated as follows: A. Meigs syndrome is a rare condition characterized by a benign ovarian tumor, ascites, and pleural effusion, which does not match the patient's symptoms. B. Jod-Basedow phenomenon is a rare condition where thyroid hormone production is stimulated by iodine, leading to hyperthyroidism, but it is not directly related to an ovarian tumor. C. Dermoid cyst is a type of ovarian tumor, but it is typically benign and does not cause hyperthyroidism. D. Struma ovarii is a rare type of ovarian tumor that is composed of thyroid tissue and can produce thyroid hormones, leading to hyperthyroidism. Given the patient's symptoms and the presence of a thyroid-related ovarian tumor on ultrasound, the most likely diagnosis is Struma ovarii.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg.

            "content": "The incidence of hypothyroidism is approximately 1% in the adult population, and 5% in adults older than 50 years (154). In women older than 60 years, the incidence of hypothyroidism may approach 6% (168). Hypothyroidism is 10 times more common in women than in men (154). Many such cases are secondary to previous antithyroid therapy (radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy) for hyperthyroidism. The most common primary cause of hypothyroidism is Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition (154). A history of lethargy, cold intolerance, lassitude, weight gain, \ufb02uid retention, constipation, dry skin, hoarseness, periorbital edema, and brittle hair can be indicative of inadequate thyroid function. In this setting, physical findings of increased relaxation phase of deep tendon re\ufb02exes, cardiomegaly, pleural or pericardial effusions, or peripheral edema should stimulate further investigation of thyroid function by assessment of TSH and free T4 levels. Hypothyroidism decreases cardiac"

The patient had no significant adverse effects from this dosage. At age 21, she had a second tonic-clonic seizure while in college; further discussion with her room-mate at that time revealed a history of two recent episodes of 1\u20132 minutes of altered consciousness with lip smacking (focal impaired awareness seizure, formerly complex partial seizure). A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid. Four days later, electroencephalography (EEG)"

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

            "content": "Physical Examination The physical examination should include measurements of vital signs and examination of the abdomen and pelvis. Frequently, the findings before rupture and hemorrhage are nonspecific, and vital signs are normal. The abdomen may be nontender or mildly tender, with or without rebound. The uterus may be slightly enlarged, with findings similar to a normal pregnancy (103,104). Cervical motion tenderness may or may not be present. An adnexal mass may be palpable in up to 50% of cases, but the mass varies markedly in size, consistency, and tenderness. A palpable mass may be the corpus luteum and not the ectopic pregnancy. With rupture and intra-abdominal hemorrhage, the patient develops tachycardia followed by hypotension. Bowel sounds are decreased or absent. The abdomen is distended, with marked tenderness and rebound tenderness. Cervical motion tenderness is present. Frequently, the findings of the pelvic examination are inadequate because of pain and guarding."

Increased sympathetic activity and hypermetabolism result in weight loss despite increased appetite. Gastrointestinal: Stimulation of the gut results in rapid transit time (hypermotility), which can cause fat malabsorption and steatorrhea.

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

            "content": "The patient gave no history of these disorders. Upon further questioning, however, the patient revealed that her last menstrual period was 6 weeks before this examination. The senior physician realized that a potential cause of the abdominal pain was a pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). The patient was rushed for an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed no fetus or sac in the uterus. She was also noted to have a positive pregnancy test. The patient underwent surgery and was found to have a ruptured fallopian tube caused by an ectopic pregnancy. Whenever a patient has apparent pelvic pain, it is important to consider the gender-related anatomical differences. Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age."
