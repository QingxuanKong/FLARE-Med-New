    "question": "A 48-year-old female presents with an enlargement of her anterior neck which made swallowing very difficult for 2 weeks now. She has had constipation for the past 6 weeks and overall fatigue. She also had heavy menstrual bleeding; and often feels extremely cold at home. On the other hand, she has well-controlled asthma and spring allergies. On examination, the thyroid is stony hard, tender and asymmetrically enlarged. There is also pain associated with swallowing. Laboratory studies show a serum T4 level of 4.4 \u03bcg/dL and a TSH level of 6.3 mU/L. A radionuclide thyroid scanning indicates that the nodule has low radioactive iodine uptake. Which of the following is the most likely pathology to be found in this patient?",

The radionuclide thyroid scanning indicates low radioactive iodine uptake. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of thyroiditis. The patient's symptoms of constipation, fatigue, and heavy menstrual bleeding may also be related to hypothyroidism. Reidel thyroiditis is a type of chronic thyroiditis characterized by a hard and fixed thyroid gland, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. It is also known to cause low radioactive iodine uptake on radionuclide thyroid scanning. Therefore, the most likely pathology to be found in this patient is Reidel thyroiditis.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

After injection of radioactive iodine, most adenomas take up iodine less avidly than normal thyroid parenchyma. On radionuclide scanning, therefore, adenomas appear as cold nodules relative to the adjacent normal thyroid gland. Toxic adenomas, however, appear as warm or hot nodules in the scan. As many as 10% of cold nodules eventually prove to be malignant. By contrast, malignancy is uncommon in hot nodules. Essential techniques used in the preoperative evaluation of suspected adenomas are ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration biopsy.

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

The majority of these are related to cell damage caused by smoking and alcohol use. Certain viruses are also related to cancers in the head and neck, including human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). A 50-year-old overweight woman came to the doctor complaining of hoarseness of voice and noisy breathing. She was also concerned at the increase in size of her neck. On examination she had a slow pulse rate (45 beats per minute). She also had an irregular knobby mass in the anterior aspect of the lower neck, which deviated the trachea to the right. A clinical diagnosis of a multinodular goiter and hypothyroidism was made."

A TSH level should be measured to exclude subclinical hyperor hypothyroidism, but thyroid function is usually normal. Tracheal deviation is common, but compression must usually exceed 70% of the tracheal diameter before there is significant airway compromise. Pulmonary function testing can be used to assess the functional effects of compression, which characteristically causes inspiratory stridor. CT or MRI can be used to evaluate the anatomy of the goiter and the extent of substernal extension or tracheal narrowing. A barium swallow may reveal the extent of esophageal compression. The risk of malignancy in MNG is similar to that in solitary nodules. Ultrasonography can be used to identify which nodules should be"

Patients with MTC may complain of a dull, aching sensation. A history of hoarseness is worrisome, as it may be secondary to malignant involvement of the RLNs. Most impor-tantly, patients should be questioned regarding risk factors for malignancy, such as exposure to ionizing radiation and family history of thyroid and other malignancies associated with thy-roid cancer.External-Beam Radiation Low-dose therapeutic radiation has been used to treat conditions such as tinea capitis (6.5 cGy), thymic enlargement (100 to 400 cGy), enlarged tonsils and adenoids (750 cGy), acne vulgaris (200 to 1500 cGy), and other conditions such as hemangioma and scrofula. Radiation (approximately 4000 cGy) is also an integral part of the manage-ment of patients with Hodgkin\u2019s disease. It is now known that a history of exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation to"

Assessment by speech lan-guage pathology and a dietician is often beneficial to ascertain swallowing function and nutritional intake, respectively. Some patients require dilation or reinsertion of a gastrostomy tube if they develop pharyngeal strictures and are unable to maintain their weight. The history should be followed with a thorough head and neck examination, including fiberoptic nasolaryg-noscopy, because of the significant risk of developing a sec-ond primary in the upper aerodigestive tract.93 Patients should have their thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) checked once a year, especially in those that have radiation as they may develop hypothyroidism at an earlier age than the general population. Shoulder dysfunction after neck dissection with extensive accessory nerve dissection or in patients who have had a scapu-lar system free flap should be managed with physiotherapy to minimize the long-term effects and improve function."

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

MNG typically develops over many years and is detected on routine physical examination, when an individual notices an enlargement in the neck, or as an incidental finding on imaging. If the goiter is large enough, it can ultimately lead to compressive symptoms including difficulty swallowing, respiratory distress (tracheal compression), or plethora (venous congestion), but these symptoms are uncommon. Symptomatic MNGs are usually extraordinarily large and/or develop fibrotic areas that cause compression. Sudden pain in an MNG is usually caused by hemorrhage into a nodule but should raise the possibility of invasive malignancy. Hoarseness, reflecting laryngeal nerve involvement, also suggests malignancy."
