He reports that he has a 15-year history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. He is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. Neurological examination shows decreased sensation to light pinprick and temperature on the right side of the face and body. Motor strength is 5/5 and deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally.

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To solve this question, we must first analyze the symptoms and then relate them to the potential brain structures involved. Step 1: Identify the symptoms - Sudden-onset right-sided body numbness - Decreased sensation to light pinprick and temperature on the right side of the face and body Step 2: Analyze the symptoms - The patient has decreased sensation on one side of the body, which suggests a lesion affecting the sensory pathways. - The numbness is limited to one side of the face and body, indicating a contralateral lesion in the brain. Step 3: Relate symptoms to brain structures - The posterior limb of the internal capsule is a critical structure for transmitting sensory information from the body to the brain. - The lateral medulla is involved in the transmission of sensory information, but it is not as directly related to the symptoms as the posterior limb of the internal capsule. - The basal pons is involved in the transmission of sensory information, but it is not as directly related to the symptoms as the posterior limb of the internal capsule. - The ventral thalamus is involved in the transmission of sensory information, but it is not as directly related to the symptoms as the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Step 4: Determine the most likely affected structure - Based on the symptoms and analysis, the posterior limb of the internal capsule is the most likely affected structure.

The peripheral neuropathy is due to axonal degeneration (rather than demyelinization) and primarily affects motor neurons. Significant neuropathy does not occur with all acute attacks; abdominal symptoms are usually more prominent. Motor neuropathy affects the proximal muscles initially, more often in the shoulders and arms. The course and degree of involvement are variable and sometimes may be focal and involve cranial nerves. Deep tendon reflexes initially may be normal or hyperactive but become decreased or absent as the neuropathy advances. Sensory changes such as paresthesia and loss of sensation are less prominent. Progression to respiratory and bulbar paralysis and death occurs especially when the diagnosis and treatment are delayed. Sudden death may result from sympathetic overactivity and cardiac arrhythmia."

Stated another way, coma generally cannot be attributed to elevated ICP alone. Only when ICP exceeds 40 to 50 mm Hg does cerebral blood flow diminish to a degree that results in loss of consciousness. Further elevations are followed imminently by global ischemia and brain death. From our own observations, the brain shift and herniation that causes the pupil to dilate on the side of a mass lesion generally occurs at an ICP of 28 to 34 mm Hg. (Again, this is not a direct effect of the elevated ICP.) There are instances in which the dissociation between ICP and clinical signs is striking, for example, a mass in the medial temporal lobe that is contiguous to the third nerve will compress the nerve at a time when ICP is little raised, and slowly growing lesions, which raise ICP slowly and allow for"

He has a family history of hypertension, and his father died of a myocardial infarction at age 55. Physical examination is remarkable only for moderate obesity. Total cholesterol is 220, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level is 40 mg/dL. Fasting glucose is 105 mg/dL. Chest X-ray is normal. Electrocardiogram shows left ven-tricular enlargement.

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

A cooperative patient may, if asked to use a pin or his fingertips, outline an analgesic or anesthetic area or determine whether there is a graduated loss of sensation in the distal parts of a leg or arm. Finally, the findings of the sensory examination should be accurately recorded in narrative or on a chart by shading affected regions on a preprinted figure of the body or a sketch of a hand, foot, face, or limb."

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."

Hypotension and fainting after tilting for this duration, a positive test, as already emphasized, is taken as a proclivity to neurocardiogenic fainting and at least an ostensible explanation for the problem. However, because it occurs in a proportion of individuals who have never fainted; it is not to be taken as incontrovertible evidence that a recent spell is explained by this mechanism. Although controversial, in some circumstances the infusion of the catecholamine isoproterenol (1 to 5 mcg/min for 30 min during head-up tilt) may be a more effective means of producing hypotension (and syncope) than the standard tilt test alone (Almquist et al; Waxman et al). While it brings out more cases of neurocardiogenic syncope, some of these are false"

Therefore, patients and their family members should be counseled to call emergency medical services immediately if they experience or witness the sudden onset of any of the following: loss of sensory and/or motor function on one side of the body (nearly 85% of ischemic stroke patients have hemiparesis); change in vision, gait, or ability to speak or understand; or a sudden, severe headache. Other causes of sudden-onset neurologic symptoms that may mimic stroke include seizure, intracranial tumor, migraine, and metabolic encephalopathy. An adequate history from an observer that no convulsive activity occurred at the onset usually excludes seizure, although ongoing complex partial seizures without tonic-clonic activity can on occasion mimic stroke. Tumors may present"
