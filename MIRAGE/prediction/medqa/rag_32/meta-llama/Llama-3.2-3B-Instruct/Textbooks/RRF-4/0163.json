The lumbar puncture shows elevated opening pressure and a high WBC count with a predominance of lymphocytes. The pathogen isolated from the CSF can be cultured on Sabouraud agar, suggesting a fungal etiology. Given the patient's HIV status, the most likely cause of his meningitis is cryptococcal meningitis. The characteristic CSF abnormalities in cryptococcal meningitis include a lymphocytic pleocytosis, increased protein concentration, and decreased glucose concentration. The presence of eosinophils in the CSF is also common in cryptococcal meningitis. The patient's symptoms and CSF findings are consistent with cryptococcal meningitis, which is a serious and potentially life-threatening infection in HIV-positive individuals.

            "content": "The CSF (including those lacking other manifestations of HIV) may be normal or show only a slight elevation of protein content and, less frequently, a mild lymphocytosis. HIV can be isolated from the CSF. In the CT scan there is widening of the sulci and enlargement of the ventricles; MRI may show patchy but confluent or diffuse white matter changes with ill-defined margins and generally displays cerebral atrophy (Fig. 32-2). These findings are useful in diagnosis, although CMV infection of the brain in HIV produces a similar MRI appearance, as described in the following text."

            "content": "aseptic meningitis and encepHalitis In children and young adults, enteroviruses are the cause of up to 90% of cases of aseptic meningitis in which an etiologic agent can be identified. Patients with aseptic meningitis typically present with an acute onset of fever, chills, headache, photophobia, and pain on eye movement. Nausea and vomiting also are common. Examination reveals meningismus without localizing neurologic signs; drowsiness or irritability may also be apparent. In some cases, a febrile illness may be reported that remits but returns several days later in conjunction with signs of meningitis. Other systemic manifestations may provide clues to an enteroviral cause, including diarrhea, myalgias, rash, pleurodynia, myocarditis, and herpangina. Examination of the CSF invariably reveals pleocytosis; the CSF cell count shows a shift from neutrophil to lymphocyte predominance within 1 day of presentation, and the total cell count does not exceed 1000/\u03bcL. The CSF glucose level is"

            "content": "Analysis of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Assessment of CSF is critical for patients with suspected meningitis or encephalitis. An opening pressure should always be recorded, and fluid should routinely be sent for cell counts, Gram\u2019s stain and culture, and determination of glucose and protein levels. A CSF Gram\u2019s stain typically requires >105 bacteria/mL for reliable positivity; its specificity approaches 100%. Table 144-4 lists the typical CSF profiles for various infections. In general, CSF with a lymphocytic pleocytosis and a low glucose concentration suggests either infection (e.g., with Listeria,"

            "content": "In respect to the first two categories, parameningeal and partially treated bacterial infections, smoldering paranasal sinusitis or mastoiditis may produce a CSF picture of aseptic meningitis because of epidural or subdural extension into the intracranial compartments; it is infrequent that the entire syndrome of meningitis is present. Uncomplicated sinusitis alone does not cause a meningeal reaction. Antibiotic therapy given for a systemic or pulmonary infection may suppress a bacterial meningitis to the point where mononuclear cells predominate, glucose is near normal, and organisms cannot be cultured from the CSF although they may still be evident by Gram stain. Careful attention to the history of recent antimicrobial therapy permits recognition of these cases."

There may be eosinophils in the CSF in C. immitis meningitis. Large volumes of CSF are often required to demonstrate the organism on India ink smear or grow the organism in culture. If spinal fluid examined by LP on two separate occasions fails to yield an organism, CSF should be obtained by high-cervical or cisternal puncture."
