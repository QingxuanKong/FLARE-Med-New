    "question": "A 28-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 20 weeks' gestation comes to the physician with her husband for a prenatal visit. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. They are planning to travel to Ethiopia next month to visit the husband's family. Medications include folic acid and an iron supplement. Vital signs are within the normal range.

The patient is at 20 weeks' gestation and has an uncomplicated pregnancy. Mefloquine is the only drug advised for pregnant women traveling to areas with drug-resistant malaria, and it is generally considered safe in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Chloroquine and proguanil are regarded as safe, but the patient is traveling to Ethiopia, where chloroquine resistance is common. Doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy due to the risk of inhibiting bone growth and tooth discoloration in the fetus. Proguanil is often used in combination with chloroquine, but it is not a suitable option for this patient due to the high risk of chloroquine resistance in Ethiopia. Therefore, the most suitable drug for pre-exposure prophylaxis against malaria in this patient is mefloquine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Monitor weight gain, with a goal of approximately 25 to 35elb in women with a normal BMI. 4. Explore food intake by dietary recall periodically to discover the occasional nutritionally errant diet. 5. Give tablets of simple iron salts that provide at least 27 mg of elemental iron daily. Give folate supplementation before and in the early weeks of pregnancy. Provide iodine supplementation in areas of known dietary insuiciency. 6.

Fetal distress, premature labor, and stillbirth or low birth weight are common results. Fetal death is usual in severe malaria. Congenital malaria occurs in <5% of newborns whose mothers are infected; its frequency and the level of parasitemia are related directly to the parasite density in maternal blood and in the placenta. P. vivax malaria in pregnancy is also associated with a reduction in birth weight (average, 110 g), but, in contrast to the situation in falciparum malaria, this effect is more pronounced in multigravid than in primigravid women. About 350,000 women die in childbirth yearly, with most deaths occurring in low-income countries; maternal death from hemorrhage at childbirth is correlated with malaria-induced anemia."

In nonimmune individuals with acute malaria, the spleen takes several days to become palpable, but splenic enlargement is found in a high proportion of otherwise healthy individuals in malaria-endemic areas and reflects repeated infections. Slight enlargement of the liver is also common, particularly among young children. Mild jaundice is common among adults; it may develop in patients with otherwise uncomplicated malaria and usually resolves over 1\u20133 weeks. Malaria is not associated with a rash like those seen in meningococcal septicemia, typhus, enteric fever, viral exanthems, and drug reactions. Petechial hemorrhages in the skin or mucous membranes\u2014features of viral hemorrhagic fevers and leptospirosis\u2014 develop only very rarely in severe falciparum malaria."

Such vaccines are also contraindicated in pregnant women owing to a theoretical risk of maternal-fetal transmission."

            "content": "Usually, the neurologic symptoms appear in the second or third week of the infection, but they may be the initial manifestation. Children in hyperendemic regions are the ones most susceptible to cerebral malaria. Among adults in nonenedmic areas, only pregnant women and nonimmune individuals who discontinue prophylactic medication are liable to CNS involvement (Toro and Roman). Useful laboratory findings are anemia and parasitized red blood cells. The CSF may be under increased pressure and sometimes contains a few white blood cells, and the glucose content is normal. With Plasmodium vivax infections, there may be drowsiness, confusion, and seizures without invasion of the brain by the parasite."

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

General medical problems such as diabetes, heart failure, severe anemia, or a history of thromboembolic disease also should prompt the pregnant woman to postpone her travels. Finally, regions in which the pregnant woman and her fetus may be at excessive risk (e.g., those at high altitudes, those where live-virus vaccines are required, and those where multidrug-resistant malaria is endemic) are not ideal destinations during any trimester."
