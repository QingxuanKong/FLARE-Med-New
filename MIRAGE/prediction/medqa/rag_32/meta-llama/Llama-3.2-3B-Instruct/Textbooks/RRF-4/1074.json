    "question": "A 24-year-old man with chronic back pain comes to the physician to establish care after moving to Florida. He complains of anxiety, nausea, abdominal cramping, vomiting, and diarrhea for three days. He denies smoking, drinking alcohol, and using illicit drugs. He appears restless. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 150/86 mm Hg. Physical examination shows dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and piloerection. His abdominal exam shows diffuse mild tenderness. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding. His hemoglobin concentration is 14.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 8,000/mm, and platelet count is 250,000/mm3; serum studies and urinalysis show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Lorazepam",
        "B": "Naltrexone",
        "C": "Methadone",
        "D": "Naloxone\n\""
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. The patient presents with symptoms of anxiety, nausea, abdominal cramping, vomiting, and diarrhea, which have been ongoing for three days. 2. The patient denies any history of substance abuse, but the symptoms of anxiety, dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and piloerection are suggestive of opioid withdrawal. 3. The physical examination shows diffuse mild tenderness in the abdomen, but no rebound tenderness or guarding, which is consistent with opioid withdrawal. 4. The laboratory results show a normal hemoglobin concentration, leukocyte count, and platelet count, but the patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia (110/min) and hypertension (150/86 mmHg), which are also consistent with opioid withdrawal. 5. Based on the symptoms and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is opioid withdrawal. Now, let's evaluate the treatment options: A. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine, which is not the first-line treatment for opioid withdrawal. B. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that is typically used to treat opioid addiction, not to treat withdrawal symptoms. C. Methadone is an opioid agonist that is used to treat opioid addiction, not to treat withdrawal symptoms. D. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that is used to rapidly reverse opioid overdose, which is the most appropriate treatment for opioid withdrawal. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and the most appropriate treatment is an opioid antagonist to reverse the withdrawal symptoms. Naloxone is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Chest pain is more common in adults, and abdominal pain is more common in children. Paroxysms of severe, knifelike pain usually last 15\u201330 min and are associated with diaphoresis and tachypnea. Fever peaks within an hour after the onset of paroxysms and subsides when pain resolves. The involved muscles are tender to palpation, and a pleural rub may be detected. The white blood cell count and chest x-ray results are usually normal. Most cases are due to coxsackievirus B and occur during epidemics. Symptoms resolve in a few days, and recurrences are rare. Treatment includes the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or the application of heat to the affected muscles."
