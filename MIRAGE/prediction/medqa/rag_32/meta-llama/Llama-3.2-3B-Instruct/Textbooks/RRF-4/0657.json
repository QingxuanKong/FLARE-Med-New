    "question": "A 62-year-old man presents with episodes of palpitations for the past 3 weeks. He says that he has episodes where he feels his heart is \u2018racing and pounding\u2019, lasting 1\u20132 hours on average. Initially, he says the episodes would happen 1\u20132 times per week but now happen almost every day. This last episode has been constant for the past 2 days. He denies any seizure, loss of consciousness, dizziness, chest pain, or similar symptoms in the past. His past medical history is significant for an ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery 1 month ago, status post intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with still some residual neurologic impairment, and long-standing gastroesophageal reflux secondary to a hiatal hernia, managed medically. The patient reports a 15-pack-year smoking history, but no alcohol or recreational drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, pulse 105/min, and respiratory rate 16/min. On physical examination, muscle strength in the lower extremities is 4/5 on the left and 5/5 on the right, along with sensory loss on the left, all of which is improved from his previous exam 3 weeks ago. There is a loss of the left half of the visual field bilaterally which is stable from the previous exam. Cardiac examination is significant for a new-onset irregular rate and rhythm. No rubs, thrills or murmurs. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan shows evidence of an area of infarction in the vicinity of the right anterior cerebral artery showing normal interval change with no evidence of new hemorrhage or expansion of the area of infarction. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed, which is shown in the exhibit (see image below). Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to best prevent future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) in this patient?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate intervention to prevent future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) in this patient, we need to analyze the patient's medical history, physical examination findings, and test results. The patient has a history of ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery 1 month ago, which is a significant risk factor for future CVAs. The patient is currently experiencing palpitations, tachycardia, and a new-onset irregular rate and rhythm, which may be related to the previous stroke. The ECG results show evidence of atrial fibrillation, which is a significant risk factor for stroke and CVA. The patient's physical examination findings, including sensory loss on the left side and loss of the left half of the visual field, are consistent with previous strokes. The noncontrast CT scan shows evidence of an area of infarction in the vicinity of the right anterior cerebral artery, which is consistent with the patient's history of stroke. Given these findings, the most appropriate intervention to prevent future CVAs is to initiate anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolism. The options for anticoagulation therapy include warfarin and heparin, but the most appropriate choice is warfarin due to its efficacy and safety profile in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke. Aspirin and clopidogrel are antiplatelet agents that may be used in addition to anticoagulation therapy, but they are not sufficient alone to prevent stroke in this patient. Carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure that may be considered in patients with significant carotid stenosis, but it is not indicated in this patient based on the available information. Therefore, the best choice is to begin warfarin therapy to prevent future CVAs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

A 60-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department with acute right-sided weakness, predominantly in the upper limb, which lasted for 24 hours. She made an uneventful recovery, but was extremely concerned about the nature of her illness and went to see her local doctor. A diagnosis of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) was made. A TIA is a neurological deficit resolving within 24 hours. It is a type of stroke. Neurological deficits may be permanent or transient. Most transient events resolve within 21 days; any failure of resolution beyond 21 days is an established stroke. An investigation into the cause of the TIA was undertaken. Eighty-five percent of all strokes result from cerebral infarction, of which most are due to embolization. A duplex Doppler scan of the carotid vessels was performed."

In patients with anterior wall infarction, an abnormal systolic pulsation caused by dyskinetic bulging of infarcted myocardium may develop in the periapical area within the first days of the illness and then may resolve. Other physical signs of ventricular dysfunction include fourth and third heart sounds, decreased intensity of the first heart sound, and paradoxical splitting of the second heart sound (Chap. 267). A transient midsystolic or late systolic apical systolic murmur due to dysfunction of the mitral valve apparatus may be present. A pericardial friction rub may be heard in patients with transmural STEMI at some time in the course of the disease, if they are examined frequently. The carotid pulse is often decreased in volume, reflecting reduced stroke volume. Temperature elevations up to 38\u00b0C may be observed during the first week after STEMI. The arterial pressure is variable; in most"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Interestingly, the height of the patient and the previous lens surgery would suggest a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and a series of blood tests and review of the family history revealed this was so. A 35-year-old male patient presented to his family practitioner because of recent weight loss (14 lb over the previous 2 months). He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets."

He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day.

Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination?

They can be triggered by any stimulus that decreases systemic vascular resistance, such as fever, agitation, or vigorous physical activity. Cyanotic spells increase in severity and frequency as the child grows, and older patients with uncorrected TOF may often squat, which increases peripheral vascular resistance and relieves the cyanosis.Evaluation in the older patient with TOF may demonstrate clubbing, polycythemia, hemoptysis, or brain abscesses. Chest radiography will demonstrate a boot-shaped heart (Fig. 20-55), and EKG will show the normal pattern of right ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography confirms the diagnosis because it demonstrates the position and nature of the VSD, defines the character of the RVOT obstruction, and often visualizes the branch pulmonary arteries and the proximal coronary arteries. Cardiac catheterization is rarely necessary and is actually risky in TOF since it can create spasm of the RVOT muscle and result in"

Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging (right picture), however, did not show any enhancement to indicate any infarction in the anteroseptal wall, suggesting that the hypocontractile and hypoperfused anteroseptal wall was viable.
