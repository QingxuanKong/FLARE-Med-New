Hydroxyurea is a medication commonly used to treat sickle cell anemia, and its mechanism of action involves increasing fetal hemoglobin (HgbF) production. This increase in HgbF levels can help reduce the frequency and severity of sickle cell crises in patients with sickle cell anemia. Let's evaluate each option: A. Decreases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin - This is incorrect because hydroxyurea does not directly decrease the oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin. B. Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF) - This is correct because hydroxyurea is known to increase HgbF production, which can help alleviate symptoms of sickle cell anemia. C. Decreases levels of HgbS - This is incorrect because hydroxyurea does not directly decrease HgbS levels. D. Decreases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF) - This is incorrect because hydroxyurea actually increases HgbF levels, not decreases them.

Some patients remain virtually asymptomatic into or even through adult life, while others suffer repeated crises requiring hospitalization from early childhood. Patients with sickle thalassemia and sickle-HbE tend to have similar, slightly milder symptoms, perhaps because of the ameliorating effects of production of other hemoglobins within the RBC. Hemoglobin SC disease, one of the more common variants of sickle cell anemia, is frequently marked by lesser degrees of hemolytic anemia and a greater propensity for the development of retinopathy and aseptic necrosis of bones. In most respects, however, the clinical manifestations resemble sickle cell anemia. Some rare hemoglobin variants actually aggravate the sickling phenomenon."

In sickle cell trait, sickling can be induced in vitro by exposing cells to marked hypoxia. The diagnosis is confirmed by electrophoretic demonstration of HbS. Prenatal diagnosis of sickle cell anemia can be performed by analyzing fetal DNA obtained by amniocentesis or biopsy of chorionic villi. The clinical course of sickle cell disease is highly variable. As a result of improvements in supportive care, an increasing number of patients are surviving into adulthood. Approximately 50% of patients now survive beyond the fifth decade. Of particular importance is prophylactic treatment with penicillin to prevent pneumococcal infections, especially in children younger than age 5."

            "content": "Sickle Cell Disease Sickle cell disease is caused by a single-point mutation in the gene that encodes the -globin chain of hemoglobin A. The result of this mutation is an abnormal -globin chain in which the amino acid valine is substituted for glutamic acid in position 6. Hemoglobin containing this abnormal -globin chain is designated sickle hemoglobin (HbS). The substitution of the hydrophobic valine for the hydrophilic glutamic acid causes HbS to aggregate under conditions of reduced oxygen tension. Instead of the normal biconcave disc shape, many of the erythrocytes become sickle-shaped at low oxygen tension, hence the name of this disease (Fig. F10.3.1). Sickled erythrocytes are more rigid than normal cells and adhere more readily to the endothelial surface. Thus, sickled erythrocytes may pile up in the smallest capillaries, depriving portions of tissues and organs of oxygen and nutrients. Large-vessel obstruction may also occur, which in children frequently leads to stroke."

HbS differs from HbA by having a valine residue instead of a glutamate residue at the 6th amino acid position in \u03b2-globin. On deoxygenation HbS molecules undergo a conformational change that allows polymers to form via intermolecular contacts involving the abnormal valine residue.

Because HbA greatly retards HbS polymerization, the red cells of HbS heterozygotes have little tendency to sickle in vivo. Such persons are said to have sickle cell trait. Similarly, because fetal hemoglobin (HbF) interacts weakly with HbS, newborns with sickle cell anemia do not manifest the disease until HbF falls to adult levels, generally around the age of 5 to 6 months.

It is considered as a third-line therapy after failure of steroids or anti-CD20 antibody administration.39Hemoglobinopathies. Sickle cell disease is an inherited chronic hemolytic anemia that results from the mutant sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS) within the red blood cell and is inher-ited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Persons who inherit an HbS gene from one parent (heterozygous) are carriers; those who inherit an HbS gene from both parents (homozygous) have sickle cell anemia.40In sickle cell disease, the underlying abnormality is the mutation of adenine to"

Sickle cell anemia is characterized by lifelong episodes of pain (\u201ccrises\u201d), chronic hemolytic anemia with associated hyperbilirubinemia (see p. 284), and increased susceptibility to infections, usually beginning in infancy. [Note: The lifetime of a RBC in sickle cell anemia is <20 days, compared with 120 days for normal RBC, hence, the anemia.] Other symptoms include acute chest syndrome, stroke, splenic and renal dysfunction, and bone changes due to marrow hyperplasia. Life expectancy is reduced. Heterozygotes, representing 1 in 12 African Americans, have one normal and one sickle cell gene. The blood cells of such heterozygotes contain both HbS and HbA, and these individuals have sickle cell trait. They usually do not show clinical symptoms (but may under conditions of extreme physical exertion with dehydration) and can have a normal life span."

            "content": "HPFH is characterized by continued synthesis of high levels of HbF in adult life. No deleterious effects are apparent, even when all of the hemoglobin produced is HbF. These rare patients demonstrate convincingly that prevention or reversal of the fetal to adult hemoglobin switch would provide effective therapy for sickle cell anemia and \u03b2 thalassemia. The two most important acquired hemoglobinopathies are carbon monoxide poisoning and methemoglobinemia (see above). Carbon monoxide has a higher affinity for hemoglobin than does oxygen; it can replace oxygen and diminish O2 delivery. Chronic elevation of carboxyhemoglobin levels to 10 or 15%, as occurs in smokers, can lead to secondary polycythemia. Carboxyhemoglobin is cherry red in color and masks the development of cyanosis usually associated with poor O2 delivery to tissues."

Acidosis decreases the solubility of HbS. B. Acidosis increases the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin. C. Acidosis favors the conversion of hemoglobin from the taut to the relaxed conformation. D. Acidosis shifts the oxygen-dissociation curve to the left. E. Acidosis decreases the ability of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate to bind to hemoglobin. Correct answer = A. HbS is significantly less soluble in the deoxygenated form, compared with oxyhemoglobin S. Decreased pH (acidosis) causes the oxygen-dissociation curve to shift to the right, indicating decreased oxygen affinity (increased delivery). This favors the formation of the deoxy, or taut, form of hemoglobin and can precipitate a sickle cell crisis. The binding of 2,3bisphosphoglycerate is increased, because it binds only to the deoxy form of hemoglobin."

It consists of two and two chains (22). \u0081 Hemoglobin HbF accounts for less than 1% of total hemoglobin in adults. It contains two and two chains (22) and is the principal form of hemoglobin in the fetus. HbF production falls dramatically after birth; however, in some individuals HbF is produced throughout their entire lives. Although HbF persists in slightly higher percentages than normal in those with sickle cell disease and thalassemia, it does not appear to have a pathologic role. Mutations in the genes encoding the globin chains can cause disorders in hemoglobin production. An example of a mutation in the gene encoding hemoglobin is discussed in the Folder 10.3. Interestingly, more than 550 types of abnormal hemoglobin molecules have been identified, but the majority of them have no clinical significance. \u0081 FOLDER 10.2 Clinical Correlation: Hemoglobin in Patients with Diabetes"
