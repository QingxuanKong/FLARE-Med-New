    "question": "A 43-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her brother for severe chest pain. The patient recently lost her husband in a car accident and is still extremely shocked by the event. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 105/67 mm Hg, the heart rate is 96/min and regular, breathing rate is 23/min, and the pulse oximetry is 96%. An S3 heart sound and rales in the lower right and left lung lobes are heard. A 12-lead ECG shows no significant findings. Echocardiography shows an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium. The patient is stabilized and informed about the diagnosis and possible treatment options. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the patient's presentation and the provided documents: 1. The patient is a 43-year-old woman who recently experienced a traumatic event, the loss of her husband in a car accident, which is a significant emotional stressor. 2. She presents with severe chest pain, an S3 heart sound, and rales in the lower lung lobes, which suggests fluid accumulation in the lungs. 3. The patient's blood pressure is 105/67 mmHg, which is slightly low, but not indicative of hypotension. 4. The heart rate is 96/min and regular, which is a relatively normal rate. 5. The ECG shows no significant findings, which makes it less likely to be related to arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation. 6. Echocardiography shows an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium, which could be related to various conditions, including cardiac stress, myocardial infarction, or cardiomyopathy. Given the recent traumatic event and the presence of an S3 heart sound, rales, and an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium on echocardiography, the most likely diagnosis is Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as broken heart syndrome. This condition is a form of stress cardiomyopathy that occurs in response to intense emotional or psychological stress, such as the loss of a loved one. The other options are less likely: A. Atrial fibrillation is unlikely given the lack of significant ECG findings and the presence of an S3 heart sound, which is more characteristic of ventricular dysfunction. B. Constrictive pericarditis is unlikely given the absence of pericardial signs and the presence of an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium. D. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is unlikely given the patient's presentation and the echocardiography findings, which do not suggest a restrictive pattern. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."

Symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, neurologic, or pulmonary disease help focus the differential diagnosis, as do findings relevant to the jugular venous pressure and waveforms, the arterial pulses, other heart sounds, the lungs, the abdomen, the skin, and the extremities. In many instances, laboratory studies, an ECG, and/or a chest x-ray may have been obtained earlier and may contain valuable information. A patient with suspected infective endocarditis, for example, may have a murmur in the setting of fever, chills, anorexia, fatigue, dyspnea, splenomegaly, petechiae, and positive blood cultures. A new systolic murmur in a patient with a marked fall in blood pressure after a recent MI suggests myocardial rupture.

In contrast, the physical examination in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is dominated by the findings of the precipitating condition; pulmonary findings may be relatively normal in the early stages. The chest radiograph in cardiogenic pulmonary edema typically shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette, vascular redistribution, interstitial thickening, and perihilar alveolar infiltrates; pleural effusions are common.

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a"

If the ventricular septum is intact, there may be no murmur. Children with transposition and a large VSD have improved intracardiac mixing and less cyanosis. They may present with signs of heart failure. The heart is hyperdynamic, with palpable left and right ventricular impulses. A loud VSD murmur is heard. S2 is single. ECG findings typically include right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy. The chest x-ray reveals increased pulmonary vascularity, and the cardiac shadow is classically an egg on a string created by the narrow superior mediastinum. Echocardiography shows the transposition of the great arteries, the sites and amount of mixing, and any associated lesions. Figure 144-3 Tricuspid atresia with ventricular septal defect.

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

Is the patient in pain or resting quietly, dyspneic or diaphoretic?

During the general examination, signs of anemia (pale conjunctivae), cyanosis, and cirrhosis (spider angiomata, gynecomastia) should be sought. Examination of the chest should focus on symmetry of movement; percussion (dullness is indicative of pleural effusion; hyperresonance is a sign of emphysema); and auscultation (wheezes, rhonchi, prolonged expiratory phase, and diminished breath sounds are clues to disorders of the airways; rales suggest interstitial edema or fibrosis). The cardiac examination should focus on signs of elevated right heart pressures (jugular venous distention, edema, accentuated pulmonic component to the second heart sound); left ventricular dysfunction (S3 and S4 gallops); and valvular disease (murmurs). When examining the abdomen with the patient in the supine position, the physician should note whether there is paradoxical movement of the abdomen: inward motion during inspiration is a sign of diaphragmatic"

            "content": "Palpation may reveal cardiac enlargement and abnormal contraction of the cardiac impulse (left ventricular dyskinesia). Auscultation can uncover arterial bruits, a third and/or fourth heart sound, and, if acute ischemia or previous infarction has impaired papillary muscle function, an apical systolic murmur due to mitral regurgitation. These auscultatory signs are best appreciated with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. Aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation (Chap. 283), pulmonary hypertension (Chap. 304), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Chap. 287) must be excluded, since these disorders may cause angina in the absence of coronary atherosclerosis. Examination during an anginal attack is useful, since ischemia can cause transient left ventricular failure with the appearance of a third 1582 and/or fourth heart sound, a dyskinetic cardiac apex, mitral regurgitation, and even pulmonary edema.
