Paramedics report extensive blood loss at the scene where he was found. Due to his Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, an endotracheal airway and large-bore access are secured prior to arrival. He is aggressively resuscitated with a massive transfusion protocol as the operating room is prepared for an exploratory laparotomy. An arterial line and central access are obtained. His temperature is 95\u00b0F (35\u00b0C), blood pressure is 50/40 mmHg, and pulse is 80/min, and respirations are controlled at 20/min on lung-protective volume control. After a 6:6:1 ratio of red blood cells, plasma, and platelets and the use of continuous phenylephrine infusion, the patient's vital signs remain the same. The surgical team reports no active blood loss. A stat ScvO2 results as 39% with a SaO2 of 100% on 100% oxygen. His extremities remain cold despite having the ambient room temperature increased to 80\u00b0F (26.7\u00b0C). What is the most likely cause of his presentation?",

The patient has undergone aggressive resuscitation with a massive transfusion protocol, but the vital signs remain unchanged. The stat ScvO2 results are 39% with a SaO2 of 100% on 100% oxygen, indicating hypoperfusion. The patient's extremities remain cold, suggesting poor peripheral perfusion. Given these findings, the most likely cause of the patient's presentation is hypothermia, which is a common problem in trauma patients, especially in the setting of massive transfusions and prolonged resuscitation. Hypothermia can worsen coagulopathy and provoke myocardial irritability, leading to cardiac arrest and further compromise of perfusion. The patient's cold extremities and poor ScvO2 values support this diagnosis. The other options, cardiac tamponade, cervical spinal cord transection, and pulmonary embolism, are possible causes of shock, but they do not directly explain the patient's hypothermia and poor peripheral perfusion in this context.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The infusion of large volumes of refrigerated blood products and room temperature crystalloid solutions can rapidly drop core temperatures if fluid is not run through warming devices. Hypothermia may depress cardiac contractility and thereby further impair cardiac output and oxygen delivery/utilization. Hypothermia, particularly temperatures <35\u00b0C (<95\u00b0F), directly impairs the coagulation pathway, sometimes causing a significant coagulopathy. Rapid rewarming to >35\u00b0C (>95\u00b0F) significantly decreases the requirement for blood products and produces an improvement in cardiac function.

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

Once the cycle starts, each component magnifies the other, which leads to a down-ward spiral and ultimately a fatal arrhythmia. The purpose of DCS is to limit operative time so that the patient can be returned to the SICU for physiologic restoration and the cycle thereby broken. Indications to limit the initial operation and institute DCS techniques include a combination of refractory hypother-mia (temperature <35\u00b0C), profound acidosis (arterial pH <7.2, base deficit >15 mmol/L), and refractory coagulopathy.56,77 The decision to abbreviate a trauma laparotomy is made intraopera-tively as the patient\u2019s clinical course becomes clearer and labo-ratory values become available.The goal of DCS is to control surgical bleeding and limit GI spillage.

Further examination of his left eye reveals rupture of his globe. The ophthalmolo-gist requests emergency surgery to repair and save his eye. Because the patient has suffered a recent trauma, you decide to perform a rapid sequence intubation in preparation for the surgical procedure. What muscle relaxant would you use to facilitate tracheal intubation? What is the proper dose for your chosen muscle relaxant? After intravenous infusion of your chosen muscle relaxant, you are unable to adequately visualize the patient\u2019s larynx and vocal cords and cannot successfully pass an endotracheal tube.

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

Urine output is a reliable indicator of organ perfusion but requires time to quantitate. Adequate urine output is 0.5 mL/kg per hour in an adult, 1 mL/kg per hour in a child, and 2 mL/kg per hour in an infant <1 year of age. Because measurement of this resuscitation-related vari-able is time dependent, it is generally more useful in the OR and intensive care unit (ICU) setting, than in initial evaluation in the trauma bay.There are several caveats to be considered when evaluat-ing the injured patient for shock. Tachycardia (HR >110 bpm) is often the earliest sign of ongoing blood loss, but the critical issue is change in HR over time. Individuals in good physical condition with a resting pulse rate in the 50s may manifest a relative tachycardia in the 90s; although clinically"

Once the heart is decompressed and hemodynamics are acceptable, ventilation is stopped. The oxygenator is adjusted to maintain a Pao2 of 150 mmHg and normocarbia. Blood can also be filtered and returned through vents that are placed in chambers of the heart (such as the left ventricle or pulmonary artery) or through the cardiotomy suction used to aspirate blood from the surgical field. When the cardiac procedure is complete, the patient is rewarmed, the lungs ventilated, and the heart defibrillated, if needed. The venous return to the CPB machine is gradually reduced allowing the heart to fill. The pump is also slowed while hemodynamics and global cardiac function are assessed with a TEE probe. Ino-tropic and vasopressor support may be used to augment cardiac function and treat hypotension. Once CPB has been weaned and stable hemodynamics achieved, the cannulae are removed. The heparin"

To remember the Glasgow Coma Scale, think 4-eyes, Jackson-5, V6 engine. Four points can be assigned for eye response, five points for verbal response, and six points for motor response. Patients with chest trauma and shock may have cardiac tamponade. The relevant signs are JVD, hypotension, and muf\ufb02ed heart sounds. This can be diagnosed with bedside ultrasound. If tamponade is diagnosed, an immediate pericardiocentesis is necessary. Disability/Exposure: Disability (CNS dysfunction) is assessed and quantified with the GCS. Exposure requires that the patient be completely disrobed and assessed for injury and temperature status on both the front and back of the body. Hypothermia is a common problem in trauma and can worsen bleeding; once the exam is done, the patient should be covered with warm blankets."

Thus, patients undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) upon arrival to the ED should undergo RT selectively based on injury and duration of CPR (Fig. 7-11). RT is best accomplished using a generous left anterolateral thoracotomy, with the skin incision started to the right of the sternum (Fig. 7-12). A longitudinal peri-cardiotomy anterior to the phrenic nerve is used to release cardiac tamponade and permits access to the heart for cardiac repair and open cardiac massage. The cardiac wound should be repaired prior to vigorous efforts of myocardial resuscitation (e.g., epinephrine, calcium). Cross-clamping of the aorta improves central circula-tion, augments cerebral and coronary blood flow, and limits further abdominal blood loss (Fig. 7-13). The patient must sustain a SBP of 70 mmHg after RT and associated interventions to be considered"
