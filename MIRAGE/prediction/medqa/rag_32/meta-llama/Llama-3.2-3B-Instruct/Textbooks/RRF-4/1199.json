    "question": "An 89-year-old woman sees her neurologist for a follow-up evaluation. Three months ago, she presented with complaints about facial asymmetry. Her daughter has noticed that her mother\u2019s mouth is droops downwards on the right side of her face and that she cannot close her right eye well. The same side also lacks wrinkles on the forehead. Since then, the patient feels like her facial muscles have gotten weaker. She was given a course of corticosteroids, but she has still not recovered fully. Upon being asked to close her eyes, the patient has difficulty doing so and fails to completely close her eyelids. On examination, there is no loss of pain, temperature, or crude or tactile touch sensations in the whole face. The neurological exam is otherwise unremarkable. This patient also has type 2 diabetes mellitus which is well controlled with metformin. The neurologist recommends a therapy that will help relieve her symptoms. Which of the following is the most likely treatment option being prescribed to this patient?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of facial asymmetry, drooping eyelid, and inability to close the eye on one side, along with the lack of pain, temperature, or crude or tactile touch sensations in the face, suggest a peripheral facial nerve palsy. This condition is commonly known as Bell's palsy. The patient's facial weakness is likely due to inflammation or compression of the facial nerve. Given that the patient has not fully recovered after a course of corticosteroids, it is likely that the condition is a form of recurrent or chronic Bell's palsy. The most effective treatment option for Bell's palsy is botulinum toxin, which is used to temporarily paralyze the facial muscles and improve muscle function. Botox is a type of botulinum toxin that is commonly used for this purpose. The other options are not suitable for this condition: carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant, methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid, and ceftriaxone is an antibiotic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

However, only a few patients display this fully developed syndrome. Ptosis, diplopia, difficulty in speaking or swallowing, or weakness of the limbs is at first mild and inconstant and may be mistaken for a cerebrovascular disease. However, the finding that sustained activity of small cranial muscles results in weakness (e.g., increasing droop of eyelids while looking at the ceiling or diplopia when fixating in lateral or vertical gaze or reading for 2 to 3 min) and that contraction improves after a brief rest is virtually diagnostic, even in the early stages of the disease. Any other affected group of muscles may be tested in similar fashion. The characteristic ocular signs"

            "content": "responses and accommodation are normal. As the patient attempts to raise his eyelids and to see under them, the head is thrown back and the frontalis muscle is contracted, wrinkling the forehead (hutchinsonian facies). The eyelids are abnormally thin due to atrophy of the levator muscles. The orbicularis oculi muscles are frequently involved in addition to the extraocular muscles. Thus, in PEO, as in myasthenia gravis and myotonic dystrophy, there can be a characteristic combination of weakness of eye closure and eye opening, a combination that is nearly always myopathic. Other facial muscles, masseters, sternocleidomastoids, deltoids, or peronei are variably weak and wasted in approximately 25 percent of cases. The characteristic feature of PEO is that ptosis and ocular paralysis precede involvement of other muscles by many years."

Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

Second, subtle CNS abnormalities are best detected by carefully comparing a patient\u2019s performance on tasks that require simultaneous activation of both cerebral hemispheres (e.g., eliciting a pronator drift of an outstretched arm with the eyes closed; extinction on one side of bilaterally applied light touch, also with eyes closed; or decreased arm swing or a slight asymmetry when walking). Third, if the patient\u2019s complaint is brought on by some activity, reproduce the activity in the office. If the complaint is of dizziness when the head is turned in one direction, have the patient do this and also look for associated signs on examination (e.g., nystagmus or dysmetria).

            "content": "Over the following week the paralysis improved and was likely due to nerve bruising during the procedure. The patient remained asymptomatic. A 60-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department with acute right-sided weakness, predominantly in the upper limb, which lasted for 24 hours. She made an uneventful recovery, but was extremely concerned about the nature of her illness and went to see her local doctor. A diagnosis of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) was made. A TIA is a neurological deficit resolving within 24 hours. It is a type of stroke. Neurological deficits may be permanent or transient. Most transient events resolve within 21 days; any failure of resolution beyond 21 days is an established stroke. An investigation into the cause of the TIA was undertaken. Eighty-five percent of all strokes result from cerebral infarction, of which most are due to embolization. A duplex Doppler scan of the carotid vessels was performed."

One of our patients, a large man, fell repeatedly, wrecking household furniture as he went down, yet careful examination provided no clue as to the basic defect in this \u201ctoppling\u201d phenomenon. Along with the oculomotor and balance disorders, there is a gradual stiffening and extension of the neck (in one of our patients it was sharply flexed in a manner consistent with camptocormia) but this is not an invariable finding. The face acquires a staring, \u201cworried\u201d expression with a furrowed brow (a result of the tonic contraction of the procerus muscle), made more striking by the paucity of eye movements. A number of our patients have displayed mild dystonic postures of a hand or foot, especially as the illness advanced but occasionally early on. The limbs may be slightly stiff and there are Babinski signs in a few cases."

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

She became convinced that her roommate was listening in on her phone conversations and planning to alter her essays. She became reclusive and spent most of her time locked in her room. After much difficulty, her teachers convinced her to be seen by the student health service. It was believed she was beginning to show signs of schizophrenia and she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where she was started on antipsychotic medications. While in the hospital, she had a generalized seizure which prompted her transfer to our service. Her spinal fluid analysis showed 10 lymphocytes per mL3. She was found to have an anti-NMDA receptor antibody, which prompted an ultrasound examination of the pelvis. The left ovary was thought to show a benign cyst. Because of the neurological syndrome, the ovarian cyst was resected and revealed a microscopic ovarian teratoma. The neuropsychiatric syndrome resolved. She has since graduated and"

Look in particular for differences in the lower versus upper facial muscles; weakness of the lower two-thirds of the face with preservation of the upper third suggests an upper motor neuron lesion, whereas weakness of an entire side suggests a lower motor neuron lesion. CN VIII (Vestibulocochlear) Check the patient\u2019s ability to hear a finger rub or whispered voice with each ear. Further testing for air versus mastoid bone conduction (Rinne) and lateralization of a 512-Hz tuning fork placed at the center of the forehead (Weber) should be done if an abnormality is detected by history or examination. Any suspected problem should be followed up with formal audiometry. For further discussion of assessing vestibular nerve function in the setting of dizziness, hearing loss, or coma, see Chaps. 28, 43, and 328, respectively."

At older, cooperative ages, children can be asked to smile, blow out their cheeks, blink forcibly, and furrow their foreheads. Weakness of all unilateral muscles of the face, including the forehead, eye, and mouth, indicates a lesion of the ipsilateral peripheral facial nerve (Bell palsy).Because the upper third of the face receives bilateral cortical innervation, if the weakness affects only the lower face and mouth, a contralateral lesion of upper motor neuron in the brain (tumor, stroke, abscess) must be considered."
