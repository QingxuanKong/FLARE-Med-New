    "question": "A 38-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, obesity, and hyperlipidemia presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of new bilateral blisters on her hands. She says that she first noticed these blisters shortly after returning from a weekend trip to the beach two weeks prior. She denies any fevers, joint pains, or other skin rash during this period. The patient works in the adult entertainment industry. On examination, there are multiple flaccid blisters of the bilateral dorsal hands with hemorrhagic crusts, mild scarring, and hyperpigmentation. In addition, increased hair growth is noted on the bilateral malar cheeks. Her temperature is 99.1\u00b0 F (37.3\u00b0 C), pulse is 95/min, blood pressure is 130/87 mmHg, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Her laboratory results are:\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 140 mEq/L\nK+: 4.5 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 21 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.1 mg/dL\nGlucose: 104 mg/dL\n\nLeukocyte count: 9,000/mm^3\nHemoglobin: 12.4 g/dL\nPlatelets: 400,000/mm^3\n\nAnti-nuclear antibody titer 1:320\n\nWhich of the following would confirm the diagnosis in this patient?",

She also has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), obesity, and hyperlipidemia. The presence of flaccid blisters on the dorsal hands with hemorrhagic crusts, mild scarring, and hyperpigmentation, as well as increased hair growth on the bilateral malar cheeks, is suggestive of bullous pemphigoid, a condition that can be associated with SLE. The laboratory results show an elevated anti-nuclear antibody titer, which is consistent with SLE. To confirm the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid, we need to look for autoantibodies that target the skin. Anti-hemidesmosome titers are a specific marker for bullous pemphigoid. Therefore, checking anti-hemidesome titers would confirm the diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

Skin lesions may appear typically as palpable purpura; however, other cutaneous manifestations of the vasculitis may occur, including macules, papules, vesicles, bullae, subcutaneous nodules, ulcers, and recurrent or chronic urticaria. The skin lesions may be pruritic or even quite painful, with a burning or stinging sensation. Lesions most commonly occur in the lower extremities in ambulatory patients or in the sacral area in bedridden patients due to the effects of hydrostatic forces on the postcapillary venules. Edema may accompany certain lesions, and hyperpigmentation often occurs in areas of recurrent or chronic lesions. There are no specific laboratory tests diagnostic of idiopathic cutaneous vasculitis. A mild leukocytosis with or without eosinophilia is characteristic, as is an elevated ESR. Laboratory studies should be"

She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.

During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause.
