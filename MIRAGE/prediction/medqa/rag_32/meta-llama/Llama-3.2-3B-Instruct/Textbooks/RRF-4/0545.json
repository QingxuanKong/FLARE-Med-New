She describes it as a dull pain over the sides of her head. The patient is otherwise healthy and is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 97.0\u00b0F (36.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 111/74 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a severe headache associated with chewing, described as a dull pain over the sides of her head. The pain is worsened when the patient opens and closes their mouth. This symptomatology is highly suggestive of temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ). The patient's physical exam findings of pain and tenderness over the mandibular and temporal region further support this diagnosis. TMJ dysfunction is a common cause of jaw pain and can be exacerbated by chewing, opening, and closing the mouth. The other options, while possible causes of headache, do not typically present with these specific symptoms. Migraine headaches are often described as throbbing or pulsating and are not typically associated with chewing. Temporal arteritis is a serious condition that typically presents with more systemic symptoms such as fever, jaw claudication, and malaise, and is not typically associated with jaw pain that worsens with chewing. Tension headaches are often described as a band-like or pressing sensation around the head and are not typically localized to the jaw. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is temporomandibular joint dysfunction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Headache is the dominant symptom and often appears in association with malaise and muscle aches. Head pain may be unilateral or bilateral and is located temporally in 50% of patients but may involve any and all aspects of the cranium. Pain usually appears gradually over a few hours before peak intensity is reached; occasionally, it is explosive in onset. The quality of pain is only seldom throbbing; it is almost invariably described as dull and boring, with superimposed episodic stabbing pains similar to the sharp pains that appear in migraine. Most patients can recognize that the origin of their head pain is superficial, external to the skull, rather than originating deep within the cranium (the pain site for migraineurs). Scalp tenderness is present, often to a marked degree; brushing the hair or resting the head on a pillow may be impossible because of pain."

In the case of headache, a detailed history following these lines will determine the diagnosis more often than will the physical examination or imaging. Nevertheless, a few aspects of the examination are worth emphasizing. For example, auscultation of the skull may rarely disclose a bruit (with large arteriovenous malformations); palpation may disclose the tender, hardened or elevated arteries of temporal arteritis; sensitive areas overlying a cranial metastasis or an inflamed paranasal sinus may be apparent; or there may be a tender occipital nerve.

A pelvic examination is performed and is positive for muco-purulent discharge from the endocervical canal. No cervical"

            "content": "Considered by some to be a milder form of migraine headache. More common in females than in males. Hx/PE: Presents with tight, bandlike pain that is not associated with sensory phobia, nausea/vomiting, or auras and is brought on by fatigue or stress. Nonspecific symptoms (e.g., anxiety, poor concentration, difficulty sleeping) may also be seen. May be generalized or most intense in the frontal, occipital, and neck regions. Usually occurs at the end of the day. Dx: A diagnosis of exclusion. Be particularly aware of giant cell arteritis in patients > 50 years of age with new headaches; always obtain an ESR even if headaches are mild and unassociated with constitutional or vascular symptoms. There are no focal neurologic signs. Tx: Relaxation, massage, hot baths, and avoidance of exacerbating factors. NSAIDs and acetaminophen are first-line abortive therapy, but trip-tans may also be considered."

            "content": "Differential Diagnosis Trigeminal neuralgia must be distinguished from other causes of face and head pain (Chap. 21) and from pain arising from diseases of the jaw, teeth, or sinuses. Pain from migraine or cluster headache tends to be deep-seated and steady, unlike the superficial stabbing quality of trigeminal neuralgia; rarely, cluster headache is associated with trigeminal neuralgia, a syndrome known as cluster-tic. In temporal arteritis, superficial facial pain is present but is not typically shock-like, the patient frequently complains of myalgias and other systemic symptoms, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is usually present (Chap. 385). When trigeminal neuralgia develops in a young adult or is bilateral, multiple sclerosis (MS) is a key consideration, and in such cases, the cause is a demyelinating plaque near the root entry zone of the fifth nerve in the pons; often, evidence of facial sensory loss can be found on careful examination. Cases that are"

Visual blurring may occur, likely due to retinal or occipital lobe ischemia. Neck pain, typically in the suboccipital, posterior cervical, and shoulder region (the \u201ccoat-hanger headache\u201d), most likely due to neck muscle ischemia, may be the only symptom. Patients may report orthostatic dyspnea (thought to reflect ventilation-perfusion mismatch due to inadequate perfusion of ventilated lung apices) or angina (attributed to impaired myocardial perfusion even with normal coronary arteries). Symptoms may be exacerbated by exertion, prolonged standing, increased ambient temperature, or meals. Syncope is usually preceded by warning symptoms, but may occur suddenly, suggesting the possibility of a seizure or cardiac cause."

            "content": "characterized by an unheralded onset over minutes or longer of increasing hemicranial headache or, less often, by generalized headache with or without nausea and vomiting, which then follows the same temporal pattern as the migraine with aura. Sensitivity to light, noise, and often smells (photophobia, phonoor sonophobia, and osmophobia) attends both types, and intensification with movement of the head is common. If the pain is severe, the patient prefers to lie down in a quiet, darkened room and tries to sleep. The hemicranial and the throbbing (pulsating) aspects of migraine are its most characteristic features in comparison to other headache types. Each patient displays a proclivity for the pain to affect one side or the other of the cranium, but not exclusively, so that some bouts are on the other side or on both sides."

            "content": "Pain is the most common presenting complaint in patients with STEMI. The pain is deep and visceral; adjectives commonly used to 1600 describe it are heavy, squeezing, and crushing, although, occasionally, it is described as stabbing or burning (Chap. 19). It is similar in character to the discomfort of angina pectoris (Chap. 293) but commonly occurs at rest, is usually more severe, and lasts longer. Typically, the pain involves the central portion of the chest and/or the epigastrium, and, on occasion, it radiates to the arms. Less common sites of radiation include the abdomen, back, lower jaw, and neck. The frequent location of the pain beneath the xiphoid and epigastrium and the patients\u2019 denial that they may be suffering a heart attack are chiefly responsible for the common mistaken impression of indigestion. The pain of STEMI may radiate as high as the occipital area but not below the umbilicus. It is often accompanied by weakness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, and a sense"

Associated symptoms/signs: Significant findings include fever or rash (consider meningitis or other infectious causes), jaw claudication (specific for temporal arteritis), or constitutional symptoms such as weight loss (associated with neoplastic, in\ufb02ammatory, or infectious conditions). Photophobia, nausea, and vomiting are associated with migraine, aneurysmal SAH, and meningitis, but neck stiffness is more likely to accompany the latter two. Neurologic sequelae: Look for diplopia, mental status changes or associated symptoms (numbness, weakness, dizziness, ataxia, visual disturbances), papilledema, or pupillary abnormalities (partial CN III palsy or Horner\u2019s syndrome). Patient risk factors: High-risk patients are > 50 years of age, immunocompromised, or with preexisting malignancy. If SAH is suspected, obtain a head CT without contrast. If CT is , LP is mandatory. Obtain a CBC."
