    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. The patient is a 65-year-old man presenting with pain in his left thigh, described as dull and constant, worse at night. This symptomatology can be associated with various bone disorders, including osteomalacia, osteitis fibrosa cystica, and Paget's disease of bone. 2. Physical examination reveals tenderness and warmth over the anterior aspect of the left thigh, which may indicate an inflammatory or neoplastic process. 3. The plain radiograph of the left femur shows increased cortical thickness with widened intercortical space. This radiographic finding is characteristic of osteitis fibrosa cystica, a condition associated with hyperparathyroidism. 4. Laboratory studies show elevated alkaline phosphatase (925 U/L), which is a marker of bone turnover. This enzyme is also elevated in osteitis fibrosa cystica. 5. Serum calcium and phosphorus levels are within normal limits, which makes hyperparathyroidism (a common cause of osteitis fibrosa cystica) less likely. 6. The bone biopsy findings are not explicitly described, but the combination of radiographic and laboratory findings in the question points towards osteitis fibrosa cystica. 7. Osteitis fibrosa cystica is a condition characterized by the resorption of bone and the deposition of osteoid tissue, leading to cystic changes. It is associated with hyperparathyroidism, but the normal serum calcium and phosphorus levels make this less likely. 8. Ewing's sarcoma is a malignant bone tumor, which would likely present with more aggressive symptoms and radiographic findings, such as a lytic lesion or cortical destruction. 9. Osteochondritis dissecans is a joint disorder characterized by the separation of a piece of cartilage and underlying bone from the rest of the joint. It is not typically associated with the systemic symptoms and laboratory findings presented in this case. 10. Based on the analysis, the most likely diagnosis is osteitis fibrosa cystica, which is a condition associated with hyperparathyroidism. However, the normal serum calcium and phosphorus levels make this less likely. The correct answer is not explicitly listed, but the closest match is B. Osteitis deformans, which is a benign condition characterized by increased bone density and cortical thickening, similar to the radiographic findings in this case. The correct answer is not explicitly listed, but based on the information provided, osteitis deformans (B) is the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

LCPD commonly presents in patients 3 to 12 years of age, with a mean age of 7 years. It is four to five times more common in boys. Patients may not present for several weeks because of minimaldiscomfort; the classic presentation is a child with an atraumatic, painless limp.

The areas of pain correspond to dermatomes L4 to S3 nerves. Over the following weeks, the patient began to develop muscular weakness, predominantly footdrop. These findings are consistent with loss of the motor function and sensory change in the common fibular nerve, which is a branch of the sciatic nerve in the lower limb. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a mass in the posterior aspect of the right side of the pelvis.

Calcium levels can be elevated into the 3\u20133.5-mmol/L (12\u201314 mg/dL) range after the ingestion of 50,000\u2013100,000 units of vitamin A daily (10\u201320 times the minimum daily requirement). Typical features of severe hypercalcemia include fatigue, anorexia, and, in some, severe muscle and bone pain. Excess vitamin A intake is presumed to increase bone resorption. The diagnosis can be established by history and by measurement of vitamin A levels in serum. Occasionally, skeletal x-rays reveal periosteal calcifications, particularly in the hands. Withdrawal of the vitamin is usually associated with prompt disappearance of the hypercalcemia and reversal of the skeletal changes. As in vitamin D intoxication, administration of 100 mg/d of hydrocortisone or its equivalent leads to a rapid return of the serum calcium to normal."

An 11-year-old obese African-American boy presents with sudden onset of limp. Diagnosis? Workup? The most common 1\u00b0 malignant tumor of bone. Pseudogout. Polymyalgia rheumatica. Osgood-Schlatter disease. Distal radius (Colles\u2019 fracture). Avascular necrosis. Wrist drop, loss of thumb abduction. Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Developmental dysplasia of the hip. If severe, consider a Pavlik harness to maintain abduction. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis. AP and frog-leg lateral view. Multiple myeloma."

Imaging: Radionuclide bone scan is the most sensitive test. Labs: Abnormalities include \u2191 serum alkaline phosphatase with normal calcium and phosphate levels; urinary pyridinolines may be helpful. Must be differentiated from metastatic bone disease. The majority of patients are asymptomatic and require no treatment. There is no cure for Paget\u2019s disease. Bisphosphonates and calcitonin are used to slow osteoclastic bone resorption; NSAIDs and acetaminophen can be given for arthritis pain. Pathologic fractures, cardiac complications, osteosarcoma (up to 1%)."

She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet.

He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

Fever in the range of 38.3\u201338.9\u00b0C (101\u2013102\u00b0F) and sometimes higher is common but may not be present, especially in persons with rheumatoid arthritis, renal or hepatic insufficiency, or conditions requiring immunosuppressive therapy. The inflamed, swollen joint is usually evident on examination except in the case of a deeply situated joint such as the hip, shoulder, or sacroiliac joint. Cellulitis, bursitis, and acute osteomyelitis, which may produce a similar clinical picture, should be distinguished from septic arthritis by their greater range of motion and less-than-circumferential swelling. A focus of extraarticular infection, such as a boil or pneumonia, should be sought. Peripheral-blood leukocytosis with a left shift and elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level are common."
