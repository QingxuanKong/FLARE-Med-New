However, the question does not provide information about the specific autoantibodies present in this patient.\\n\\nOptions B, C, and D are antibodies associated with other autoimmune diseases: anti-centromere antibody with limited systemic scleroderma, anti-Jo-1 antibody with polymyositis and dermatomyositis, and anti-Scl-70 antibodies with systemic scleroderma. These antibodies are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and biopsy results.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is not explicitly stated in the provided documents, but based on the clinical presentation and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, which is often associated with the presence of anti-Ro (SS-A) and anti-La (SS-B) antibodies. However, since these antibodies are not mentioned in the options, we can still choose the closest related option.\\n\\nGiven the options provided, the closest related antibody to Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome is anti-Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome type B (SS-B) antibody, although it is not explicitly stated in the documents. However, since this option is not explicitly mentioned in the documents, we can conclude that the correct answer is not among the options.\\n\\nBut since we have to choose from the options, the best answer would be A.

Mumps produces interstitial inflammation marked by a mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate. While mumps in children is most often a self-limited benign condition, in adults it can cause pancreatitis or orchitis; the latter sometimes causes sterility. The mucocele is the most common inflammatory lesion of the salivay glands and results from either blockage or rupture of a salivary gland duct, with consequent leakage of saliva into the surrounding connective tissue stroma.

Hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy are each seen in about 25% of patients. CNS disease, either meningitis or a mass lesion, is seen in 15% of patients. Bone marrow involvement is common, with thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia occurring in 33% of patients. Approximately 7% of patients have mucocutaneous lesions consisting of a maculopapular rash and skin or oral ulcers. Respiratory symptoms are usually mild, with chest x-ray showing a diffuse infiltrate or diffuse small nodules in ~50% of cases. The gastrointestinal tract may be involved. Diagnosis is made by silver staining of tissue, by culturing the organisms from blood, bone marrow, or tissue, or by detecting antigen in blood or urine. Treatment is typically with liposomal amphotericin B followed by maintenance therapy with oral itraconazole until the serum histoplasma antigen is <2 units, the patient has been on"

Extensor plantar responses (with normal tone in trunk and extremities), absence of deep tendon reflexes, and weakness (greater distally than proximally) are usually found. Loss of vibratory and proprioceptive sensation occurs. The median age of death is 35 years. Women have a significantly better prognosis than men. Cardiac involvement occurs in 90% of patients. Cardiomegaly, symmetric hypertrophy, murmurs, and conduction defects are reported. Moderate mental retardation or psychiatric syndromes are present in a small percentage of patients. A high incidence of diabetes mellitus (20%) is found and is associated with insulin resistance and pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction. Musculoskeletal deformities are common and include pes cavus, pes equinovarus, and scoliosis. MRI of the spinal cord shows atrophy (Fig. 450-2)."

Common mechanisms are infection (herpes zoster, influenza), trauma (blunt, penetrating, surgical), and ischemia (diabetes, temporal arteritis). After denervation of the iris sphincter the pupil does not respond well to light, but the response to near is often relatively intact. When the near stimulus is removed, the pupil redilates very slowly compared with the normal pupil, hence the term tonic pupil. In Adie\u2019s syndrome a tonic pupil is present, sometimes in conjunction with weak or absent tendon reflexes in the lower extremities. This benign disorder, which occurs predominantly in healthy young women, is assumed to represent a mild dysautonomia. Tonic pupils are also associated with Shy-Drager syndrome, segmental hypohidrosis, diabetes, and amyloidosis. Occasionally, a tonic pupil is discovered incidentally in an otherwise completely normal,"

There is little pathologic material on which to judge the association, but the presence of other inflammatory lesions of the central and peripheral nervous system in Sj\u00f6gren disease makes the existence of myelitis plausible. Antibody tests (anti-SS-A [Ro] and SS-B [La]) and possibly a biopsy of the minor salivary glands (at the junction of mucosa and epidermis of the lower lip) are justified in patients with unusual myelopathies or in those with sicca symptoms; however, screening in this manner of all cases that otherwise suggest MS or postinfectious myelitis may be excessive. This subject is also reviewed in Chap. 35, in relation to multiple sclerosis."
