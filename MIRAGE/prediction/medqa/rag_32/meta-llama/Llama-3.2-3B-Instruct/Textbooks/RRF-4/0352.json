The patient received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells during the surgery. The patient has jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae, moderate tenderness over the liver, and an enlarged liver on abdominal ultrasonography. Laboratory studies show elevated liver enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin levels. The patient is also positive for anti-HBs, indicating immunity to hepatitis B, and negative for HBsAg, indicating no current hepatitis B infection. The patient is also negative for anti-HCV antibodies, indicating no current hepatitis C infection. The patient is positive for anti-HAV IgG, indicating immunity to hepatitis A. The patient received a transfusion of packed red blood cells, which can lead to hemolysis and the release of bilirubin into the bloodstream, causing jaundice. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with a hemolytic transfusion reaction, which is a known complication of blood transfusions. The massive centrilobular necrosis on liver biopsy supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is D.

A chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a right 2.8 \u00d7 1.6 cm infrahilar mass and postobstructive pneumonia. The patient was an active smoker. Past medical history was notable for laryngeal carcinoma treated 15 years prior with radiation therapy, renal cell carcinoma, peripheral vascular disease, and hypothyroidism. On review of systems, he denied headache, nausea, and vomiting. He had chronic hip pain, managed with acetaminophen with codeine. Other medications included cilostazol, amoxicillin/clavulanate, digoxin, diltiazem, and thyroxine. He was euvolemic on examination, with no lymphadenopathy and a normal chest examination.

She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory.

Aminotransferase elevations tend to be modest for chronic hepatitis B but may fluctuate in the range of 100\u22121000 units. As is true for acute viral hepatitis B, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) tends to be more elevated than aspartate aminotransferase (AST); however, once cirrhosis is established, AST tends to exceed ALT. Levels of alkaline phosphatase activity tend to be normal or only marginally elevated. In severe cases, moderate elevations in serum bilirubin (51.3\u2212171 \u03bcmol/L [3\u221210 mg/ dL]) occur. Hypoalbuminemia and prolongation of the prothrombin time occur in severe or end-stage cases. Hyperglobulinemia and detectable circulating autoantibodies are distinctly absent in chronic hepatitis B (in contrast to autoimmune hepatitis). Viral markers of chronic HBV infection are discussed in Chap. 360."

Measurement of the prothrombin time (PT) is important in patients with acute viral hepatitis, because a prolonged value may reflect a severe hepatic synthetic defect, signify extensive hepatocellular necrosis, and indicate a worse prognosis. Occasionally, a prolonged PT may occur with only mild increases in the serum bilirubin and aminotransferase levels. Prolonged nausea and vomiting, inadequate carbohydrate intake, and poor hepatic glycogen reserves may contribute to hypoglycemia noted occasionally in patients with severe viral hepatitis. Serum alkaline phosphatase may be normal or only mildly elevated, whereas a fall in serum albumin is uncommon in uncomplicated acute viral hepatitis. In some patients, mild and transient steatorrhea has been noted, as well as slight microscopic hematuria and minimal proteinuria."

Eighty-four percent of the patients in the study were referred from outside hospitals, 40% had a serum creatinine level exceeding 2.0 mg/dL, and 14% had an arterial pH of <7.30. In addition, 44% of the patients acquired a culture-proven infection.Diagnosis and Clinical ManagementWhen the medical history is obtained, it is important to address the possibility of exposure to viral infections, medications, and other possible toxins.

Antibodies to HAV (anti-HAV) can be detected during acute illness when serum aminotransferase activity is elevated and fecal HAV shedding is still occurring. This early antibody response is predominantly of the IgM class and persists for several (~3) months, rarely for 6\u201312 months. During convalescence, however, anti-HAV of the IgG class becomes the predominant antibody (Fig. 360-2). Therefore, the diagnosis of hepatitis A is made during acute illness by demonstrating anti-HAV of the IgM class. After acute illness, anti-HAV of the IgG class remains detectable indefinitely, and patients with serum anti-HAV are immune to reinfection. Neutralizing antibody activity parallels the appearance of anti-HAV, and the IgG anti-HAV present in immune globulin accounts for the protection it affords against HAV infection."
