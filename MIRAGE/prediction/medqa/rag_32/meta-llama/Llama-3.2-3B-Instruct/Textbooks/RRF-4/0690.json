    "question": "A 67-year old man presents to his primary care physician for his yearly checkup. He has not noticed any major changes in his health over the last year but says that unfortunately, he stopped exercising because he has been stressed by work. His past medical history is significant for obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperlipidemia. He is taking a number of drugs but does not remember what they are. A panel of metabolic and lipid tests are ordered and show worsening of his metabolic parameters. Based on these findings, his physician prescribes a drug that leads to a large decrease in triglycerides with a much smaller increase in high-density lipoproteins and decrease in low-density lipoproteins. The drug that was most likely prescribed in this case is associated with which of the following side effects?",

The physician prescribes a drug that leads to a large decrease in triglycerides with a much smaller increase in high-density lipoproteins and a decrease in low-density lipoproteins. This suggests that the drug is a fibrate, which is known to decrease triglycerides and increase HDL cholesterol. However, fibrate therapy is also associated with hepatotoxicity, which is a potential side effect. The other options, cholelithiasis, decreased vitamin D absorption, and teratogenicity, are not directly related to the pharmacological profile of fibrates. Therefore, the most likely side effect of the prescribed drug is hepatotoxicity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Several of the animations included in this series highlight the role of modified LDL as a trigger for inflammation and other aspects of the pathobiology of arterial plaques that lead to their aggravation and clinical events. Physicians have useful tools for modulating LDL, but other aspects of dyslipidemia are on the rise and provide a growing challenge to the practitioner.

Therefore, they should be carried out only if the results can be expected to modify the patient\u2019s management. The prevention of heart disease, especially of CAD, is one of the most important tasks of primary care health givers as well as cardiologists. Prevention begins with risk assessment, followed by attention to lifestyle, such as achieving optimal weight, physical activity, and smoking cessation, and then aggressive treatment of all abnormal risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (Chap. 417). After a complete diagnosis has been established in patients with known heart disease, a number of management options are usually available.

Individuals with this phenotype should be treated aggressively due to significantly increased risk of premature CHD. Decreased dietary intake of simple carbohydrates, aerobic exercise, and weight loss can all have beneficial effects on the lipid profile.

The control of lipids can be achieved by the combination of a diet low in saturated and trans-unsaturated fatty acids, exercise, and weight loss. Nearly always, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are required and can lower LDL cholesterol (25\u201350%), raise HDL cholesterol (5\u20139%), and lower triglycerides (5\u201330%). A powerful treatment effect of statins on atherosclerosis, IHD, and outcomes is seen regardless of the pretreatment LDL cholesterol level. Fibrates or niacin can be used to raise HDL cholesterol and lower triglycerides (Chaps. 291e and 421). Controlled trials with lipid-regulating regimens have shown equal proportional benefit for men, women, the elderly, diabetic patients, and smokers.

In obese patients, efforts should be made to reduce body weight to the ideal level. Patients should receive dietary counseling to reduce the content of saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol in the diet. Regular aerobic exercise has relatively little impact on reducing plasma LDL-C levels, although it has cardiovascular benefits independent of LDL lowering. Pharmacologic Therapy for Hypercholesterolemia The decision to use LDL-lowering drug therapy (Table 421-5)\u2014with a statin being first-line therapy\u2014depends on the level of LDL-C as well as the level of cardiovascular risk.

            "content": "The thoughtful use of screening tests (e.g., measurement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) may be of great value. A group of laboratory values can conveniently be obtained with a single specimen at relatively low cost. Screening tests are most informative when they are directed toward common diseases or disorders and when their results indicate whether other useful\u2014but often costly\u2014tests or interventions are needed. On the one hand, biochemical measurements, together with simple laboratory determinations such as blood count, urinalysis, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, often provide a major clue to the presence of a pathologic process. On the other hand, the physician must learn to evaluate occasional screening-test abnormalities that do not necessarily connote significant disease. An in-depth workup after the report of an isolated laboratory abnormality in a person who is otherwise well is almost invariably wasteful and unproductive. Because so many tests are performed"

The five main steps in the evaluation of obesity, as described below, are (1) a focused obesity-related history, (2) a physical examination to determine the degree and type of obesity, (3) assessment of comorbid conditions, (4) determination of fitness level, and (5) assessment of the patient\u2019s readiness to adopt lifestyle changes. The Obesity-Focused History Information from the history should address the following seven questions: What factors contribute to the patient\u2019s obesity? How is the obesity affecting the patient\u2019s health? What is the patient\u2019s level of risk from obesity? What does the patient find difficult about managing weight? What are the patient\u2019s goals and expectations? Is the patient motivated to begin a weight management program? What kind of help does the patient need?"

He has hypertension, and during the last 8 years, he has been adequately managed with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH\u2019s problem? What information would you gather to confirm your diagnosis? What treatment steps would you initiate?"

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"
