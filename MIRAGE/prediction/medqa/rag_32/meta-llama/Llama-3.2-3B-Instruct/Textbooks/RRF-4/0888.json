    "question": "An academic obstetrician is conducting a retrospective cohort study that evaluates the risk of placenta accreta at all statewide medical centers. Per chart review he finds that a prior cesarian birth is associated with a statistically significant increased risk of placenta accreta. The relative risk associated with this finding is 1.23. The associated p-value is 0.03. Which of the following statements is the best interpretation of the reported association in the context of the study?",
    "options": {
        "A": "The 99% confidence interval includes the null hypothesis.",
        "B": "The chance of bias in favor of the alternative hypothesis is 3%.",
        "C": "The p-value represents the likelihood of seeing an increased risk of placenta accreta in women with prior cesarian birth, assuming the alternative hypothesis is true.",
        "D": "The p-value represents the likelihood that the alternative hypothesis is false."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of p-value and its interpretation in the context of hypothesis testing. The p-value represents the probability of observing the results of the study, or more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true. In this case, the null hypothesis is that there is no association between prior cesarean birth and the risk of placenta accreta. The p-value of 0.03 indicates that the observed association is statistically significant, meaning that it is unlikely to be due to chance. However, it does not necessarily mean that the association is practically significant or clinically important. The relative risk of 1.23 indicates that women with a prior cesarean birth are 23% more likely to develop placenta accreta than those without a prior cesarean birth. However, this risk is still relatively low, and the actual risk of placenta accreta in women with a prior cesarean birth is likely to be much lower than the relative risk suggests. Therefore, the p-value of 0.03 is not a strong indicator of the clinical significance of the association. The correct answer is not among the provided options, but option C is the closest correct interpretation of the p-value in the context of the study.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

In one review of 5367 pregnancy-related maternal deaths in the United States from 2006 to 2013, 13 percent were due to hemorrhage caused by accrete syndromes (Creanga, 2015, 2017). In addition, they are a leading cause of hemorrhage and emergency peripartum hysterectomy (Awan, 2011; Eller, 2011; Rossi, 2010). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017 c) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (2010) have taken the lead to address and optimize management. In subsequent pregnancies following placenta accreta, recurrence risks are high. Women in whom hysterectomy is avoided have an estimated 20-percent incidence of recurrence (Cunningham, 2016; Roeca, 2017). In addition, some evidence shows that these women have greater risks for previa, uterine rupture, and hysterectomy (Eshkoli, 2013)."

That said, the two most important risk factors are an associated previa, a prior cesarean delivery, and more likely a combination of the two (Kia', 2014). A classical hysterotomy incision has a higher risk for a subsequent accrete placenta (Gyami-Bannerman, 2012). In fact, almost half of women with a prior cesarean delivery had myometrial fibers seen microscopically adhered to the placenta (Hardardottir, 1996; Miller, 2016). An associated previa confers an even higher risk. his is shown in Figure 41-26, and the astonishing increase in frequency of associated accrete syndromes is apparent with a concomitant previa.

Foremost, women with one or more prior cesarean deliveries are at greater risk for subsequent placental disorders that include placenta previa, abruption, or morbidly adherent placenta (Gibbins, 2018; Klar, 2014). The cumulative risks for placenta previa that accrue with the increasing number of cesarean deliveries are extraordinary. The risk rises even further if there was a prior prelabor cesarean delivery (Downes, 2015). In one MFMU Network study of 30,132 women undergoing cesarean delivery, the incidence was 1.3 percent for those with only one prior cesarean delivery, but it was 3.4 percent if there were six or more prior cesareans (Silver, 2006). In a retrospective cohort of nearly 400,000 women who were delivered of two consecutive singletons, those with a cesarean delivery for the first pregnancy had a 1.6-fold greater risk for previa in the second pregnancy (Gurol-Urganci, 2011). hese same investigators reported a"

In cases offirst-and second-trimester accrete syndromes, there is usually hemorrhage that is the consequence ofcoexisting placenta previa. Such bleeding will typically prompt evaluation and management. In some women who do not have an associated previa, accreta may not be identiied until third-stage labor when an adhered placenta is encountered. Unfortunately, imaging modalities are less than perfect to identiy all of these placentas early."

            "content": "The association of fetal-growth restriction with placenta previa is likely minimal ter controlling for gestational age. In a populationbased cohort of more than 500,000 singleton births, Ananth and associates (2001) found that most low-birthweight newborns associated with placenta previa resulted from preterm birth. Harper and coworkers (2010) reported similar indings from a cohort of nearly 58,000 women. In contrast, at least two studies reported a greater risk for fetal-growth restriction (iisanen, 2014; Weiner, 2016). The term morbidy adherent placenta describes aberrant placentation characterized by abnormally implanted, invasive, or adhered placenta. We also refer to these disorders collectively as accrete syndromes and use these terms interchangeably. Derivation of accrete comes from the Latin ac-+ crescere-to adhere or become attached to (Benirschke, 2012)."

            "content": "Several demographic factors may contribute to this higher risk for placenta previa. First, maternal age raises the frequency of placenta previa (Biro, 2012; Roberts, 2012). In the First-and Second-Trimester E val uation of Risk (FASTER) trial, which included more than 36,000 women, the frequency of previa was 0.5 percent for women <35 years compared with 1.1 percent in those :35 years (Cleary-Goldman, 2005). At Parkland Hospital, this incidence difered from a low rate of approximately 0.65 per 1000 births for women ; 19 years to almost 10 per 1000 births for women older than 35 (see Fig. 41-16). Multpariy also elevates the risk for previa (Raisanen, 2014). Obviously, the efects of advancing maternal age and parity are confounding. Still, Babinszki and colleagues (1999) reported that the 2.2-percent incidence in women with parity of five or greater was significantly higher than that of women with lower parity. he interpregnancy interval does not afect this rate (Fox, 2015)."

            "content": "In sum, these syndromes can have disastrous outcomes for both mother and fetus. Although the depth of placental invasion does not correspond with perinatal outcome, it is of paramount maternal significance (Seet, 2012). Shown in Table 41-6 are outcomes from reports of women from tertiary-care hospitals and in whom the diagnosis of morbidly adherent placenta was made preoperatively. Despite these advantages, a litany of complications included hemorrhage, urinary tract injury, intensive care unit admission, and secondary surgical procedures. Some of these reports chronicle outcomes in a second cohort of women in whom care was not given at a tertiary-care facility or in whom the diagnosis of percreta was not made until delivery, or both. In these cohorts, morbidity was higher, and there was one maternal death."
