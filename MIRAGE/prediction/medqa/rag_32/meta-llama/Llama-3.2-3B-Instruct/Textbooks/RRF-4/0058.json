One week ago, he experienced abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea that have since subsided. The patient's father states that they returned early from a 6-week roadtrip in Mexico because of these symptoms. His parents have been giving him oral rehydration solution.

Examination shows scleral icterus. The abdomen is soft and nontender; there is no rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 8.5 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 94 \u03bcm3\nLeukocyte count 18,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 45,000/mm3\nProthrombin time 12 sec\nPartial thromboplastin time 34 sec\nSerum\nUrea nitrogen 28 mg/dL\nCreatinine 1.6 mg/dL\nBilirubin\nTotal 2.5 mg/dL\nDirect 0.1 mg/dL\nLactate dehydrogenase 1658 U/L\nA blood smear shows schistocytes.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, such as schistocytes on the blood smear, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and thrombocytopenia, suggest a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The patient's history of recent travel to Mexico and the onset of symptoms after a gastrointestinal infection are also important clues. Considering the combination of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure, the most likely diagnosis is Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" ``` The reasoning behind this answer is as follows: * The patient's symptoms of pallor, lethargy, and scleral icterus suggest anemia and jaundice. * The patient's history of abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea followed by a relapse of symptoms is consistent with a gastrointestinal infection. * The presence of schistocytes on the blood smear is a characteristic finding in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. * The elevated lactate dehydrogenase and thrombocytopenia further support the diagnosis of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. * The patient's renal failure, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels, is a complication of HUS. * The patient's travel history to Mexico and the onset of symptoms after a gastrointestinal infection are also consistent with HUS, which can be caused by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (EHEC).",

The treatment goals are to reduce his blood urate levels to <6.0 mg/dl and prevent additional attacks. He was advised to lose weight because being overweight or obese is a risk factor for gout.

            "content": "Severe cases of HFRS evolve in four identifiable stages. The febrile stage lasts 3 or 4 days and is identified by the abrupt onset of fever, headache, severe myalgia, thirst, anorexia, and often nausea and vomiting. Photophobia, retroorbital pain, and pain on ocular movement are common, and the vision may become blurred with ciliary body inflammation. Flushing over the face, the V area of the neck, and the back is characteristic, as are pharyngeal injection, periorbital edema, and conjunctival suffusion. Petechiae often develop in areas of pressure, the conjunctivae, and the axillae. Back pain and tenderness to percussion at the costovertebral angle reflect massive retroperitoneal edema. Laboratory evidence of mild to moderate DIC is present. Other laboratory findings of HFRS include proteinuria and active urinary sediment. The hypotensive stage lasts from a few hours to 48 h and begins with falling blood pressure and sometimes shock. The relative bradycardia typical of the febrile"

There is slight monocytosis, lymphopenia, and eosinopenia, with reactive lymphocytosis and eosinophilia in the weeks after the acute infection. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, plasma viscosity, and levels of C-reactive protein and other acute-phase proteins are high. The platelet count is usually reduced to ~105/\u03bcL. Severe infections may be accompanied by prolonged prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times and by more severe thrombocytopenia. Levels of antithrombin III are reduced even in mild infection. In uncomplicated malaria, plasma concentrations of electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine are usually normal. Findings in severe malaria may include metabolic acidosis, with low plasma concentrations of glucose, sodium, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphate, and albumin together with elevations in lactate, BUN, creatinine, urate,"

A chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a right 2.8 \u00d7 1.6 cm infrahilar mass and postobstructive pneumonia. The patient was an active smoker. Past medical history was notable for laryngeal carcinoma treated 15 years prior with radiation therapy, renal cell carcinoma, peripheral vascular disease, and hypothyroidism. On review of systems, he denied headache, nausea, and vomiting. He had chronic hip pain, managed with acetaminophen with codeine.

Hypoglycemia, hypoglycemic seizures, and lactic acidosis can develop after a short fast. These children usually have doll-like faces with fat cheeks, relatively thin extremities, short stature, and a protuberant abdomen that is due to massive hepatomegaly. The kidneys are enlarged, but the spleen and heart are of normal size. The hepatocytes are distended by glycogen and fat, with large and prominent lipid vacuoles. Despite hepatomegaly, liver enzyme levels are usually normal or near normal. Easy bruising and epistaxis are associated with a prolonged bleeding time as a result of impaired platelet aggregation/adhesion. Hyperuricemia is present. Hyperlipidemia includes elevation of triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins, and phospholipids. Type Ib patients have additional findings of"

She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative."

Most commonly, myocarditis is evidenced by gallops on cardiac auscultation, a prolonged QTc interval, and cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema on chest radiography. General laboratory studies are not specific. Mild to moderate normocytic anemia is common, but frank hemolysis and hemoglobinuria do not develop. Leukocyte counts are usually in the normal range or only slightly elevated, and leukopenia can occur during the crisis. Platelet counts can fall below 50,000/\u00b5L. Laboratory evidence of hepatitis can be found, with elevated serum concentrations of unconjugated bilirubin and aminotransferases; the prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times may be moderately prolonged."
