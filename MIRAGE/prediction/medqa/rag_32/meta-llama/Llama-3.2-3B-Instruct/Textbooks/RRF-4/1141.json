She says she is worried because she and her husband have been trying to conceive for more than a year with no success. Conception by in vitro fertilization was attempted once 3 months ago but was unsuccessful. Analysis of her husband's semen has shown normal sperm counts and morphology. She has a 6-year-old daughter who was born at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. She has no history of severe illness and tries to stay healthy by going to the gym an hour per day. Her menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 to 6 days; her last menstrual period started 2 days ago. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's inability to conceive?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely cause of the patient's inability to conceive, we need to consider her symptoms and medical history. The patient is 35 years old, has a 6-year-old daughter, and has been trying to conceive with her husband for over a year without success. Her menses occur at regular 28-day intervals, and her last menstrual period started 2 days ago. She has no history of severe illness, and her physical examination shows no abnormalities. She also underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) 3 months ago, which was unsuccessful. Given these details, we can rule out pelvic inflammatory disease (A) as a likely cause, as there is no indication of recent pelvic infection or trauma. Diminished ovarian reserve (B) is also unlikely, as the patient's menses occur at regular intervals, and she is still experiencing regular ovulation. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (C) is a possibility, but it would likely present with other symptoms such as amenorrhea or irregular menses, which is not the case for this patient. Premature ovarian failure (D) is a strong possibility, as the patient's age is 35, and she has been trying to conceive for over a year without success. Premature ovarian failure typically occurs before the age of 40, and it can lead to anovulation and infertility. Considering these factors, the most likely cause of the patient's inability to conceive is premature ovarian failure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative."

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Each unsuccessful treatment episode is experienced as the loss of a hoped-for pregnancy (67). The loss of a fetus or newborn induces grief, with some of the same symptoms as depression. Depression is associated with guilt, whereas bereavement is not. However, women who lose pregnancies or infants often do feel guilty, regardless of whether these feelings are logically justified. Patients should not be pressed to \u201cput the loss behind them\u201d or expected to be \u201cover it\u201d within several months. Some feelings of sadness may persist for years. However, their sleep, appetite, and other vital functions and behaviors should begin to improve after a few weeks (68). Grief that persists and interferes with normal function is characterized as pathologic. Depression can complicate grief and should be treated (69)."

The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

Menstrual cycles vary appreciably in length among women and even in the same woman (Chap. 5, p. 81). hus, amenorrhea is not a reliable pregnancy indicator until 10 days or more after expected menses have passed. Occasionally, uterine bleeding that mimics menstruation is noted after conception. During the irst month of pregnancy, these episodes are likely the consequence of blastocyst implantation. Still, irst-trimester bleeding should generally prompt evaluation for an abnormal pregnancy."

Therefore, the definition of primary amenorrhea changed: Primary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses by 13 years of age when there is no visible development of secondary sexual characteristics or by 15 years of age in the presence of normal secondary sexual characteristics. The ages defining primary amenorrhea were decreased by 1 year to continue to represent two standard deviations above the mean age of developing secondary sexual characteristics and menses (1). Failure to begin breast development by age 13 warrants investigation. A woman who previously menstruated can develop secondary amenorrhea, which is defined as absence of menstruation for three normal menstrual cycles (2). A woman with regular cycles and a delay of menses of even a week may warrant assessment with a pregnancy test. It is reasonable to evaluate a woman who has fewer than nine cycles per year. With a few exceptions, the causes of primary"
