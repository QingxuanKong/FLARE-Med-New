His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

Yet these patients may be fully aware of what is said to them or happening around them and will reproduce much of this information during a later spontaneous remission or one induced by intravenous sodium amytal or midazolam. Even if untreated, the patient, after weeks or months in this state, begins to talk and act more normally and there is then rapid recovery. In certain phases of catatonia there may be a period of excitement and impulsivity, during which the patient may be suicidal or homicidal. Catatonia is currently recognized to be a feature of other mental illnesses and is more frequent in severe involutional depression than in schizophrenia (the catatonic state is further discussed in Chap. 16 on Coma and Related Disorders of Consciousness)."

            "content": "The optimal daily dose for treatment of an acute psychotic episode is in the range of 10 to 20 mg daily of haloperidol, the equivalent amount (400 to 800 mg) of a phenothiazine such as chlorpromazine, or escalating doses of the atypical agents, listed in Table 49-2. The administration of much higher doses of phenothiazines or haloperidol is popular with some psychiatrists, but this practice entails serious risks and the advantages have not been demonstrated in controlled trials (see Kane and Marder). Attempts are made to individualize and eventually lower the dosage until the patient\u2019s behavior suggests that a relapse is imminent. Antidepressants and lithium have also been used in those schizophrenic patients with prominent affective symptoms. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is now seldom used except in patients who are catatonic or severely agitated or who have prominent affective symptoms."

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."
