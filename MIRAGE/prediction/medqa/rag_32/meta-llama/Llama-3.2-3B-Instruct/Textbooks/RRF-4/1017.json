He is found with a blood pressure of 100/80 mm Hg, a heart rate of 84/min, an elevated respiratory rate, and a holosystolic heart murmur III/VI. His palms and soles show non-tender erythematous lesions. His personal medical history is relevant for frequent visits to the ER for lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the last month with a recent colonoscopy that reported an ulcerative lesion suggestive of colorectal cancer. He has not been subjected to dental procedures recently, and he denies the use of psychoactive drugs.

    "predict": "To determine the most likely causative agent for the patient's condition, let's analyze the provided information step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia, malaise, progressive shortness of breath, and sharp chest pain. These symptoms suggest an infectious process, particularly one that involves the cardiovascular system. 2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The presence of a holosystolic heart murmur III/VI and non-tender erythematous lesions on the palms and soles are indicative of endocarditis, particularly involving the mitral valve. 3. **Medical History**: The patient has a history of frequent visits to the ER for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, with a recent colonoscopy showing an ulcerative lesion suggestive of colorectal cancer. This history is significant because certain bacteria are associated with colorectal cancer. 4. **Diagnostic Findings**: The echocardiography reports the presence of vegetations involving the mitral valve, which is a hallmark of infective endocarditis. Given these findings, the most likely causative agent is associated with colorectal cancer and endocarditis. The bacteria that fit this description are **Streptococcus bovis**. This organism is known to be associated with colorectal cancer and is a common cause of subacute bacterial endocarditis in patients with cancer, particularly those with colorectal cancer. Therefore, the answer is: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's history of colorectal cancer and the presence of endocarditis, particularly involving the mitral valve, makes Streptococcus bovis the most likely causative agent.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"} ```",

Symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, neurologic, or pulmonary disease help focus the differential diagnosis, as do findings relevant to the jugular venous pressure and waveforms, the arterial pulses, other heart sounds, the lungs, the abdomen, the skin, and the extremities. In many instances, laboratory studies, an ECG, and/or a chest x-ray may have been obtained earlier and may contain valuable information. A patient with suspected infective endocarditis, for example, may have a murmur in the setting of fever, chills, anorexia, fatigue, dyspnea, splenomegaly, petechiae, and positive blood cultures. A new systolic murmur in a patient with a marked fall in blood pressure after a recent MI suggests myocardial rupture.

This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung.

Once the details from history and physical are teased out, laboratory testing (including measurements of blood eosinophils, cultures, and markers of inflammation), spirometry and radiographic imaging can help distinguish between different diseases. Often, however, BAL, transbronchial, or open lung biopsies are required. In many cases, biopsies or"

The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy. One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC). He undergoes surgical resection and is found to have high-risk stage III CRC with five positive lymph nodes. After surgery, he feels entirely well with no symptoms. Of note, he has no other illnesses. What is this patient\u2019s overall prognosis? Based on his prognosis, what"

After admission a bronchoscopy was carried out and sputum was aspirated from the left upper lobe bronchus. This was cultured in the laboratory and also viewed under the microscope and tuberculous bacilli (TB) were identified. A 68-year-old man came to his family physician complaining of discomfort when swallowing (dysphagia). The physician examined the patient and noted since his last visit he had lost approximately 18 lb over 6 months. Routine blood tests revealed the patient was anemic and he was referred to the gastroenterology unit. A diagnosis of esophageal cancer was made and the patient underwent a resection, which involved a chest and abdominal incision. After 4 years the patient remains well though still subject to follow-up."

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

Pulmonary abnormalities raise concern for aspiration of vomitus. Abdominal auscultation may reveal absent bowel sounds with ileus. High-pitched rushes suggest bowel obstruction, whereas a succussion splash upon abrupt lateral movement of the patient is found with gastroparesis or pyloric obstruction. Tenderness or involuntary guarding raises suspicion of inflammation, whereas fecal blood suggests mucosal injury from ulcer, ischemia, or tumor. Neurologic disease presents with papilledema, visual field loss, or focal neural abnormalities. Neoplasm is suggested by palpation of masses or adenopathy."

Assessment of the patient\u2019s general appearance and vital signs, skin and soft tissue examination, and the neurologic evaluation are of particular importance. The patient may appear either anxious and agitated or lethargic and apathetic. Fever is usually present, although elderly patients and compromised hosts (e.g., patients who are uremic or cirrhotic and those who are taking glucocorticoids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be afebrile despite serious underlying infection. Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate helps determine the degree of hemodynamic and metabolic compromise. The patient\u2019s airway must be evaluated to rule out the risk of obstruction from an invasive oropharyngeal infection."

Manifestations of progression and severity include both constitutional findings and those limited to the lung and associated structures. In light of the pathobiology of the disease, many of the findings are to be expected. The patient is frequently febrile with tachycardia or may have a history of chills and/or sweats. Cough may be either nonproductive or productive of mucoid, purulent, or blood-tinged sputum. Gross hemoptysis is suggestive of CA-MRSA pneumonia. Depending on severity, the patient may be able to speak in full sentences or may be very short of breath. If the pleura is involved, the patient may experience pleuritic chest pain. Up to 20% of patients may have gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. Other symptoms may include fatigue, headache, myalgias, and arthralgias."
