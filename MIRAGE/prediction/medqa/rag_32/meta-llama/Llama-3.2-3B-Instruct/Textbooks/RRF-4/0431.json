    "question": "A 24-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of an inability to urinate. She states that this has been one of many symptoms she has experienced lately. At times she has had trouble speaking and has noticed changes in her vision however these episodes occurred over a month ago and have resolved since then. Two days ago she experienced extreme pain in her face that was exacerbated with brushing her teeth and plucking out facial hairs. The patient has no relevant past medical history, however, the patient admits to being sexually abused by her boyfriend for the past year. Her current medications include ibuprofen for menstrual cramps. On physical exam it is noted that leftward gaze results in only the ipsilateral eye gazing leftward. The patient's initial workup is started in the emergency department. Her vital signs are within normal limits and you note a pale and frightened young lady awaiting further care. Which of the following is the best initial test for this patient's chief complaint?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: Step 1: Review the patient's symptoms and history. The patient presents with an inability to urinate, trouble speaking, and changes in vision that resolved on their own, as well as extreme pain in her face that was exacerbated by brushing her teeth and plucking out facial hairs. These symptoms, combined with the patient's admission of being sexually abused, suggest a potential neurological or gynecological issue. Step 2: Consider the patient's physical examination findings. The physical exam notes leftward gaze palsy, which is a symptom often associated with third nerve palsy (oculomotor nerve [III] dysfunction). This nerve is responsible for controlling several eye movements, including upward, downward, and outward movements, as well as constriction of the pupil. Step 3: Analyze the potential causes of the patient's symptoms. Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a possible diagnosis could be a third nerve palsy, which could be caused by a variety of factors, including a stroke, aneurysm, or tumor. However, the patient's history of sexual abuse and the presence of oculomotor nerve palsy suggest that a more sinister cause, such as a space-occupying lesion or a vascular malformation, should be considered. Step 4: Evaluate the potential tests for diagnosis. The options for initial testing include: A. Head CT: This would be useful for detecting structural abnormalities such as a tumor or aneurysm. B. Head MRI: This would provide more detailed imaging of the brain and could help identify lesions or abnormalities. C. Lumbar puncture: This would be useful for detecting infections or inflammation in the central nervous system. D. Domestic abuse screening and exploring patient's life stressors: This would be important to address the patient's history of sexual abuse and potential psychological impact, but it is not a diagnostic test for the patient's chief complaint. Step 5: Choose the best initial test based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the best initial test would be to perform a Head MRI to evaluate for potential structural abnormalities such as a tumor or aneurysm. Answer: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a potential neurological issue, and a Head MRI would be the best initial test to evaluate for structural abnormalities such as a tumor or aneurysm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia.

A 30-year-old woman came to her doctor with a history of amenorrhea (absence of menses) and galactorrhea (the production of breast milk). She was not pregnant and appeared otherwise fit and well. Serum prolactin was measured. Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland and necessary for the production of breast milk postpartum. This hormone was markedly elevated. Further clinical tests demonstrated visual field defects. The patient went to see an optometrist who performed a visual field assessment and demonstrated a reduction in the lateral aspects of the normal visual fields. This was bilateral and symmetrical\u2014a bilateral temporal hemianopia. The visual pathways have now determined the site of the lesion."

Focused History: As noted on her medical alert bracelet, MW has had type 1 diabetes (T1D) for the last 24 years. Her husband reports that this is her first medical emergency in 2 years. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): MW displayed signs of dehydration (such as dry mucous membranes and skin, poor skin turgor, and low blood pressure) and acidosis (such as deep, rapid breathing [Kussmaul respiration]).

The history should note whether the patient has experienced pelvic trauma, surgery, or radiation. In light of the increasing recognition of the relationship between lower urinary tract symptoms and ED, it is advisable to evaluate for the presence of symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction. Questions should focus on the onset of symptoms, the presence and duration of partial erections, and the progression of ED. A history of nocturnal or early morning erections is useful for distinguishing physiologic ED from psychogenic ED. Nocturnal erections occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and require intact neurologic and circulatory systems. Organic causes of ED generally are characterized by a gradual and persistent change in rigidity or the inability to sustain nocturnal, coital, or self-stimulated erections. The patient should be questioned about the presence of"

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases.

She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"
