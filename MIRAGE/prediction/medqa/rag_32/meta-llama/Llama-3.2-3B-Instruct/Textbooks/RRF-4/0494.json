Since the mother had no prenatal care, it's likely that the birth weights were not accurately measured, and there might be some discrepancy. However, we can still use these values to make an educated guess.\\n\\nThe smaller newborn weighs 2050 g, which is below the 10th percentile for gestational age. This suggests that the newborn may have growth restriction.\\n\\nThe larger newborn weighs 2850 g, which is above the 90th percentile for gestational age. This suggests that the newborn may have macrosomia.\\n\\nThe flattened nose and left-sided clubfoot in the smaller newborn could be related to growth restriction or other prenatal factors.\\n\\nThe hematocrit values are 42% and 71% for the smaller and larger newborns, respectively. A hematocrit value of 71% is significantly higher than the normal range for a newborn, which is typically around 45-55%. This suggests that the larger newborn may have polycythemia, a condition characterized by an excess of red blood cells.\\n\\nConsidering these factors, the most likely scenario is that the two newborns are conjoined twins. Conjoined twins are a type of monozygotic (identical) twins that are physically connected and share organs or body parts. They often have different growth rates and may have different hematocrit values due to the unequal sharing of blood and nutrients.\\n\\nThe fact that one twin is smaller and has growth restriction, while the other twin is larger and has macrosomia, is consistent with conjoined twins. Additionally, the presence of polycythemia in the larger twin is also consistent with conjoined twins, as they may have different blood circulation patterns.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely answer is C. Monochorionic-monoamniotic monozygotic twins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

Although there is general agreement among obstetricians that neonates weighing < 4000 g are not excessively large, a similar consensus has not been reached for the definition of macrosomia. Newborn weight rarely exceeds 11 pounds (5000 g), and excessively large infants are a curiosity. The largest newborn cited in the Guinness Book of World Records was a 23-lb 12-oz (10,800 g) infant boy born in 1879 to a Canadian woman (Barnes, 1957). In the United States in 2015, of more than 4 million births, 6.9 percent weighed 4000 to 4499 g; 1 percent weighed 4500 to 4999 g; and 0.1 percent were born weighing 5000 g or more 4500-4649 3221 (Martin, 2017) .

As shown in Table 44-2, birthweights ::4500 g are uncommon. During a 30-year period at Parkland Hospital, during which there were more than 350,000 singleton births, only 1.4 percent of newborns weighed 4500 g or more. We are of the view that the upper limit of fetal growth, above which growth can be deemed abnormal, is likely two standard deviations above the mean, representing perhaps 3 percent of births. At 40 weeks, such a threshold would correspond to approximately 4500 g.

This at least suggests that placental function is not severely compromised. Indeed, continued fetal growth is the norm-albeit at a slower rate beginning at 37 completed weeks (Fig. 43-3). Nahum and colleagues (1995) conirmed that fetal growth continues until at least 42 weeks. However, Link and associates (2007) showed that umbilical blood low did not increase concomitantly. The principal reasons for increased risks to postterm fetuses were described by Leveno and associates (1984). Both antepartum fetal jeopardy and intrapartum fetal distress were found to be the consequence of cord compression associated with oligohydramnios. In their analysis of 727 postterm pregnancies, intrapartum fetal distress detected with electronic monitoring was not associated with late decelerations characteristic of uteroplacental insuiciency.

Rates of stillbirth and adverse neonatal outcomes that include birth asphyxia, meconium aspiration, hypoglycemia, and hypothermia are all increased, as is the prevalence of abnormal neurological development. This is true for both term and preterm growth-restricted newborns. In one analysis of nearly 3000 newborns born before 27 weeks' gestation, those weighing < 10th percentile had a nearly fourfold higher risk of neonatal death or neurodevelopmental impairment and a 2.6-fold increased risk of cerebral palsy compared with non-SGA neonates (De Jesus, 2013). In another analysis of more than 91,000 uncomplicated pregnancies, newborns with weights < 5th percentile had a higher risk of low 5-minute Apgar score, respiratory distress, necrotizing enterocolitis, and neonatal sepsis than appropriate-weight neonates.

Expert opinion now generally favors an Hb transfusion trigger of 70 g/L in stable critically ill children, which is the same as the recommendation for adult patients (see Chapter 7). A higher threshold should be considered if the child has symptomatic anemia or impaired cardiorespiratory function.A useful guideline for estimating blood volume for the newborn infant is approximately 80 mL/kg of body weight. When packed red blood cells are required, the transfusion requirement is usually administered in 10 mL/kg increments, which is roughly equivalent to a 500-mL transfusion for a 70-kg adult.

With respect to size, a newborn may be normally grown and appropriate or gestational age; undersized, thus, smaL or gestational age; or overgrown and consequently, large or gestational age. Small for gestational age categorizes newborns whose birthweight is <10th percentile for gestational age. Other frequently used terms have included etal-growth restriction or intrauterine growth restriction. he term large for gestational age describes newborns whose birthweight is > 90th percentile for gestational age. The term appropriate or gestational age designates newborns whose weight is between the 10th and 90th percentiles."

For example, in a prospective study of 682 consecutive pregnancies complicated by diabetes, women with type 1 diabetes were significantly more likely than women with type 2 diabetes to have a neonate weighing above the 90th and 97.7th percentiles (Murphy, 2011). Additionally, women with type 1 diabetes were significantly less likely to deliver an SGA newborn.
