Although he has had gum bleeding in the past, it has never been this severe. He has no family history available as he was adopted. He does not have any significant past medical history. His physical exam is within normal limits.

The patient's platelet count is normal (330,000/mm3), which suggests that the platelet count is not the primary issue. The bleeding time is slightly prolonged (6 mins), which may indicate some issue with platelet function or primary hemostasis. The prothrombin time (PT) is normal (12 sec), which suggests that the extrinsic coagulation pathway is intact. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is prolonged (42 sec), which suggests an issue with the intrinsic coagulation pathway or the common pathway. The factor VIII activity is decreased, and the ristocetin cofactor assay is also decreased, which suggests that the patient has a problem with von Willebrand factor (VWF), which is a carrier protein for factor VIII. This is consistent with a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (VWD).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

In evaluating a patient for a bleeding disorder, a history of at-risk situations, including the response to past surgeries, should be assessed. Does the patient have a history of spontaneous or trauma/surgery-induced bleeding? Spontaneous hemarthroses are a hallmark of moderate and severe factor VIII and IX deficiency and, in rare circumstances, of other clotting factor deficiencies. Mucosal bleeding symptoms are more suggestive of underlying platelet disorders or Von Willebrand disease (VWD), termed disorders of primary hemostasis or platelet plug formation. Disorders affecting primary hemostasis are shown in Table 78-1."

The bleeding time has been used to assess bleeding risk; however, it does not predict bleeding risk with surgery and it is not recommended for this indication. The PFA-100, an instrument that measures platelet-dependent coagulation under flow conditions, is more sensitive and specific for VWD than the bleeding time; however, it is not sensitive enough to rule out mild bleeding disorders. PFA-100 closure times are prolonged in patients with some, but not all, inherited platelet disorders. Also, its utility in predicting bleeding risk has not been determined."

Patients with FXI levels <10% of normal have a high risk of bleeding, but the disease phenotype does not always correlate with residual FXI clotting activity. A family history is indicative of the risk of bleeding in the propositus. Clinically, the presence of mucocutaneous hemorrhages such as bruises, gum bleeding, epistaxis, hematuria, and menorrhagia are common, especially following trauma.

B. Factors of the coagulation cascade are produced by the liver in an inactive state. Activation requires 1. Exposure to an activating substance i. Tissue thromboplastin activates factor VII (extrinsic pathway). ii. Subendothelial collagen activates factor XII (intrinsic pathway). 2. Phospholipid surface of platelets 3. II. DISORDERS OF SECONDARY HEMOSTASIS A. Usually due to factor abnormalities B. Clinical features include deep tissue bleeding into muscles and joints (hemarthrosis) and rebleeding after surgical procedures (e.g., circumcision and wisdom tooth extraction). C. Laboratory studies include 1. Prothrombin time (PT)-measures extrinsic (factor VII) and common (factors II, V, X, and fibrinogen) pathways of the coagulation cascade 2."

Easy bruising can also be a sign of medical conditions in which there is no identifiable coagulopathy; instead, the conditions are caused by an abnormality of blood vessels or their supporting tissues. In Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, there may be posttraumatic bleeding and a history of joint hyperextensibility. Cushing\u2019s syndrome, chronic steroid use, and aging result in changes in skin and subcutaneous tissue, and subcutaneous bleeding occurs in response to minor trauma. The latter has been termed senile purpura."

A mildly decreased VWF level should be viewed more as a risk factor for bleeding than as an actual disease. Patients with type 2 VWD have functional defects; thus, the VWF antigen measurement is significantly higher than the test of function. For types 2A, 2B, and 2M VWD, platelet-binding and/or collagen binding VWF activity is decreased. In type 2A VWD, the impaired function is due either to increased susceptibility to cleavage by ADAMTS13,"

FXIII is a transglutaminase that cross-links fibrin molecules in a soft clot to form a hard clot. Its deficiency does not affect the PT or aPTT tests.
