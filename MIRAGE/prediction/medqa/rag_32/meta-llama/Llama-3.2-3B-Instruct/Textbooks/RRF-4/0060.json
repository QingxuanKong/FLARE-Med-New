Her symptoms began one week ago, when she had several days of low-grade fever and constipation. She returned from Indonesia 2 weeks ago, where she spent the summer with her grandparents. Her temperature is 39.3\u00b0C (102.8\u00b0F). Examination shows diffuse abdominal tenderness and mild hepatosplenomegaly. There is a faint salmon-colored maculopapular rash on her trunk and abdomen. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with fever, chills, abdominal pain, and profuse non-bloody diarrhea, which began after returning from Indonesia. The symptoms of fever and abdominal pain are indicative of an infectious process, and the presence of mild hepatosplenomegaly and a faint salmon-colored maculopapular rash further support this. The most likely cause of these symptoms is a waterborne pathogen that is endemic in Indonesia. Among the options, Salmonella Typhi is a common cause of enteric fever and is endemic in Indonesia. The rash and hepatosplenomegaly are also consistent with typhoid fever. The incubation period of typhoid fever is typically 7-14 days, which fits with the patient's symptoms. The patient's travel history to Indonesia also supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely causal organism is Salmonella Typhi.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Fever may continue for several weeks with decreasing intensity, and the patient may become afebrile for a short period before experiencing another bout of fever. The spleen may be palpable by the second week of illness and, depending on the duration of illness, may become hugely enlarged (Fig. 251-3). Hepatomegaly (usually moderate in degree) soon follows.

Clues to the mechanisms of anemia may be provided on physical examination by findings of infection, blood in the stool, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, or petechiae. Splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy suggest an underlying lymphoproliferative disease, whereas petechiae suggest platelet dysfunction. Past laboratory measurements are helpful to determine a time of onset."

True or false: Withdrawing a nonbeneficial treatment is ethically similar to withholding a nonindicated one. When can a physician refuse to continue treating a patient on the grounds of futility? An eight-year-old child is in a serious accident. She requires emergent transfusion, but her parents are not present. Conditions in which confidentiality must be overridden. Involuntary commitment or isolation for medical treatment may be undertaken for what reason? A 10-year-old child presents in status epilepticus, but her parents refuse treatment on religious grounds. A son asks that his mother not be told about her recently discovered cancer. False. Patients may change their minds at any time. Exceptions to the requirement of informed consent include emergency situations and patients without decision-making capacity."

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"
