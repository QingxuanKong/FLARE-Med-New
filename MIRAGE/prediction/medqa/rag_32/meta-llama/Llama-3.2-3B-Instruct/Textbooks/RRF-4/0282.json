    "question": "A 16-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her father because of concerns about her behavior during the past 2 years. She does not have friends and spends most of the time reading by herself. Her father says that she comes up with excuses to avoid family dinners and other social events. She states that she likes reading and feels more comfortable on her own. On mental status examination, her thought process is organized and logical. Her affect is flat. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Schizoid personality disorder",
        "B": "Antisocial personality disorder",
        "C": "Schizophreniform disorder",
        "D": "Autism spectrum disorder"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the symptoms and behavior described in the scenario and match them with the diagnostic criteria for the given options. The key points from the scenario are: the 16-year-old girl's lack of social interaction, preference for solitary activities like reading, and avoidance of social events. She also exhibits a flat affect and organized but logical thought process. We need to consider the diagnostic criteria for Schizoid Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, Schizophreniform Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder to determine the most likely diagnosis.\\n\\nSchizoid Personality Disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of emotional expression in interpersonal settings. The individual prefers solitary activities and may appear aloof or indifferent to social interactions. The girl's preference for reading and avoidance of social events align with these criteria.\\n\\nAntisocial Personality Disorder is characterized by a disregard for others' rights, lack of empathy, and impulsivity. There is no indication of these traits in the scenario.\\n\\nSchizophreniform Disorder is a short-term version of Schizophrenia, characterized by a sudden onset of hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and negative symptoms. The girl's flat affect and organized thought process do not support this diagnosis.\\n\\nAutism Spectrum Disorder is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. While the girl's social interaction is limited, there is no mention of restricted or repetitive behaviors.\\n\\nBased on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is Schizoid Personality Disorder, as the girl's behavior and preferences align with the diagnostic criteria for this condition.\\n\\nAnswer Choice: A\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

Social factors that contribute to underachievement must be eliminated if possible. Later, there is need for advice about possible occupational attainments. Great care must be exercised in deciding about institutionalization. Whereas severe degrees of cognitive impairment are all too apparent by the first or second year, less-severe degrees are difficult to recognize early. As stated above, psychologic tests alone are not trustworthy. The method of assessment suggested many years ago by Fernald still has a ring of soundness. It includes (1) physical examination, (2) family background, (3) developmental history, (4) school progress (grade achieved), (5) performance in schoolwork (tests of reading, arithmetic, etc.), (6) practical knowledge, (7) social behavior, (8) industrial efficiency, (9) moral reactions, and (10)"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV.
