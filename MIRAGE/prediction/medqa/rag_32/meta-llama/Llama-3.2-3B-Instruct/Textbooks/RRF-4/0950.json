            "content": "Normal Transformation The original squamous epithelium of the vagina and exocervix has four layers (5): Zone 1. The basal layer is a single row of immature cells with large nuclei and a small amount of cytoplasm. 2. The parabasal layer includes two to four rows of immature cells that have normal mitotic figures and provide the replacement cells for the overlying epithelium. 3. The intermediate layer includes four to six rows of cells with larger amounts of cytoplasm in a polyhedral shape separated by an intercellular space. Intercellular bridges, where differentiation of glycogen production occurs, can be identified with light microscopy. 4. The superficial layer includes five to eight rows of \ufb02attened cells with small uniform nuclei and a cytoplasm filled with glycogen. The nucleus becomes pyknotic, and the cells detach from the surface (exfoliation). These cells form the basis for Papanicolaou (Pap) testing."

This section of adult skin from the area around the anus shows several apocrine (anal) sweat glands, which are easily identified by the large lumen of their secretory components. This apocrine sweat gland is close to a hair follicle (center of photomicrograph) and deep to the dense, irregular connective tissue of the dermis. 45. Inset. Higher magnification of secretory component shows the cell types of the apocrine gland. The gland consists of a simple epithelium whose cells are either cuboidal or columnar and myoepithelial cells located in the basal portion of the epithelial cell layer. 230."
