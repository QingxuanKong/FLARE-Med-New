Twenty years ago, he had a painless ulcer on his penis that resolved without treatment. He has no history of serious illness. Examination shows small pupils that constrict with accommodation but do not react to light. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the distal lower extremities.

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the patient's symptoms and examination findings: 1. **Symptoms**: The patient has sharp, shooting pain in both legs, which has been present for several months. 2. **Past medical history**: The patient had a painless ulcer on his penis 20 years ago, which resolved without treatment. 3. **Examination findings**: * Small pupils that constrict with accommodation but do not react to light (Argyll Robertson pupils). * Decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch over the distal lower extremities. * Absent patellar reflexes bilaterally. * Unsteady and broad-based gait. Given these findings, the patient is likely suffering from **tabes dorsalis**, a late manifestation of syphilis that affects the posterior columns, dorsal roots, and dorsal root ganglia. Tabes dorsalis is associated with several complications, including: * **Thoracic aortic aneurysm**: This is a known complication of tabes dorsalis due to the degeneration of the myelin sheath in the spinal cord, which can lead to autonomic dysfunction and increased blood pressure, potentially causing an aortic aneurysm. The other options are less likely: * Atrioventricular block (A) is not directly related to tabes dorsalis. * Mitral valve regurgitation (B) is not a known complication of tabes dorsalis. * Penile squamous cell carcinoma (C) is not directly related to tabes dorsalis, although the patient's past history of a painless genital ulcer (likely a chancre, a characteristic of primary syphilis) is relevant. Therefore, the correct answer is: **D. Thoracic aortic aneurysm** Here is the response in the requested JSON format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with tabes dorsalis, a late manifestation of syphilis.

On examination he had a reduced peripheral pulse on the left foot compared to the right. On direct questioning, the patient revealed that he experienced severe left-sided buttock pain after walking 100 yards. After a short period of rest, he could walk another 100 yards before the same symptoms recurred. He also noticed that over the past year he was unable to obtain an erection.

Diabetes can lead to vascular disease of large and medium arteries, narrowing the lumen and reducing blood supply to the extremities, thereby impairing healing. In addition, diabetes can also affect blood supply to nerves, which leads to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy results in reduced sensation, and therefore minor injuries can often go unnoticed. This patient has developed an ulcer on his heel, which is a pressure point and likely to be under repeated strain. The nurse examined the ulcer and found that the ulcer was looking infected with pus at the base of the ulcer and asked for a specialist orthopedic opinion, who requested an x-ray and an MRI.

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

            "content": "This type of neurosyphilis, described by Duchenne in his classic monograph L\u2019ataxie locomotrice progressive (1858), usually develops 15 to 20 years after the onset of the infection. The major symptoms are lightning pains, ataxia, and urinary incontinence; the chief signs are absent tendon reflexes at knee and ankle, impaired vibratory and position sense in feet and legs, and a Romberg sign. The ataxia is purely a result of the sensory defect. Power, by contrast, is fully retained in most cases. The pupils are abnormal in more than 90 percent of cases, usually Argyll Robertson in type (see Chap. 13). Optic atrophy is frequent. The lancinating or lightning pains (present in more than 90 percent of cases) are, as their name implies, sharp, stabbing, and brief, like a flash of lightning. They are more frequent in the legs than elsewhere but roam over the body from face to feet, sometimes playing persistently on one spot \u201clike the repeated twanging of a fiddle string,\u201d as Wilson remarked."

There is usually no pain. Onset may be on awakening in the morning. Peroneal neuropathy needs to be distinguished from L5 radiculopathy. In L5 radiculopathy, ankle invertors and evertors are weak and needle EMG reveals denervation. EDx can help localize the lesion. Peroneal motor conduction velocity shows slowing and amplitude drop across the fibular head. Management consists of rapid weight loss and avoiding leg crossing. Footdrop is treated with an ankle brace. A knee pad can be worn over the lateral knee to avoid further compression. Most cases spontaneously resolve over weeks or months."

They are initiated by autophosphorylation of select tyrosine residues in their receptors. C. They are mediated by binding to adrenergic receptors, which are a class of nuclear receptors. D. They result in the activation of glycogen and triacylglycerol synthesis. Q3. NE bound to certain receptors causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. Why might NE be used clinically in the treatment of septic shock? Case 5: Sun Sensitivity Patient Presentation: AZ is a 6-year-old boy who is being evaluated for freckle-like areas of hyperpigmentation on his face, neck, forearms, and lower legs. Focused History: AZ\u2019s father reports that the boy has always been quite sensitive to the sun. His skin turns red (erythema) and his eyes hurt (photophobia) if he is exposed to the sun for any period of time."

Paresthesias and cramps are present but only to a slight degree and there is always some impairment, usually also mild, of deep and superficial sensation in the feet and hands, shading off proximally. Rarely, the sensory loss is severe and perforating ulcers appear as they do in the pure sensory varieties of inherited neuropathy. The tendon reflexes are absent in the involved limbs. The illness progresses very slowly over decades, giving the impression of stabilization for long periods."

He saw his PCP for evaluation of low back pain. X-rays of the spine showed some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine plus several wedge deformities in the thoracic spine. The patient is a long-time smoker (up to two packs per day) and has two to four glasses of wine with dinner, more on the weekends. He has chronic bronchitis, presumably from smoking, and has been treated on numerous occasions with oral prednisone for exacerba-tions of bronchitis. He is currently on 10 mg/d prednisone. Examination shows kyphosis of the thoracic spine, with some tenderness to fist percussion over the thoracic spine. The dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measure-ment of the lumbar spine is \u201cwithin the normal limits,\u201d but the radiologist noted that the reading may be misleading because of degenerative changes. The hip measurement shows a T score (number of standard"
