Since the patient is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive, there is a risk of Rh incompatibility. To prevent this, Rh immune globulin (RhoGAM) should be administered to the patient. However, the question asks for the most appropriate choice among the given options, which are all types of immunoglobulins. The correct answer is the one that is most likely to prevent Rh incompatibility in this scenario. Since the patient is Rh-negative, the correct answer is Anti-D IgG. Anti-D IgG is specifically used to prevent Rh incompatibility in Rh-negative individuals, and it is administered to Rh-negative women who are at risk of Rh incompatibility, such as those who are pregnant with an Rh-positive fetus or have had an Rh-positive fetus in a previous pregnancy. The other options, Anti-A IgG and Anti-B IgG, are not relevant in this scenario, and Anti-D IgM is not the correct choice as it is not the standard form of Rh immune globulin used to prevent Rh incompatibility.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The dose of RhoGAM (300 \u03bcg) is based on the ability of this amount of anti-Rh-positive antibody to bind all the possible fetal Rh-positive erythrocytes entering the maternal circulation during the fetal-to-maternal transfusion at birth (approximately 30 mL). RhoGAM may bind Rh-positive fetal erythrocytes or interfere with maternal anti-Rh-positive antibody production by another, unknown mechanism. RhoGAM is effective only in preventing sensitization to the D antigen. Other blood group antigens that can cause immune hydrops and erythroblastosis include Rh C, E, Kell, and Duffy. Anti-Kell alloimmunity produces lower amniotic bilirubin levels and a lower reticulocyte count because, in addition to hemolysis, it inhibits erythropoiesis."

The normal anti-A and anti-B isohemagglutinins in group O mothers usually are of the IgM type and therefore do not cross the placenta. However, for reasons not well understood, certain group O women possess IgG antibodies directed against group A or B antigens (or both) even"

            "content": "Initial evaluation of alloimmunization begins with determining the paternal erythrocyte antigen status. Provided that paternity is certain, if the father is negative for the red cell antigen to which the mother is sensitized, the pregnancy is not at risk. In a D-alloimmunized pregnancy in which the father is D-positive, it is helpful to determine paternal zygosity for the D antigen using DNA-based analysis. If the father is heterozygous-or if paternity is not known-the woman should be ofered assessment of fetal genotype. Traditionally, this was done with amniocentesis and PCR testing of uncultured amniocytes, which has a positive-predictive value of 100 percent and negative-predictive value of approximately 97 percent (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2016; Van den Veyver, 1996). Fetal testing for other antigens-such as E/e, C/c, Duy, Kell, Kidd, and \ufffd1/N-is also available with this method. Chorionic villus sampling is not recommended because of greater risk for"

            "content": "Immune hydrops results from an antibody-induced hemolytic disease in the newborn that is caused by blood group incompatibility between mother and fetus. Such an incompatibility occurs when the fetus inherits red cell antigenic determinants from the father that are foreign to the mother. The most common antigens to result in clinically significant hemolysis are the Rh and ABO blood group antigens. Of the numerous antigens included in the Rh system, only the D antigen is a major cause of Rh incompatibility. Fetal red cells may reach the maternal circulation during the last trimester of pregnancy, when the cytotrophoblast is no longer present as a barrier, or during childbirth itself (fetomaternal bleed). The mother then becomes sensitized to the foreign antigen and produces antibodies that, in future pregnancies, can freely traverse the placenta to the fetus, in which they cause red cell destruction. With initiation of immune hemolysis, progressive anemia in the fetus leads to tissue"

Because of the risk for surgical intervention, intravenous access is obtained, and patients abstain from eating for 6 or more hours. Sonographic examination is performed to conirm nonvertex presentation, document amnionic fluid volume adequacy, exclude obvious fetal anomalies if not done previously, and identiy placental location and fetal spine orientation. Preprocedural external monitoring is performed to assess fetal heart rate reactivity. Anti-D immune globulin is given to Rh-D negative women. Tocolysis and regional analgesia may be elected, and rationale for these is provided in subsequent sections."

            "content": "Coombs tests use anti-immunoglobulin antibodies to detect the antibodies that cause hemolytic disease of the newborn, or erythroblastosis fetalis. Anti-immunoglobulin antibodies were first developed by Robin Coombs, and the test for this disease is still called the Coombs test. Hemolytic disease of the newborn occurs when a mother makes IgG antibodies specific for the rhesus or Rh bloodgroup antigen expressed on the red blood cells of her fetus. Rh-negative mothers make these antibodies when they are exposed at delivery to Rh-positive fetal red blood cells bearing the paternally inherited Rh antigen. During subsequent pregnancies, these antibodies are transported across the placenta to the fetus. This normal process is generally beneficial, as it protects newborn infants against infection. However, IgG anti-Rh antibodies coat the fetal red blood cells, which are then destroyed by phagocytic cells in the liver, causing a hemolytic anemia in the fetus and newborn infant."
