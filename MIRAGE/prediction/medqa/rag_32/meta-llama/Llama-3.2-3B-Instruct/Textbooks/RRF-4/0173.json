    "question": "A 26-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue, weight loss, and muscle aches during the past 2 months. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. Her only medication is a multivitamin. A metyrapone stimulation test is performed and the results rule out a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Which of the following changes in laboratory findings are most likely to have been observed in this patient following the administration of the drug?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Increase in serum ACTH",
        "B": "Decrease in urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids",
        "C": "Decrease in serum 11-deoxycortisol",
        "D": "Increase in serum cortisol"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's first understand the metyrapone stimulation test and its purpose. Metyrapone is a medication that inhibits the enzyme 11-beta hydroxylase, which is involved in the final step of cortisol production in the adrenal glands. By inhibiting this enzyme, metyrapone reduces cortisol production, but it does not affect the production of other hormones like aldosterone and androgens. The test is used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency, particularly primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease). During the test, the patient is given a high dose of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) to stimulate the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. If the patient has adrenal insufficiency, the cortisol levels will be low. In this case, the metyrapone stimulation test ruled out a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, indicating that the patient's adrenal glands are producing cortisol normally. Now, let's consider the effects of metyrapone on the laboratory findings. Metyrapone inhibits the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. Therefore, administering metyrapone would decrease the levels of serum 11-deoxycortisol. The other options are not directly affected by metyrapone. ACTH levels would not be affected as metyrapone does not affect the production of ACTH. Urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids would not be affected as metyrapone primarily affects the final step of cortisol production, not the production of 17-hydroxycorticosteroids. Cortisol levels would not be affected as the patient's adrenal glands are producing cortisol normally. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Decrease in serum 11-deoxycortisol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

The correct conclusion can usually be reached by keeping these illnesses in mind as one elicits the history from patient and family. Difficulty arises when symptoms of the psychiatric illness are so inconspicuous as not to be appreciated; one comes then to suspect the diagnosis only by having eliminated the common medical causes. Repeated observation may bear out the existence of an anxiety state or gloomy mood. Reassurance in combination with a therapeutic trial of antidepressant drugs may suppress symptoms of which the patient was barely aware, thus clarifying the diagnosis. The best that can be done is to assist the patient in adjusting to the adverse circumstances that have brought him under medical surveillance."

            "content": "Laboratory and radiologic testing has advanced greatly over the past few decades and has become an important component in the evaluation of patients. The dramatic increase in the number of serologic diagnostics, antigen tests, and molecular diagnostics available to the physician has, in fact, revolutionized medical care. However, all of these tests should be viewed as adjuncts to the history and physical examination\u2014not a replacement for them. The selection of initial tests should be based directly on the patient\u2019s history and physical exam findings. Moreover, diagnostic testing should generally be limited to those conditions that are reasonably likely and treatable, important in terms of public health considerations, and/ or capable of providing a definitive diagnosis that will consequently limit other testing."

It is characterized by fatigue, weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and, occasionally, hypoglycemia. In contrast to primary adrenal failure, hypocortisolism associated with pituitary failure usually is not accompanied by hyperpigmentation or mineralocorticoid deficiency."

The classic form of adrenal insufficiency, described by Addison in the nineteenth century, is a result of primary disease of the adrenals. It is characterized by pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss, as well as muscle weakness, languor, and a tendency to faint. Since Addison\u2019s time, hypotension, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and low serum cortisol concentrations have come to be recognized as important laboratory features."

The severity of the patient\u2019s illness, as judged either by the presence of systemic symptoms, such as weakness, fatigue, loss of weight, or by a change in personal habits.

Is she continuously confined to bed? c. Determine the patient\u2019s psychological reaction to her illness (anxiety, depression, irritability, fear) by observing how she relates her story as well as her nonverbal behavior. The response to a question such as, \u201cHave you any particular theories about or fear of what may be the matter with you?\u201d may yield important clues relative to the patient\u2019s understanding and feeling about her illness. The reply may help in the management of the patient\u2019s problem and allow the physician to give advice according to the patient\u2019s understanding of her ailment."

            "content": "Acute adrenal insufficiency usually occurs after a prolonged period of nonspecific complaints and is more frequently observed in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, due to the loss of both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid secretion. Postural hypotension may progress to hypovolemic shock. Adrenal insufficiency may mimic features of acute abdomen with abdominal tenderness, nausea, vomiting, and fever. In some cases, the primary presentation may resemble neurologic disease, with decreased responsiveness, progressing to stupor and coma. An adrenal crisis can be triggered by an intercurrent illness, surgical or other stress, or increased glucocorticoid inactivation (e.g., hyperthyroidism). Abbreviations: ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; GH, growth hormone; LH/FSH, luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone; PRL, prolactin; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone."

Weakness, fatigue, and anorexia with weight loss are common. GI manifestations, hypotension, and salt craving are also seen. Hyperpigmentation (due to \u2191 ACTH secretion) is seen in Addison\u2019s disease, especially in areas of sun exposure or friction. Labs show hyponatremia and eosinophilia (1\u00b0 or 2\u00b0). Hyperkalemia is specific to 1\u00b0 AI. Hypercalcemia is seen in up to one-third of cases. Diagnosis is confirmed with plasma cortisol levels: Low plasma cortisol levels (< 20 \u03bcg/dL) during a period of high physiologic stress is confirmatory. A random plasma cortisol level > 20 \u03bcg/dL excludes the diagnosis. Confrmatory test with synthetic ACTH stimulation test: A plasma cortisol level > 20 \u03bcg/dL excludes the diagnosis. Glucocorticoid replacement, with mineralocorticoid replacement if 1\u00b0."
