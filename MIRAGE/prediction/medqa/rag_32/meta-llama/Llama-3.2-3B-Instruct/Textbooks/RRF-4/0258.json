She further expresses her concerns about the possibility of contracting tuberculosis as one of the patients under her care is being treated for tuberculosis. A PPD skin test is done and reads 11 mm on day 3. Chest X-ray demonstrates a cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe. The standard anti-tuberculosis medication regimen is started. At a follow-up appointment 3 months later the patient presents with fatigue. She has also been experiencing occasional dizziness, weakness, and numbness in her feet. Physical exam is positive for conjunctival pallor. Lab work is significant for a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume of 68 fl. What is the most likely cause of her current symptoms?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with fatigue, dizziness, weakness, and numbness in her feet, which are common symptoms associated with megaloblastic anemia. The patient's lab work shows a low hemoglobin level (10 g/dL) and a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 68 fl, which is consistent with a macrocytic anemia. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate, as both are essential for DNA synthesis and red blood cell production. Given the patient's age and occupation as a nursing home worker, it is possible that she has a deficiency in vitamin B12, which is often seen in individuals with poor dietary habits or malabsorption. The standard anti-tuberculosis medication regimen started earlier may have contributed to the patient's current symptoms, as isoniazid is a known cause of vitamin B6 deficiency, which can lead to megaloblastic anemia. However, the patient's symptoms and lab work are more consistent with a vitamin B12 deficiency. The correct answer is A. Inhibition of ferrochelatase is not directly related to the patient's symptoms. B. Increased homocysteine degradation is a feature of homocystinuria, a different metabolic disorder. C. Increased GABA production is not related to the patient's symptoms. D. Decreased ALA synthesis is related to porphyria, a group of disorders that affect heme production, but is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and lab work.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

He was recently incarcerated near Bakersfield, California and returned to Oakland about 3 months ago. He is currently experiencing one month of severe headache and double vision. He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

            "content": "Primary Disease Primary pulmonary TB occurs soon after the initial infection with tubercle bacilli. It may be asymptomatic or may present with fever and occasionally pleuritic chest pain. In areas of high TB transmission, this form of disease is often seen in children. Because most inspired air is distributed to the middle and lower lung zones, these areas are most commonly involved in primary TB. The lesion forming after initial infection (Ghon focus) is usually peripheral and accompanied by transient hilar or paratracheal lymphadenopathy, which may or may not be visible on standard chest radiography (Fig. 202-4). Some patients develop erythema nodosum on the legs (see Fig. 25e-40) or phlyctenular conjunctivitis. In the majority of cases, the lesion heals spontaneously and becomes evident only as a small calcified nodule. Pleural reaction overlying a subpleural focus is also common. The Ghon focus, with or without overlying pleural reaction, thickening, and regional lymphadenopathy,"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"
