Patient has no significant past medical history and takes no medications.  Her last two pregnancies ended with spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of gestation. No significant family history. Her vital signs include: blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg, pulse 58/min, respiratory rate 11/min, and temperature 36.8\u2103 (98.2\u2109). GCS is 14/15. Physical examination shows 3+ deep tendon reflexes and increased muscle tone in the left upper and lower extremities. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:\nPlatelet count 230,000/mm3\nFibrinogen 3.5 g/L\nActivated partial thromboplastin time  70 s\nThrombin time 34 s\n A non-contrast CT of the head is performed and shown in the picture.

The patient's physical examination shows 3+ deep tendon reflexes and increased muscle tone in the left upper and lower extremities, which suggests upper motor neuron lesions. The laboratory findings of thrombocytopenia (platelet count 230,000/mm^3), elevated activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 70 s, and prolonged thrombin time of 34 s suggest a coagulopathy. The non-contrast CT of the head is not provided, but based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, it is likely that the CT scan shows evidence of hemorrhagic stroke. The next best diagnostic step would be to assess the patient's coagulation status, specifically the International Normalized Ratio (INR), to determine if she has a coagulopathy that may be contributing to her bleeding symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury?

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

Photophobia, nausea, and vomiting are associated with migraine, aneurysmal SAH, and meningitis, but neck stiffness is more likely to accompany the latter two. Neurologic sequelae: Look for diplopia, mental status changes or associated symptoms (numbness, weakness, dizziness, ataxia, visual disturbances), papilledema, or pupillary abnormalities (partial CN III palsy or Horner\u2019s syndrome). Patient risk factors: High-risk patients are > 50 years of age, immunocompromised, or with preexisting malignancy. If SAH is suspected, obtain a head CT without contrast. If CT is , LP is mandatory.
