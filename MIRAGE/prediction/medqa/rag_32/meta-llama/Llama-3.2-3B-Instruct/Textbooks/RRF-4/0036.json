The weakness improves after brief exercise. She also has bladder incontinence for the past 4 weeks and was given an anticholinesterase agent with no improvement.

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with weakness that improves after brief exercise and is more noticeable when performing activities such as climbing stairs and combing hair. This pattern of weakness is characteristic of myasthenia gravis (MG), a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction. The fact that the weakness is not due to fatigue, but rather improves with brief exercise, is a key distinguishing feature of MG. The patient's bladder incontinence and lack of response to an anticholinesterase agent further support this diagnosis. Anticholinesterase agents are often used to treat MG, but in this case, they were ineffective, suggesting that the patient may have a different underlying cause. The other options, such as hypothyroidism and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, do not typically present with this specific pattern of weakness and response to exercise. Paraneoplastic syndrome from small cell carcinoma of the lung is also less likely, as it would typically present with a broader range of symptoms, including weight loss, fever, and other systemic findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

            "content": "Rather than relying on the patient\u2019s report to distinguish between fatigability and weakness, it is more informative to observe the patient during the performance of certain common activities such as walking, climbing stairs, and arising from a sitting, kneeling, squatting, or reclining position or using the arms over the head. Difficulty in performing these tasks signifies weakness rather than fatigue. Sometimes, the weakness of a group of muscles becomes manifest only after a period of activity; for example, the feet and legs may \u201cdrag\u201d only after the patient has walked a long distance. The physician, upon being told this by the patient, should attempt to conduct the examination under circumstances that duplicate the complaints. Of course, these impairments of muscle function may be caused by a neuropathic or central nervous system (CNS) disturbance rather than of a myopathic one, but usually these conditions can be separated by the basic methods indicated further on in this chapter"

            "content": "These disorders are considered together because they are clinically virtually identical and both express themselves by the development of muscle cramps after exercise (actually true physiologic contractures, as described in Chap. 46). In both diseases, an otherwise normal child, adolescent, or adult begins to complain of weakness and stiffness and sometimes pain on using the limbs. Muscle contraction and relaxation are normal when the patient is in repose, but strenuous exercise, either isometric (carrying heavy weights) or dynamic (climbing stairs or walking uphill), causes the muscles to shorten (contracture), a result of their inability to relax. After vigorous exercise, episodes of myoglobinuria are common, in some cases resulting in renal failure. With mild sustained activity, the patient experiences progressive muscle fatigue and weakness, which diminish following a brief pause. The patient can then resume his activities at the original pace (\u201csecond-wind\u201d phenomenon). During"

Certain actions\u2014such as arising from a deep or low chair or from a squatting or kneeling position, climbing or descending stairs, walking, putting an object on a high shelf, or combing the hair\u2014become increasingly difficult. Pain of an aching variety in the buttocks, calves, or shoulders is experienced by approximately 15 percent of patients, and it may indicate a combination of myositis and rheumatoid arthritis, tendonitis, or other rhuematologic disorder."

Patients with anti-MuSK MG generally obtain less benefit from anticholinesterase agents than those with AChR antibodies. Pyridostigmine is the most widely used anticholinesterase drug. The beneficial action of oral pyridostigmine begins within 15\u201330 min and lasts for 3\u20134 h, but individual responses vary. Treatment is begun with a moderate dose, e.g., 30\u201360 mg three to four times daily. The frequency and amount of the dose should be tailored to the patient\u2019s individual requirements throughout the day. For example, patients with weakness in chewing and swallowing may benefit by taking the medication before meals so that peak strength coincides with mealtimes.

The patient notes difficulty that begins in the legs, thighs, and lower back and spreads to the hands, forearms, and shoulders over minutes or more. Only in the severest attacks are the neck and cranial muscles involved; respiratory muscles are usually spared. As the muscles become inexcitable, tendon reflexes are diminished or lost. Attacks usually last 15 to 60 min, and recovery can be hastened by mild exercise. After an attack, mild weakness may persist for a day or 2.

Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of \u201closs of vision.\u201d Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver\u2019s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian"

A 55-year-old woman came to her physician with sensory alteration in the right gluteal (buttock) region and in the intergluteal (natal) cleft. Examination also demonstrated low-grade weakness of the muscles of the foot and subtle weakness of the extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, and fibularis tertius on the right. The patient also complained of some mild pain symptoms posteriorly in the right gluteal region. A lesion was postulated in the left sacrum."

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

            "content": "CliniCal and laboratory findings Usually, symptoms first develop in adulthood and involve exercise intolerance with muscle cramps. Two types of activity tend to cause symptoms: (1) brief exercise of great intensity, such as sprinting or carrying heavy loads; and (2) less intense but sustained activity, such as climbing stairs or walking uphill. Most patients can engage in moderate exercise, such as walking on level ground, for long periods. Patients often exhibit the \u201csecond-wind\u201d phenomenon, in which, after a short break from the initiation of strenuous physical effort, they are able to continue the activity without pain. Although most patients experience episodic muscle pain and cramping as a result of exercise, 35% report permanent pain that seriously affects sleep and other activities. About half of patients report burgundy-colored urine after exercise; this coloration results from myoglobinuria secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Intense myoglobinuria after vigorous exercise can lead to"
