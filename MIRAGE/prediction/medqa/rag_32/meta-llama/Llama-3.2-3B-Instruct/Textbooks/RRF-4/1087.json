    "question": "A 39-year-old man seeks an evaluation in the emergency room due to an episode of syncope at work. He says that he has felt increasing shortness of breath while exercising over the past 6 months. He is a well-built man in mild distress. The vital signs include heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 18/min, temperature 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F), and blood pressure 135/90 mm Hg. The cardiac examination is significant for a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border which is accentuated by forceful expiration against a closed airway. Palpation of the carotid artery shows 2 closely spaced pulses which occur during systole. Which of the following is most consistent with these findings?",

The 2 closely spaced pulses in the carotid artery during systole are also indicative of a dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. This is consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a condition characterized by thickening of the heart muscle that can cause obstruction of blood flow out of the left ventricle. The patient's symptoms of syncope and shortness of breath while exercising are also consistent with HCM. The other options do not match the physical examination findings as closely. Aortic stenosis would typically present with a systolic ejection murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border, cardiac tamponade would present with a muffled heart sounds and distended neck veins, and third-degree heart block would not typically present with a systolic ejection murmur or dynamic carotid pulse abnormalities.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The murmur is soft (grade 1 or 2), is best heard at the lower left sternal border, and may increase in intensity with inspiration (Carvallo\u2019s sign). Regurgitant \u201cc-v\u201d waves may be visible in the jugular venous pulse. TR in this setting is not associated with signs of right heart failure. Mid-Systolic Murmurs Mid-systolic murmurs begin at a short interval after , end before S (Fig. 51e-1C), and are usually crescendo-decrescendo in configuration. Aortic stenosis is the most common cause of a mid-systolic murmur in an adult. The murmur of AS is usually loudest to the right of the sternum in the second intercostal space (aortic area, Fig. 51e-2) and radiates into the carotids. Transmission of the mid-systolic murmur to the apex, where it becomes higher-pitched, is common (Gallavardin effect; see above)."

Accurate bedside identification of coexistent AS can be difficult unless the carotid pulse examination is abnormal or the mid-systolic murmur is of grade 4 or greater intensity. In the absence of heart failure, chronic severe AR is accompanied by several peripheral signs of significant diastolic run-off, including a wide pulse pressure, a \u201cwater-hammer\u201d carotid upstroke (Corrigan\u2019s pulse), and Quincke\u2019s pulsations of the nail beds. The diastolic murmur of acute, severe AR is notably shorter in duration and lower pitched than the murmur of chronic AR. It can be very difficult to appreciate in the presence of a rapid heart rate.

Other physical signs of ventricular dysfunction include fourth and third heart sounds, decreased intensity of the first heart sound, and paradoxical splitting of the second heart sound (Chap. 267). A transient midsystolic or late systolic apical systolic murmur due to dysfunction of the mitral valve apparatus may be present. A pericardial friction rub may be heard in patients with transmural STEMI at some time in the course of the disease, if they are examined frequently.

The intensity of the murmur increases during maneuvers that increase cardiac output and mitral valve flow, such as exercise. The duration of the murmur reflects the length of time over which left atrial pressure exceeds left ventricular diastolic pressure. An increase in the intensity of the murmur just before S1, a phenomenon known as presystolic accentuation (Figs. 51e-1A and 51e-6), occurs in patients in sinus rhythm and is due to a late increase in transmitral flow with atrial contraction.

The continuous mammary souffle of pregnancy is created by enhanced arterial flow through engorged breasts and usually appears during the late third trimester or early puerperium. The murmur is louder in systole. Firm pressure with the diaphragm of the stethoscope can eliminate the diastolic portion of the murmur. (Table 51e-2; see Table 267-1) Careful attention to the behavior of heart murmurs during simple maneuvers that alter cardiac hemodynamics can provide important clues to their cause and significance. Respiration Auscultation should be performed during quiet respiration or with a modest increase in inspiratory effort, as more forceful"

            "content": "Auscultation The first heart sound (S1) is usually accentuated in the early stages of the disease and slightly delayed. The pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) also is often accentuated with elevated PA pressures, and the two components of the second heart sound (S2) are closely split. The opening snap (OS) of the mitral valve is most readily audible in expiration at, or just medial to, the cardiac apex. This sound generally follows the sound of aortic valve closure (A2) by 0.05\u20130.12 s. The time interval between A2 and OS varies inversely with the severity of the MS. The OS is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, diastolic murmur, heard best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral recumbent position (see Fig. 267-5); it is accentuated by mild exercise (e.g., a few rapid sit-ups) carried out just before auscultation. In general, the duration of this murmur correlates with the severity of the stenosis in patients with preserved CO. In patients with sinus rhythm,"

            "content": "The neck veins in patients with severe TR are distended with prominent c-v waves and rapid y descents (in the absence of TS). TR is more often diagnosed by examination of the neck veins than by auscultation of the heart sounds. Other findings may include marked hepatomegaly with systolic pulsations, ascites, pleural effusions, edema, and a positive hepatojugular reflex. A prominent RV pulsation along the left parasternal region and a blowing holosystolic murmur along the lower left sternal margin, which may be intensified during inspiration (Carvallo\u2019s sign) and reduced during expiration or the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver, are characteristic findings. The murmur of TR may sometimes be confused with that of MR unless attention is paid to its variation during the respiratory cycle and the extent of RV enlargement is appreciated. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is usually present in the chronic phase of the disease."

Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."

            "content": "A short, mid-diastolic murmur is rarely heard during an episode of acute rheumatic fever (Carey-Coombs murmur) and probably is due to flow through an edematous mitral valve. An opening snap is not present in the acute phase, and the murmur dissipates with resolution of the acute attack. Complete heart block with dyssynchronous atrial and ventricular activation may be associated with intermittent midto late diastolic murmurs if atrial contraction occurs when the mitral valve is partially closed. Mid-diastolic murmurs indicative of increased tricuspid valve flow can occur with severe, isolated TR and with large ASDs and significant left-to-right shunting. Other signs of an ASD are present (Chap. 282), including fixed splitting of S2 and a mid-systolic murmur at the midto upper left sternal border. TTE is indicated for evaluation of a patient with a midto late diastolic murmur. Findings specific to the diseases discussed above will help guide management."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"
