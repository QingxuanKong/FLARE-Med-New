He has a history of several episodes of mild bone pain in the past treated with over the counter analgesics. On physical examination, the child is icteric with nonspecific pain in his hands. His hands are swollen, tender, and warm. There is no chest pain, abdominal pain, fever, or hematuria. A complete metabolic panel and complete blood count with manual differential are performed:\nTotal bilirubin\n8.4 mg/dL\nWBC\n9,800/mm3\nHemoglobin \n6.5 g/dL\nMCV 82.3 fL\nPlatelet count  465,000/mm3\nReticulocyte 7%\nPeripheral blood smear shows multiple clumps of elongated and curved cells and erythrocytes with nuclear remnant.

The child has jaundice, normocytic anemia, and severe bone pain, which suggests a hematological disorder. The physical examination reveals swollen, tender, and warm hands, which may indicate a bone or joint disorder. The laboratory results show a high reticulocyte count, which suggests an increased red blood cell production. The peripheral blood smear shows multiple clumps of elongated and curved cells and erythrocytes with nuclear remnant, which is consistent with sickle cell disease. The hemoglobin electrophoresis result is not provided, but based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, sickle cell disease is the most likely cause. Sickle cell trait (A) is unlikely because it typically presents with mild anemia and no significant clinical symptoms. Hemoglobin F (C) is not a cause of anemia or bone pain. HbC (D) is a hemoglobin variant that can cause anemia and jaundice, but the clinical presentation and laboratory findings are more consistent with sickle cell disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Irritation of the obturator nerve can cause referred pain in the thigh and knee when the pathology is at the hip. Patients with transient synovitis are often afebrile, walk with a painful limp, and have normal to minimally elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate compared with bacterial diseases of the hip (Table 199-1). Table 197-3 lists the differential diagnosis of a limping child. Anteroposterior and frog-leg radiographs of the hip are usually normal. Ultrasonography may reveal a joint effusion.

The anemia is usually normomacrocytic, with unremarkable red cell morphology. If the MCV is high, it is usually largely accounted for by reticulocytosis, which may be quite marked (up to 20%, or up to 400,000/\u03bcL). The anemia may become microcytic if the patient is allowed to become iron deficient as a result of chronic urinary blood loss through hemoglobinuria. Unconjugated bilirubin is mildly or moderately elevated; LDH is typically markedly elevated (values in the thousands are common); and haptoglobin is usually undetectable. All of these findings make the diagnosis of hemolytic anemia compelling.

The blood smear reveals only microcytosis with \u03b1-thalassemia trait. Outside the neonatal period, when Bart hemoglobin is detectable, hemoglobin electrophoresis usually is normal in \u03b1-thalassemia minor (see Fig. 150-3). Blood smears of patients with \u03b2-thalassemia minor show microcytic RBCs. Target cells and basophilic stippled RBCs, caused by precipitation of alpha chain tetramers, also may be present. The diagnosis is based on an elevation of hemoglobin A2 and F levels in \u03b2-thalassemia. Molecular testing is indicated for identification of more severe or unusual variants."

The patient had noted progressive weakness over several days, to the point that he was unable to rise from bed. Past medical history was notable for small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, liver, and adrenals. The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced. Blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, increasing to 160/98 mmHg after 1 L of saline, with a JVP at 8 cm. There was generalized muscle weakness.

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

Anemia is a disorder of low hematocrit and hemoglobin. There are several subtypes, which are classified according to red cell morphology (MCV, RDW, color, shape) and reticulocyte count (see Figure 2.7-3). Once anemia has been diagnosed by a low hemoglobin/hematocrit, the approach starts with the MCV. An MCV < 80 fL indicates microcytic anemia; between 80 fL and 100 fL is normocytic; and > 100 fL is macrocytic. A condition in which iron loss exceeds intake.

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

Features that suggest bone marrow failure and mandate an examination of bone marrow include a low reticulocyte count, teardrop forms of RBCs(implying marrow replacement, not just failure), presenceof abnormal forms of leukocytes or myeloid elements lessmature than band forms, small platelets, and an elevatedmean corpuscular volume in the face of a low reticulocytecount. Pancytopenia resulting from bone marrow failure isusually a gradual process, starting with one or two cell lines, but later involving all three cell lines. Features suggestingincreased destruction include reticulocytosis, jaundice,immature erythroid or myeloid elements on the blood smear,large platelets, and increased serum bilirubin and lactic dehydrogenase.
