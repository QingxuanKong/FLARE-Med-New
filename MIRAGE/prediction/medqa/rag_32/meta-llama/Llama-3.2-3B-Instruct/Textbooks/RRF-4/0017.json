    "question": "A 3-month-old boy is brought the emergency department by his parents after an episode of cyanosis and muscle hypotonia that resolved after 2 minutes. Diagnostic evaluation fails to discover an exact etiology of the boy's symptoms and the episode is classified as a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). The risk profile for BRUE in infants remains largely unknown. The pediatrician who saw the boy in the emergency department is trying to identify risk factors for BRUE. She is aware of several confounders, including age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She recruits 75 infants under 1 year of age with BRUE and 75 infants without BRUE of the same age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She then compares the two groups with regard to history of feeding problems and history of recent upper respiratory infection. Which of the following methods was conducted to control confounding bias in the study?",

    "predict": "To determine the correct answer, let's break down the concept of controlling confounding bias in the study described. Confounding bias occurs when a third variable (the confounder) affects the outcome and is related to both the exposure and the outcome. In this case, the confounders mentioned are age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. To control for confounding bias, we need to ensure that the groups being compared are similar in terms of these confounders. The study described recruited 75 infants with BRUE and 75 infants without BRUE, ensuring that the groups are similar in terms of age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. Now, let's examine the options: A. Blinding: Blinding refers to concealing the treatment or exposure from the researcher or participant to reduce bias. While blinding can help reduce bias, it does not address confounding bias directly. B. Restriction: Restriction refers to limiting the sample to a specific group or population. While restriction can help control for certain biases, it does not necessarily control for confounding bias. C. Randomization: Randomization involves randomly assigning participants to groups to ensure that the groups are similar in terms of the confounders. However, in this case, the study did not randomize the participants, and the groups were already similar in terms of confounders. D. Matching: Matching involves pairing participants with similar characteristics in the exposed and non-exposed groups. In this case, the study matched the groups by history of feeding problems and history of recent upper respiratory infection, which are related to BRUE. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The study matched the groups by history of feeding problems and history of recent upper respiratory infection, which are related to BRUE, to control for confounding bias.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Infection with HRSV is seen throughout the world in annual epidemics that occur in late fall, winter, or spring and last up to 5 months. The virus is rarely encountered during the summer. Rates of illness are highest among infants 1\u20136 months of age, peaking at 2\u20133 months of age. The attack rates among susceptible infants and children are extraordinarily high, approaching 100% in settings such as daycare centers where large numbers of susceptible infants are present. By age 2, virtually all children will have been infected with HRSV. HRSV accounts for 20\u201325% of hospital admissions of young infants and children for pneumonia and for up to 75% of cases of bronchiolitis in this age group. It has been estimated that more than half of infants who are at risk will become infected during an HRSV epidemic."

Current World Health Organization (2013) recommendations are to exclusively breastfeed for the first 6 months of life with partial breastfeeding until 2 years of age. Neonatal infection, especially in its early stages, may be dificult to diagnose because these newborns often fail to express classic clinical signs. If the fetus was infected in utero, there may be depression and acidosis at birth for no apparent reason. The neonate may suck poorly, vomit, or show abdominal distention. Respiratory insuiciency can develop, which may present similarly to idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome. he neonate may be lethargic or jittery. he response to sepsis may be hypothermia rather than hyperthermia, and the total leukocyte and neutrophil counts may be depressed."

Inborn errors of metabolism often present a fewhours to weeks after birth, often mimicking late-onset sepsis.Infants who survive the neonatal period without developingrecognized symptoms often experience intermittent illness separated by periods of being well. While pursuing the evaluationof the specific clinical presentations (e.g., the approach to thesick newborn, irritable child, or child with liver dysfunction),the hypoglycemic and intoxicating (encephalopathy) metabolicdisorders should be considered in all neonates presenting withlethargy, poor tone, poor feeding, hypothermia, irritability, orseizures. In most cases these should be evaluated for by assessment of plasma ammonia, blood glucose, and anion gap (Fig. 51-2). Significant ketosis in the neonate is unusual and suggests"

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

The two critical clinical points are whether the child is weak and the presence or absence of deep tendon reflexes. Hypotonia and weakness coupled with depressed or absent deep tendon reflexes suggest a neuromuscular disorder. A stronger child with brisk reflexes suggests an upper motor neuron source for the hypotonia. Causes of neonatal weakness are outlined earlier. A diagnostic algorithm for infants with hypotonia or weakness is presented in Figure 182-1.

Polysomnography is not useful in predicting which children with ALTEs are likely to progress to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The key to prevention of future events is to identify the underlying cause and treat it. Teaching parents infant cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and attempting to alleviate anxiety surrounding the event are recommended."

Prevalent cases are incident cases that have persisted in a population for various reasons: Prevalence = Incidence \u00d7 Average duration of disease A prevalence study is one in which people in a population are examined for the presence of a disease of interest at a given point in time. The advantages of prevalence studies are as follows: They provide an effcient means of examining a population, allowing cases and noncases to be assessed all at once. They can be used as a basis for diagnostic testing. They can be used to plan which health services to offer and where. Their disadvantages include the following: One cannot determine causal relationships because information is obtained only at a single point in time. The risk or incidence of disease cannot be directly measured."
