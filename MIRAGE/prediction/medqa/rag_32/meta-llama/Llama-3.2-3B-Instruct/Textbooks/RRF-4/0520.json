    "question": "Mutations in the ATP2A1 gene results in loss of function of the calcium ATPase pump, which is in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes of skeletal muscle in humans. This mutation results in a rare disease characterized by muscle cramping and stiffening that is usually most severe after exercise or strenuous activity and is typically relieved after affected individuals rest for a few minutes. Which of the following is expected in individuals with an ATP2A1 gene mutation?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to understand the function of the ATP2A1 gene and the effects of its mutation on muscle function. The ATP2A1 gene encodes the calcium ATPase pump, which is responsible for pumping calcium ions (Ca++) out of the cytosol and into the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle cells. This process is crucial for muscle relaxation after contraction. A mutation in the ATP2A1 gene would disrupt this function, leading to an accumulation of calcium ions in the cytosol. This would result in a prolonged relaxation phase, making it difficult for the muscle to relax. Therefore, the muscle relaxation time would be increased. Additionally, the increased cytosolic calcium concentration would lead to muscle stiffness and cramping, especially after exercise or strenuous activity. After rest, the cytosolic calcium concentration would decrease, and the muscle would relax. Thus, the correct answer is A. Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Muscle contraction is normal but the relaxation phase becomes increasingly slow during exercise. Lambert and Goldstein referred to it as an unusual type of myotonia, and Brody, as a decrease of \u201crelaxing factor\u201d; the slow relaxation has also been attributed to a decreased uptake of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In some cases, the disease is transmitted as a recessive trait with a mutation that impairs the function of a sarcoplasmic reticular calcium adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase). In other instances, the disease is transmitted as a dominant trait that is not genetically linked to calcium ATPase. This latter process may be more closely aligned with the muscular dystrophies and is mentioned in Chap. 45 under that heading. Tetanus (See Tetanus in Chap. 41)"

Table 46-4 summarizes the main features of the ion channel diseases affecting muscle and the individual members of the group are described as follows. This is an uncommon disease of skeletal muscle that begins in early life and is characterized by myotonia, muscular hypertrophy, nonprogressive course, and dominant inheritance. It is distinctly different from myotonic dystrophy, which is characterized by a progressive degeneration of muscle fibers and has a different genetic basis. Thomsen disease is caused by one of several inherited molecular defects in the voltage-dependent chloride channel gene (CLCN1), (see Koch et al). It is interesting that most mutations behave as dominant traits, whereas others have either a dominant or recessive pattern of inheritance (see Table 46-4). The physiologic mechanism whereby these mutations alter ion fluxes across the muscle membrane and cause myotonia is described further on."

Mutations in genes that encode voltage-gated Na+ channels in skeletal muscle cells, for example, can cause myotonia, a condition in which there is a delay in muscle relaxation after voluntary contraction, causing painful muscle spasms. In some cases, this occurs because the abnormal channels fail to inactivate normally; as a result, Na+ entry persists after an action potential finishes and repeatedly reinitiates membrane depolarization and muscle contraction. Similarly, mutations that affect Na+ or K+ channels in the brain can cause epilepsy, in which excessive synchronized firing of large groups of neurons causes epileptic seizures (convulsions, or fits)."

Stress, exercise, or excessive fatigue may be precipitants. Acetazolamide may be therapeutic and can reverse the relative intracellular alkalosis detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Stop codon, nonsense mutations causing EA-2 have been found in the CACNA1A gene, encoding the voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit (see \u201cSCA6,\u201d above)."

In yet another type of muscle stiffness, the muscle may ripple or respond to percussion by mounding and rapidly contrasting and relaxing. Cramping should also be differentiated from restless leg syndrome (see Chap. 18), which is primarily a nocturnal disorder but may carry over into the daytime hours."

            "content": "A gene for the neonatal form of centronuclear myopathy has been localized to Xq28; this gene encodes myotubularin, a protein tyrosine phosphatase. Missense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations predict loss of myotubularin function in affected individuals. Carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis are possible. Autosomal recessive forms are caused by mutations in BIB1 that encodes for amphyphysin-2, whereas some autosomal dominant cases, which are allelic to a form of CMT2, are associated with mutations in the gene that encodes dynamin-2. No specific medical treatments are available at this time. There are two principal sources of energy for skeletal muscle\u2014fatty acids and glucose. Abnormalities in either glucose or lipid utilization can be associated with distinct clinical presentations that can range from an acute, painful syndrome with rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria to a chronic, progressive muscle weakness simulating muscular dystrophy."

            "content": "The pattern of inheritance is autosomal dominant as noted, with an onset usually in infancy and childhood. Characteristically, attacks of weakness occur before breakfast and later in the day, particularly when resting following exercise. In the latter case, the weakness appears after 20 to 30 min of becoming sedentary. The patient notes difficulty that begins in the legs, thighs, and lower back and spreads to the hands, forearms, and shoulders over minutes or more. Only in the severest attacks are the neck and cranial muscles involved; respiratory muscles are usually spared. As the muscles become inexcitable, tendon reflexes are diminished or lost. Attacks usually last 15 to 60 min, and recovery can be hastened by mild exercise. After an attack, mild weakness may persist for a day or 2. In severe cases, the attacks may occur every day; during late adolescence and the adult years, when the patient becomes more sedentary, the attacks may diminish and even cease entirely. In certain"
