His duty as a member of the team is to collect serum samples of the subjects every 4 hours and send them for analysis of serum drug levels. He is also supposed to collect, document and analyze the data. For one of the subjects, he notices that the subject is eliminating 0.5 mg of the drug every 4 hours. Which of the following anticoagulants did this patient most likely consume?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which anticoagulant the patient most likely consumed, we need to consider the elimination rate of each option. The patient is eliminating 0.5 mg of the drug every 4 hours. We can calculate the elimination rate per hour for each option as follows: - Warfarin: 0.5 mg / 4 hours = 0.125 mg/hour - Enoxaparin: Not enough information is provided about Enoxaparin's elimination rate, but it is generally eliminated through the kidneys and has a half-life of around 1-2 hours. - Fondaparinux: Not enough information is provided about Fondaparinux's elimination rate, but it is generally eliminated through the kidneys and has a half-life of around 11-17 hours. - Apixaban: 0.5 mg / 4 hours = 0.125 mg/hour Based on the elimination rates, Apixaban and Warfarin have the same elimination rate of 0.125 mg/hour. However, the elimination rate of Apixaban is more consistent with the elimination rate of warfarin. Therefore, the patient most likely consumed Apixaban.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Within a narrow therapeutic range, warfarin is highly effective for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders (Chapter 34). Nevertheless, interpatient differences in dosing requirements (up to 20-fold) often lead to complications from subtherapeutic anticoagulation and clotting or supratherapeutic anticoagulation and bleeding, which are among the most common causes for emergency room visits in the United States. Understanding the factors that contribute to variability in individual warfarin maintenance doses may improve therapeutic outcomes."

These include assessment of adherence, detection of accumulation or overdose, identification of bleeding mechanisms, and determination of activity prior to surgery or intervention. For qualitative assessment of anticoagulant activity, the prothrombin time can be used for factor Xa inhibitors and the aPTT for dabigatran. Rivaroxaban and edoxaban prolong the prothrombin time more than apixaban. In fact, because apixaban has such a limited effect on the prothrombin time, anti-factor Xa assays are needed to assess its activity. The effect of the drugs on tests of coagulation varies depending on the time that the blood is drawn relative to the timing of the last dose of the drug and the reagents used to perform the tests.

A plasma concentration of heparin of 0.2\u20130.4 unit/mL (by protamine titration) or 0.3\u20130.7 unit/mL (anti-Xa units) is considered to be the therapeutic range for treatment of venous thromboembolic disease. This concentration generally corresponds to a PTT of 1.5\u20132.5 times baseline. However, the use of the PTT for heparin monitoring is problematic. There is no standardization scheme for the PTT as there is for the prothrombin time (PT) and its international normalized ratio (INR) in warfarin monitoring. The PTT in seconds for a given heparin concentration varies between different reagent/ instrument systems. Thus, if the PTT is used for monitoring, the laboratory should determine the clotting time that corresponds to the therapeutic range by protamine titration or anti-Xa activity, as listed above."

In addition, these drugs offer the advantages of rapid therapeutic effect, no monitoring requirement, and fewer drug interactions in comparison with warfarin, which has a narrow therapeutic window, is affected by diet and many drugs, and requires monitoring for dosage optimization. However, the short half-life of the newer anticoagulants has the important consequence that patient noncompliance will quickly lead to loss of anticoagulant effect and risk of thromboembolism. Given the convenience of onceor twice-daily oral dosing, lack of a monitoring requirement, and fewer drug and dietary interactions documented thus far, the new direct oral anticoagulants represent a significant advance in the prevention and therapy of thrombotic disease."

The prothrombin time (PT) should be increased to a level representing a reduction of prothrombin activity to 25% of normal and maintained there for long-term therapy. When the activity is less than 20%, the warfarin dosage should be reduced or omitted until the activity rises above 20%. Inherited polymorphisms in 2CYP2C9 and VKORC1 have significant effects on warfarin dosing; however, algorithms incorporating genomic information to predict initial warfarin dosing were no better than standard clinical algorithms in two of three large randomized trials examining this issue (see Chapter 5)."

            "content": "When a woman is admitted in labor, most often the hematocrit or hemoglobin concentration is checked. he hematocrit can be measured easily and quickly. At Parkland Hospital, blood is collected in a standard collection tube with anticoagulant. From this, a heparinized capillary tube is filled to spin in a microhematocrit centrifuge in the labor and delivery unit. his provides a hematocrit value within 3 minutes. he initial collection tube is also sent to the hematology laboratory for evaluation if the point-of-care hematocrit is <30 volume percent. Another labeled tube of blood is allowed to clot and sent to the blood bank for blood type and antibody screen, if needed. A final sample is collected for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology. In some labor units, a cleancatch voided specimen is examined in all women for protein and glucose. At Parkland Hospital, however, we obtain a urine specimen for protein determination in hypertensive women only (Table 40-1, p. 712)."

Drug displaced from plasma protein will of course distribute throughout the volume of distribution, so that a 5% increase in the amount of unbound drug in the body produces at most a 5% increase in pharmaco-logically active unbound drug at the site of action. Second, when the amount of unbound drug in plasma increases, the rate of elimination will increase (if unbound clearance is unchanged), and after four half-lives the unbound concentration will return to its previous steady-state value. When drug interactions associated with protein binding displacement and clinically important effects have been studied, it has been found that the displacing drug is also an inhibitor of clearance, and it is the change in clearance of the unbound drug that is the relevant mechanism explaining the interaction.

            "content": "An initial determination of serum lithium concentration should be obtained about 5 days after the start of treatment, at which time steady-state conditions should have been attained. If the clinical response suggests a change in dosage, simple arithmetic (new dose equals present dose times desired blood level divided by present blood level) should produce the desired level. The serum concentration attained with the adjusted dosage can be checked after another 5 days. Once the desired concentration has been achieved, levels can be measured at increasing intervals unless the schedule is influenced by intercurrent illness or the introduction of a new drug into the treatment program."
