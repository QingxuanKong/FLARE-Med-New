    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with altered mental status, fluctuating level of consciousness, and a history of alcohol abuse, which are red flags for delirium tremens (DTs). DTs is a serious condition that can occur in individuals with alcohol use disorder, typically after a period of alcohol withdrawal. The patient's symptoms, such as fluctuating level of consciousness and disorientation, are consistent with DTs. The presence of multiple empty bottles of medication on the floor suggests that the patient may have been experiencing intense alcohol withdrawal symptoms, which can lead to DTs. The correct answer is likely A. Hallucinations, as DTs is often characterized by visual, auditory, and sometimes tactile hallucinations. The other options are not directly related to the patient's presentation. Irreversibility (B) is not a finding that would be present in this patient, as DTs can be treated and reversed with supportive care and medication. Multi-infarct dementia (C) is a type of dementia caused by small vessel disease, which is not suggested by the patient's presentation. Normal vital signs (D) are not expected in a patient with DTs, as they often present with vital sign instability, including hypertension, tachycardia, and hypotension.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Otherwise the patient must be admitted for a 24-hour observation period.Patients with depressed consciousness, focal neurologic deficits, penetrating injury, depressed skull fracture, or changing neurologic examination have a high risk for intracranial injury. These patients should undergo immediate head CT and admis-sion for observation or intervention as needed.Types of Closed Head Injury Concussion A concussion is defined as temporary neuronal dysfunction following nonpenetrating head trauma. The head CT is normal, and deficits resolve over minutes to hours. Defini-tions vary; some require transient loss of consciousness, while others include patients with any alteration of mental status.

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

A medical emergency consisting of prolonged (> 10-minute) or repetitive seizures that occur without a return to baseline consciousness. May be either convulsive (the more medically urgent form) or nonconvulsive. Common causes include anticonvulsant withdrawal/noncompliance, anoxic brain injury, EtOH/sedative withdrawal or other drug intoxication, metabolic disturbances (e.g., hyponatremia), head trauma, and infection. Death usually results from the underlying medical condition and may occur in 10% of cases of status epilepticus. Determine the underlying cause with pulse oximetry, CBC, electrolytes, calcium, glucose, ABGs, LFTs, BUN/creatinine, ESR, antiepileptic drug levels, and a toxicology screen. Obtain an EEG and brain imaging, but defer testing until the patient is stabilized. Obtain a stat head CT to evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage."

There are others, however, who, at certain periods of life, usually adolescence or early adulthood, begin to have episodes of wild, aggressive behavior. Alcohol or some other drug may trigger episodes. One suspects epilepsy, but there is no history of a recognizable seizure or interruption of consciousness, typical of focal temporal lobe epilepsy. We have been consulted from time to time on patients who report a proclivity to anger, cursing, and momentary unreasonableness in behavior that is acquired in adulthood. Each of these patients described a first-order relative with the same traits. Most such individuals are remorseful afterward and otherwise function at a high cognitive level. In a very few such cases, in which aggression has resulted in serious injury to others (or homicide),"
