    "question": "A one-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for bilious vomiting. The patient has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium. He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patient\u2019s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. Her last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. The patient\u2019s two older siblings are both healthy. The patient\u2019s temperature is 97.8\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 58/37 mmHg, pulse is 166/min, and respirations are 38/min. On physical exam, the patient is in moderate distress.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely etiology of the patient's presentation, let's analyze the given information step by step. The patient is a one-day-old male who has bilious vomiting and has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium. He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a mother with a history of gestational diabetes. The quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation showed decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. The patient's last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. Given the patient's symptoms of bilious vomiting and the fact that he has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium, we can consider several potential etiologies. However, the quadruple screen results suggest an increased risk for certain fetal anomalies, including neural tube defects and chromosomal abnormalities. The decreased AFP and decreased unconjugated estriol on the quadruple screen are particularly concerning for neural tube defects, such as spina bifida or anencephaly. However, the increased beta-hCG and increased inhibin A do not strongly suggest a neural tube defect. The patient's amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm is also low, which can be seen in cases of intestinal obstruction or other conditions that reduce amniotic fluid volume. Considering the patient's symptoms of bilious vomiting and the low AFI, we can consider the possibility of intestinal obstruction. Meconium ileus is a condition where the meconium is thick and sticky, causing intestinal obstruction, and it is often associated with cystic fibrosis. This condition is a possible explanation for the patient's presentation. The other options are less likely. Duodenal atresia is a congenital obstruction of the duodenum, but it is not typically associated with a low AFI. Necrotizing enterocolitis is a condition that can cause intestinal obstruction, but it is more common in preterm infants and is not typically associated with a low AFI. Pyloric stenosis is a condition that causes vomiting, but it is not typically associated with bilious vomiting or a low AFI. Therefore, the most likely etiology of this fetus's presentation is meconium ileus, which is often associated with cystic fibrosis.\" \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

Review of the past history and growth chart demonstrates normal birth weight and birth length, but a progressive decrease in height per-centiles relative to age-matched normal ranges starting at 6 months of age, and orthostasis with febrile illnesses. Physical examination demonstrates short stature and mild generalized obesity. Genital examination reveals descended but small testes and a phallic length of \u20132 SD. Laboratory evaluations demonstrate growth hormone (GH) deficiency and a delayed bone age of 18 months. The patient is started on replacement with recombinant human GH at a dose of 40 mcg/kg per day subcutaneously. After 1 year of treatment, his height velocity has increased from 5 cm/y to 11 cm/y.

            "content": "The presentation of patients with an abdominal pregnancy varies and depends on the gestational age. In the first and early second trimesters, the symptoms may be the same as with tubal ectopic gestation; in advanced abdominal pregnancy, the clinical presentation is more variable. The patient may report painful fetal movement, fetal movements high in the abdomen, or sudden cessation of movements. Physical examination may disclose persistent abnormal fetal positioning, abdominal tenderness, a displaced uterine cervix, easy palpation of fetal parts, and palpation of the uterus separate from the gestation. The diagnosis may be suspected when there are no uterine contractions after oxytocin infusion. Other diagnostic aids include abdominal radiography, abdominal ultrasonography, CT, and MRI (261\u2013263)."

He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

Women currently have the option of neural-tube defect screening with MSAFP, sonography, or both (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2016). Serum screening is generally performed between 15 and 20 weeks' gestation. And, if using an upper threshold of 2.5 multiples of the median (MoM), the anticipated detection rate is at least 90 percent for fetal anencephaly and 80 percent for myelomeningocele. Targeted sonography is the preferred diagnostic test, and in addition to characterizing the neural-tube defect, it may identiy other abnormalities or conditions that also result in MSAFP elevation (Table 14-6, p. 283)."

The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative."

            "content": "Historically, prenatal screening involved maternal serum screening for \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP), a protein secreted during fetal life by the liver, gastrointestinal tract, and yolk sac. Some of the AFP crosses the placenta and enters the maternal circulation. Although maternal serum screening was initially used to detect high levels of AFP associated with neural tube defects (NTDs) and the disruption of fetal integument such as omphalocele or gastroschisis, low levels of AFP were found to be associated with fetal aneuploidy. Approximately 50% of fetuses with autosomal trisomies (Down syndrome, trisomy 18, trisomy 13) will be detected by low maternal serum AFP levels. Three other proteins\u2014unconjugated estriol (uE3),inhibin A, and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)\u2014were added to the maternal serum screening to create the quad screen. The addition of these compounds increased the detection rate to about 80%."

Typically used only in research, as the exact date of fertilization is not commonly known. Gestational age (GA): The number of weeks and days measured from the frst day of the last menstrual period (LMP). GA can also be determined by: Fundal height: At 20 weeks, the uterus is at the umbilicus and grows approximately 1 cm/week. Quickening, or appreciation of fetal movement: Typically occurs at 17\u201318 weeks. Fetal heart tones: Can be heard at 10\u201312 weeks by Doppler. Ultrasound: Measures fetal crown-rump length (CRL) at 5\u201312 weeks and measures biparietal diameter (BPD), femur length (FL), and abdominal circumference (AC) from 13 weeks. Ultrasound measurement of GA is most reliable during the f rst trimester."
