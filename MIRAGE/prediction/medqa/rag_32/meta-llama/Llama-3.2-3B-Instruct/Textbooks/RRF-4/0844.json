    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the clinical presentation and determine the underlying condition. The patient is a 14-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea, low height percentile, and delayed sexual development (Tanner stage 1). The physical examination reveals a broad chest with widely spaced nipples, a low posterior hairline, and shortened fourth metacarpals. These findings are characteristic of Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects females. Turner syndrome is caused by the absence of one X chromosome (45,X), which leads to primary ovarian failure and infertility. The patient's fertility options are limited due to ovarian failure. Let's evaluate the options: A. Pregnancy success rate with donor oocytes: While donor oocytes can be used to achieve pregnancy, the success rate may vary depending on the individual's age, egg quality, and other factors. However, it is not the most accurate statement regarding the patient's fertility. B. Administration of gonadotropins: Gonadotropins are typically used to stimulate ovarian function in individuals with hypothalamic or pituitary disorders, not in those with primary ovarian failure. This option is not relevant to the patient's condition. C. Impaired tubal ciliary function: Turner syndrome is not primarily associated with impaired tubal ciliary function. This option is not directly related to the patient's fertility. D. The majority of patients become pregnant without medical assistance: Turner syndrome is a significant cause of infertility, and the majority of patients require medical assistance, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or egg donation, to conceive. This option is the most accurate statement regarding the patient's fertility.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Constitutional delay is the most common cause of delayed puberty. In a normal population, 2% to 3% of normal children will be classified as having pubertal delay, and this finding may be considered a normal variant. Constitutional delayed growth and adolescence can be diagnosed only after careful evaluation excludes other causes of delayed puberty and normal sexual development is documented by longitudinal follow-up. The farther below the third percentile for height that the young girl is, the less likely it is that the cause is constitutional. Because some children are severely handicapped socially by constitutional pubertal delay, some physicians occasionally provide exogenous estrogen in low doses for 3 to 4 months to stimulate some pubertal"

Concerns of weight gain and long-term decrease in bone mineral density with the use of GnRHa do not seem to be warranted. The most important clinical criterion for initiating GnRHa treatment is documented progression of pubertal development over a 3-to 6-month period. This observational period may not be necessary if the child is at or past Tanner stage 3, particularly with advanced skeletal maturation. It appears that discontinuation of GnRHa at a chronological age of about 11 years and a bone age of about 12 years is associated with maximum adult height (77\u201379).

Anecdotal photographs and data such as these served to provide the basis for the theory that body fat, body mass, and menarche are linked. (From Wilkins L.

The nipple is generally below the midplane of breast tissue when the woman is seated and viewed from the side. Full breast development usually occurs over 3 to 3.5 years, but it may occur in as little as 2 years or not progress beyond stage 4 until the first pregnancy. Breast size is no indication of breast maturity."

With routine cytogenetic methods, the entire X chromosome is found to be missing in 57% of patients, resulting in a 45,X karyotype. These patients are the most severely affected, and the diagnosis often can be made at birth or early in childhood. Typical clinical features associated with 45,X Turner syndrome include growth retardation, leading to abnormally short stature (below the third percentile); swelling of the nape of the neck because of distended lymphatic channels (in infancy) that is seen as webbing of the neck in older children; low posterior hairline; cubitus valgus (an increase in the carrying angle of the arms); shieldlike chest with widely spaced nipples; high-arched palate; lymphedema of the hands and feet; and a variety of congenital malformations such as horseshoe kidney, bicuspid aortic"

Disorders of sexual development and amenorrhea may be considered in relation to this classification of the aberrations of puberty. It is very helpful to document the growth of the individual and to plot the individual\u2019s height and weight on one of several commonly available growth charts (Fig. 29.7)."

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

Women may be affected, and other associated defects may include cleft lip and palate, cerebellar ataxia, nerve deafness, and abnormalities of thirst and vasopressin release. The frequency approximates Figure 29.11 A: A 16-year-old individual with 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis and primary amenorrhea. Circulating follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were markedly elevated. The small amount of breast development (Tanner stage 2) is unusual, but some pubertal development may occur in such patients."

Constitutional growth delay: A normal variant, and the most common cause of delayed puberty. The growth curve lags behind others of the same age but is consistent. There is often a family history, and children ultimately achieve target height potential. Pathological puberty delay: Rarely, due to systemic disease (e.g., IBD), malnutrition (e.g., anorexia nervosa), gonadal dysgenesis (e.g., Klinefelter\u2019s syndrome, Turner\u2019s syndrome), or endocrine abnormalities (e.g., hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, Kallmann\u2019s syndrome, androgen insensitivity syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome) Precocious puberty: Any sign of 2\u00b0 sexual maturation in girls < 8 years or boys < 9 years of age. Often idiopathic; may be central or peripheral (see the Gynecology chapter)."
