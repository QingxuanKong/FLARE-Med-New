    "question": "Ten days after undergoing a cadaveric renal transplant, a 21-year-old man has pain in the right lower abdomen and generalized fatigue. During the past 2 days, he has had decreasing urinary output. He passed 5 liters of urine on the second postoperative day and serum studies showed a creatinine concentration of 2.1 mg/dL. He has adult polycystic kidney disease and was on maintenance hemodialysis for 2 months prior to transplantation. Current medications include azathioprine, cyclosporine, prednisone, and enalapril. He appears lethargic. His temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 164/94 mm Hg. Examination shows a healing surgical incision in the right lower abdomen. The graft site shows tenderness to palpation. His blood urea nitrogen concentration is 52 mg/dL, creatinine concentration is 4.1 mg/dL. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows tubulitis. C4d staining is negative. Which of the following is the most likely responsible for this patient's findings?",

This increases the risk of acute rejection and complications such as tubulitis. The patient has a low serum creatinine concentration on the second postoperative day, but a significant increase in creatinine concentration to 4.1 mg/dL on the third day suggests acute kidney injury (AKI). The presence of tubulitis on biopsy and C4d staining is negative, making drug-induced nephrotoxicity and fibrosis of the glomerular vessels less likely. The patient's symptoms of pain and lethargy also suggest an acute rejection episode. The most likely cause of the patient's findings is an acute cellular rejection, which is often associated with T-cell activation in the graft. Given the patient's immunosuppressive regimen, which includes azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone, the most likely responsible for this patient's findings is recipient T-cells in the graft.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Acute cessation of urine output in recipients with brittle posttransplant diuresis and the sudden onset of hematuria or graft pain should arouse suspicion of graft thrombosis. Doppler ultrasound may help confirm the diagnosis. In cases of graft thrombosis, an urgent thrombectomy is indi-cated; however, it rarely results in graft salvage.Urologic complications are seen in up to 5% of recipi-ents. The cause is often related to ureteral ischemia, damage during procurement of the donor\u2019s distal ureter, or technical errors. Symptoms of urine leak include fever, pain, swelling at the graft site, increased creatinine level, decreased urine output, and cutaneous urinary drainage. Diagnosis can be confirmed by a combination of ultrasound, nuclear renography, drainage of perinephric fluid collection, and comparison of serum and fluid creatinine levels.

The diuresis that commonly occurs postoperatively must be carefully monitored. In some instances, it may be massive, reflecting the inability of ischemic tubules to regulate sodium and water excretion; with large diureses, massive potassium losses may occur. Most chronically uremic patients have some excess of extracellular fluid, and it is useful to maintain an expanded fluid volume in the immediate postoperative period. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to ischemia may cause immediate oliguria or may follow an initial short period of graft function. Recovery usually occurs within 3 weeks, although periods as long as 6 weeks have been reported. Superimposition of rejection on ATN is common, and the differential diagnosis may be difficult without a graft biopsy. Cyclosporine therapy"

At the 1-year mark, graft survival is higher for living-donor recipients, most likely because those grafts are not subject to as much ischemic injury. The more effective drugs now in use for immunosuppression have almost equalized the risk of graft rejection in all patients for the first year. At 5 and 10 years, however, there has been a steeper decline in survival of those with deceased-donor kidneys. There are few absolute contraindications to renal transplantation. The transplant procedure is relatively noninvasive, as the organ is placed in the inguinal fossa without entering the peritoneal cavity. Recipients without perioperative complications often can be discharged from the hospital in excellent condition within 5 days of the operation."

This action will lead to a deterioration in renal function difficult to distinguish from rejection without a renal biopsy. Interstitial fibrosis, isometric tubular vacuolization, and thickening of arteriolar walls are suggestive of this side effect, but not diagnostic. Hence, if no rejection is detected on the biopsy, serum creatinine may respond to a reduction in dose. However, if rejection activity is present in the biopsy, appropriate therapy is indicated. The first rejection episode is usually treated with IV administration of methylprednisolone, 500\u20131000 mg daily for 3 days. Failure to respond is an indication for antibody therapy, usually with antithymocyte globulin."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

The plasma Na+ concentration increased to 129 meq/L with this therapy; however, the patient developed orthostatic hypotension and dizziness. He was started on demeclocycline, 600 mg PO in the morning and 300 mg in the evening, just before discharge from hospital. Plasma Na+ concentration increased to 140 meq/L with a BUN of 23 and creatinine of 1.4, at which point demeclocycline was reduced to 300 mg PO bid.

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

Clinical evidence of rejection is rarely characterized by fever, swelling, and tenderness over the allograft. Rejection may present only with a rise in serum creatinine, with or without a reduction in urine volume. The focus should be on ruling out other causes of functional deterioration."

His physician initially prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic commonly used to treat hyper-tension. His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic. Because the patient had elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, hydrochlorothiazide was replaced with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril lowered his blood pressure to almost normotensive levels. However, after several weeks on enalapril, the patient returned complaining of a persistent cough. In addition, some signs of angioedema were detected. How does enalapril lower blood pressure? Why does it occasionally cause coughing and angioedema? What other drugs could be used to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and decrease blood pressure,"

Posttransplant hypertension can be mediated by catecholamines, fluid overload, or immunosuppressive agents.Postoperatively, urine output is used as a surrogate marker to monitor graft function. Among recipients whose native kid-neys produce significant amounts of urine, normal or increased urine output can be misleading; for them, serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are more reliable indicators of kidney graft function.Suddenly decreased or minimal urine output requires immediate attention. A change in volume status is the most common cause, but other culprits include blockage of the uri-nary catheter, urinary leak, vascular thrombosis, hypotension, drug-related nephrotoxicity, ATN, and rejection (all of which must be thoroughly investigated). Diagnostic studies such as Doppler ultrasound, nuclear renograms, or biopsies"

Pancreas transplant recipients are usually kept on broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents for the first 7 days posttransplant.The most common nonsurgical complication posttrans-plant is rejection. The incidence of rejection is about 30% within the first year. The diagnosis is usually based on an increase in serum amylase and lipase levels and, in bladder-drained recipi-ents, a decrease in urinary amylase levels. A sustained drop in urinary amylase levels greater than 25% from baseline should prompt a pancreas graft biopsy to rule out rejection. In enteric-drained recipients, one must rely on serum amylase and lipase levels only. Other signs and symptoms of rejection include tenderness over the graft, unexplained fever, and hyperglyce-mia, which usually is a late finding; fewer than 5% of"
