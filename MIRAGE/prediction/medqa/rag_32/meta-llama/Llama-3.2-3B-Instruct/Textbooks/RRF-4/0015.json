She also complains of a dull pain in her back with nausea and vomiting several times. Her pain has no relation with food. Her past medical history is significant for recurrent abdominal pain due to cholelithiasis. Her father died at the age of 60 with some form of abdominal cancer. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 122/98 mm Hg. Physical exam is unremarkable.

Her past medical history is significant for recurrent abdominal pain due to cholelithiasis, and her father died at the age of 60 with some form of abdominal cancer. The CT scan shows a calcified mass near her gallbladder. The differential diagnosis should include gallbladder cancer, cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis, and pancreatitis. Given the patient's age, sex, and symptoms, gallbladder cancer should be excluded first. The patient's father died of abdominal cancer, and the presence of a calcified mass near the gallbladder is suspicious for gallbladder cancer. Acute cholecystitis is less likely given the lack of fever and the presence of a calcified mass. Choledocholithiasis is also possible but less likely than gallbladder cancer given the patient's age and the presence of a calcified mass. Pancreatitis is less likely given the lack of relation to food and the presence of a calcified mass. Therefore, gallbladder cancer should be excluded first.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

An elevated level of serum bilirubin and/or alkaline phosphatase suggests a common duct stone. Fever or chills (rigors) with biliary pain usually imply a complication, i.e., cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or cholangitis.

The absence of bowel sounds or the presence of high-pitched localized bowel sounds points toward an ileus or intestinal obstruction. An umbilical venous hum may suggest the presence of portal hypertension, and a harsh bruit over the liver is heard rarely in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or alcoholic hepatitis. Abdominal swelling caused by intestinal gas can be differentiated from swelling caused by fluid or a solid mass by percussion; an abdomen filled with gas is tympanic, whereas an abdomen containing a mass or fluid is dull to percussion. The absence of abdominal dullness, however, does not exclude ascites, because a minimum of 1500 mL of ascitic fluid is required for detection on physical examination. Finally, the abdomen should be palpated to assess for tenderness, a mass, enlargement of the spleen or liver, or presence of a nodular"

Patients with indwelling stents are at particularly high risk for cholan-gitis, though rarely become jaundiced as a patent stent will prevent the obstruction of bile flow. On abdominal examina-tion, the findings are indistinguishable from those of acute cholecystitis.44Diagnosis Leukocytosis, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevation of alkaline phosphatase and transaminases are common and, when present, support the clinical diagnosis of cholangitis. Ultraso-nography is helpful, as it will document the presence of gall-bladder stones, demonstrate dilated ducts, and possibly pinpoint a site of obstruction. CT scanning and MRI can show pancreatic and periampullary masses, if present, in addition to the ductal dilatation. However, abdominal imaging will rarely elucidate the exact cause of cholangitis, and the initial diagnosis is gener-ally made clinically.Treatment The initial treatment of patients with cholangi-tis"

The liver is frequently enlarged and tender in patients with chronic heart failure. Systolic pulsations over the liver signify severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Splenomegaly may be a feature of infective endocarditis, particularly when symptoms have persisted for weeks or months. Ascites is a nonspecific finding but may be present with advanced chronic right heart failure, constrictive pericarditis, hepatic cirrhosis, or an intraperitoneal malignancy. The finding of an elevated JVP implies a cardiovascular etiology. In nonobese patients, the aorta typically is palpated between the epigastrium and the umbilicus. The sensitivity of palpation for the detection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (pulsatile and expansile mass) decreases as a function of body size. Because palpation alone is not sufficiently accurate to establish this diagnosis, a screening"

Few clinical situations require greater judgment, because the most catastrophic of events may be forecast by the subtlest of symptoms and signs. In every instance, the clinician must distinguish those conditions 20 that require urgent intervention from those that do not and can best be managed nonoperatively. A meticulously executed, detailed history and physical examination are critically important for focusing the differential diagnosis, where necessary, and allowing the diagnostic evaluation to proceed expeditiously (Table 20-1). The etiologic classification in Table 20-2, although not complete, provides a useful framework for evaluating patients with abdominal pain."

An abdominal ultrasound is the standard diagnostic test for gallstones as it is noninvasive and highly sensitive (see earlier \u201cUltrasonography\u201d section).28 Gallstones are occasionally iden-tified on abdominal CT scans that were obtained as part of a broader workup of abdominal pain. In these cases, if the patient has typical symptoms, it is reasonable to proceed with interven-tion. Stones diagnosed incidentally on CT or plain radiographs in patients without symptoms should be left in place. Occasion-ally, patients with typical attacks of biliary pain have no evi-dence of stones on ultrasound but have evidence of sludge in the gallbladder. If a patient has attacks of typical biliary pain and sludge is detected, cholecystectomy is warranted.In addition to sludge and stones, cholesterolosis and adeno-myomatosis of the gallbladder may cause typical biliary symp-toms and may be detected on ultrasound or CT."
