She also has a 1-month history of progressive fatigue. Five weeks ago, she was hospitalized and received intravenous antibiotics for treatment of bacterial meningitis while visiting relatives in Guatemala. Her temperature is 39.4\u00b0C (102.9\u00b0F), pulse is 130/min, and blood pressure is 105/70 mm Hg. Examination shows pallor and scattered petechiae and ecchymoses. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.0 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 1,100/mm3 with 30% segmented neutrophils, and a platelet count of 20,000/mm3 . Blood cultures grow coagulase-negative staphylococci. The patient was most likely treated with which of the following antibiotics?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of bacterial meningitis, which was treated with intravenous antibiotics while visiting relatives in Guatemala 5 weeks ago. The current presentation of fever, intermittent rigors, night sweats, progressive fatigue, pallor, scattered petechiae and ecchymoses, and low hemoglobin concentration suggests an ongoing infection. The blood cultures grow coagulase-negative staphylococci, which is a common cause of post-surgical infections, including infections in immunocompromised patients. Given the patient's recent history of bacterial meningitis and the current symptoms, it is likely that the patient has developed a post-surgical infection, possibly caused by the same bacteria that caused the initial meningitis. The antibiotics used to treat bacterial meningitis often include cephalosporins, carbapenems, and vancomycin. However, these antibiotics are not typically effective against coagulase-negative staphylococci. The patient's symptoms and the growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci on blood cultures suggest that the patient may have developed a resistant strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis or another coagulase-negative staphylococcus. Linezolid is effective against many Gram-positive bacteria, including coagulase-negative staphylococci, making it a suitable choice for empirical treatment in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

            "content": "The classic CSF abnormalities in tuberculous meningitis are as follows: (1) elevated opening pressure, (2) lymphocytic pleocytosis (10\u2013500 cells/\u03bcL), (3) elevated protein concentration in the range of 1\u20135 g/L, and (4) decreased glucose concentration in the range of 1.1\u20132.2 mmol/L (20\u201340 mg/dL). The combination of unrelenting headache, stiff neck, fatigue, night sweats, and fever with a CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis and a mildly decreased glucose concentration is highly suspicious for tuberculous meningitis. The last tube of fluid collected at LP is the best tube to send for a smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). If there is a pellicle in the CSF or a cobweb-like clot on the surface of the fluid, AFB can best be demonstrated in a smear of the clot or pellicle. Positive smears are typically reported in only 10\u201340% of cases of tuberculous meningitis in adults.

            "content": "Beginning in the late 1980s, several reports described patients with GAS infections associated with shock and multisystem organ failure. This syndrome was called streptococcal TSS because it shares certain features with staphylococcal TSS. In 1993, a case definition for streptococcal TSS was formulated (Table 173-4). The general features of the illness include fever, hypotension, renal impairment, and respiratory distress syndrome. Various types of rash have been described, but rash usually does not develop. Laboratory abnormalities include a marked shift to the left in the white blood cell differential, with many immature granulocytes; hypocalcemia; hypoalbuminemia; and thrombocytopenia, which usually becomes more pronounced on the second or third day of illness. In contrast to patients with staphylococcal TSS, the majority with streptococcal TSS are bacteremic. The most common associated infection is a soft tissue infection\u2014necrotizing"

Cellulitis, pustules, bullae, or hemorrhagic lesions may develop when hematogenous bacteria or fungi seed the skin or underlying soft tissue. Bacterial toxins may also be distributed hematogenously and elicit diffuse cutaneous reactions. On occasion, skin lesions may suggest specific pathogens. When sepsis is accompanied by cutaneous petechiae or purpura, infection with N. meningitidis (or, less commonly, H. influenzae) should be suspected (see Fig. 25e-42); in a patient who has been bitten by a tick while in an endemic area, petechial lesions also suggest Rocky Mountain spotted fever (see Fig. 211-1). A cutaneous lesion seen almost exclusively in neutropenic patients is ecthyma gangrenosum, often caused by P. aeruginosa. This bullous lesion surrounded by edema undergoes central hemorrhage and necrosis (see Fig. 189-1)."

Patients with aseptic meningitis typically present with an acute onset of fever, chills, headache, photophobia, and pain on eye movement. Nausea and vomiting also are common. Examination reveals meningismus without localizing neurologic signs; drowsiness or irritability may also be apparent. In some cases, a febrile illness may be reported that remits but returns several days later in conjunction with signs of meningitis. Other systemic manifestations may provide clues to an enteroviral cause, including diarrhea, myalgias, rash, pleurodynia, myocarditis, and herpangina. Examination of the CSF invariably reveals pleocytosis; the CSF cell count shows a shift from neutrophil to lymphocyte predominance within 1 day of presentation, and the total cell count does not exceed 1000/\u03bcL.

Infants with early-onset sepsis should be evaluated by blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures, CSF Gram stain, cell count, and protein and glucose levels. Normal newborns generally have an elevated CSF protein content (100 to 150 mg/dL) and may have 25 to 30/mm3 white blood cells (mean, 9/mm3), which are 75% lymphocytes in the absence of infection. Some infants with neonatal meningitis caused by group B streptococci do not have an elevated CSF leukocyte count but are seen to have microorganisms in the CSF on Gram stain. In addition to culture, other methods of identifying the pathogenic bacteria are the determination of bacterial antigen in samples of blood, urine, or CSF. In cases of neonatal meningitis, the ratio of CSF glucose to blood glucose usually is less than 50%. The polymerase chain reaction test primarily is used to identify viral infections. Serial"
