    "question": "A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of periodic painful double vision for 3 days. Her symptoms occur only when looking sideways. She has myopia and has been wearing corrective lenses for 10 years. Ten days ago, she lost her balance and fell off her bike, for which she went to a hospital. A CT scan of the head at that time showed no abnormalities and she was released without further treatment. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Her best corrected visual acuity is 20/40 in each eye. She has an adduction deficit in the right eye and nystagmus in the left eye when looking left; she has an adduction deficit in the left eye and nystagmus in the right eye when looking right. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral disc hyperemia. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with periodic painful double vision that occurs only when looking sideways, which suggests a problem with the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). The MLF is a structure in the brainstem that connects the nuclei of the oculomotor and trochlear nerves, which are responsible for controlling eye movements. Damage to the MLF can cause internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), a condition characterized by impaired adduction of one eye when looking in the direction of the lesion. The patient's symptoms of adduction deficit in the right eye and nystagmus in the left eye when looking left, and adduction deficit in the left eye and nystagmus in the right eye when looking right, are consistent with INO. The fact that the pupils are equal and reactive to light suggests that the cranial nerves are not affected. The patient's history of a recent fall and loss of balance also suggests a possible traumatic injury to the brainstem, which could have caused damage to the MLF. However, the CT scan of the head at the time of the fall showed no abnormalities, which makes a traumatic injury less likely. The other options are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms. Demyelination of the MLF is a condition that can cause INO, but it is not typically associated with traumatic injury. Compressive tumor of the pons is a possible cause of INO, but it would likely cause more significant neurological deficits. Oxidative damage due to thiamine deficiency can cause Wernicke's encephalopathy, which can cause oculomotor disturbances, but it is not typically associated with INO. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's findings is damage to the medial longitudinal fasciculus, which is consistent with internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Reciprocally, with a lesion of the right MLF, the right eye fails to adduct when the patient looks to the left and the patient has a right internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Quite often, rather than a complete paralysis of adduction, there are only slowed adducting saccades in the affected eye while the other eye quickly arrives at its fully abducted position. This slowing can be observed by having the patient make large side-to-side refixation movements between two targets or by observing the slowed corrective saccades induced by optokinetic stimulation. Typically, the affected eye at rest does not lie in an abducted position, but there are exceptions and in most cases the absence of exotropia most dependably differentiates INO from a partial third-nerve palsy with weakness of the medial rectus"

The cause is usually intrinsic to the eye and therefore has no dire implications for the patient. Corneal aberrations (e.g., keratoconus, pterygium), uncorrected refractive error, cataract, or foveal traction may give rise to monocular diplopia. Occasionally it is a symptom of malingering or psychiatric disease. Diplopia alleviated by covering one eye is binocular diplopia and is caused by disruption of ocular alignment. Inquiry should be made into the nature of the double vision (purely side-by-side versus partial vertical displacement of images), mode of onset, duration, intermittency, diurnal variation, and associated neurologic or systemic symptoms.

            "content": "Philip J. Rosenthal, MD A 5-year-old American girl presents with a 1-week history of intermittent chills, fever, and sweats. She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

She became convinced that her roommate was listening in on her phone conversations and planning to alter her essays. She became reclusive and spent most of her time locked in her room. After much difficulty, her teachers convinced her to be seen by the student health service. It was believed she was beginning to show signs of schizophrenia and she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where she was started on antipsychotic medications. While in the hospital, she had a generalized seizure which prompted her transfer to our service. Her spinal fluid analysis showed 10 lymphocytes per mL3. She was found to have an anti-NMDA receptor antibody, which prompted an ultrasound examination of the pelvis. The left ovary was thought to show a benign cyst. Because of the neurological syndrome, the ovarian cyst was resected and revealed a microscopic ovarian teratoma. The neuropsychiatric syndrome resolved. She has since graduated and"

The symptoms usually develop suddenly, often after an altercation or other emotionally charged event. The patient stares straight ahead blandly when undisturbed, but may squint or move the head as if straining to see when asked to view an object. Some such individuals can reduce reflexive blinking in response to a visual threat. The psychic nature of the problem may be recognized by a nurse who observes the patient reaching for a cup or for the phone. The preservation of vision is confirmed by the presence of normal pupillary reflexes and of optokinetic nystagmus, although one occasionally encounters a patient who has learned to suppress the latter response as well. A mirror passed slowly in the patient\u2019s central vision often engages eye movements. Other similar maneuvers are favored by different examiners. The presence of visual evoked responses also confirms the intactness of"
