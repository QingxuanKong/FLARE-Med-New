    "question": "A microbiologist is studying the emergence of a virulent strain of the virus. After a detailed study of the virus and its life cycle, he proposes a theory: Initially, a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same virus family. Within the host cell, concomitant production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. Ultimately, the different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. The newly formed virus particle is both stable and viable and is a new strain from the virus family that caused the outbreak of infection. Which of the following viruses is capable of undergoing the above-mentioned process?",

The theory states that a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same virus family, and concomitant production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. Ultimately, the different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. This process is known as recombination or reassortment. The key to solving this question is to identify which virus is capable of recombination or reassortment. Let's analyze each option: A. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV): EBV is a DNA virus that can integrate into the host genome and cause latency. However, it is not known to undergo recombination or reassortment with other viruses. B. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV): HIV is an RNA virus that can undergo recombination and reassortment with other HIV strains, but it is not typically associated with recombination with viruses from different families. C. Rotavirus: Rotavirus is an RNA virus that can undergo reassortment with other rotaviruses, but it is not typically associated with recombination with viruses from different families. D. Vaccinia virus: Vaccinia virus is a DNA virus that can undergo recombination and reassortment with other vaccinia viruses, and it can also recombine with other DNA viruses. Vaccinia virus is known to cause recombination and reassortment, which can result in the creation of new virus strains. Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is D. Vaccinia virus, as it is capable of undergoing recombination and reassortment with other viruses, including those from different families.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",

In the later stages of infection, viruses often either switch to use CXCR4 or adapt to use both co-receptors through the accumulation of mutations; in this way, the virus can change the cell types it infects as the disease progresses.

Enveloped viruses can cause persistent infections that may last for years, often without noticeable deleterious effects on the host."

            "content": "Table 9.2 ). Many viruses cause transient illnesses (e.g., colds, influenza). Other viruses are not eliminated from the body and persist within cells of the host for years, either continuing to multiply (e.g., chronic infection with hepatitis B virus [HBV]) or survive in some latent nonreplicating form, with the potential to be reactivated later. For example, herpes zoster virus, the cause of chickenpox, can enter dorsal root ganglia and establish latency at the site, with periodic reactivation at later times to cause shingles, a painful skin condition. Some viruses are involved in transformation of a host cell into a benign or malignant tumor (e.g., human papillomavirus [HPV]-induced benign warts and cervical carcinoma). Different species of viruses can produce the same clinical picture (e.g., adenovirus and rhinovirus causing upper respiratory infection); conversely, a single virus can cause different clinical manifestations depending on the age or immune status of the host (e.g.,"

(A) An electron micrograph of the viral particle, which consists of a single long RNA molecule enclosed in a cylindrical protein coat composed of identical protein subunits. (B) A model showing part of the structure of TMV. A single-stranded RNA molecule of 6395 nucleotides is packaged in a helical coat constructed from 2130 copies of a coat protein 158 amino acids long. Fully infective viral particles can self-assemble in a test tube from purified RNA and protein molecules. (A, courtesy of Robley Williams; B, courtesy of Richard J. Feldmann.)"

            "content": "Some Viruses Use a Transposition Mechanism to Move Themselves Into Host-Cell Chromosomes Certain viruses are considered mobile genetic elements because they use transposition mechanisms to integrate their genomes into that of their host cell. However, unlike transposons, these viruses encode proteins that package their genetic information into virus particles that can infect other cells. Many of the viruses that insert themselves into a host chromosome do so by employing one of the first two mechanisms listed in Table 5\u20134; namely, by behaving like DNA-only transposons or like retroviral-like retrotransposons. Indeed, much of our knowledge of these mechanisms has come from studies of particular viruses that employ them."
