    "question": "A 44-year-old man comes to the clinic because of a 6-month history of progressive fatigue. He has a history of intravenous heroin use. Physical examination shows scleral icterus. A serum study is positive for hepatitis C RNA. Therapy with interferon-\u03b1 is initiated in combination with a second drug. The expected beneficial effect of the additional drug is most likely due to inhibition of which of the following enzymes?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the given question: Step 1: Understand the context of the question - The patient has a history of intravenous heroin use and is being treated for hepatitis C with interferon-\u03b1. Step 2: Recall the mechanism of action of interferon-\u03b1 - Interferon-\u03b1 works by binding to the interferon-\u03b1 receptor on the surface of cells, which triggers a signaling cascade that leads to the production of antiviral proteins that inhibit viral replication. Step 3: Understand the role of the second drug in combination with interferon-\u03b1 - The question states that the second drug is likely to inhibit an enzyme that interferes with the replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Step 4: Recall the antiviral drugs used in combination with interferon-\u03b1 for HCV treatment - Ribavirin is a commonly used antiviral drug in combination with interferon-\u03b1 for HCV treatment. Step 5: Identify the mechanism of action of ribavirin - Ribavirin works by inhibiting the replication of HCV by interfering with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is an enzyme essential for viral replication. Step 6: Match the mechanism of action of ribavirin with the given options - Based on the mechanism of action of ribavirin, the correct answer is B. DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, as this is the enzyme that ribavirin inhibits to prevent HCV replication. The final answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The expected beneficial effect of the additional drug is most likely due to inhibition of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, as ribavirin works by inhibiting this enzyme to prevent HCV replication.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Most relapses occur within the first 12 weeks after treatment; therefore, an SVR at week 12 posttreatment is roughly equivalent to a 24-week SVR. SVRs are very durable; normal ALT, improved histology, and absence of HCV RNA in serum and liver have been documented a decade after successful therapy, and \u201crelapses\u201d 2 years after sustained responses are almost unheard of. Thus, an SVR to antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis C is tantamount to a cure."

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

Several controlled clinical trials have documented that such therapy leads to symptomatic, clinical, biochemical, and histologic improvement as well as increased survival. A therapeutic response can be expected in up to 80% of patients. Unfortunately, therapy has not been shown in clinical trials to prevent ultimate progression to cirrhosis; however, instances of reversal of fibrosis and cirrhosis have been reported in patients responding to treatment, and rapid treatment responses within 1 year do translate into a reduction in progression to cirrhosis. Although some advocate the use of prednisolone (the hepatic metabolite of prednisone), prednisone is just as effective and is favored by most authorities. Therapy may be initiated at 20 mg/d, but a popular regimen in the United States relies on an initiation dose of 60 mg/d. This high dose is tapered successively over the course of a month down to a"

Liver function and renal function were normal. After 1 year of treatment, the patient experienced visible yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes. Blood samples were drawn, and grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia was documented. When atazanavir was discontinued and the antiretroviral regimen was modified to include lopinavir, the plasma levels of bilirubin returned to the normal range, and skin and eye color were cleared.

Simerprevir, which is effective for genotype 1, must be administered, like first-generation protease inhibitors, for 12 weeks with PEG IFN and ribavirin, followed by another 12 weeks of PEG IFN and ribavirin (no response-guided therapy). Sofosbuvir, the more convenient and broadly applicable of the two new drugs, must be administered with PEG IFN and ribavirin but for only 12 weeks in patients with genotyes 1, 4-6; for patients with genotypes 2 and 3, PEG IFN is not required. Sofosbuvir plus ribavirin are administered for 12 weeks in genotype 2 and for 24 weeks in genotype 3. Antiviral therapy is evolving very rapidly; by the end of 2014, all-oral, interferon-free combinations (e.g., sofosbuvir plus the NS5a inhibitor ledipasvir) will supplant earlier treatment"
