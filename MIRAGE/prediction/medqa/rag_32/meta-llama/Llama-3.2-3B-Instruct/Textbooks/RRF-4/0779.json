    "question": "A 29-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. On presentation, he is found to have scalp and trunk lacerations that are still actively bleeding. He has no past medical history and does not take any medications. On presentation, his temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/74 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical exam, he is found to be anxious but does not have any visible injuries other than the lacerations. Which of the following processes would most likely be seen in this patient?",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing stress due to the motor vehicle accident, which has led to anxiety. This anxiety response is a classic example of the 'fight or flight' response. The body's 'fight or flight' response is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which increases heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration rate. The SNS achieves this through the release of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine. Norepinephrine acts on the sinoatrial (SA) node of the heart, increasing heart rate. In this scenario, the patient's pulse is 82/min, which is lower than the normal resting heart rate of 60-100 bpm. This suggests that the SNS is still active, but not overly dominant. The patient's blood pressure is 110/74 mmHg, which is within the normal range, indicating that the SNS is not causing significant vasoconstriction. The patient's respirations are 17/min, which is slightly decreased from the normal rate of 12-20 breaths/min, indicating some respiratory depression. The lack of visible injuries other than the lacerations and the patient's anxious state suggests that the 'fight or flight' response is the primary response to the stress of the accident. Given these observations, the most likely process seen in this patient is increased norepinephrine at the sinoatrial node, leading to a slightly increased heart rate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

            "content": "If the physician arrives at the scene of an accident and finds an unconscious patient, a rapid examination should be made before the patient is moved. First it must be determined whether the patient is breathing and has a clear airway and obtainable pulse and blood pressure, and whether there is hemorrhage from a scalp laceration or injured viscera. Severe head injuries that arrest respiration are soon followed by cessation of cardiac function. Injuries of this magnitude are often fatal; if resuscitative measures do not restore and sustain cardiopulmonary function within 4 to 5 min, the brain is usually irreparably damaged. Bleeding from the scalp can usually be controlled by a pressure bandage unless an artery is divided; then a suture becomes necessary. Resuscitative measures (artificial respiration and cardiac compression) should be continued until they are taken over by ambulance personnel. Oxygen should then be administered."

            "content": "Vital Signs Given that elevations in temperature are often a hallmark of infection, paying close attention to the temperature may be of value in diagnosing an infectious disease. The idea that 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F) is the normal human body temperature dates back to the nineteenth century and was initially based on axillary measurements. Rectal temperatures more accurately reflect the core body temperature and are 0.4\u00b0C (0.7\u00b0F) and 0.8\u00b0C (1.4\u00b0F) higher than oral and axillary temperatures, respectively. Although the definition of fever varies greatly throughout the medical literature, the most common definition, which is based on studies defining fever of unknown origin (Chap. 26), uses a temperature \u226538.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F). Although fever is very commonly associated with infection, it is also documented in many other diseases (Chap. 23). For every 1\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) increase in core temperature, the heart rate typically rises by 15\u201320 beats/min. Table 144-1 lists infections that are associated with relative"

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

Case 3: Hyperglycemia and Hyperketonemia Patient Presentation: MW, a 40-year-old woman, was brought to the hospital in a disoriented, confused state by her husband. Focused History: As noted on her medical alert bracelet, MW has had type 1 diabetes (T1D) for the last 24 years. Her husband reports that this is her first medical emergency in 2 years. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): MW displayed signs of dehydration (such as dry mucous membranes and skin, poor skin turgor, and low blood pressure) and acidosis (such as deep, rapid breathing [Kussmaul respiration]). Her breath had a faintly fruity odor. Her temperature was normal."

The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy. One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC). He undergoes surgical resection and is found to have high-risk stage III CRC with five positive lymph nodes. After surgery, he feels entirely well with no symptoms. Of note, he has no other illnesses. What is this patient\u2019s overall prognosis? Based on his prognosis, what"

Blunt or penetrating trauma to the head can cause injury to the densely vascularized scalp, and significant blood loss can result. Direct pressure initially controls the bleeding, allowing close inspection of the injury. If a simple laceration is found, it should be copiously irrigated and closed primarily. If the laceration is short, a single-layer, percutaneous suture clo-sure will suffice. If the laceration is long or has multiple arms, the patient may need debridement and closure in the operating room, with its superior lighting and wider selection of instru-ments and suture materials.

Less often, there is a tear in a dural venous sinus. The injury, even when it fractures the skull, may not have produced coma initially, or it may be part of a devastating craniocerebral injury. A typical example is that of a child who has fallen from a bicycle or swing or has suffered some other hard blow to the head and was unconscious only momentarily. A few hours later (exceptionally, with venous bleeding the interval may be several days or a week), headache of increasing severity develops, with vomiting, drowsiness, confusion, aphasia, seizures (which may be one sided), hemiparesis with slightly increased tendon reflexes, and a Babinski sign. As coma develops, the hemiparesis may give way to bilateral spasticity of the limbs and Babinski signs. The heart rate is often and is bounding as a result of a rise in systolic blood pressure (Cushing effect). The"
