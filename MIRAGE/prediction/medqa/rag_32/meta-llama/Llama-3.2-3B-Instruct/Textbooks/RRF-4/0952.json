    "question": "A hospitalized 34-year-old man with severe diarrhea and bloating for 1 month is diagnosed with celiac disease based on serology and duodenal biopsy. He has no history of any serious illnesses and takes no medications. He has no history of recent travel. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. At discharge from the hospital, he is given complete instructions for a strict gluten-free diet. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for the temporary control of the severe diarrhea and bloating?",

The most appropriate recommendation for temporary control of these symptoms is to follow a strict gluten-free diet. However, this may not provide immediate relief from diarrhea and bloating. In addition to a gluten-free diet, other measures can be taken to help manage these symptoms. Loperamide, an antidiarrheal medication, is often used to slow down bowel movements and reduce diarrhea. It is not a cure for celiac disease, but it can help alleviate symptoms. The other options are not appropriate for temporary control of diarrhea and bloating in this context. Avoiding all dairy products is not necessary as dairy products are not typically contaminated with gluten. Prednisone is a corticosteroid and is not used to treat diarrhea. Restriction of soy products is also not necessary as soy products are not typically contaminated with gluten. Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation for temporary control of severe diarrhea and bloating is loperamide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

In patients with persistent diarrhea not responding to simple antidiarrheal agents, a sigmoid colon biopsy should be performed to rule out microscopic colitis. In those age >40 years, an air-contrast barium enema or colonoscopy should also be performed. If the main symptoms are diarrhea and increased gas, the possibility of lactase deficiency should be ruled out with a hydrogen breath test or with evaluation after a 3-week lactose-free diet. Some patients with IBS-D may have undiagnosed celiac sprue. Because the symptoms of celiac sprue respond to a gluten-free diet, testing for celiac sprue in IBS may prevent years of morbidity and attendant expense.

With the increase in the number of patients diagnosed with celiac disease (mostly by serologic studies), the spectrum of histologic changes seen on duodenal biopsy has increased and includes findings that are not as severe as the classic changes shown in Fig. 349-4. The classic changes seen on duodenal/jejunal biopsy are restricted to the mucosa and include (1) an increase in the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes; (2) absence or a reduced height of villi, which causes a flat appearance with increased crypt cell proliferation resulting in crypt hyperplasia and loss of villous structure, with consequent villous, but not"

The small-intestinal biopsy in tropical sprue does not reveal pathognomonic features but resembles, and can often be indistinguishable from, that seen in celiac disease (Fig. 349-4). The biopsy sample in tropical sprue has less villous architectural alteration and more mononuclear cell infiltrate in the lamina propria. In contrast to those of celiac disease, the histologic features of tropical sprue manifest with a similar degree of severity throughout the small intestine, and a gluten-free diet does not result in either clinical or histologic improvement in tropical sprue."

Mechanism of Diarrhea The diarrhea in celiac disease has several pathogenetic mechanisms. Diarrhea may be secondary to (1) steatorrhea, which is primarily a result of changes in jejunal mucosal function; (2) secondary lactase deficiency, a consequence of changes in jejunal brush border enzymatic function; (3) bile acid malabsorption resulting in bile acid\u2013induced fluid secretion in the colon (in cases with more extensive disease involving the ileum); and (4) endogenous fluid secretion resulting from crypt hyperplasia. Celiac disease patients with more severe involvement may improve temporarily with dietary lactose and fat restriction while awaiting the full effects of total gluten restriction, which constitutes primary therapy."

The most common celiac disease\u2013 associated cancer is enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma, an aggressive tumor of intraepithelial T lymphocytes. Small-intestinal adenocarcinoma also is more frequent in individuals with celiac disease. Thus, when symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss develop despite a strict gluten-free diet, cancer or refractory sprue, in which the response to a gluten-free diet is lost, must be considered. It is, however, important to recognize that failure to adhere to a gluten-free diet is the most common cause of recurrent symptoms, and that most individuals with celiac disease do well with dietary restrictions and die of unrelated causes."

            "content": "A review of the patient\u2019s history suggested a serious and chronic illness and the patient was admitted to hospital. After admission a bronchoscopy was carried out and sputum was aspirated from the left upper lobe bronchus. This was cultured in the laboratory and also viewed under the microscope and tuberculous bacilli (TB) were identified. A 68-year-old man came to his family physician complaining of discomfort when swallowing (dysphagia). The physician examined the patient and noted since his last visit he had lost approximately 18 lb over 6 months. Routine blood tests revealed the patient was anemic and he was referred to the gastroenterology unit. A diagnosis of esophageal cancer was made and the patient underwent a resection, which involved a chest and abdominal incision. After 4 years the patient remains well though still subject to follow-up."
