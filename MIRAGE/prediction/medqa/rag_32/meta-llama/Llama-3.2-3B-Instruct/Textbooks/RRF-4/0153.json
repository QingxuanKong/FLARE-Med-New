    "question": "A 71-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine visit. His psychiatric history is significant for major depression with psychotic features. He was diagnosed after his wife died from pancreatic cancer four years earlier. Three years ago, he deliberately overdosed on sleeping pills. Today, he feels well but still wakes up frequently at night and cannot sleep through the night. He lives alone in his apartment and has no children. He does not possess a firearm at home but has access to weapons at a local hunting club. The patient currently denies suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm. He takes sertraline and olanzapine. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. Which of the following is the strongest risk factor for suicide in this patient?",

The patient has a history of major depression with psychotic features, a previous suicide attempt, and currently experiences insomnia. We need to evaluate which of these factors is the strongest risk factor for suicide in this patient.\\n\\nThe patient's history of previous suicide attempt is a significant risk factor for future suicidal behavior. This is because previous attempts are often a predictor of future attempts, and the patient's current symptoms of insomnia may be a manifestation of underlying depression.\\n\\nThe patient's history of psychosis is also a risk factor, as psychotic depression can increase the risk of suicide. However, the patient's current symptoms are not indicative of psychosis, and the patient denies suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm.\\n\\nThe patient's age is a risk factor for suicide, as older adults are more likely to experience suicidal thoughts and behaviors. However, in this case, the patient's age is not as significant a risk factor as his history of previous suicide attempt.\\n\\nThe patient's sleeping disorder is a symptom of his depression, but it is not a risk factor for suicide in itself.\\n\\nTherefore, the strongest risk factor for suicide in this patient is his previous suicide attempt.\\n\\nAnswer: A\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Because many of these individuals have reputations for being sound, dependable, and stable and deny being depressed, one\u2019s inclination is to doubt the possibility of self-destruction. Such patients should nonetheless be questioned forthrightly on this subject: Do they feel that life is not worthwhile? Have there been thoughts of suicide?

The examining physician discovers postural hypotension and moderate vitiligo (depigmented areas of skin) and obtains routine blood tests. She finds hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis and suspects Addison\u2019s disease. She performs a standard ACTH 1\u201324 stimulation test, which reveals an insufficient plasma cortisol response compatible with primary adrenal insuf-ficiency. The diagnosis of autoimmune Addison\u2019s disease is made, and the patient must start replacement of the hormones he cannot produce himself. How should this patient be treated? What precautions should he take?"

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension.

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen.
