    "question": "A 22-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of irregular menstrual bleeding. Menses have occurred at 45- to 90-day intervals since menarche at the age of 15 years. Her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. The patient reports that she was too embarrassed to discuss this issue with anyone until now. Over the past two years, she was unable to become pregnant despite having unprotected sexual intercourse with her husband on a regular basis. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 85 kg (187 lb); BMI is 29.4 kg/m2. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows oily skin and severe facial acne. There is abnormal pigmented hair on the upper lip and around both nipples. The patient wishes to have children. In addition to recommending lifestyle modifications, which of the following is the most appropriate step in management?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and physical examination. The patient is a 22-year-old woman with irregular menstrual bleeding (45-90 day intervals) since menarche at 15 years. She has been unable to become pregnant despite unprotected sexual intercourse with her husband for two years. She has a BMI of 29.4 kg/m^2, oily skin, severe facial acne, and abnormal pigmented hair on the upper lip and around both nipples. These symptoms are suggestive of hyperandrogenism, which can be caused by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, hyperandrogenism, and often, ovulatory dysfunction. The patient's desire to have children is also a crucial factor in management. Given these clues, the most appropriate step in management would be to initiate clomiphene therapy. Clomiphene is a medication commonly used to treat infertility in women with PCOS, as it stimulates ovulation and improves fertility. It is also used to treat oligomenorrhea and anovulatory cycles in PCOS patients who wish to conceive. The other options are not the most appropriate initial step in management. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a more invasive and costly option, progesterone therapy is typically used to support pregnancy after ovulation has occurred, and leuprolide therapy is used to treat conditions such as endometriosis or precocious puberty, not PCOS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient.

Therefore, the definition of primary amenorrhea changed: Primary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses by 13 years of age when there is no visible development of secondary sexual characteristics or by 15 years of age in the presence of normal secondary sexual characteristics. The ages defining primary amenorrhea were decreased by 1 year to continue to represent two standard deviations above the mean age of developing secondary sexual characteristics and menses (1). Failure to begin breast development by age 13 warrants investigation. A woman who previously menstruated can develop secondary amenorrhea, which is defined as absence of menstruation for three normal menstrual cycles (2). A woman with regular cycles and a delay of menses of even a week may warrant assessment with a pregnancy test. It is reasonable to evaluate a woman who has fewer than nine cycles per year.

Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

            "content": "Blood from the lower limbs and the pelvis may drain via a series of collateral vessels, some of which include the superficial inferior epigastric veins, which run in the superficial fascia. These anastomose with the superior, superficial, and deep epigastric venous systems to drain into the internal thoracic veins, which in turn drain into the brachiocephalic veins and the superior vena cava. After the initial inferior vena cava thrombosis, the veins of the anterior abdominal wall and other collateral pathways hypertrophy to accommodate the increase in blood flow. A 52-year-old woman visited her family physician with complaints of increasing lethargy and vomiting. The physician examined her and noted that compared to previous visits she had lost significant weight. She was also jaundiced, and on examination of the abdomen a well-defined 10-cm rounded mass was palpable below the liver edge in the right upper quadrant (Fig. 4.185)."

Primary amenorrhea is defined as absence of menses at age 13 years when there is no visible development of secondary sexual characteristics or age 15 years in the presence of normal secondary sexual characteristics. Absent or irregular menses may be an indication that a woman has a medical condition that can affect her overall health. The health implications can vary depending on the etiology of the amenorrhea. Therefore, a cause for amenorrhea should be established whenever possible. When gonadal failure occurs in conjunction with primary amenorrhea, it is associated with a high incidence of abnormal karyotype. The anatomic causes of amenorrhea are relatively few, and the majority may be diagnosed by history and physical examination."

Premenopausal women should examine their breasts monthly 7 to 10 days after the onset of the menstrual cycle. For postmenopausal women, selection of a specific calendar date is a helpful way to remember to perform a monthly BSE. Women should be instructed to report any abnormalities or changes to their physicians. If the physician cannot confirm the patient\u2019s findings, the examination should be repeated in 1 month or after her next menstrual period."

An adolescent who presents with excessive bleeding should have a pelvic examination if she had intercourse, if the results of a pregnancy test are positive, if she has abdominal pain, if she is markedly anemic, or if she is bleeding heavily enough to compromise hemodynamic stability. The pelvic examination occasionally may be deferred in young teenagers who have a classic history of irregular cycles soon after menarche, who have normal hematocrit levels, who deny sexual activity, and who will reliably return for follow-up. A pelvic examination may be deferred in adolescents who present to the office requesting oral contraceptives before the initiation of intercourse or at the patient\u2019s request, even if she has had intercourse.
