He reports alternating episodes of decreased urine output followed by a temporary increase in urine output for the past 2 days. In the past year, he has had two urinary tract infections. He has Crohn disease and underwent a small bowel resection 5 years ago. He currently takes mesalamine and a multivitamin. His father had recurrent kidney stones. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows right costovertebral angle tenderness. Urinalysis shows 70 RBC/hpf and envelope-shaped crystals. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a 6-mm stone in the proximal right ureter and two 4-mm stones in the left kidney. Which of the following factors has most likely contributed most to this patient\u2019s current condition?",

The urinalysis shows 70 RBC/hpf and envelope-shaped crystals, and the CT scan shows a 6-mm stone in the proximal right ureter and two 4-mm stones in the left kidney. The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a ureteral obstruction, which is likely caused by the stone in the right ureter. The envelope-shaped crystals in the urinalysis are consistent with struvite stones, which are often associated with urinary tract infections. Given the patient's history of Crohn disease and recurrent urinary tract infections, it is likely that the infection has contributed to the formation of the struvite stone. The correct answer is therefore related to the patient's urinary tract infection and the type of stone it has formed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

            "content": "A 25-year-old man developed severe pain in the left lower quadrant of his abdomen. The pain was diffuse and relatively constant but did ease for short periods of time. On direct questioning the patient indicated that the pain was in the inguinal region and radiated posteriorly into his left infrascapular region (loin). A urine dipstick was positive for blood (hematuria). A diagnosis of a ureteric stone (calculus) was made. The patient\u2019s initial infrascapular pain, which later radiated to the left groin, relates to passage of the ureteric stone along the ureter. The origin of the pain relates to ureteral distention. A series of peristaltic waves along the ureter transport urine along the length of the ureter from the kidney to the bladder. As the ureteric stone obstructs the kidney, the ureter becomes distended, resulting in an exacerbation of the pain. The peristaltic waves are superimposed upon the distention, resulting in periods of exacerbation and periods of relief."

If the stone lodges in the ureter at the ureterovesical junction, the patient may experience urinary urgency and frequency. In female patients, the latter symptoms may lead to an incorrect diagnosis of bacterial cystitis; the urine will contain red and white blood cells, but the urine culture will be negative.

The stones are polycrystalline aggregates of calcium, phosphate, oxalate, urate, and other soluble salts within an organic matrix. The urine becomes saturated with these salts, and small variations in the pH cause the salts to precipitate. Typically the patient has pain that radiates from the infrascapular region (loin) into the groin, and even into the scrotum or labia majora. Blood in the urine (hematuria) may also be noticed. Infection must be excluded because certain species of bacteria are commonly associated with urinary tract stones.

Renal colic is a misnomer because pain typically does not subside completely; rather, it varies in intensity. When a stone moves into the ureter, the discomfort often begins with a sudden onset of unilateral flank pain. The intensity of the pain can increase rapidly, and there are no alleviating factors. This pain, which is accompanied often by nausea and occasionally by vomiting, may radiate, depending on the location of the stone. If the stone lodges in the upper part of the ureter, pain may radiate anteriorly; if the stone is in the lower part of the ureter, pain can radiate to the ipsilateral testicle in men or the ipsilateral labium in women. Occasionally, a patient has gross hematuria without pain."

The review of systems should focus on identifying possible etiologic factors related to low urine volume (e.g., high insensible losses; low fluid intake) and gastrointestinal malabsorption as well as on ascertaining how frequently the patient voids during the day and overnight."

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a"

The alkaline milieu (pH >7) predisposes to infec-tious (struvite) stones with the precipitation of magnesium, ammonium, and phosphate (Fig. 40-1).Evaluation for first-time stone formers should include a complete medical history and physical exam, basic metabolic panel, calcium, uric acid, urinalysis and culture, and radio-graphic imaging. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan is the most sensitive (98%) and specific (97%) exam to detect urolithiasis10 and can provide additional anatomical infor-mation useful for surgical planning, although its use in recurrent stone formers should be balanced by cost and radiation expo-sure. Low-dose CT is currently the preferred imaging study for patients with a body mass index (BMI) <30. This imaging study uses less than one-third of the estimated effective ionizing radiation dose (3 mSv) compared to standard dose noncontrast"

            "content": "Follow-up imaging should be planned thoughtfully. Many patients with recurrent episodes of renal colic that lead to emergency room visits often undergo repeat CT studies. While CT does provide the best information, the radiation dose is substantially higher than that with plain abdominal radiography (KUB). Small stones may be missed by KUB, and ultrasound has a limited ability to determine size and number of stones. Minimizing radiation exposure should be a goal of the long-term follow-up plan and must be balanced against the gain in diagnostic information."

Focused History: AK is known to the ED staff from previous visits. He has a 6year history of chronic, excessive alcohol consumption. He is not known to take illicit drugs. At this ED visit, AK reports that he has been drinking heavily in the past day or so. He cannot recall having eaten anything in that time.

UTO must always be considered in patients with urinary tract infections or urolithiasis. Urinary stasis encourages the growth of organisms. Urea-splitting bacteria are associated with magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) calculi. Hypertension is frequent in acute and sub-acute unilateral obstruction and is usually a consequence of increased release of renin by the involved kidney. Chronic kidney disease from bilateral UTO, often associated with extracellular volume expansion, may result in significant hypertension. Erythrocytosis, an infrequent complication of obstructive uropathy, is secondary to increased erythropoietin production."

At the time of surgery, the initial dissection mobilized the kidney on its vascular pedicle; however, a large portion of tumor became detached in the inferior vena cava. The tumor embolus passed through the right atrium and right ventricle and occluded the pulmonary artery. This could not be cleared at the time of surgery, and the patient succumbed. A 65-year-old businessman came to the emergency department with severe lower abdominal pain that was predominantly central and left sided. He had pain radiating into the left loin, and he also noticed he was passing gas and fecal debris as he urinated. A CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis was performed (eFig. 4.191)."
