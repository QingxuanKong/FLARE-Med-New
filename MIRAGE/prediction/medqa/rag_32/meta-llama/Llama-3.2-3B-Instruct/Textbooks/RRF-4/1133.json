    "question": "A 31-year-old male comes to your office for his annual exam. He states that he received all of his recommended vaccinations prior to beginning college, but has not had any vaccines in the past 13 years. His medical history is significant for intermittent, exercise-induced asthma. He has been sexually active in the past with multiple female partners. In addition to an influenza vaccine, which vaccine should be administered to this patient during this visit?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Pneumococcal vaccine",

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the question: 1. The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of intermittent exercise-induced asthma and is sexually active with multiple female partners. 2. The patient has not had any vaccines in the past 13 years, but received all recommended vaccinations prior to beginning college. 3. The patient is due for an annual exam and needs to be updated on his vaccinations. 4. Considering the patient's age and history, the patient is at risk for various diseases, but the most relevant vaccine to consider is one that protects against diseases that are common in young adults. 5. The patient's history of asthma is not directly related to a specific vaccine, but it's worth noting that people with asthma may be more susceptible to certain infections. 6. The patient's sexual history makes him susceptible to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HPV. 7. The patient's age and history make the HPV vaccine a high priority, as it protects against certain types of cancer and STIs. 8. The other options are not as relevant to the patient's specific situation: - Pneumococcal vaccine (A) is recommended for older adults or those with certain medical conditions, but not typically for young adults without risk factors. - Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis booster (Tdap) vaccine (B) is recommended for adolescents and adults, but not typically for young adults without a specific need for booster shots. - Haemophilus influenzae type b (HIB) vaccine (C) is typically recommended for children under 5 years old. Based on the above analysis, the most appropriate vaccine to administer to this patient is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a young adult with a history of exercise-induced asthma and is sexually active, making him susceptible to HPV. The HPV vaccine is the most relevant vaccine to consider given his age and history. The other options are not as relevant to the patient's specific situation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

He was recently incarcerated near Bakersfield, California and returned to Oakland about 3 months ago. He is currently experiencing one month of severe headache and double vision. He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

            "content": "In 2007, the ACIP recommended routine immunization of 9to 26-year-old girls and women with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18) approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; the optimal age for recommended vaccination is 11\u201312 years because of the very high risk of HPV infection after sexual debut. In 2009, the ACIP added bivalent HPV vaccine (against types 6 and 11) as an option and expanded the groups in which immunization (with either quadrivalent or bivalent vaccine) is safe and effective to include boys and men 9\u201326 years old. HPV vaccines offering broader protection against additional oncogenic HPV types are anticipated. Since 2011, the ACIP has recommended routine administration of quadrivalent HPV vaccine to boys at 11 or 12 years of age and to males 13\u201321 years of age who have not yet been vaccinated or who have not completed the three-dose vaccine series; men 22\u201326 years of age may also be vaccinated."

He is then switched to celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily, and on this regimen his joint symptoms and heartburn resolve. Two years later, he returns with increased joint symptoms. His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor. With the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, he is started on a regimen"

He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

            "content": "In the United States, the prevalence of antibody to HSV-2 began to fall in the late 1990s, especially among adolescents and young adults; the decline is presumably due to delayed sexual debut, increased condom use, and lower rates of multiple (four or more) sex partners, as is well documented by the U.S. Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. The estimated annual incidence of HBV infection has also declined dramatically since the mid-1980s; this decrease is probably attributable more to adoption of safer sexual practices and reduced needle sharing among injection drug users than to use of hepatitis B vaccine, for which coverage among young adults (including those at high risk for this infection) initially was very limited. Genital HPV remains the most common sexually transmitted pathogen in this country, infecting 60% of a cohort of initially HPV-negative, sexually active Washington state college women within 5 years in a study conducted from 1990 to 2000. The scale-up of HPV"
