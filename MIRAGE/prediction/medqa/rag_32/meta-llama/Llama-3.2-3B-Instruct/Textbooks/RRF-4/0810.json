The negative Coombs test suggests that the hemolysis is not due to an immune-mediated process. The spherocytes are a hallmark of hereditary spherocytosis (HS), a disorder of the red blood cell membrane. The splenomegaly is consistent with HS, as the spleen sequesters and destroys the abnormal red blood cells. The mild anemia and normal reticulocyte count suggest that the bone marrow is producing red blood cells at a normal rate, but they are being destroyed at a similar rate. The MCV is slightly above the normal range, which is consistent with HS. The physical examination findings of scleral icterus and splenomegaly are also consistent with HS. The liver function tests are not directly relevant to the diagnosis of HS, but they may be abnormal in patients with HS due to the chronic hemolysis. The Coombs test is negative, which rules out autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The flow cytometry for CD55/CD59 is a specific test for diagnosing paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), which is not consistent with the patient's presentation. The anti-parvovirus B19 antibodies are not relevant to the diagnosis of HS. The eosin-5-maleimide binding test is used to diagnose paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), which is not consistent with the patient's presentation. The liver function tests are not directly relevant to the diagnosis of HS, but they may be abnormal in patients with HS due to the chronic hemolysis.

Peritoneal fluid in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis has a high neutrophil count of greater than 250 cells/mm3. Other tests that should be run on the peritoneal fluid includeamylase (to rule out pancreatic ascites), culture, albumin, andlactate dehydrogenase concentration. For culture, a large sampleof fluid should be placed into aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles immediately on obtaining the sample."

            "content": "Laboratory Testing. The thalassemia minor syndromes are characterized by a mild hypochromic, microcytic anemia with a low absolute reticulocyte count (see Table 150-5). The RBC count is usually elevated. As a result, if the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) divided by the RBC count is less than 12.5 (Mentzer index), the diagnosis is suggestive of thalassemia trait. The blood smear reveals only microcytosis with \u03b1-thalassemia trait. Outside the neonatal period, when Bart hemoglobin is detectable, hemoglobin electrophoresis usually is normal in \u03b1-thalassemia minor (see Fig. 150-3). Blood smears of patients with \u03b2-thalassemia minor show microcytic RBCs. Target cells and basophilic stippled RBCs, caused by precipitation of alpha chain tetramers, also may be present. The diagnosis is based on an elevation of hemoglobin A2 and F levels in \u03b2-thalassemia. Molecular testing is indicated for identification of more severe or unusual variants."

ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AMA, antimitochondrial antibody; ANA, antinuclear antibody; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; LKM, liver-kidney microsomal antibody; MRCP, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; SMA, smooth-muscle antibody; SPEP, serum protein electrophoresis. Simply stated, the initial step is to perform appropriate blood tests in order to determine whether the patient has an isolated elevation of serum bilirubin. If so, is the bilirubin elevation due to an increased unconjugated or conjugated fraction? If the hyperbilirubinemia is accompanied by other liver test abnormalities, is the disorder hepatocellular or cholestatic? If cholestatic, is it intraor extrahepatic? All of these questions can be answered with a thoughtful history, physical examination, and interpretation of laboratory and radiologic tests and procedures."

Reticulocytes are absent or few, and lymphocyte numbers may be normal or reduced. The presence of immature myeloid forms suggests leukemia or MDS; nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) suggest marrow fibrosis or tumor invasion; abnormal platelets suggest either peripheral destruction or MDS."

            "content": "Blood Loss/Hemolytic Anemia In contrast to anemias associated with an inappropriately low reticulocyte production index, hemolysis is associated with red cell production indices \u22652.5 times normal. The stimulated erythropoiesis is reflected in the blood smear by the appearance of increased numbers of polychromatophilic macrocytes. A marrow examination is rarely indicated if the reticulocyte production index is increased appropriately. The red cell indices are typically normocytic or slightly macrocytic, reflecting the increased number of reticulocytes. Acute blood loss is not associated with an increased reticulocyte production index because of the time required to increase EPO production and, subsequently, marrow proliferation. Subacute blood loss may be associated with modest reticulocytosis. Anemia from chronic blood loss presents more often as iron deficiency than with the picture of increased red cell production."

            "content": "Hemolytic Anemias and Anemia Due to Acute Blood Loss 650 The laboratory features of HA are related to hemolysis per se and the erythropoietic response of the bone marrow. Hemolysis regularly produces an increase in unconjugated bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in the serum; urobilinogen will be increased in both urine and stool. If hemolysis is mainly intravascular, the telltale sign is hemoglobinuria (often associated with hemosiderinuria); in the serum, there is hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is increased, and haptoglobin is reduced. In contrast, the bilirubin level may be normal or only mildly elevated. The main sign of the erythropoietic response by the bone marrow is an increase in reticulocytes (a test all too often neglected in the initial workup of a patient with anemia). Usually the increase will be reflected in both the percentage of reticulocytes (the more commonly quoted figure) and the absolute reticulocyte count (the more definitive parameter). The"

Physical examination shows hyperpigmentation, hepatomegaly, and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory tests are remarkable for elevated serum transaminases (liver function tests) and fasting blood glucose. Results of other tests are pending. Correct answer = B. The patient has hereditary hemochromatosis, a disease of iron overload that results from inappropriately low levels of hepcidin caused primarily by mutations to the HFE (high iron) gene. Hepcidin regulates ferroportin, the only known iron export protein in humans, by increasing its degradation. The increase in iron with hepcidin deficiency causes hyperpigmentation and hyperglycemia (\u201cbronze diabetes\u201d). Phlebotomy or use of iron chelators is the treatment. [Note: Pending lab tests would show an increase in serum iron and transferrin saturation.] UNIT VII Storage and Expression of Genetic Information"
