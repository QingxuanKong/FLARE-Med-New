This finding is concerning for magnesium toxicity. Magnesium sulfate can cause neuromuscular blockade and respiratory depression, and absent deep tendon reflexes are a sign of neuromuscular blockade. The next step is to assess for magnesium toxicity and to correct it if necessary. The patient should be monitored for signs of respiratory depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and other systemic effects of magnesium toxicity. The most appropriate next step is to stop magnesium sulfate and give calcium gluconate to counteract the effects of magnesium toxicity and prevent further complications. This is a life-saving measure to prevent respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. The other options are not the most appropriate next step in management. Stopping labetalol (option B) may not be necessary as it is being used for blood pressure control. Stopping magnesium sulfate and giving lorazepam (option C) may not be sufficient to correct magnesium toxicity. Performing nerve conduction studies (option D) is not relevant in this acute setting and may not be helpful in managing magnesium toxicity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Its role is presumably that of a calcium antagonist, and when given in pharmacological doses, it may inhibit labor. Intravenous magnesium sulfate, given s a 4-g loading dose and followed by a continuous inusion of 2 g/hr, usually arrests labor (Steer, 1977). Like 3-mimetic agents, magnesium treatment can cause pulmonary edema (Samol, 2005). However, this has not been our experience at Parkland Hospitl in the treatment of tens of thousands of preeclamptic women with intravenous magnesium sulfate. Pharmacology and toxicology of magnesium are considered in more detail in Chapter 40 (p. 737)."

Further stratification of outcomes by gestational age is described in Chapter 42 (p. 806). Overall, prognosis is improved if previa ble PPROM occurred at a later gestation, latency is longer, and oligohydramnios is absent. Neonatal mortality predominantly stems from pulmonary dysfunction, which has higher rates when oligohydramnios persists (Winn, 2000). Fetal deforma tions may also result from scant amnionic luid. Amnioinfusion has been investigated but is currently investigational (Roberts, 20i14). If expectant care is elected, management is described in Chapter 42 (p. 807). Antibiotics are considered and given for 7 days to extend latency. Other topics include lung-maturing corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate neuroprophylaxis, group"

If not satisfactory, this is followed by labetalol. Nedipine given sublingualy is no longer recommended. his route is associated with dangerously rapid and extensive efects. Randomized trials that compared nifedipine with labetalol found neither drug definitively superior, but nifedipine lowered blood pressure more quickly (Scardo, 1999; Shekhar, 2016; Vermillion, 1999). Finally, nifedipine does not potentiate magnesium-related efects (Magee, 2015)."

This was accomplished via the administration of both oral and intravenous K+-Cl\u2212, giving a total of 240 meq over the first 18 h; 5 g of intravenous magnesium sulfate was also administered. Multiple 100-mL \u201cminibags\u201d of saline containing 20 meq each were infused, with cardiac monitoring and frequent measurement of plasma electrolytes. Of note, intravenous K+-Cl\u2212 should always be given in saline solutions because dextrose-containing solutions can increase insulin levels and exacerbate hypokalemia."

Labor and delivery units should be stocked with a 20-percent lipid emulsion solution (Intralipid). It is administered as a rapid intravenous bolus followed by an infusion upon the first sign of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (Neal, 2012). Controlling seizures and securing the airway are essential to prevent aspiration and hypoxemia. Benzodiazepines, such as midazolam or lorazepam, may be used to help control seizures, particularly if lipid emulsions are not available. Magnesium sulfate also controls convulsions (Chap 40, p. 736). Abnormal fetal heart follow and stem from maternal hypoxia. With proper manage ment, including supportive measures, the fetus usually recovers. herefore, it is best for the fetus and mother to delay delivery until the mother is stabilized."

When magnesium sulfate is given to arrest eclamptic seizures, 10 to 15 percent of women will have a subsequent convulsion. If so, an additional 2-g dose of magnesium sulfate in a 20-percent solution is slowly administered intravenously. In a small woman, this additional 2-g dose may be used once, but it can be given twice if needed in a larger woman. In only 5 of 245 women with eclampsia at Parkland Hospital was it necessary to use alternative supplementary anticonvulsant medication to control convulsions (Pritchard, 1984). For these, an intravenous barbiturate is given slowly. Midazolam or lorazepam may also be given in a small single dose, but prolonged use is avoided because it is associated with a higher mortality rate from aspiration pneumonia (Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 2006)."
