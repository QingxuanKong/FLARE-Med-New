    "question": "A 27-year-old woman was referred to a dermatology clinic due to a changing discoloration of her fingers from white to red to blue. Although she has not had any recent changes in her daily routines, she also complains of increasing fatigue, muscle weakness, and weight loss. She has a blood pressure of 126/77 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 14/min, and heart rate of 88/min. Physical examination reveals regular heart and lung sounds. Anti-U1 RNP antibodies and increased creatinine kinase were found in her serum. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

The presence of anti-U1 RNP antibodies is also a hallmark of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), but the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with dermatomyositis. The elevated creatinine kinase (CK) levels indicate muscle damage, which is also consistent with dermatomyositis. The patient's fatigue, muscle weakness, and weight loss are also consistent with dermatomyositis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is dermatomyositis. The other options, mixed connective tissue disease, polymyositis, and rheumatoid arthritis, can also present with muscle weakness and elevated CK levels, but the characteristic skin rash and anti-U1 RNP antibodies are not present in these conditions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

The majority of these are related to cell damage caused by smoking and alcohol use. Certain viruses are also related to cancers in the head and neck, including human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). A 50-year-old overweight woman came to the doctor complaining of hoarseness of voice and noisy breathing. She was also concerned at the increase in size of her neck. On examination she had a slow pulse rate (45 beats per minute). She also had an irregular knobby mass in the anterior aspect of the lower neck, which deviated the trachea to the right. A clinical diagnosis of a multinodular goiter and hypothyroidism was made."

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."
