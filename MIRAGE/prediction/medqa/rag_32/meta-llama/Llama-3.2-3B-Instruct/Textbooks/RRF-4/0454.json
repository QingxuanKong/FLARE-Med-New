    "question": "A 42-year-old man presents to a neurologist for evaluation of severe headache. He started experiencing episodic headaches and palpitations 3 months ago; however, he thought that these symptoms were simply related to the stress of moving and starting a new job. He has continued to experience these intermittent headaches and has also noticed that he sweats profusely during these episodes. On presentation his temperature is 99.1\u00b0F (37.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 163/112 mmHg, pulse is 112/min, and respirations are 15/min. Physical exam reveals pallor and perspiration but is otherwise unremarkable.

    "predict": "After analyzing the provided documents, I'll break down the thought process step-by-step: 1. The patient presents with severe headache, palpitations, sweating, and profuse perspiration, which are classic symptoms of a condition that is often associated with an excess of catecholamines in the body. 2. The symptoms of episodic headaches and palpitations are suggestive of a condition that affects the autonomic nervous system, particularly the sympathetic nervous system. 3. The symptoms of sweating and profuse perspiration are indicative of a condition that leads to an overactive sympathetic nervous system. 4. The patient's blood pressure is elevated, which further supports the idea of an overactive sympathetic nervous system. 5. The symptoms of the patient are consistent with a pheochromocytoma, a type of tumor that produces excess catecholamines. 6. The tumor is likely located in the adrenal gland or the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the excess catecholamines. 7. The histology slide likely shows the tumor cells, which are typically found in the adrenal medulla or the sympathetic nervous system. Given these clues, the most likely region of the histology slide that would show the tumor cells is the region of the sympathetic nervous system. Now, let's look at the options: A. A - This region is not typically associated with the symptoms described. B. B - This region is not typically associated with the symptoms described. C. C - This region is not typically associated with the symptoms described. D. E - This region is the adrenal medulla, which is the most likely location of the tumor cells. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are consistent with a pheochromocytoma, a tumor that produces excess catecholamines. The tumor is likely located in the adrenal medulla, which is region E.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination?

Although popularly considered a symptom of elevated arterial pressure, headache generally occurs only in patients with severe hypertension. Characteristically, a \u201chypertensive headache\u201d occurs in the morning and is localized to the occipital region. Other nonspecific symptoms that may be related to elevated blood pressure include dizziness, palpitations, easy fatigability, and impotence. When symptoms are present, they are generally related to hypertensive cardiovascular disease or to manifestations of secondary hypertension.

Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

            "content": "The premonitory clinical characteristics may be nonspecific and include weakness, dizziness, disorientation, ataxia, and gastrointestinal or psychiatric symptoms. These prodromal symptoms often resemble heat exhaustion. The sudden onset of heatstroke occurs when the maintenance of adequate perfusion requires peripheral vasoconstriction to stabilize the mean arterial blood pressure. As a result, the cutaneous radiation of heat ceases. At this juncture, the core temperature rises dramatically. Since many patients with heatstroke also meet the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome and have a broad differential diagnosis, rapid cooling is essential during the extensive diagnostic evaluation (Table 479e-1)."

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

            "content": "The following three brief scenarios of a patient with hemoptysis demonstrate three distinct patterns: A 46-year-old man presents to his internist with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

            "content": "Brain tumors of any type can present with a variety of symptoms and signs that fall into two categories: general and focal; patients often have a combination of the two (Table 118-1). General or nonspecific symptoms include headache, with or without nausea or vomiting, cognitive difficulties, personality change, and gait disorder. Generalized symptoms arise when the enlarging tumor and its surrounding edema cause an increase in intracranial pressure or direct compression of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation leading to hydrocephalus. The classic headache associated with a brain tumor is most evident in the morning and improves during the day, but this particular pattern is actually seen in a minority of patients. Headaches are often holocephalic but can be ipsilateral to the side of a tumor. Occasionally, headaches have features of a typical migraine with unilateral throbbing pain associated with visual scotoma. Personality changes may include apathy and withdrawal from social"

In some, the pain is slight, dull, and episodic; in others, it is severe and either dull or sharp but also intermittent. If there are any characteristic features of the headache, they would be its nocturnal occurrence or presence on first awakening and perhaps its deep, nonpulsatile quality. However, these are not specific attributes, as migraine and hypertensive vascular headaches may also begin in the early morning hours or upon awakening. But if vomiting occurs at the peak of the head pain, tumor is more likely, as noted later. Occipitonuchal headache with vomiting is indicative of a tumor in or near the cerebellum and foramen magnum and is one typical presentation of brain tumors in children."

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."
