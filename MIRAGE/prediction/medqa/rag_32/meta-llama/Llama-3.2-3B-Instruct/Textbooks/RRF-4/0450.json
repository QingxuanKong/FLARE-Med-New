He feels increasingly anxious during physical education (PE) class as he has noticed that the size of his penis is significantly smaller when compared to his peers. Based on the physical examination, he is Tanner stage 1. The weight and height are 60 kg (132 lb) and 175 cm (5 ft 9 in), respectively.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break it down step by step. The patient is a 17-year-old boy who is experiencing anxiety due to his penis size being smaller than his peers. He is Tanner stage 1, which indicates that he has not yet entered puberty. The patient's difficulty identifying coffee grounds by smell suggests an issue with the sense of smell, which is mediated by the olfactory system. The olfactory system is responsible for detecting odor molecules in the air, and it is linked to the hypothalamus, which is also involved in regulating reproductive hormones. Given the patient's age and Tanner stage, it is likely that the issue is related to a hormone deficiency that affects both the sense of smell and reproductive development. The most likely cause is Kallmann syndrome, which is a genetic disorder caused by a non-disjunction of sex chromosomes, resulting in an isolated GnRH deficiency. This deficiency affects the production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which is essential for the regulation of sex hormones and reproductive development. The expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat (option A) is associated with Fragile X syndrome, which is a different condition that affects cognitive development and behavior. Isolated GnRH deficiency (option B) is a possible cause, but it is not the most likely explanation given the patient's age and the combination of symptoms. Sex-specific epigenetic imprinting (option C) is a mechanism that regulates gene expression, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Non-disjunction of sex chromosomes, which is the underlying cause of Kallmann syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Boys with pubertal delay may have accompanying emotional and physical immaturity relative to their peers, which can be a source of anxiety. Physical examination should focus on height; arm span; weight; visual fields; and secondary sex characteristics, including hair growth, testicular volume, phallic size, and scrotal reddening and thinning. Testicular size >2.5 cm generally indicates that the child has entered puberty."

Pigmented, curly pubic hair is first visible around the base of the penis.

Thicker, curly hair extends above the penis. Tanner stage 4 involves further growth of the genitalia, with testis length ranging from 4 to 4.5 cm. Extension of pubic hair over the genital area continues, but the volume is less than in the adult. At this stage, the prostate gland is palpable by rectal examination.

He has hypertension, and during the last 8 years, he has been adequately managed with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH\u2019s problem? What information would you gather to confirm your diagnosis? What treatment steps would you initiate?"

The patient had noted 2 days of abdominal pain and fever, and his clinical evaluation and CT scan were consistent with appendicitis. His clinical find-ings resolved after laparoscopic appendectomy. The patient immigrated to the USA 10 years ago from a rural area of Peru where his family trades in sheepskins. His father and sister have undergone resection of abdominal masses, but details of their diagnoses are unavailable. What is your differential diagnosis? What are your diagnostic and therapeutic plans?"

At the initial examination, blood pressure should be measured in both arms and preferably in the supine, sitting, and standing positions to evaluate for postural hypotension. Even if the femoral pulse is normal to palpation, arterial pressure should be measured at least once in the lower extremity in patients in whom hypertension is discovered before age 30. Heart rate also should be recorded. Hypertensive individuals have an increased prevalence of atrial fibrillation. The neck should be palpated for an enlarged thyroid gland, and patients should be assessed for signs of hypoand hyperthyroidism. Examination of blood vessels may provide clues about underlying vascular disease and should include funduscopic examination, auscultation for bruits over the carotid and femoral arteries, and palpation of femoral and pedal pulses. The retina is the only tissue in which arteries and arterioles can be examined directly. With increasing"

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian"

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

Following a sleepless night with significant dyspnea, the patient develops nausea and vomiting and collapses. He presents to the emergency department in cardiac arrest and is unable to be resuscitated. His autopsy shows a posterior wall myocardial infarction and a fresh thrombus in an atherosclerotic right coronary artery. What went wrong? The clinician had decided, based on the patient\u2019s appearance, even before starting the history, that the patient\u2019s complaints were not serious. Therefore, he felt confident that he could perform an abbreviated and focused examination by using the URI assessment protocol rather than considering the broader range of possibilities and performing appropriate tests to confirm or refute his initial hypotheses. In particular, by concentrating on the URI, the clinician failed to elicit the full dyspnea history, which would have"

Once she has used the insert on a number of occasions during sexual play, encourage her to follow it immediately with insertion of her partner\u2019s penis. It is usually preferable for the woman to hold her partner\u2019s penis in the same position she used with the insert and to insert the penis herself. He must allow his pelvis to move forward with gentle pressure as she tries to insert it. The use of external lubrication is advised in these first attempts at penile entry. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors may be used to treat temporary situational partner erectile dysfunction that occurs at the crucial moment when the woman is finally able to accommodate her partner\u2019s penis."
