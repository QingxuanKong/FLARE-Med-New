    "question": "A 66-year-old woman presents with urinary incontinence, difficulty urinating, incomplete voiding, and dull pain in the suprapubic region. She reports that she has not urinated for the past 2 days and that the urine leakage occurs during both day and night and is not associated with physical exertion. The medical history is significant for arterial hypertension and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus for 8 years, and depression for 3 years. She is prescribed amlodipine, valsartan, atorvastatin, metformin, and amitriptyline. Her weight is 75 kg (165 lb) and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 40 in). Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 120/80 mm Hg; heart rate, 91/min; respiratory rate, 13/min; and temperature, 36.4\u2103 (97.5\u2109). The physical examination reveals lower abdominal tenderness with a distended urinary bladder that is palpated in the suprapubic region. The neurological examination shows decreased Achilles reflexes bilaterally, and diminished fine touch and vibratory sensation. On gynecologic examination, the cervix was normally positioned, mobile, and without any visible lesions. Bulging of the posterior vaginal wall was noted. The adnexa were not palpable. An ultrasound examination showed an overdistended urinary bladder with no structural abnormalities. Which of the following is  the next step in managing this patient?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with urinary incontinence, difficulty urinating, incomplete voiding, and dull pain in the suprapubic region, which suggests an overdistended bladder. The patient's symptoms are not associated with physical exertion, which rules out stress urinary incontinence. The patient's medical history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus is also a significant clue. The neurological examination shows decreased Achilles reflexes bilaterally, and diminished fine touch and vibratory sensation, which suggests neurogenic bladder. The ultrasound examination shows an overdistended urinary bladder with no structural abnormalities, which further supports the diagnosis of neurogenic bladder. The bulging of the posterior vaginal wall is a sign of urinary retention. Given these findings, the next step in managing this patient would be to relieve the urinary retention by draining the bladder. Bladder catheterization is the most appropriate treatment option to relieve the overdistension and prevent further complications such as urinary tract infections or kidney damage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The history should include a review of symptoms, general medical history, review of past surgery, and current medications. The woman\u2019s most troubling symptoms must be ascertained\u2014how often she leaks urine, how much urine she leaks, what provokes urine loss, what improves or worsens the problem, and what treatment (if any) she had in the past. It is essential to keep the patient\u2019s chief symptom at the forefront to avoid inappropriate management. Consider, for example, a woman whose chief concern is that once a month, while leading a business seminar, she has a sudden, overwhelming urge to void followed by complete bladder emptying. She finds this leakage devastating and is considering quitting her job because of her acute embarrassment. On occasion, she leaks a few drops of urine during exercise, but this minor leakage does not bother her. During the evaluation, urodynamics reveal minimal stress"

            "content": "The clinical context, careful history taking, and physical examination often narrow the differential diagnosis for the cause of AKI. Prerenal azotemia should be suspected in the setting of vomiting, diarrhea, glycosuria causing polyuria, and several medications including diuretics, NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs. Physical signs of orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, reduced jugular venous pressure, decreased skin turgor, and dry mucous membranes are often present in prerenal azotemia. A history of prostatic disease, nephrolithiasis, or pelvic or paraaortic malignancy would suggest the possibility of postrenal AKI. Whether or not symptoms are present early during obstruction of the urinary tract depends on the location of obstruction. Colicky flank pain radiating to the groin suggests acute ureteric obstruction. Nocturia and urinary frequency or hesitancy can be seen in prostatic disease. Abdominal fullness and suprapubic pain can accompany massive bladder enlargement. Definitive"

The pain of dysmenorrhea is colicky in nature and, unlike abdominal pain that is caused by chemical or infectious peritonitis, is relieved by abdominal massage, counter-pressure, or movement of the body. On examination, the vital signs are normal. The suprapubic region may be tender to palpation. Bowel sounds are normal, and there is no upper abdominal tenderness and no abdominal rebound tenderness. Bimanual examination at the time of the dysmenorrheic episode often reveals uterine tenderness; severe pain does not occur with movement of the cervix or palpation of the adnexal structures.

The extent of the physical examination during the gynecologic visit is often dictated by the patient\u2019s primary concerns and symptoms. For example, for healthy teens without symptoms who are requesting oral contraceptives before the initiation of intercourse, a gynecologic examination is not necessarily required. Some aspects of the examination\u2014such as assessment of vital signs and measurement of height, weight, blood pressure, and calculation of a body mass index\u2014 should be performed routinely during most office visits. Typically, examination of the breasts and abdomen and a complete examination of the pelvis are considered to be essential parts of the gynecologic examination. It is often helpful to ask the patient if the gynecologic examination was difficult for her in the past; this"

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Laboratory evaluation of patients with known or suspected heart disease should include a blood count and serum chemistry analysis. Patients with heart disease tolerate anemia poorly. Serum sodium and potassium levels are particularly important in patients taking diuretics and digitalis. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine values provide information on renal function and hydration status. Assessment of blood glucose levels may detect undiagnosed DM. Chest radiography and electrocardiography are mandatory as part of the preoperative evaluation, and the results may be particularly helpful when compared with those of previous studies."

With tubal rupture, lower abdominal and pelvic pain is usually severe and frequently described as sharp, stabbing, or tearing. Abdominal palpation elicits tenderness. Bimanual pelvic examination, especially cervical motion, causes exquisite pain. The posterior vaginal fornix may bulge from blood in the rectouterine cul-de-sac, or a tender, boggy mass may be felt beside the uterus. The uterus can also be slightly enlarged due to hormonal stimulation. Symptoms of diaphragmatic irritation, characterized by neck or shoulder pain, especially on inspiration, develop in perhaps half of women with sizable hemoperitoneum."
