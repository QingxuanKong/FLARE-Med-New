    "question": "A 48-year-old man presents to the clinic with nausea, vomiting, fever, and pain in the right upper quadrant of his abdomen for the past 18 hours. He mentions that he has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain at the same location over the last 3 months and that these episodes usually occur after a heavy meal and subside within 1 or 2 hours. On physical examination, his temperature is 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. On examination of the abdomen, tenderness is present over the right upper quadrant; palpation over the area produces an inspiratory pause. An urgent bedside ultrasonogram shows a dilated common bile duct stone, but no stone in the common bile duct or in the gallbladder. Laboratory results show the following:\nHemoglobin 15.4 g/dL (9.56 mmol/L)\nTotal leukocyte count 14,000/mm3 (17.4 x 10*9/L)\nSegmented neutrophils 70%\nLymphocytes 25%\nMonocytes 4%\nEosinophils 1%\nBasophils 0%\nPlatelet count 32,0000/mm3 (320 x 10*9/L)\nSerum bilirubin (total) 1.8 mg/dL (30.78 \u03bcmol/L)\nSerum bilirubin (direct) 1.1 mg/dL (18.81 \u03bcmol/L)\nSerum alanine aminotransferase 96 U/L\nSerum aspartate aminotransferase 88 U/L\nSerum alkaline phosphatase\n350 U/L (5.83 \u03bckat/L)\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The triad of sudden onset of RUQ tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis is highly suggestive. Typically, leukocytosis in the range of 10,000\u201315,000 cells per microliter with a left shift on differential count is found. The serum bilirubin is mildly elevated (<85.5 \u03bcmol/L [5 mg/dL]) in fewer than half of patients, whereas about one-fourth have modest elevations in serum aminotransferases (usually less than a fivefold elevation). Ultrasound will demonstrate calculi in 90\u201395% of cases and is useful for detection of signs of gallbladder inflammation including thickening of the wall, pericholecystic fluid, and dilatation of the bile duct. The radionuclide (e.g., HIDA) biliary scan may be confirmatory if bile duct imaging is seen without visualization of the gallbladder."

It is steady rather than intermittent, as would be suggested by the word colic, which must be regarded as a misnomer, although it is in widespread use. An episode of biliary pain persisting beyond 5 h should raise the suspicion of acute cholecystitis (see below). Nausea and vomiting frequently accompany episodes of biliary pain. An elevated level of serum bilirubin and/or alkaline phosphatase suggests a common duct stone. Fever or chills (rigors) with biliary pain usually imply a complication, i.e., cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or cholangitis.

Biliary obstruction causes progressive dilatation of the intra-hepatic bile ducts as intrabiliary pressures rise.

Patients with indwelling stents are at particularly high risk for cholan-gitis, though rarely become jaundiced as a patent stent will prevent the obstruction of bile flow. On abdominal examina-tion, the findings are indistinguishable from those of acute cholecystitis.44Diagnosis Leukocytosis, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevation of alkaline phosphatase and transaminases are common and, when present, support the clinical diagnosis of cholangitis. Ultraso-nography is helpful, as it will document the presence of gall-bladder stones, demonstrate dilated ducts, and possibly pinpoint a site of obstruction. CT scanning and MRI can show pancreatic and periampullary masses, if present, in addition to the ductal dilatation. However, abdominal imaging will rarely elucidate the exact cause of cholangitis, and the initial diagnosis is gener-ally made clinically.Treatment The initial treatment of patients with cholangi-tis"

In uncomplicated acute cho-lecystitis, serum liver chemistries are usually normal, but a mild elevation of serum bilirubin (<4 mg/mL) may be present along with mild elevation of alkaline phosphatase, transami-nases, and amylase.28 Severe jaundice is suggestive of obstruc-tion of the bile ducts. This can be a result of common bile duct stones or severe pericholecystic inflammation secondary to impaction of a stone in the infundibulum of the gallblad-der that mechanically obstructs the bile duct, known as Mir-izzi\u2019s syndrome (Fig. 32-16).

He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day.

Other conventional hepatic biochemical tests such as serum aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase are normal, and there is no evidence of hemolysis. Hepatic histology is also essentially normal except for the occasional presence of bile plugs within canaliculi. Bilirubin glucuronides are virtually absent from the bile, and there is no detectable constitutive expression of UGT1A1 activity in hepatic tissue. Neither UGT1A1 activity nor the serum bilirubin concentration responds to administration of phenobarbital or other enzyme inducers. In the absence of conjugation, unconjugated bilirubin accumulates in plasma, from which it is eliminated very slowly by alternative pathways that include direct passage into the bile and small intestine. These account for the small amounts of urobilinogen"

Simply stated, the initial step is to perform appropriate blood tests in order to determine whether the patient has an isolated elevation of serum bilirubin. If so, is the bilirubin elevation due to an increased unconjugated or conjugated fraction? If the hyperbilirubinemia is accompanied by other liver test abnormalities, is the disorder hepatocellular or cholestatic? If cholestatic, is it intraor extrahepatic? All of these questions can be answered with a thoughtful history, physical examination, and interpretation of laboratory and radiologic tests and procedures."
