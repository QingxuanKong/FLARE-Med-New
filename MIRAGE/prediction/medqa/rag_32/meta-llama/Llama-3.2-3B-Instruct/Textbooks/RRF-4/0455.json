    "question": "A 62-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for vision changes. About 90 minutes ago she was on the couch watching television with her husband when she suddenly noticed that she couldn't see the screen normally. She also felt a little dizzy. She has never had anything like this happen before. Her general physical exam is unremarkable. Her neurologic exam is notable for loss of vision in the right visual field of both eyes with macular sparing, though extraocular movements are intact. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head shows no acute intracranial process. Angiography of the brain will most likely show a lesion in which of the following vessels?",

The patient presents with sudden vision changes, specifically loss of vision in the right visual field of both eyes with macular sparing, and dizziness. This is a classic presentation for a visual field defect caused by a lesion in the optic radiation, which is usually supplied by the posterior cerebral artery (PCA). The macular sparing is also consistent with a PCA lesion. The CT scan shows no acute intracranial process, but angiography of the brain will likely show a lesion in the posterior cerebral artery. Let's evaluate the options: A. Internal carotid artery - This artery supplies the anterior visual pathway, including the optic chiasm and optic tracts, but not the visual cortex or the posterior cerebral artery territory. B. Anterior cerebral artery - This artery supplies the medial surface of the brain, including the anterior visual pathway, but not the posterior cerebral artery territory. C. Posterior cerebral artery - This artery supplies the occipital lobe, including the visual cortex, and the optic radiation, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms. D. Basilar artery - This artery supplies the brainstem and the posterior inferior cerebellar arteries, but not the visual cortex or the posterior cerebral artery territory. Therefore, the most likely location of the lesion is the posterior cerebral artery, which is responsible for supplying the visual cortex and the optic radiation. The answer is C. Posterior cerebral artery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

A 60-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department with acute right-sided weakness, predominantly in the upper limb, which lasted for 24 hours. She made an uneventful recovery, but was extremely concerned about the nature of her illness and went to see her local doctor. A diagnosis of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) was made. A TIA is a neurological deficit resolving within 24 hours. It is a type of stroke. Neurological deficits may be permanent or transient. Most transient events resolve within 21 days; any failure of resolution beyond 21 days is an established stroke. An investigation into the cause of the TIA was undertaken. Eighty-five percent of all strokes result from cerebral infarction, of which most are due to embolization. A duplex Doppler scan of the carotid vessels was performed."

Attention should be given to any symptoms or signs that point to central dysfunction (diplopia, weakness or numbness, dysarthria). The pattern of spontaneous nystagmus, if present, may be helpful (Table 28-1). If the head impulse test is normal, an acute peripheral vestibular lesion is unlikely. A central lesion cannot always be excluded with certainty based on symptoms and examination alone; thus, older patients with vascular risk factors who present with an acute vestibular syndrome should be evaluated for the possibility of stroke even when there are no specific findings that indicate a central lesion."

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

In other words, the diagnosis of ruptured saccular aneurysm is essentially excluded if blood is not present in the CSF, provided the spinal fluid is examined more than 30 min after the event. Xanthochromia is found after centrifugation of the CSF if several hours or more have elapsed from the moment of the ictus. In a patient who reports a headache that was consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage but that had occurred several days earlier, the CT may be normal and xanthochromia is the only diagnostic finding. To determine whether xanthochromia is present, fresh CSF must be centrifuged in a tube with a conical bottom and the supernatant compared to clear water in good light or preferably examined by spectrophotometric techniques. It has been our experience that most hospital laboratories cannot be depended on to give accurate results for this test from visual inspection alone. Also helpful"

Either the small superficial or deep retinal hemorrhage may show a central or eccentric pale (Roth) spot, which is caused by an accumulation of white blood cells, fibrin, histiocytes, or amorphous material between the vessel and the hemorrhage. This lesion is said to be characteristic of bacterial endocarditis, but it is also seen in leukemia and occasionally in embolic retinopathy caused by carotid disease."

The common ocular symptoms associated with extra-cranial carotid artery occlusive disease include amaurosis fugax and presence of Hollenhorst plaques. Amaurosis fugax, com-monly referred to as transient monocular blindness, is a tempo-rary loss of vision in one eye that patients typically describe as a window shutter coming down or grey shedding of the vision. This partial blindness usually lasts for a few minutes and then resolves. Most of these phenomena (>90%) are due to embolic occlusion of the main artery or the upper or lower divisions. Monocular blindness progressing over a 20-minute period sug-gests a migrainous etiology. Occasionally, the patient will recall no visual symptoms while the optician notes a yellowish plaque within the retinal vessels, which is also known as Hollenhorst plaque. These plaques are frequently derived from"
