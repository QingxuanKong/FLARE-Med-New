    "question": "A 38-year-old woman presents to the office for a routine examination. She has no complaints and offers very little information voluntarily. She answers each question with soft, short sentences and avoids eye contact. She appears timid, anxious and admits that this is one of the very few times she has left the house in the last several years. Medical history is significant for essential hypertension. She takes hydrochlorothiazide and a daily vitamin. She has worked from home as a web graphic designer for 20 years. Questions about her social life reveal that she is very shy with few friends, and she often makes excuses to avoid parties and social gatherings. Despite this, she expresses a strong desire to be in a relationship. Today, her blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg, heart rate is 95/min, respiratory rate is 18/min, and temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical examination, her heart has a regular rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Which of the following is most consistent with her behavior?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most consistent diagnosis with the patient's behavior, let's analyze the information provided:\\n\\nThe patient is a 38-year-old woman who appears timid, anxious, and admits to being very shy with few friends. She has worked from home as a web graphic designer for 20 years and expresses a strong desire to be in a relationship despite her social anxiety. She also has a history of essential hypertension and takes hydrochlorothiazide and a daily vitamin.\\n\\nThe key points that suggest her behavior are:\\n\\n1. Social isolation: She has worked from home for 20 years and admits to avoiding parties and social gatherings.\\n2. Social anxiety: She is shy, timid, and expresses a strong desire to be in a relationship despite her social anxiety.\\n3. Avoidance behaviors: She makes excuses to avoid social situations.\\n\\nBased on these points, the most consistent diagnosis is Avoidant Personality Disorder (B). This disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and social avoidance due to feelings of social anxiety or fear of criticism or rejection.\\n\\nThe other options are not supported by the information provided:\\n\\nA. Schizoid Personality Disorder is characterized by a lack of interest in social relationships, a restricted range of emotional expression, and a tendency towards a solitary lifestyle. While the patient is shy, there is no indication of a lack of interest in social relationships or a restricted range of emotional expression.\\n\\nC. Antisocial Personality Disorder is characterized by a disregard for the rights of others, a lack of empathy, and a tendency to engage in impulsive and aggressive behavior. There is no indication of these behaviors in the patient's history.\\n\\nD. Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by a fear of being in public places or situations that might cause panic, helplessness, or embarrassment. While the patient is anxious, there is no indication of a specific fear of public places or situations.\\n\\nTherefore, the most consistent diagnosis is Avoidant Personality Disorder (B).\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin.

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

By listening to patients and noting the way in which they describe their symptoms, physicians can gain valuable insight. Inflections of voice, facial expression, gestures, and attitude (i.e., \u201cbody language\u201d) may offer important clues to patients\u2019 perception of their symptoms. Because patients vary in their medical sophistication and ability to recall facts, the reported medical history should be corroborated whenever possible. The social history also can provide important insights into the types of diseases that should be considered. The family history not only identifies rare Mendelian disorders within a family but often reveals risk factors for common disorders, such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, and asthma. A thorough family history may require input from multiple relatives to ensure completeness and accuracy; once recorded, it can be updated readily. The process of history-taking provides an"

Deciding whether a clinical clue is worth pursuing or should be dismissed as a \u201cred herring\u201d and weighing whether a proposed test, preventive measure, or treatment entails a greater risk than the disease itself are essential judgments that a skilled clinician must make many times each day. This combination of medical knowledge, intuition, experience, and judgment defines the art of medicine, which is as necessary to the practice of medicine as is a sound scientific base."

During late childhood and adolescence, the normal activities of the patient, including education, had often been interrupted by periods of ill-defined illness. In the past, rheumatic fever, and in the current era, chronic fatigue, Lyme disease, sick building syndrome, or multiple environmental allergy may be carried as explanatory diagnoses from other physicians or the patient\u2019s research on the Internet. Later in life, problems in work adjustment and marriage are frequent. Notable in many cases is a high incidence of marital incompatibility, separation, and divorce. The patient\u2019s life history is punctuated by symptoms that do not conform to recognizable patterns of medical and surgical disease. For these ailments, many forms of therapy including surgical operations may have been performed."

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."
