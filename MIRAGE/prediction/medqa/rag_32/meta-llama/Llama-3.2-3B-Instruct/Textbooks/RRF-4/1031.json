The tumor markers AFP and hCG are elevated, with AFP at 350 ng/mL and hCG at 0.4 IU/L. The biopsy results show glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells. This description is consistent with a yolk sac tumor, which is a type of germ cell tumor. The elevated AFP level further supports this diagnosis. Yolk sac tumors are the most common malignant germ cell tumor in children, and the presence of glomeruli-like structures in the biopsy is a characteristic feature of this tumor. Choriocarcinoma typically presents with high levels of hCG, but the biopsy results do not support this diagnosis. Seminoma and teratoma are less likely given the presence of germ cells and the specific biopsy findings. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is yolk sac tumor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Unlike epithelial ovarian cancer, these tumors have a higher proclivity for nodal or hematogenous metastases.

For young patients, blood tests should include serum hCG and AFP and LDH. A CT scan of the chest is important because germ cell tumors can metastasize to the lungs or mediastinum. A karyotype should be obtained preoperatively for all premenarcheal girls, particularly those with dysgerminomas, because of the propensity of these tumors to arise in dysgenetic gonads (343,349). A preoperative CT scan or MRI may document the presence and extent of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy or liver metastases; however, because these patients require surgical exploration, preoperative imaging is not usually required. If postmenarcheal patients have predominantly cystic lesions up to 8 cm in diameter, they may be observed or given oral contraceptives for two menstrual cycles (350).

Therefore, in cases in which the patient would be a candidate for resection of recurrent colorectal cancer or systemic therapy, the ASCO guidelines recommend that postoperative CEA testing be performed every 3 months in patients with stage II or III disease for at least 3 years.112 CEA is the marker of choice for monitor-ing metastatic colorectal cancer during systemic therapy.112Alpha-Fetoprotein. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a glycoprotein normally produced by a developing fetus. AFP levels decrease soon after birth in healthy adults.
