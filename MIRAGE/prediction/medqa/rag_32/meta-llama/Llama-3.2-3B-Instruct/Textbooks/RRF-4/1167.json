He also \u2018can\u2019t catch his breath\u2019 at times. The mother also reports that he seems to be slightly shorter than other children his age. His temperature is 36.6\u00b0C (97.9\u00b0F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 14/min. On auscultation, a localized harsh pansystolic murmur is heard over the left sternal border at the level of the 2nd\u20133rd intercostal space. The murmur becomes louder when the patient is asked to squat. An echocardiogram is performed.

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To determine the defective structure that is causing this patient's symptoms, we need to analyze the information provided: 1. The patient is a 3-year-old boy who has been experiencing tiredness and shortness of breath during swimming classes. 2. He is slightly shorter than other children his age. 3. The physical examination reveals a localized harsh pansystolic murmur over the left sternal border at the level of the 2nd\u20133rd intercostal space. 4. The murmur becomes louder when the patient is asked to squat. 5. An echocardiogram is performed. From the information provided, we can infer that the patient has a heart condition that is causing his symptoms. The pansystolic murmur and the fact that it becomes louder with squatting suggest a left-to-right shunt, which is a common feature of certain congenital heart defects. Based on the location of the murmur (left sternal border, 2nd-3rd intercostal space), the most likely defect is a ventricular septal defect (VSD). VSDs are a type of congenital heart defect that allows blood to flow between the left and right ventricles. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Endocardial cushion defects can cause various heart abnormalities, but they are not typically associated with pansystolic murmurs at the left sternal border. B. Infundibular septum defects can cause murmurs, but they are typically associated with murmurs at the right sternal border, not the left. C. The 3rd pharyngeal arch is not directly related to the development of VSDs. D. Rathke's pouch is involved in the development of the pituitary gland and is not related to congenital heart defects. Therefore, based on the analysis, the defective structure that is causing this patient's symptoms is the ventricular septum. Here is the answer in the required format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a pansystolic murmur over the left sternal border at the level of the 2nd-3rd intercostal space, which suggests a left-to-right shunt, and the murmur becomes louder with squatting. This is consistent with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). The ventricular septum is the structure that gives rise to the defective structure causing this patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The rib notching was caused by dilated collateral intercostal arteries. Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. This narrowing can markedly reduce blood flow to the lower body. Many of the vessels above the narrowing therefore enlarge due to the increased pressure so that blood can reach the aorta below the level of the narrowing. Commonly, the internal thoracic, superior epigastric, and musculophrenic arteries enlarge anteriorly. These arteries supply the anterior intercostal arteries, which anastomose with the posterior intercostal arteries that allow blood to flow retrogradely into the aorta. Enlargement of the intertcostal vessels results in notching of the ribs."

The carotid upstrokes are normal, and electrocardiographic LVH is not present. A grade 1 or 2 mid-systolic murmur often can be heard at the left sternal border with pregnancy, hyperthyroidism, or anemia, physiologic states that are associated with accelerated blood flow. Still\u2019s murmur refers to a benign grade 2, vibratory or musical mid-systolic murmur at the mid or lower left sternal border in normal children and adolescents, best heard in the supine position"

These features also help distinguish PR from AR as the cause of a decrescendo diastolic murmur heard along the left sternal border. PR in the absence of pulmonary hypertension can occur with endocarditis or a congenitally deformed valve. It is usually present after repair of tetralogy of Fallot in childhood. When pulmonary hypertension is not present, the diastolic murmur is softer and lower pitched than the classic Graham Steell murmur, and the severity of the PR can be difficult to appreciate."

Rheumatic fever is the most common cause of MS (Fig. 51e-6). In younger patients with pliable valves, S1 is loud and the murmur begins after an opening snap, which is a high-pitched sound that occurs shortly after S2. The interval between the pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) and the opening snap is inversely related to the magnitude of the left atrial\u2013left ventricular pressure gradient. The murmur of MS is low-pitched and thus is best heard with the bell of the stethoscope. It is loudest at the left ventricular apex and often is appreciated only when the patient is turned in the left lateral decubitus position. It is usually of grade 1 or 2 intensity but may be absent when the cardiac output is severely reduced despite significant obstruction. The intensity of the murmur increases during maneuvers that"

The murmur of pulmonic regurgitation is also heard along the left sternal border. It is most commonly due to pulmonary hypertension and enlargement of the annulus of the pulmonic valve. S2 is single and loud and may be palpable. There is a right ventricular/parasternal lift that is indicative of chronic right ventricular pressure overload. A less impressive murmur of PR is present after repair of tetralogy of Fallot or pulmonic valve atresia. In this postoperative setting, the murmur is softer and lower-pitched, and the severity of the accompanying pulmonic regurgitation can be underestimated significantly."

Other cardiac symptoms include cyanosis, palpitations, chest pain, syncope, and near-syncope. A review ofsystems assesses for possible systemic diseases or congenitalmalformation syndromes that may cause cardiac abnormalities (Tables 139-1 and 139-2). Current and past medication use as well as history of drug use, is important. Family history should be reviewed for hereditary diseases, early atherosclerotic heart disease, congenital heart disease, suddenunexplained deaths, thrombophilia, rheumatic fever, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. A complete cardiovascular examination starts in the supine position and includes evaluation in sitting and standing positions when possible. Inspection is supplemented by palpation and auscultation to provide a complete examination."

In the first weeks of life, excessive afterload being placed on the myocardium is most common.

If the ventricular septum is intact, there may be no murmur. Children with transposition and a large VSD have improved intracardiac mixing and less cyanosis. They may present with signs of heart failure. The heart is hyperdynamic, with palpable left and right ventricular impulses. A loud VSD murmur is heard. S2 is single. ECG findings typically include right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy. The chest x-ray reveals increased pulmonary vascularity, and the cardiac shadow is classically an egg on a string created by the narrow superior mediastinum. Echocardiography shows the transposition of the great arteries, the sites and amount of mixing, and any associated lesions. Figure 144-3 Tricuspid atresia with ventricular septal defect.

Left-sided murmurs may be best heard at end expiration, when lung volumes are minimized and the heart and great vessels are brought closer to the chest wall. This phenomenon is characteristic of the murmur of AR. Murmurs of right-sided origin, such as tricuspid or pulmonic regurgitation, increase in intensity during inspiration. The intensity of left-sided murmurs either remains constant or decreases with inspiration."
