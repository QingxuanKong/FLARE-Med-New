Following orchiectomy and chemotherapy, the patient presents with shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, fine inspiratory crackles, and clubbing. The PFTs show a normal FEV1/FVC ratio, but a decreased FVC, indicating a restrictive pattern. The CT scan is not described in detail, but the combination of these findings suggests pulmonary fibrosis.\\n\\nThe patient's symptoms and PFTs are consistent with pulmonary toxicity due to chemotherapy. The key to this question is to identify which chemotherapy drug is most commonly associated with pulmonary toxicity, particularly pulmonary fibrosis.\\n\\nBleomycin is a well-known cause of pulmonary toxicity, particularly pulmonary fibrosis. It is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug that can cause lung damage, leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and fine crackles. The patient's clubbing and restrictive pattern on PFTs are also consistent with pulmonary fibrosis.\\n\\nThe other options, carboplatin, cisplatin, and ifosfamide, are not as commonly associated with pulmonary toxicity as bleomycin. While they can cause other types of side effects, pulmonary fibrosis is more characteristic of bleomycin exposure.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is bleomycin.\\n\\nAnswer: A.

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Should this indi-vidual use oral contraceptives? A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency depart-ment complaining of acute onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic pain. She had been in her usual state of health until 2 days prior when she noted that her left leg was swollen and red. Her only medication was oral contraceptives. Family history was significant for a history of \u201cblood clots\u201d in mul-tiple members of the maternal side of her family. Physical examination demonstrates an anxious woman with stable vital signs. The left"

The examining physician discovers postural hypotension and moderate vitiligo (depigmented areas of skin) and obtains routine blood tests. She finds hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis and suspects Addison\u2019s disease. She performs a standard ACTH 1\u201324 stimulation test, which reveals an insufficient plasma cortisol response compatible with primary adrenal insuf-ficiency. The diagnosis of autoimmune Addison\u2019s disease is made, and the patient must start replacement of the hormones he cannot produce himself. How should this patient be treated? What precautions should he take?"

At presentation, the total white blood cell counts were ~10,000 cells/\u03bcL; transaminases tended to be elevated, and all 11 had abnormal findings on chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT). Radiologic findings included infiltrates, mediastinal widening, and hemorrhagic pleural effusions. For cases in which the dates of exposure were known, symptoms appeared within 4\u20136 days. Death occurred within 7 days of diagnosis in the five fatal cases (overall mortality rate 55%). Rapid diagnosis and prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy were key to survival."

            "content": "The diagnosis of asthma is usually apparent from the symptoms of variable and intermittent airways obstruction, but must be confirmed by objective measurements of lung function. Lung Function Tests Simple spirometry confirms airflow limitation with a reduced FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, and PEF (Fig. 309-6). Reversibility is demonstrated by a >12% and 200-mL increase in FEV1 15 min after an inhaled short-acting \u03b22-agonist or in some patients by a 2to 4-week trial of oral corticosteroids (OCS) (prednisone or prednisolone 30\u201340 mg daily). Measurements of PEF twice daily may confirm the diurnal variations in airflow obstruction. Flow-volume loops show reduced peak flow and reduced maximum expiratory flow. Further lung function tests are rarely necessary, but whole-body plethysmography shows increased airway resistance and may show increased total lung capacity and residual volume. Gas diffusion is usually normal, but there may be a small increase in gas transfer in some patients."

            "content": "Pleuritis, the most common pulmonary manifestation of RA, may produce pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea, as well as a pleural friction rub and effusion. Pleural effusions tend to be exudative with increased numbers of monocytes and neutrophils. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) may also occur in patients with RA and is heralded by symptoms of dry cough and progressive shortness of breath. ILD can be associated with cigarette smoking and is generally found in patients with higher disease activity, although it may be diagnosed in up to 3.5% of patients prior to the onset of joint symptoms. Diagnosis is readily made by high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) scan. Pulmonary function testing shows a restrictive pattern (e.g., reduced total lung capacity) with a reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). The presence of ILD confers a poor prognosis. The prognosis is not quite as poor as that of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (e.g., usual interstitial pneumonitis) because ILD"
