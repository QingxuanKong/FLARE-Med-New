    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's consider the patient's symptoms and history. The patient presents with gross hematuria and acute, colicky flank pain, which suggests a renal issue. She denies any previous episodes of hematuria, but has been taking high doses of acetaminophen and aspirin over several weeks due to persistent upper back pain. The presence of proteinuria and hematuria suggests kidney damage or disease. The absence of palpable flank masses and normal blood pressure and temperature help to rule out some possibilities. Let's evaluate the options: A. Diffuse cortical necrosis is a rare condition characterized by necrosis of the renal cortex, often caused by severe hypotension or shock. While it can cause hematuria and proteinuria, it is not typically associated with colicky flank pain. B. Chronic pyelonephritis is a type of chronic kidney infection that can cause hematuria and proteinuria, but it is not typically associated with acute, colicky flank pain. C. Papillary necrosis is a condition characterized by necrosis of the renal papillae, often caused by analgesic abuse (e.g., phenacetin or aspirin use). The patient's history of taking high doses of acetaminophen and aspirin over several weeks makes this a plausible diagnosis. D. Acute nephrolithiasis refers to the formation of kidney stones, which can cause colicky flank pain, but it is not typically associated with proteinuria. Given the patient's history of analgesic abuse, papillary necrosis is the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

Focal renal cysts are typically detected in affected subjects before 30 years of age. Hundreds to thousands of cysts are usually present in the kidneys of most patients in the fifth decade (Fig. 339-2). Enlarged kidneys can each reach a fourfold increase in length and weigh up to 20 times the normal weight. The clinical presentations of ADPKD are highly variable. Although many patients are asymptomatic until the fourth to fifth decade of life and are diagnosed by incidental discoveries of hypertension or abdominal masses, back or flank pain is a frequent symptom in ~60% of patients with ADPKD. The pain may result from renal cyst infection, hemorrhage, or nephrolithiasis. Gross hematuria resulting from cyst rupture occurs in ~40% of patients during the course of their disease, and many of them will have recurrent episodes. Flank pain and hematuria"

Persistent urinary tract infection, persistent proteinuria, or hematuria in patients with cancer should raise suspicion of ureteral obstruction.

Renal ultrasound is the safest and cheapest way to identify hydronephrosis. The function of an obstructed kidney can be evaluated by a nuclear scan.

            "content": "Clinical Presentation and Differential Diagnosis There are two common presentations for individuals with an acute stone event: renal colic and painless gross hematuria. Renal colic is a misnomer because pain typically does not subside completely; rather, it varies in intensity. When a stone moves into the ureter, the discomfort often begins with a sudden onset of unilateral flank pain. The intensity of the pain can increase rapidly, and there are no alleviating factors. This pain, which is accompanied often by nausea and occasionally by vomiting, may radiate, depending on the location of the stone. If the stone lodges in the upper part of the ureter, pain may radiate anteriorly; if the stone is in the lower part of the ureter, pain can radiate to the ipsilateral testicle in men or the ipsilateral labium in women. Occasionally, a patient has gross hematuria without pain."

The clinical presentation is usually that of a patient who undergoes a screening urine culture for a reason unrelated to the genitourinary tract and is incidentally found to have bacteriuria. The presence of systemic signs or symptoms such as fever, altered mental status, and leukocytosis in the setting of a positive urine culture does not merit a diagnosis of symptomatic UTI unless other potential etiologies have been considered. The typical symptoms of cystitis are dysuria, urinary frequency, and urgency. Nocturia, hesitancy, suprapubic discomfort, and gross hematuria are often noted as well. Unilateral back or flank pain is generally an indication that the upper urinary tract is involved. Fever also is an indication of invasive infection of either the kidney or the prostate."

Prerenal azotemia should be suspected in the setting of vomiting, diarrhea, glycosuria causing polyuria, and several medications including diuretics, NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs. Physical signs of orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, reduced jugular venous pressure, decreased skin turgor, and dry mucous membranes are often present in prerenal azotemia. A history of prostatic disease, nephrolithiasis, or pelvic or paraaortic malignancy would suggest the possibility of postrenal AKI.

Microscopic hematuria is more commonly of prostate origin (25%); only 2% of bladder cancers produce microscopic hematuria. Once hematuria is documented, a urinary cytology, visualization of the urothelial tract by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance urogram or intravenous pyelogram, and cystoscopy are recommended if no other etiology is found. Screening asymptomatic individuals for hematuria increases the diagnosis of tumors at an early stage but has not been shown to prolong life. After hematuria, irritative symptoms are the next most common presentation. Ureteral obstruction may cause flank pain. Symptoms of metastatic disease are rarely the first presenting sign."

A urine dipstick was positive for blood (hematuria). A diagnosis of a ureteric stone (calculus) was made. The patient\u2019s initial infrascapular pain, which later radiated to the left groin, relates to passage of the ureteric stone along the ureter. The origin of the pain relates to ureteral distention. A series of peristaltic waves along the ureter transport urine along the length of the ureter from the kidney to the bladder. As the ureteric stone obstructs the kidney, the ureter becomes distended, resulting in an exacerbation of the pain. The peristaltic waves are superimposed upon the distention, resulting in periods of exacerbation and periods of relief."

Which of the eicosanoid agonists have been demonstrated to reduce both morbidity and mortality in patients with such a diagnosis? What are the modes of action? A 40-year-old woman presented to her doctor with a 6-month history of increasing shortness of breath. This was associated with poor appetite and ankle swell-ing. On physical examination, she had elevated jugular venous distention, a soft tricuspid regurgitation murmur, clear lungs, and mild peripheral edema. An echocardio-gram revealed tricuspid regurgitation, severely elevated"

These anastomose with the superior, superficial, and deep epigastric venous systems to drain into the internal thoracic veins, which in turn drain into the brachiocephalic veins and the superior vena cava. After the initial inferior vena cava thrombosis, the veins of the anterior abdominal wall and other collateral pathways hypertrophy to accommodate the increase in blood flow. A 52-year-old woman visited her family physician with complaints of increasing lethargy and vomiting. The physician examined her and noted that compared to previous visits she had lost significant weight. She was also jaundiced, and on examination of the abdomen a well-defined 10-cm rounded mass was palpable below the liver edge in the right upper quadrant (Fig. 4.185)."
