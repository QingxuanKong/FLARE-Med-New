    "question": "A 68-year-old woman presents with an intermittent throbbing headache with an onset approximately 3 weeks ago. The pain is bilateral, \u201cband-like,\u201d and extends to the neck. The patient rates the 4 points out of 10 on a visual scale. The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when the patient coughs or laughs. The headache has persisted throughout the day and is usually worse in the morning an hour after she has breakfast and taken her medications. The patient was diagnosed with stage 1 arterial hypertension 2 years ago and stable angina pectoris 3 weeks ago. Currently, she takes aspirin (81 mg once daily), rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), lisinopril (20 mg once daily), and isosorbide mononitrate (60 mg once daily). She has been menopausal for the last 15 years. In addition to her chief complaint, she also notes that she had a runny nose with a temperature elevation approximately 3 weeks ago, and her headache was linked to that acute illness. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 135/80 mm Hg, heart rate 76/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 36.5\u2103 (97.7\u2109). The physical examination reveals S2 accentuation that is best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border. Palpation of the paranasal sinuses is painless. The neurologic exam shows no focal symptoms, no pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, and no meningeal symptoms. What is the most likely mechanism underlying the patient\u2019s headaches?",

She has been experiencing an intermittent throbbing headache with a 'band-like' quality, which is bilateral and extends to the neck. The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when she coughs or laughs. \\n\\nThe headache is worse in the morning, an hour after she has breakfast and taken her medications. She also had a runny nose with a temperature elevation approximately 3 weeks ago, which is linked to her current headache. \\n\\nThe patient's vital signs and physical examination are within normal limits, with no focal neurologic symptoms, no pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, and no meningeal symptoms. The S2 accentuation is heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border, which may indicate pulmonary congestion or heart failure. \\n\\nGiven these points, the most likely mechanism underlying the patient's headaches is dilation of the intracerebral arterioles. This is supported by the following: \\n\\n1. The 'band-like' quality of the headache is consistent with secondary headache due to intracranial hypertension, which can be caused by dilation of the intracerebral arterioles. \\n\\n2. The worsening of the headache in the morning, an hour after breakfast, may be related to the release of vasoactive substances such as natriuretic peptides, which can cause vasodilation and increase intracranial pressure. \\n\\n3. The lack of nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia suggests that the headache is not due to a primary headache disorder such as migraine or tension headache. \\n\\n4. The presence of S2 accentuation on physical examination may indicate pulmonary congestion or heart failure, which can be a cause of secondary headache due to increased intracranial pressure. \\n\\nTherefore, the most likely mechanism underlying the patient's headaches is dilation of the intracerebral arterioles, likely caused by secondary hypertension or cardiac dysfunction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination?

The headaches last from 15 to 30 min and are typically moderately severe and generalized, although they may be unilateral and can be throbbing. Patients may report falling back to sleep only to be awakened by a further attack a few hours later; up to three repetitions of this pattern occur through the night. Daytime naps can also precipitate head pain. Most patients are female, and the onset is usually after age 60 years. Headaches are bilateral in most, but may be unilateral. Photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea are usually absent. The major secondary consideration in this headache type is poorly controlled hypertension; 24-h blood pressure monitoring is recommended to detect this treatable condition."

These are of much shorter duration (2 to 45 min) than cluster and usually affect the temporoorbital region of one side, accompanied by conjunctival hyperemia, rhinorrhea, and in some cases a partial Horner syndrome. Even periorbital ecchymosis may accompany a severe attack. Unlike cluster headache, however, the paroxysms occur many times each day, recur daily for long periods (the patient of Price and Posner had an average of 16 attacks daily for more than 40 years), and, most important, respond dramatically to the administration of indomethacin, 25 to 50 mg tid. Unlike cluster headache, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania is more common in women than in men (ratio of 3:1)."

The mechanism of this response is unclear. Primary Exercise Headache Primary exertional headache has features resembling both cough headache and migraine. It may be precipitated by any form of exercise; it often has the pulsatile quality of migraine. The pain, which can last from 5 min to 24 h, is bilateral and throbbing at onset; migrainous features may develop in patients susceptible to migraine. The duration tends to be shorter in adolescents than in older adults. Primary exertional headache can be prevented by avoiding excessive exertion, particularly in hot weather or at high altitude."

The pain is usually described as dull and aching, but questioning often uncovers other sensations, such as fullness, tightness, or pressure (as though the head were surrounded by a band or clamped in a vise) or a feeling that the head is swollen and may burst. On these sensations, waves of aching pain are superimposed. These may be interpreted as paroxysmal or throbbing and, if the pain is slightly more on one side, the headache may suggest a migraine without aura. However, absent in tension headache are the persistent throbbing quality, nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, and clear lateralization of migraine.

At the peak of the pain, within minutes to an hour, the patient may be forced to lie down and to shun light (photophobia) and noise (phonophobia). Light is irritating and may be painful to the globes, or it is perceived as overly bright (dazzle) and strong odors are disagreeable. Nausea and, less often, vomiting may occur. The headache lasts for hours and sometimes for a day or even longer and is often the most disabling feature of the illness.

Other nonspecific symptoms that may be related to elevated blood pressure include dizziness, palpitations, easy fatigability, and impotence. When symptoms are present, they are generally related to hypertensive cardiovascular disease or to manifestations of secondary hypertension. Table 298-5 lists salient features that should be addressed in obtaining a history from a hypertensive patient."

The patient had no significant adverse effects from this dosage. At age 21, she had a second tonic-clonic seizure while in college; further discussion with her room-mate at that time revealed a history of two recent episodes of 1\u20132 minutes of altered consciousness with lip smacking (focal impaired awareness seizure, formerly complex partial seizure). A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid. Four days later, electroencephalography (EEG)"

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice?

Examination of patients experiencing stable angina is generally unremarkable. Look for carotid and peripheral bruits suggesting atherosclerosis and hypertension. Rule out pulmonary, GI, or other cardiac causes of chest pain. Angina may be diagnosed from the history alone, but significant ST-segment changes on exercise stress test with ECG monitoring is diagnostic of CAD. Women and diabetics classically experience \u201csilent\u201d ischemic events and present \u201catypically\u201d; for this reason, it is necessary to maintain a high index of suspicion in this patient population. Treat acute symptoms with ASA, O2 and/or IV nitroglycerin, and IV morphine, and consider IV \u03b2-blockers. The efficacy of nondihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem, verapamil) and ACEIs has also been validated."

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Acute venous distension likely explains one syndrome\u2014the acute onset of headache with straining and breath holding, as in weightlifter\u2019s headache. Because exertion can result in headache in a number of serious underlying conditions, these must be considered in patients with exertional headache. Pain from angina may be referred to the head, probably by central connections of vagal afferents, and may present as exertional headache (cardiac cephalgia). The link to exercise is the main clinical clue that headache is of cardiac origin. Pheochromocytoma may occasionally cause exertional headache. Intracranial lesions and stenosis of the carotid arteries are other possible etiologies."

Hx/PE: Presents with tight, bandlike pain that is not associated with sensory phobia, nausea/vomiting, or auras and is brought on by fatigue or stress. Nonspecific symptoms (e.g., anxiety, poor concentration, difficulty sleeping) may also be seen. May be generalized or most intense in the frontal, occipital, and neck regions. Usually occurs at the end of the day. Dx: A diagnosis of exclusion. Be particularly aware of giant cell arteritis in patients > 50 years of age with new headaches; always obtain an ESR even if headaches are mild and unassociated with constitutional or vascular symptoms. There are no focal neurologic signs. Tx: Relaxation, massage, hot baths, and avoidance of exacerbating factors. NSAIDs and acetaminophen are first-line abortive therapy, but trip-tans may also be considered."
