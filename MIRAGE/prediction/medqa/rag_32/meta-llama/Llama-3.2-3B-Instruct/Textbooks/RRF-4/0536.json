    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the laboratory results provided for the patient. The patient has severe liver enzyme elevation, with ALT (2,674 U/L) and AST (2,254 U/L), which are indicative of hepatocellular injury. The patient also has a low platelet count (170,000/mm3), which can be seen in various liver diseases, including hepatitis. The patient's hemoglobin level is low (8 g/dL), which could be due to blood loss or liver dysfunction. The patient's urea nitrogen level is elevated (60 mg/dL), and creatinine level is also elevated (2.1 mg/dL), indicating impaired renal function, which can be secondary to liver disease. The patient's bilirubin levels are within normal limits (total 1.2 mg/dL, indirect 0.3 mg/dL). The alkaline phosphatase level is slightly elevated (96 U/L), which can be seen in various liver diseases, including cholestasis or bone disorders. Given these laboratory results, the patient likely has severe hepatocellular injury. Now, let's consider the options provided. Hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (B) are not typically damaged in hepatocellular injury. Hepatic Kupffer cells (C) are macrophages that line the sinusoids and are involved in the immune response, but they are not the primary cells damaged in hepatocellular injury. Centrilobular hepatocytes (D) are located in the central lobule of the liver and are involved in detoxification and metabolism, but they are not the primary cells damaged in hepatocellular injury. Periportal hepatocytes (A) are located near the portal tracts and are involved in the uptake of nutrients and bile salts. Given the patient's severe hepatocellular injury, it is likely that periportal hepatocytes were damaged first due to the direct exposure to toxic substances and the disruption of the normal liver architecture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Aminotransferase elevations tend to be modest for chronic hepatitis B but may fluctuate in the range of 100\u22121000 units. As is true for acute viral hepatitis B, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) tends to be more elevated than aspartate aminotransferase (AST); however, once cirrhosis is established, AST tends to exceed ALT. Levels of alkaline phosphatase activity tend to be normal or only marginally elevated. In severe cases, moderate elevations in serum bilirubin (51.3\u2212171 \u03bcmol/L [3\u221210 mg/ dL]) occur. Hypoalbuminemia and prolongation of the prothrombin time occur in severe or end-stage cases. Hyperglobulinemia and detectable circulating autoantibodies are distinctly absent in chronic hepatitis B (in contrast to autoimmune hepatitis).

A mortality benefit from albumin (1.5 g/ kg of body weight within 6 h of detection and 1.0 g/kg on day 3) has been demonstrated for patients who present with serum creatinine levels \u22651 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen levels \u226530 mg/dL, or total bilirubin levels \u22654 mg/dL but not for patients who do not meet these criteria. After the infecting organism is identified, therapy should be narrowed to target the specific pathogen. Patients with PBP usually respond within 72 h to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Antimicrobial treatment can be administered for as little as 5 days if rapid improve-847 ment occurs and blood cultures are negative, but a course of up to 2 weeks may be required for patients with bacteremia and for those whose improvement is slow. Persistence of WBCs in the ascitic fluid after therapy should prompt a search for additional diagnoses."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable.

At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

Liver biochemical tests are invariably abnormal but may not correlate with the clinical severity or histopathologic features in individual cases. Many patients with autoimmune hepatitis have normal serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and globulin levels with only minimal aminotransferase elevations. Serum AST and ALT levels are increased and fluctuate in the range of 100\u22121000 units. In severe cases, the serum bilirubin level is moderately elevated (51\u2212171 \u03bcmol/L [3\u221210 mg/dL]). Hypoalbuminemia occurs in patients with very active or advanced disease. Serum alkaline phosphatase levels may be moderately elevated or near normal. In a small proportion of patients, marked elevations of alkaline phosphatase activity occur; in such patients, clinical and laboratory features overlap with those of primary biliary cirrhosis (Chap. 365).

The patient was treated with antibiotics and intubated for several days, with the development of polyuria (3\u20135 L/d), hypernatremia, and acute renal insufficiency; the peak plasma Na+ concentration was 156 meq/L, and peak creatinine was 2.6 mg/dL. Urine osmolality was measured once and reported as 157 mOsm/kg, with a coincident plasma osmolality of 318 mOsm/kg. Lithium was stopped on admission to the ICU. On physical examination, the patient was alert, extubated, and thirsty. Weight was 97.5 kg. Urine output for the previous 24 h had been 3.4 L, with an IV intake of 2 L/d of D5W."

Clinical reports suggest that bleeding colonic diverticula stop bleeding spontaneously in ~80% of patients and, on long-term follow-up, rebleed in ~15\u201325% of patients. Case series suggest endoscopic therapy may decrease recurrent bleeding in the uncommon case when colonoscopy identifies the specific bleeding diverticulum. When diverticular bleeding is found at angiography, transcatheter arterial embolization by superselective technique stops bleeding in a majority of patients. If bleeding persists or recurs, segmental surgical resection is indicated."

Associated symptoms may include nausea and vomiting, transient diarrhea, anorexia, and bloody stools. With the exception of minimal abdominal distention and hypoactive bowel sounds, early abdominal examination is unimpressive. Later findings will demonstrate peritonitis and cardiovascular collapse. In the evaluation of acute intestinal ischemia, routine laboratory tests should be obtained, including complete blood count, serum chemistry, coagulation profile, arterial blood gas, amylase, lipase, lactic acid, blood type and cross match, and cardiac enzymes. Regardless of the need for urgent surgery, emergent admission to a monitored bed or intensive care unit is recommended for resuscitation and further evaluation.
