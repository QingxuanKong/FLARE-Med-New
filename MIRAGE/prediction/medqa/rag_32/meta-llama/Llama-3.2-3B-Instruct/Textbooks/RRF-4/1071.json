    "question": "A 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because he has not been able to walk since waking up that morning. His mother said that when he tried to get out of bed that he was unable to stand without support. He also complained of prickling in his hands and feet. Three weeks ago, he had a fever, dry cough, and a sore throat. The fever and sore throat subsided a week after they began, but the cough is persisting. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medication. His vital signs are within normal limits. The lungs are clear to auscultation. There is severe weakness in both lower extremities and mild sensory loss of the hands and feet. Knee and ankle jerk reflexes are absent. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 12.0 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 6000/mm3\nSegmented neutrophils 64%\nEosinophils 2%\nLymphocytes 26%\nMonocytes 7%\nPlatelet count 160,000/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 27 mm/h\nSerum\nNa+ 138 mEq/L\nCl- 101 mEq/L\nK+ 4.9 mEq/L\nHCO3- 26 mEq/L\nCa2+ 9.7 mg/dL\nCreatine kinase 93 U/L\nA lumbar puncture is performed; cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows a leukocyte count of 2/mm3, a glucose concentration of 60 mg/dL, and a protein concentration of 91 mg/dL.

The patient had a recent history of fever, dry cough, and sore throat, which resolved a week ago. The laboratory results show a mild leukocytosis (6000/mm^3) with a predominance of lymphocytes (26%) and a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 27 mm/h.\\n\\nThe cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows a low leukocyte count (2/mm^3), normal glucose concentration (60 mg/dL), and a protein concentration of 91 mg/dL.\\n\\nGiven these findings, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are suggestive of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disorder characterized by acute onset of muscle weakness and paralysis, often following a recent infection. The CSF findings are consistent with GBS, showing a low leukocyte count and normal glucose concentration.\\n\\nThe next step in treatment for GBS is the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with GBS.\\n\\nThe other options are not the most appropriate next steps in treatment:\\n\\n* Prednisone is a corticosteroid that may be used in certain autoimmune disorders, but it is not the first-line treatment for GBS.\\n\\n* Botulism antitoxin is used to treat botulism, a different neurologic disorder caused by the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum.\\n\\n* Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant medication that may be used to treat certain types of neuropathic pain, but it is not the first-line treatment for GBS.\\n\\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in treatment is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

The CSF is usually under increased pressure and contains between 50 and 500 white cells per cubic millimeter, rarely more. Early in the disease there may be a more-or-less-equal number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes, but after several days lymphocytes predominate in the majority of cases. In some cases, however, M. tuberculosis causes a persistent polymorphonuclear pleocytosis, the other usual causes of this CSF formula being Nocardia, Aspergillus, and Actinomyces (Peacock). The protein content of the CSF is always elevated, between 100 and 200 mg/dL in most cases, but much higher if the flow of CSF is blocked around the spinal cord. Glucose is reduced to levels below 40 mg/dL, but rarely to the very low values observed in conventional bacterial meningitis; the glucose falls slowly and a reduction may become manifest only several days"

The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

The typical profile is a pleocytosis, a normal or slightly elevated protein concentration (0.2\u20130.8 g/L [20\u201380 mg/dL]), a normal glucose concentration, and a normal or mildly elevated opening pressure (100\u2013350 mmH2O). Organisms are not seen on Gram\u2019s stain of CSF. The total CSF cell count in viral meningitis is typically 25\u2013500/\u03bcL, although cell counts of several thousand/\u03bcL are occasionally seen, especially with infections due to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and mumps virus. Lymphocytes are typically the predominant cell. Rarely, PMNs may predominate in the first 48 h of illness, especially with infections due to echovirus 9, West Nile virus, eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus, or mumps. A PMN pleocytosis occurs in 45% of patients with West Nile virus (WNV) meningitis and can persist for a week or longer before shifting to a"

In the acute phase, inflammatory parameters are elevated, including white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and the ESR, which can be profoundlyelevated (often >80 mm/hr). Platelet counts may be inappropriately low or normal. A lumbar puncture, if performed toexclude infection, may reveal pleocytosis. Tests of hepatobiliary function may be abnormal. Greatly elevated platelet countsdevelop during the subacute phase. The development of coronary artery aneurysms is monitored by performing two-dimensional echocardiograms, usually during the acute phase, at 2 to3 weeks, and again at 6 to 8 weeks. More frequent echocardiograms and, potentially, coronary angiography are indicated forpatients who develop coronary artery abnormalities."

The main constituents of CSF in the lumbar cistern are listed in Table 4.2. For comparison the concentrations of the same constituents in blood are also given. CSF has a lower concentration of K+ , glucose, and protein but a greater concentration of Na+ and Cl\u2212 than blood does. Furthermore, CSF contains practically no blood cells. The increased concentration of Na+ and Cl\u2212 enables CSF to be isotonic to blood. The pressure in the CSF column is about 120 to 180 mm H2O when a person is recumbent.

The combination of unrelenting headache, stiff neck, fatigue, night sweats, and fever with a CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis and a mildly decreased glucose concentration is highly suspicious for tuberculous meningitis. The last tube of fluid collected at LP is the best tube to send for a smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). If there is a pellicle in the CSF or a cobweb-like clot on the surface of the fluid, AFB can best be demonstrated in a smear of the clot or pellicle. Positive smears are typically reported in only 10\u201340% of cases of tuberculous meningitis in adults.

In standing and walking, the patient places his feet wide apart so as to increase his base of support. To rise from a sitting position, he first flexes his trunk at the hips, puts his hands on his knees, and pushes the trunk upward by working the hands up the thighs. In rising from the ground, the child first assumes a four-point position by extending the arms and legs to the fullest possible extent and then works each hand alternately up the corresponding thigh (the sign traditionally attached to Gowers\u2019 name).
