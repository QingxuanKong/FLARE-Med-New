Vitals show a temperature of 37-0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg, pulse of 115/min, respirations of 19/min, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is diaphoretic and unresponsive. Extremities are pale and cool. There is a 3-inch long penetrating wound between the 3rd and 4th intercostal space on the left side of the chest, which is bleeding profusely. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall. There are no apparent injuries to any coronary arteries or major branches. The patient is intubated and aggressive fluid resuscitation is initiated, including a blood transfusion. Which of the following is the best definitive surgical approach to take in this patient?",

The patient is in shock (low blood pressure, tachycardia, and low oxygen saturation) and is not responding to fluid resuscitation. The primary goal is to control the bleeding and stabilize the patient before definitive surgical repair of the cardiac injury can be performed. Given the location and nature of the injury, a needle thoracostomy is not appropriate as it may not adequately control the bleeding and could worsen the situation. Immediate cardiac transplant (A) is not a viable option as the patient needs surgical intervention to repair the cardiac injury. Watchful waiting (B) while resuscitative fluids are initiated is not appropriate as the patient is in shock and requires immediate intervention to control the bleeding. Interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets (C) may be a suitable option for repairing the cardiac injury, but it is not the best initial approach in this scenario as it does not address the immediate need to control the bleeding. The best initial approach is to perform a needle thoracostomy to control the bleeding and then proceed with more definitive surgical repair of the cardiac injury, which is option D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Severe head injuries that arrest respiration are soon followed by cessation of cardiac function. Injuries of this magnitude are often fatal; if resuscitative measures do not restore and sustain cardiopulmonary function within 4 to 5 min, the brain is usually irreparably damaged. Bleeding from the scalp can usually be controlled by a pressure bandage unless an artery is divided; then a suture becomes necessary.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

Acutely, <100 mL of pericardial blood may cause pericardial tamponade.16 The classic Beck\u2019s triad\u2014dilated neck veins, muffled heart tones, and a decline in arterial pressure\u2014is usually not appreciated in the trauma bay because of the noisy environment and associ-ated hypovolemia. Because the pericardium is not acutely dis-tensible, the pressure in the pericardial sac will rise to match that of the injured chamber. When this pressure exceeds that of the right atrium, right atrial filling is impaired and right ventricular preload is reduced. This ultimately leads to decreased right ven-tricular output. Additionally, increased intrapericardial pressure impedes myocardial blood flow, which leads to subendocardial ischemia and a further reduction in cardiac output.Diagnosis of hemopericardium is"

For the patient with blunt injury, where the major cause of death is a closed head injury, the increase in mortality with hypotension in the setting of brain injury must be avoided. In this setting, a SBP of 110 mmHg would seem to be more appropriate.Patients who respond to initial resuscitative effort but then deteriorate hemodynamically frequently"

Pulmonary contusion, pneumothorax, and rib fractures occur most commonly, and patients may present without external signs of trauma. Patients with pulmonary parenchymal injury should receive supportive treatment to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Most pediatric blunt thoracic injuries can be managed without surgery. Injury to the heart and great vessels is rare but requires urgent diagnosis and treatment. Great vessel injury should be suspected if a widened mediastinum is seen on chest radiograph. Injury to the abdomen occurs in approximately 8% of pediatric trauma patients and is the third leading cause of trauma death. The relative size and closer proximity of intra-abdominal organs in children increase the risk of significant injury after blunt trauma. Penetrating trauma may result in a child who is asymptomatic or who presents in hypovolemic shock."

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

The multiple dilated veins around the neck are indicative of venous obstruction. The veins are dilated on both sides of the neck, implying that the obstruction must be within a common vessel, the superior vena cava. Anterior to the superior vena cava in the right side of the chest is the phrenic nerve, which supplies the diaphragm. Because the diaphragm is elevated, suggesting paralysis, it is clear that the phrenic nerve has been involved with the tumor. A 35-year-old man was shot during an armed robbery. The bullet entry wound was in the right fourth intercostal space, above the nipple. A chest radiograph obtained on admission to the emergency room demonstrated complete collapse of the lung. A further chest radiograph performed 20 minutes later demonstrated an air/fluid level in the pleural cavity (eFig. 3.117)."

Temporary control of hemorrhage, and at times definitive repair, may be accomplished with skin staples for left ventricular lacerations; the myocardial edges of the laceration must coapt in diastole for stapling to be technically feasible. Definitive repair of cardiac injuries is performed with either running 3-0 polypropylene suture or interrupted, pledgeted 2-0 polypropylene suture (Fig. 7-58).103 Use of pledgets may be particularly important in the right ventricle to prevent sutures from pulling through the thinner myocardium. Injuries adjacent to coronary arteries should be repaired using horizontal mattress sutures because use of running sutures results in coronary occlu-sion and distal infarction. Gunshot wounds may result in stellate lesions or contused, extremely friable myocardium adjacent to the wound. When the edges of"

To objectively evaluate the progression of local envenomation, the level of swelling in the bitten extremity should be marked and limb circumference should be measured every 15 min until the swelling has stabilized. During this period of observation, the extremity should be positioned at approximately heart level. Measures applied in the field (such as bandages or wraps) should be removed once IV access has been obtained, with cognizance that the release of such ligatures may result in hypotension or dysrhythmias when stagnant acidotic blood containing venom is released into the systemic circulation. Two large-bore IV lines should be established in unaffected extremities. Because of the potential for coagulopathy, venipuncture attempts should be minimized, and noncompressible"
