    "question": "An 11-month-old male infant is brought to his pediatrician by his mother. She is concerned about his leg and his inability to stand. He was born vaginally to a 33-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 2) from an uncomplicated pregnancy at 39 weeks. He has met all developmental milestones and is up to date on all vaccinations. His mother explains that he can normally stand without help and can walk briefly on his own. However, he hit his right leg against a chair 2 days ago. The area became edematous and bruised overtime and the infant became unable to stand or crawl and cries when he puts weight on it. The mother denies any child abuse from her family or child care. The patient\u2019s vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 137/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and temperature 36.7\u00b0C (97.0\u00b0F). His length and weight are both between the 15th and 25th percentile. On physical examination, blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae are noted. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations are within normal limits for his age. There is joint hypermobility and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities. The patient\u2019s right calf appears slightly deformed, edematous, and warm to the tough. The patient begins to cry loudly when the physician palpates his leg. The patient\u2019s X-ray shows an incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis. What is the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Insufficient production of procollagen type 1",

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's analyze the symptoms and examination findings presented in the scenario. The infant is 11 months old and has an incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis, blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae, joint hypermobility, decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities, and a deformed, edematous, and warm right calf. These findings suggest a condition that affects bone structure and connective tissue. The blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae, also known as blue sclera, is a characteristic feature of certain genetic disorders. The incomplete fracture of the tibial diaphysis at a young age and the presence of joint hypermobility also point towards a disorder that affects bone strength and connective tissue. The options provided are all related to collagen disorders, which are conditions that affect the production or structure of collagen, a key component of connective tissue. Let's evaluate each option: A. Insufficient production of procollagen type 1: This option is related to osteogenesis imperfecta, a condition characterized by fragile bones, blue sclera, and joint hypermobility. However, osteogenesis imperfecta typically presents with more severe symptoms, such as frequent fractures and hearing loss, which are not mentioned in the scenario. B. Mutation in the gene encoding fibrillin-1: This option is related to Marfan syndrome, a condition that affects the body's connective tissue, including skin, bones, eyes, and cardiovascular system. Marfan syndrome can cause joint hypermobility, but it typically presents with other features such as tall stature, long limbs, and aortic aneurysm, which are not mentioned in the scenario. C. Defective collagen type 3: This option is related to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a group of conditions that affect the body's connective tissue. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can cause joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility, which are all consistent with the symptoms presented in the scenario. However, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome typically presents with other features such as skin hyperextensibility and tissue fragility, which are not mentioned in the scenario. D. Dysfunctional structure of laminins: This option is not directly related to a known collagen disorder. Laminins are a type of protein that plays a role in the structure of the basement membrane, but they are not directly related to the symptoms presented in the scenario. Based on the symptoms and examination findings, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which is characterized by defective collagen type 3. This condition can cause joint hypermobility, blue sclera, and tissue fragility, which are all consistent with the symptoms presented in the scenario. The answer is C. Defective collagen type 3.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

At about 2 to 3 years of age, boys develop an awkward gait and an inability to run properly. Some have an antecedent history of mild slowness in attaining motor milestones or poor head control during infancy. Examination shows firm calf hypertrophy and mild to moderate proximal leg weakness with a hyperlordotic, waddling gait. The child typically arises from a lying position on the floor by using his arms to climb up his legs and body (Gower sign). Arm weakness is evident by age 6 years, and most boys are wheelchair dependent by age 12 years. Other manifestations include cardiomyopathy, scoliosis, respiratory decline, and, in some boys, cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. Many boys with Duchenne live into adulthood. Most die in their 20s or early 30s, usually as a result of progressive respiratory decline or cardiac dysfunction."

Intercostal paralysis with a degree of collapse of the chest is the rule. Respiratory movements become paradoxical (abdominal protrusion with chest retraction). The cry becomes feeble, and sucking and swallowing are less efficient. Such infants are unable to sit unless propped, and they cannot hold up their heads without support and cannot roll over or support their weight when placed on their feet. Their posture is characteristic: arms abducted and flexed at the elbow, legs in the \u201cfrog position\u201d with external rotation and abduction at hips and flexion at hips and knees. If the effects of gravity are removed, all muscles continue to contract; that is there is paresis, not paralysis. Until late in the illness, these children appear bright-eyed, alert, and responsive."

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

            "content": "A 45-year-old man with diabetes mellitus visited his nurse because he had an ulcer on his foot that was not healing despite daily dressings. Diabetes can lead to vascular disease of large and medium arteries, narrowing the lumen and reducing blood supply to the extremities, thereby impairing healing. In addition, diabetes can also affect blood supply to nerves, which leads to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy results in reduced sensation, and therefore minor injuries can often go unnoticed. This patient has developed an ulcer on his heel, which is a pressure point and likely to be under repeated strain. The nurse examined the ulcer and found that the ulcer was looking infected with pus at the base of the ulcer and asked for a specialist orthopedic opinion, who requested an x-ray and an MRI. The MRI and x-ray both demonstrated infection invading into the calcaneus with destruction of the bone (Fig. 6.141A,B)."

            "content": "The first physical examination of a newborn may be a general physical examination of a well infant or an examination to confirm fetal diagnoses or to determine the cause of various manifestations of neonatal diseases. Problems in the transition from fetal to neonatal life may be detectable immediately in the delivery room or during the first day of life. Physical examination also may reveal effects of the labor and delivery resulting from asphyxia, drugs, or birth trauma. The first newborn examination is an important way to detect congenital malformations or deformations (Table 58-9). Significant congenital malformations may be present in 1% to 3% of all births."

            "content": "A diagnosis of physical abuse initially is suggested by a history that seems incongruent with the clinical presentation ofthe child (Table 22-1). Although injury to any organ systemcan occur from physical abuse, some injuries are more common. Bruises are universal findings in healthy ambulatorychildren but also are among the most common injury identified in abused children. Bruises suggestive of abuse includethose that are patterned, such as a slap mark on the face orlooped extension cord marks on the body (Fig. 22-1). Bruises A child presents for medical care with significant injuries, and a history of trauma is denied, especially if the child is an infant or toddler. The history provided by the caregiver does not explain the injuries identified. The history of the injury changes significantly over time. A history of self-inflicted trauma does not correlate with the child\u2019s developmental abilities. There is an unexpected or unexplained delay in seeking medical care."

Afterward an appreciable subcutaneous hematoma developed in the ankle. The diagnostic possibilities include a bone or soft tissue injury. A bony injury was excluded because there was no bone tenderness. The patient had a significant soft tissue injury. On examination he had significant swelling of the ankle with a subcutaneous hematoma. He was unable to stand on tiptoe on the right leg, and in the prone position a palpable defect was demonstrated within the calcaneal tendon. A diagnosis of calcaneal tendon rupture was made. This patient has a typical history of ruptured calcaneal tendon and the clinical findings support this. Magnetic resonance imaging was carried out and confirmed the diagnosis (eFig. 6.144). The patient underwent an operative repair. The tendon healed well, though the patient has not gone back to playing squash."
