The patient states that his symptoms started about a week ago and have steadily worsened. He describes the abdominal pain as mild to moderate, dull, and deeply localized to the umbilical region. Past medical history is significant for 2 transient ischemic attacks 6 months prior, characterized by a sudden right-sided weakness and trouble speaking but recovered fully within 30 minutes. Current medications are sildenafil 100 mg orally as needed. Patient reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and heavy alcohol use on the weekends. Review of systems is significant for decreased appetite and feeling easily full. Vitals are temperature 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure 155/89 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, respirations 16/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The cardiac exam is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Carotid bruit present on the right. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Bowel sounds present. A pulsatile abdominal mass is felt in the lower umbilical region. Patient\u2019s feet have the following appearance seen in the picture. Abdominal ultrasound reveals the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Contrast CT reveals a small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm). High flow supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation are initiated. Morphine sulfate and metoprolol are administered. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient?\n ",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with abdominal pain and 'bruising on his feet', which suggests a possible complication of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The patient's symptoms started a week ago and have steadily worsened, and the physical examination reveals a pulsatile abdominal mass in the lower umbilical region. The abdominal ultrasound and contrast CT reveal a small, unruptured AAA with a diameter of 4.1 cm. Given the size of the aneurysm, the patient is at risk of rupture, which is a medical emergency. The patient's symptoms and examination findings, combined with the imaging results, indicate that the patient requires urgent surgical intervention to prevent rupture and potential mortality. Elective endovascular repair or elective open surgical repair may not be suitable options as the patient's condition is emergent. Discharge with clinical surveillance and ultrasound every 6 months is also not appropriate given the high risk of rupture. Therefore, the best course of treatment for this patient is emergency open surgical repair.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The classic clinical triad of abdominal pain, shock, and back pain occurs in <20% of patients. The typical patient at risk is an elderly male smoker with back pain. The diagnosis may be missed because the symptoms and signs can be nonspecific. Misdiagnoses include nonspecific back pain, diverticulitis, renal colic, sepsis, and myocardial infarction. A careful abdominal examination revealing a pulsatile mass (present in 50\u201375% of patients) is an important physical finding.

An umbilical venous hum may suggest the presence of portal hypertension, and a harsh bruit over the liver is heard rarely in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or alcoholic hepatitis. Abdominal swelling caused by intestinal gas can be differentiated from swelling caused by fluid or a solid mass by percussion; an abdomen filled with gas is tympanic, whereas an abdomen containing a mass or fluid is dull to percussion. The absence of abdominal dullness, however, does not exclude ascites, because a minimum of 1500 mL of ascitic fluid is required for detection on physical examination.

It usually is detected on routine examination as a palpable, pulsatile, expansile, and nontender mass, or it is an incidental finding observed on an abdominal imaging study performed for other reasons.

Other complications include compression of mediastinal structures (e.g., airway or esophagus) and thrombosis/embolism. III. ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM A. Balloon-like dilation of the abdominal aorta; usually arises below the renal arteries, but above the aortic bifurcation (Fig. 7.13) B. Primarily due to atherosclerosis; classically seen in male smokers > 60 years old with hypertension 1. Atherosclerosis increases the diffusion barrier to the media, resulting in atrophy and weakness of the vessel wall. C. Presents as a pulsatile abdominal mass that grows with time D. Major complication is rupture, especially when > 5 cm in diameter; presents with triad of hypotension, pulsatile abdominal mass, and flank pain 1. Other complications include compression oflocal structures (e.g., ureter) and thrombosis/embolism."

Review of the past history and growth chart demonstrates normal birth weight and birth length, but a progressive decrease in height per-centiles relative to age-matched normal ranges starting at 6 months of age, and orthostasis with febrile illnesses. Physical examination demonstrates short stature and mild generalized obesity. Genital examination reveals descended but small testes and a phallic length of \u20132 SD. Laboratory evaluations demonstrate growth hormone (GH) deficiency and a delayed bone age of 18 months. The patient is started on replacement with recombinant human GH at a dose of 40 mcg/kg per day subcutaneously. After 1 year of treatment, his height velocity has increased from 5 cm/y to 11 cm/y.

            "content": "Abdominal Localizing tenderness on the abdominal exam is useful in identifying a gastrointestinal cause of the presenting syndrome. Abdominal findings are infrequent with purely acute cardiopulmonary problems, except in the case of underlying chronic cardiopulmonary disease or severe right ventricular dysfunction leading to hepatic congestion. Vascular Pulse deficits may reflect underlying chronic atherosclerosis, which increases the likelihood of coronary artery disease. However, evidence of acute limb ischemia with loss of the pulse and pallor, particularly in the upper extremities, can indicate catastrophic consequences of aortic dissection. Unilateral lower-extremity swelling should raise suspicion about venous thromboembolism."

If a patient is hypotensive, consider pericardial tamponade, hypovolemia from blood loss, or acute MI from involvement of the coronary arteries. Asymmetric pulses and BP measurements are indicative of aortic dissection. Signs of pericarditis or pericardial tamponade may be seen; a murmur of aortic regurgitation may be heard if the aortic valve is involved with a proximal dissection. Neurologic deficits may be seen if the aortic arch or spinal arteries are involved. ECG, CXR (shows widening of the mediastinum, cardiomegaly, or new left pleural effusion). CT angiography is the gold standard of imaging. TEE can provide details of the thoracic aorta, the proximal coronary arteries, the origins of arch vessels, the presence of a pericardial effusion, and aortic valve integrity."

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired.

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).
