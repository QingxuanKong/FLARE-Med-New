    "question": "A 17-year-old girl is referred by her dentist for a suspected eating disorder. She has been visiting the same dentist since childhood and for the past 2 years has had at least 2 visits for dental caries. She eventually admitted to him that she regularly induces vomiting by putting her fingers down her throat. She says she has been doing this for the last few years and purging at least once a week. More recently, she has been inducing emesis more often and even looked into diuretics as she feels that she is gaining more and more weight compared to her \u2018skinny friends\u2019. Her BMI is at the 50th percentile for her age and sex. Which of the following features is most consistent with this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Patients with this disorder are not further sub-typed",
        "B": "Patients do not usually initiate treatment",
        "C": "Patients can have a history of both anorexia and bulimia",
        "D": "Patients will typically have a BMI between 17\u201318.5 kg/m2"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question requires identifying the characteristic feature of bulimia nervosa in a 17-year-old girl. The key information provided is that she induces vomiting by putting her fingers down her throat, purges at least once a week, and is concerned about gaining weight compared to her peers. This behavior is a clear indication of bulimia nervosa. The BMI is not a critical factor in this case, as the girl's weight is within the normal range, and the primary issue is her compensatory behavior. The other options are incorrect because they are not directly related to the symptoms described. Option A is incorrect because individuals with bulimia nervosa can be further sub-typed based on their symptoms and behaviors. Option B is incorrect because individuals with bulimia nervosa often seek treatment voluntarily. Option D is incorrect because the girl's BMI is not low enough to be classified as underweight, and the primary issue is her binge-eating and purging behaviors. Therefore, the correct answer is C, as patients with bulimia nervosa can have a history of both anorexia and bulimia, although the girl's primary issue is bulimia nervosa.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient.

She describes herself as \u201cchronically miserable and worried all the time.\u201d Her medical history is notable for chronic neck pain from a motor vehicle accident for which she is being treated with tramadol and meperidine. In addition, she is on hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol for hypertension. The patient has a history of one depressive episode after a divorce that was treated successfully with fluoxetine. Medical workup including complete blood cell count, thyroid func-tion tests, and a chemistry panel reveals no abnormalities. She is started on fluoxetine for a presumed major depressive episode and referred for cognitive behavioral psychotherapy. What CYP450 and pharmacodynamic interactions might be associated with fluoxetine use in this patient? Which class of antidepressants would be contraindicated in this patient? A 47-year-old woman"

Weight loss may also result from dehydration, possibly related to excess sweating, diarrhea, vomiting, or reduced fluid intake. Early identification is paramount and requires careful weight monitoring. Patients or caregivers should be taught to record weight regularly at home, the patient should be weighed at each clinical encounter, and a record of serial weights should be maintained in the medical record. If malnutrition is suspected, formal assessment should begin with a standardized screening instrument such as the Mini Nutritional Assessment, the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool, or the Simplified Nutritional Appetite Questionnaire. The Mini Nutritional Assessment includes questions on appetite, timing of eating, frequency of meals, and taste. Its sensitivity and specificity are >75% for future weight loss of \u22655% of body weight in older people. Many nutritional supplements"

Individuals generally become adept at inducing vomiting and are eventually able to vomit at will. Rarely, indi- viduals consume syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting. Other purging behaviors include the misuse of laxatives and diuretics. A number of other compensatory methods may also be used in rare cases. Individuals with bulimia nervosa may misuse enemas following epi- sodes of binge eating, but this is seldom the sole compensatory method employed. Individ- uals with this disorder may take thyroid hormone in an attempt to avoid weight gain."
