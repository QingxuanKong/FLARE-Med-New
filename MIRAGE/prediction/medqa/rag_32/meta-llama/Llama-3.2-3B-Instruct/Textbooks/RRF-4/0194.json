    "question": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician because of abdominal pain and constipation for 3 weeks. His mother says he has been increasingly irritable recently. His vocabulary consists of 50 words and he does not use sentences. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae and abdominal tenderness. He refers to himself by name but is unable to name body parts or count to three. Peripheral blood smear shows small, pale red blood cells with basophilic stippling. Which of the following processes is most likely impaired in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Conversion of ferrous iron to ferric iron",
        "B": "Conversion of porphobilinogen to hydroxymethylbilane",
        "C": "Conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen",
        "D": "Conversion of uroporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrinogen III"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with abdominal pain, constipation, irritability, pale conjunctivae, and abdominal tenderness. The peripheral blood smear shows small, pale red blood cells with basophilic stippling. These findings suggest a disorder of heme synthesis. The basophilic stippling is indicative of the accumulation of ribosomal RNA, which is a byproduct of the heme synthesis pathway. The impaired process would need to be one of the steps in the heme synthesis pathway that results in the accumulation of ribosomal RNA.\\n\\nThe heme synthesis pathway involves the conversion of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to porphobilinogen, which is then converted to hydroxymethylbilane, and then to coproporphyrinogen III, and finally to uroporphyrinogen III, and then to protoporphyrin IX, and finally to iron-porphyrin heme. The conversion of porphobilinogen to hydroxymethylbilane is catalyzed by the enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase, which is also known as ferrochelatase. This enzyme is also involved in the conversion of ferrous iron to ferric iron. The conversion of uroporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrinogen III is catalyzed by the enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase.\\n\\nGiven the presence of basophilic stippling in the peripheral blood smear, the most likely impaired process is the conversion of porphobilinogen to hydroxymethylbilane, which is catalyzed by the enzyme ferrochelatase. This enzyme is also involved in the conversion of ferrous iron to ferric iron. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen is not directly related to the accumulation of ribosomal RNA, so it can be ruled out. Similarly, the conversion of uroporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrinogen III is not directly related to the accumulation of ribosomal RNA, so it can be ruled out. The conversion of ferrous iron to ferric iron is not directly related to the accumulation of ribosomal RNA, so it can be ruled out. The conversion of porphobilinogen to hydroxymethylbilane is the most likely impaired process, which is catalyzed by the enzyme ferrochelatase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

History revealed that these symptoms began after fruit juices were introduced to his diet as he was being weaned off breast milk. The physical examination was remarkable for hepatomegaly. Tests on the baby\u2019s urine were positive for reducing sugar but negative for glucose. The infant most likely suffers from a deficiency of: A. aldolase B. B. fructokinase. C. galactokinase. D. \u03b2-galactosidase."

He complained that his face and extremities had taken on a blue color. His medical history included chronic stable angina treated with isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin. Blood obtained for analysis was brown. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A. Carboxyhemoglobinemia B. Hemoglobin SC disease C. Methemoglobinemia D.

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian"

            "content": "The following three brief scenarios of a patient with hemoptysis demonstrate three distinct patterns: A 46-year-old man presents to his internist with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

After red cell size is assessed, one examines the hemoglobin content of the cells. They are either normal in color (normochromic) or pale in color (hypochromic). They are never \u201chyperchromic.\u201d If more than the normal amount of hemoglobin is made, the cells get larger\u2014they do not become darker. In addition to hemoglobin content, the red cells are examined for inclusions. Red cell inclusions are the following: 1. Basophilic stippling\u2014diffuse fine or coarse blue dots in the red cell usually representing RNA residue\u2014especially common in lead poisoning 2. 3. Nuclei\u2014red cells may be released or pushed out of the marrow prematurely before nuclear extrusion\u2014often implies a myelophthisic process or a vigorous narrow response to anemia, usually hemolytic anemia 4."

Gastrointestinal involvement, which is seen in almost 70% of pediatric patients, is characterized by colicky abdominal pain usually associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation and is frequently accompanied by the passage of blood and mucus per rectum; bowel intussusception may occur. Renal involvement occurs in 10\u201350% of patients and is usually characterized by mild glomerulonephritis leadingtoproteinuriaandmicroscopic hematuria, with redblood cell casts in the majority of patients (Chap. 338); it usually resolves spontaneously without therapy. Rarely, a progressive glomerulonephritis will develop. In adults, presenting symptoms are most frequently related to the skin and joints, while initial complaints related to the gut are less common. Although certain studies have found that renal disease is more frequentandmore severe"
