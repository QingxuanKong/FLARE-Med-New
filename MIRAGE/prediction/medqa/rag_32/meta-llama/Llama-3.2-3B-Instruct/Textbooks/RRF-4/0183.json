    "question": "A 35-year-old Caucasian female presents to the emergency room with unilateral leg swelling. She reports that she developed painful left-sided leg swelling and redness earlier in the day. She is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. She denies any recent prolonged travel. She experienced a similar episode affecting the opposite leg one year ago and was diagnosed with a thrombus in the right femoral vein. On examination, the left leg is erythematous and swollen. Passive dorsiflexion of the left ankle elicits pain in the left calf. Ultrasound of the leg reveals a thrombus in the left popliteal vein. A genetic workup reveals that she has an inherited condition. What is the most likely pathophysiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with unilateral leg swelling, painful redness, and a history of a previous episode of thrombosis in the opposite leg. The ultrasound reveals a thrombus in the left popliteal vein. The genetic workup indicates an inherited condition. The key to solving this question is to consider the genetic workup results and the patient's symptoms. The patient has a history of thrombosis and an inherited condition. The most common inherited conditions associated with thrombophilia are factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin G20210A mutation, and antithrombin deficiency. However, the question does not mention any of these conditions. The correct answer can be deduced by considering the patient's symptoms and the options provided. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a condition that causes blood clotting disorders. The correct answer is related to clotting factor degradation. The patient's symptoms are consistent with Factor V Leiden thrombophilia, which is a condition that results from a mutation in the factor V gene that leads to resistance to clotting factor degradation. This is the most likely pathophysiology of this patient's condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

However, many DVTs are asymptomatic, especially in bedridden patients, and the absence of findings does not exclude their presence. Pulmonary embolism is a common and serious clinical complication of DVT, resulting from fragmentation or detachment of the venous thrombus.

Virchow described the reasons for thrombus formation as decreased blood flow, abnormality of the constituents of blood, and abnormalities of the vessel wall. Common predisposing factors include hospitalization and surgery, the oral contraceptive pill, smoking, and air travel. Other factors include clotting abnormalities (e.g., protein S and protein C deficiency). The diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis may be difficult to establish, with symptoms including leg swelling and pain and discomfort in the calf. It may also be an incidental finding. In practice, patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis undergo a D-dimer blood test, which measures levels of a fibrin degradation product. If this is positive there is a high association with deep vein thrombosis."

Patients typically have a history of pain that develops in the calf muscles (usually associated with occlusions or narrowing in the femoral artery) or the buttocks (usually associated with occlusion or narrowing in the aorto-iliac segments). The pain experienced in these muscles is often cramplike and occurs with walking. The patient rests and is able to continue walking up to the same distance until the pain recurs and stops walking as before. In some patients with chronic limb ischemia, an acute event blocks the vessels or reduces the blood supply to such a degree that the viability of the limb is threatened. Occasionally a leg may become acutely ischemic with no evidence of underlying atheromatous disease. In these instances a blood clot is likely to have embolized from the heart. Patients with mitral valve disease and atrial fibrillation are prone to embolic disease."

Other causes of leg swelling that resemble lymphedema are myxedema and lipedema. Lipedema usually occurs in women and is caused by accumulation of adipose tissue in the leg from the thigh to the ankle with sparing of the feet. Diagnostic Testing The evaluation of patients with lymphedema should include diagnostic studies to clarify the cause.

However, patients with a high clinical likelihood of VTE should skip d-dimer testing and undergo imaging as the next step in the diagnostic algorithm. Clinical Pearls Not all leg pain is due to DVT, and not all dyspnea is due to PE (Table 300-2). Sudden, severe calf discomfort suggests a ruptured Baker\u2019s cyst. Fever and chills usually herald cellulitis rather than DVT. Physical findings, if present, may consist only of mild palpation discomfort in the lower calf. However, massive DVT often presents with marked thigh swelling, tenderness, and erythema. If the leg is diffusely edematous, DVT is unlikely. More probable is an acute exacerbation of venous insufficiency due to postthrombotic syndrome. Upper extremity venous thrombosis may present with asymmetry in the supraclavicular fossa or in the circumference of the upper arms."

Bilateral leg swelling occurs in patients with congestive heart failure, hypoalbuminemia secondary to nephrotic syndrome or severe hepatic disease, myxedema caused by hypothyroidism or pretibial myxedema associated with Graves\u2019 disease, and with drugs such as dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and thiazolidinediones.

Superficial venous thrombi usually arise in the saphenous system, particularly in the setting of varicosities; these rarely embolize but they can be painful and can cause local congestion and swelling from impaired venous outflow, predisposing the overlying skin to the development of infections and varicose ulcers. Deep venous thromboses (DVTs) in the larger leg veins at or above the knee joint (e.g., popliteal, femoral, and iliac veins) are more serious because they are prone to embolize. Although such DVTs may cause local pain and edema, collateral channels often circumvent the venous obstruction. Consequently, DVTs are entirely asymptomatic in approximately 50% of patients and are recognized only after they have embolized to the lungs. Lower-extremity DVTs are associated with stasis and hypercoagulable states, as described earlier ("

What are two potential treatment options for her possible chlamydial infection? How does her potential pregnancy affect the treatment decision? A 22-year-old woman presents to her college medical clinic complaining of a 2-week history of vaginal discharge. She denies any fever or abdominal pain but does report vaginal bleeding after sexual intercourse. When questioned about her sexual activity, she reports having vaginal intercourse, at times unprotected, with two men in the last 6 months. A pelvic examination is performed and is positive for muco-purulent discharge from the endocervical canal. No cervical"

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

DUS can be performed initially to confirm the diagnosis, but limitations to the exam by the clavicle and collateralization can lead to a false-negative study. Venography is recommended when there is nonconcordance between the duplex study and clinical suspi-cion. Anticoagulation therapy should be initiated once ASVT is diagnosed to prevent PE and decrease symptoms.Treatment of patients with primary upper extremity venous thrombosis is controversial because the natural history of the disease may vary from minimal to no symptoms to significant symptoms with vigorous upper extremity activities. In recent years, patients presenting with acute symptomatic primary ASVT are often considered candidates for CDT therapy with the goal of minimizing long-term symptoms of venous congestion. Venography is performed through a catheter placed using an ultrasound-guided"

In contrast, the patient with chronic mesenteric isch-emia is likely to present with postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss. The patient fears eating because of the pain, avoids food, and loses weight. It is very unlikely that a patient with abdominal pain who has not lost weight has chronic mesenteric ischemia.The patient with lower extremity pain on ambulation has intermittent claudication that occurs in certain muscle groups; for example, calf pain upon exercise usually reflects superficial femoral artery disease, while pain in the buttocks reflects iliac disease.
