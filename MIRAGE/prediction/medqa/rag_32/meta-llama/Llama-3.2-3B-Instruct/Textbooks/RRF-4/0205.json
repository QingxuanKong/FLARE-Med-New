Splenic dysfunction is followed, eventually, by splenic infarction, usually by 2 to 4 years of age.

A febrile patient with a sickle cell syndrome (temperature >38.5\u00b0C) must be evaluated immediately (see Chapter 96).

For the purposes of this chapter, we will divide these indications into the following categories: (a) benign conditions, including red blood cell disor-ders, hemoglobinopathies, and platelet disorders (Table 34-1a); (b) malignant conditions, including white blood cell disorders, bone marrow disorders (myeloproliferative disorders) and tumors of the spleen (Table 34-1b); and (c) miscellaneous conditions and lesions of the spleen including infections and abscesses, cysts, vascular anomalies, and more (Table 34-1c).

The role of selective angioembolization (SAE) continues to be defined, but appears warranted in high grade injuries, particularly those with contrast blush.121 It is clear, however, that up to 15% to 20% of patients with splenic trauma warrant early splenectomy and that failure of nonoperative management often represents inappro-priate patient selection.122,123 Indications for early intervention in adults include initiation of blood transfusion within the first 12 hours and hemodynamic instability. Unlike hepatic injuries, which usually rebleed within 48 hours, delayed hemorrhage or rupture of the spleen can occur up to weeks after injury.Splenic injuries are managed operatively by splenectomy, partial splenectomy, or splenic repair (splenorrhaphy), based on the extent of the injury and the physiologic condition of the patient. Splenectomy is indicated for significant hilar injuries,"

Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin.

In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min).

William Henson believed the spleen to be a ductless vascular gland similar to the thyroid and adrenals. In 1777, he wrote of the lymphatic nature of the spleen and its filtering function and even suggested its role in hematopoiesis.10Rudolf Virchow, one of the first to discover leukemia, implicated the spleen as figuring prominently in all leukemia patients. He suspected that the spleen was responsible for gen-erating the leukocytes in large quantities in these patients. There soon followed an enthusiastic effort by surgeons to cure leu-kemia by splenectomy. Dr. Thomas Bryant performed the first splenectomy in 1866 in a patient with leukemia."

Prompt medical attention with evaluation and treatment of suspected bacteremia may be life-saving. Routine chemoprophylaxis with oral penicillin can result in the emergence of drug-resistant strains and is not recommended. In addition to an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections, splenectomized patients are also more susceptible to the parasitic disease babesiosis. The splenectomized patient should avoid areas where the parasite Babesia is endemic (e.g., Cape Cod, MA)."
