    "question": "A 22-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by police after he was found undressing himself outside in 110\u00b0F weather. The patient refuses to answer any questions as he suspects that his care team is spying on him. The patient recently started college and has presented to the emergency department once before for polysubstance intoxication. The patient attempts to assault a nurse, is restrained, and given diphenhydramine and haloperidol. When the patient is able to be examined, he is somnolent and non-responsive. His temperature is 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C), blood pressure is 147/98 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. He does not comply with any commands, and it is not possible to freely manipulate his extremities due to rigidity. His mucous membranes are dry. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

He has a history of polysubstance intoxication and has previously been to the emergency department for similar issues. The patient is currently somnolent, non-responsive, and has a high fever (104\u00b0F or 40\u00b0C), elevated blood pressure (147/98 mmHg), tachycardia (120/min), and tachypnea (17/min).\\n\\nThe patient's symptoms and signs are consistent with a severe case of hyperthermia, which can be caused by various factors, including heat stroke, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), and catatonic schizophrenia. However, the patient's history of polysubstance intoxication and previous episodes of similar symptoms suggest that NMS is a more likely diagnosis.\\n\\nNMS is a life-threatening neurological disorder caused by an adverse reaction to neuroleptic medications, often seen in patients with schizophrenia or other psychiatric conditions. It is characterized by fever, muscle rigidity, autonomic dysfunction, and altered mental status, which are all present in this patient.\\n\\nCatatonic schizophrenia is a subtype of schizophrenia characterized by immobility, mutism, and rigidity, but it does not typically present with fever and autonomic dysfunction.\\n\\nHeat stroke is a condition caused by severe hyperthermia, but it does not typically present with muscle rigidity and altered mental status.\\n\\nOversedation is a state of sedation, which is not consistent with the patient's current level of consciousness and motor activity.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is neuroleptic malignant syndrome (C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination?

A simultaneous esophageal probe should be placed 24 cm below the larynx; it may read falsely high during heated inhalation therapy. Relying solely on infrared tympanic thermography is not advisable. After a diagnosis of hypothermia is established, cardiac monitoring should be instituted, along with attempts to limit further heat loss. If the patient is in ventricular fibrillation, it is unclear at what core temperature ventricular defibrillation (2 J/kg) should first be attempted. One attempt below 30\u00b0C is warranted. Further defibrillation attempts should be deferred until some rewarming (1\u00b0\u20132\u00b0C) is achieved and ventricular fibrillation is coarser. Although cardiac pacing for hypothermic bradydysrrhythmias is rarely indicated, the transthoracic technique is preferable."
