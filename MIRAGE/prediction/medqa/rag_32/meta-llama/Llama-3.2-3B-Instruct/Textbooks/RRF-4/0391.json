The absence of a palpable radial pulse during inspiration is a key finding that suggests pulsus paradoxus, a hallmark of cardiac tamponade. Pulsus paradoxus is a decrease in systolic blood pressure of more than 10 mmHg with inspiration, which can be life-threatening if not addressed promptly. The next step in management should be to perform pericardiocentesis to drain the pericardial effusion and relieve the tamponade. This is a critical step to prevent further compromise of cardiac function and potential cardiac arrest. The other options, while potentially relevant to the patient's condition, are not the immediate next step in management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Unless myocardial infarction is suspected, there is no role for routine serial measurement of cardiac enzyme levels\u2014they lack specificity and do not predict significant dysrhythmias.25 In patients with no identified injuries who are being considered for discharge from the ED, the combination of a normal EKG and troponin level rules out significant BCI.26 The patient with hemodynamic instability from BCI requires appropriate resuscitation and may benefit from hemodynamic monitoring to optimize preload and guide inotropic support. Echocardiography (ECHO) is performed to exclude valvular or septal injuries; the most common ECHO finding in BCI is right ventricular dyskinesia due to the anterior orientation of the right ventricle. Transthoracic and transesophageal ECHO are now becoming routine in the trauma bay and surgical"

They can be triggered by any stimulus that decreases systemic vascular resistance, such as fever, agitation, or vigorous physical activity. Cyanotic spells increase in severity and frequency as the child grows, and older patients with uncorrected TOF may often squat, which increases peripheral vascular resistance and relieves the cyanosis.Evaluation in the older patient with TOF may demonstrate clubbing, polycythemia, hemoptysis, or brain abscesses. Chest radiography will demonstrate a boot-shaped heart (Fig. 20-55), and EKG will show the normal pattern of right ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography confirms the diagnosis because it demonstrates the position and nature of the VSD, defines the character of the RVOT obstruction, and often visualizes the branch pulmonary arteries and the proximal coronary arteries. Cardiac catheterization is rarely necessary and is actually risky in TOF since it can create spasm of the RVOT muscle and result in"

Primary Cardiology, 2nd ed. Philadelphia, WB Saunders, 2003.) Patients with exertional dyspnea should be asked to walk under observation in order to reproduce the symptoms. The patient should be examined during and at the end of exercise for new findings that were not present at rest and for changes in oxygen saturation."

            "content": "APPROACH TO THE PATIENT: The evaluation of patients with suspected cardiac arrhythmias is highly individualized; however, two key features\u2014the history and ECG\u2014are pivotal in directing the diagnostic workup and therapy. Patients with cardiac arrhythmias exhibit a wide spectrum of clinical presentations that range from asymptomatic ECG abnormalities to survival from cardiac arrest. In general, the more severe the presenting symptoms are, the more aggressive the evaluation and treatment are. Loss of consciousness that is believed to be of cardiac origin typically mandates an exhaustive search for the etiology and often requires invasive, device-based therapy. The presence of structural heart disease and prior myocardial infarction dictates a change in the approach to the management of syncope or ventricular arrhythmias. The presence of a family history of serious ventricular arrhythmias or premature sudden death will influence the evaluation of presumed heritable arrhythmias."
