    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's break down the key points from the given documents: 1. The patient is an 11-year-old child who complains of pain in the leg while playing. 2. Blood pressure in the upper limb is 140/90 mm Hg, while the lower limbs are 110/70 mm Hg, indicating a significant difference in blood pressure between the upper and lower limbs. 3. There is a brachiofemoral delay in the pulse, which suggests a narrowing or obstruction in the aorta that affects blood flow to the lower limbs. 4. Auscultation shows a loud S1, loud S2, and S4, indicating increased cardiac output and possible heart failure. 5. There is a presence of an ejection systolic murmur in the interscapular area, which is typically associated with aortic stenosis or coarctation of the aorta. 6. Chest X-ray reveals notching of the ribs, which is a classic sign of coarctation of the aorta. Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is coarctation of the aorta. Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta that can cause high blood pressure in the upper limbs, decreased blood pressure in the lower limbs, and a characteristic brachiofemoral delay in the pulse. The presence of an ejection systolic murmur in the interscapular area also supports this diagnosis. The other options can be ruled out as follows: A. Pulmonic stenosis: This condition involves narrowing of the pulmonary valve, which would not cause a significant difference in blood pressure between the upper and lower limbs. C. Aortic stenosis: While aortic stenosis can cause an ejection systolic murmur, it would not typically cause a brachiofemoral delay in the pulse or notching of the ribs. D. Transposition of great vessels: This congenital heart defect involves an abnormal connection between the pulmonary artery and the aorta, which would not cause the same symptoms as described in this patient. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The classic physical exam finding is a systolic BP that is higher in the upper extremities; the difference in BP between the left and right arm can indicate the point of coarctation. Additional findings include weak femoral pulses, radiofemoral delay, a short systolic murmur in the left axilla, and a forceful apical impulse. In infancy, critical coarctation requires a patent PDA for survival. Such infants may present in the first few weeks of life in a shocklike state when the PDA closes. Differential cyanosis may be seen with lower oxygen saturation in the left arm and lower extremities (postductal areas) as compared to the right arm (preductal area). Echocardiography and color \ufb02ow Doppler are diagnostic. CXR in young children may demonstrate cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion."

The pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) also is often accentuated with elevated PA pressures, and the two components of the second heart sound (S2) are closely split. The opening snap (OS) of the mitral valve is most readily audible in expiration at, or just medial to, the cardiac apex. This sound generally follows the sound of aortic valve closure (A2) by 0.05\u20130.12 s. The time interval between A2 and OS varies inversely with the severity of the MS. The OS is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, diastolic murmur, heard best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral recumbent position (see Fig. 267-5); it is accentuated by mild exercise (e.g., a few rapid sit-ups) carried out just before auscultation.

This murmur may be quite loud without signifying aortic obstruction. A third murmur sometimes heard in patients with severe AR is the Austin Flint murmur, a soft, low-pitched, rumbling mid-to-late diastolic murmur. It is probably produced by the diastolic displacement of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve by the AR stream and is not associated with hemodynamically significant mitral obstruction. The auscultatory features of AR are intensified by strenuous and sustained handgrip, which augments systemic vascular resistance. In acute severe AR, the elevation of LV end-diastolic pressure may lead to early closure of the mitral valve, a soft S1, a pulse pressure that is not particularly wide, and a soft, short, early diastolic murmur of AR."

            "content": "Auscultation In patients with severe AR, the aortic valve closure sound (A2) is usually absent. A systolic ejection sound is audible in patients with BAV disease, and occasionally an S4 also may be heard. The murmur of chronic AR is typically a high-pitched, blowing, decrescendo diastolic murmur, heard best in the third intercostal space along the left sternal border (see Fig. 267-5B). In patients with mild AR, this murmur is brief, but as the severity increases, it generally becomes louder and longer, indeed holodiastolic. When the murmur is soft, it can be heard best with the diaphragm of the stethoscope and with the patient sitting up, leaning forward, and with the breath held in forced expiration. In patients in whom the AR is caused by primary valvular disease, the diastolic murmur is usually louder along the left than the right sternal border. However, when the murmur is heard best along the right sternal border, it suggests that the AR is caused by aneurysmal dilation of the"

Extensor plantar responses (with normal tone in trunk and extremities), absence of deep tendon reflexes, and weakness (greater distally than proximally) are usually found. Loss of vibratory and proprioceptive sensation occurs. The median age of death is 35 years. Women have a significantly better prognosis than men. Cardiac involvement occurs in 90% of patients. Cardiomegaly, symmetric hypertrophy, murmurs, and conduction defects are reported. Moderate mental retardation or psychiatric syndromes are present in a small percentage of patients. A high incidence of diabetes mellitus (20%) is found and is associated with insulin resistance and pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction. Musculoskeletal deformities are common and include pes cavus, pes equinovarus, and scoliosis. MRI of the spinal cord shows atrophy (Fig. 450-2)."

If not diagnosed at birth, the infantmay develop signs of heart failure as pulmonary vascularresistance decreases. The signs then include tachypnea andcough. Peripheral pulses are usually bounding as a result ofthe diastolic runoff into the pulmonary arteries. A single S2 is due to the single valve. There may be a systolic ejection click, and there is often a systolic murmur at the left sternal border. ECG findings include combined ventricular hypertrophy and cardiomegaly. A chest x-ray usually reveals increased pulmonary blood and may show displaced pulmonary arteries. Echocardiography defines the anatomy, including theVSD, truncal valve function, and origin of the pulmonaryarteries."

If the ventricular septum is intact, there may be no murmur. Children with transposition and a large VSD have improved intracardiac mixing and less cyanosis. They may present with signs of heart failure. The heart is hyperdynamic, with palpable left and right ventricular impulses. A loud VSD murmur is heard. S2 is single. ECG findings typically include right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy. The chest x-ray reveals increased pulmonary vascularity, and the cardiac shadow is classically an egg on a string created by the narrow superior mediastinum. Echocardiography shows the transposition of the great arteries, the sites and amount of mixing, and any associated lesions. Figure 144-3 Tricuspid atresia with ventricular septal defect.

A tumor plop is a lower-pitched sound that rarely can be heard in patients with atrial myxoma. It may be appreciated only in certain positions and arises from the diastolic prolapse of the tumor across the mitral valve. The third heart sound (S3) occurs during the rapid filling phase of ventricular diastole. It can be a normal finding in children, adolescents, and young adults; however, in older patients, it signifies heart failure. A left-sided S3 is a low-pitched sound best heard over the left ventricular (LV) apex. A right-sided S3 is usually better heard over the lower left sternal border and becomes louder with inspiration.

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."
