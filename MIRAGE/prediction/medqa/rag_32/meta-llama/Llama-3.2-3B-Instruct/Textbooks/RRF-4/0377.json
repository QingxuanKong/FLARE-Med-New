    "question": "A 30-year-old primigravid woman at 22 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department by her husband for lethargy, nausea, and vomiting for 4 days. This morning she became drowsy. She returned from a business trip to Sudan 3 weeks ago. She denies eating any seafood while traveling. Medications include iron supplements and a multivitamin. Her immunizations are up-to-date and she has never received blood products. Her temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102\u00b0F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 122/76 mm Hg. She is oriented to person and place. Examination shows jaundice and mild asterixis. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 22-week gestation. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 11.2 g/dL\nProthrombin time 18 sec (INR=2.0)\nSerum\nTotal bilirubin 4.4 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 398 U/L\nAST 4,702 U/L\nALT 3,551 U/L\nLactate dehydrogenase 3,412 U/L\nAnti-nuclear antibody negative\nAnti-smooth muscle antibody negative\nAnti-CMV antibody negative\nAnti-EBV nuclear antigen antibody negative\nAn ELISA for HIV is negative.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. The patient is a 30-year-old primigravid woman at 22 weeks' gestation, presenting with lethargy, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and asterixis. The patient has a history of travel to Sudan 3 weeks ago, but denies eating any seafood. The laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase), elevated total bilirubin, and a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0. The patient is also positive for anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) negative, anti-smooth muscle antibody negative, anti-CMV antibody negative, and anti-EBV nuclear antigen antibody negative. The ELISA for HIV is negative. Given these findings, we need to consider the differential diagnosis. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are suggestive of acute liver injury or hepatitis. The patient's travel history to Sudan raises the possibility of hepatitis E, which is a common cause of acute hepatitis in developing countries. The fact that the patient denies eating any seafood is consistent with hepatitis E, as seafood is not a common food source in Sudan. The most likely test to confirm the diagnosis of hepatitis E is the anti-HEV IgM test. The anti-HEV IgM test detects the presence of IgM antibodies against the hepatitis E virus, which are typically present in the early stages of infection. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with acute hepatitis E, and the anti-HEV IgM test would be the most likely to confirm the diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

            "content": "Laboratory features of autoimmune hepatitis are similar to those seen in chronic viral hepatitis. Liver biochemical tests are invariably abnormal but may not correlate with the clinical severity or histopathologic features in individual cases. Many patients with autoimmune hepatitis have normal serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and globulin levels with only minimal aminotransferase elevations. Serum AST and ALT levels are increased and fluctuate in the range of 100\u22121000 units. In severe cases, the serum bilirubin level is moderately elevated (51\u2212171 \u03bcmol/L [3\u221210 mg/dL]). Hypoalbuminemia occurs in patients with very active or advanced disease. Serum alkaline phosphatase levels may be moderately elevated or near normal. In a small proportion of patients, marked elevations of alkaline phosphatase activity occur; in such patients, clinical and laboratory features overlap with those of primary biliary cirrhosis (Chap. 365). The prothrombin time is often prolonged, particularly late in"

He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

Focused History: Ten days ago, CR had her spleen removed following a bicycle accident in which she fractured her tibial eminence, necessitating immobilization of the right knee. She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."

Results on blood tests performed by the clinical laboratory are shown below: H=High;L=Low. Microscopic examination of her urine revealed a urinary tract infection (UTI). Diagnosis: MW is in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) that was precipitated by a UTI. [Note: Diabetes increases the risk for infections such as UTI.] Immediate Treatment: MW was rehydrated with normal saline given intravenously (IV). She also was given insulin IV. Blood glucose, ketone bodies, and electrolytes were measured periodically. Antibiotic treatment of her UTI was started. Long-Term Treatment: Diabetes increases the risk for macrovascular complications (such as coronary artery disease and stroke) and microvascular complications (such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy). Ongoing monitoring for these complications will be continued."
