    "question": "The parents of a 16-year-old boy with type 1 diabetes mellitus present requesting information about the drug, exenatide, an injectable drug that only needs to be administered once a week. The patient\u2019s blood glucose levels have been difficult to control on his current insulin regimen due to poor adherence to recommended therapy, and he has had difficulty putting on weight despite eating copiously. The patient is afebrile and his vital signs are within normal limits. His body mass index (BMI) is 19 kg/m2. Which of the following best describes why the patient should not be switched to exenatide?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Insulin production by the pancreas is insufficient for exenatide to be effective.",
        "B": "Exenatide suppresses glucagon secretion, which increases the risk of hypoglycemia.",
        "C": "Suppression of appetite makes it even harder for him to gain weight.",
        "D": "Exenatide is contraindicated in children below 18 years."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the mechanism of action of exenatide and its potential side effects. Exenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppresses glucagon secretion, and slows gastric emptying. It is administered once a week via injection. Given the patient's difficulty in controlling blood glucose levels and struggling with weight gain despite eating copiously, exenatide may be a suitable option. However, we need to evaluate the provided options to determine why the patient should not be switched to exenatide.\\n\\nOption A: Insulin production by the pancreas is insufficient for exenatide to be effective. This is not a correct answer because exenatide works by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion, which would be effective even if the patient's insulin production is insufficient.\\n\\nOption B: Exenatide suppresses glucagon secretion, which increases the risk of hypoglycemia. This is not a correct answer because exenatide actually suppresses glucagon secretion, which would decrease the risk of hypoglycemia, not increase it.\\n\\nOption C: Suppression of appetite makes it even harder for him to gain weight. This is a potential side effect of exenatide, as it can lead to weight loss. Given the patient's difficulty gaining weight despite eating copiously, this could be a significant concern.\\n\\nOption D: Exenatide is contraindicated in children below 18 years. This is not a correct answer because exenatide is approved for use in patients with type 2 diabetes, but not specifically for children under 18 years old. However, the patient has type 1 diabetes, not type 2, so this option is not relevant.\\n\\nTherefore, the best answer is C. Exenatide may lead to weight loss, which could exacerbate the patient's struggle with weight gain, making it an inappropriate choice for this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

            "content": "A related form lasts days and may require treatment with intravenous glucose before it stabilizes. A few infants, some of diabetic mothers but most usually below about 2500 gm birth weight, continue to be hypoglycemic for days or weeks and are generally treated with intravenous glucose or glucagon if the situation is severe, and monitored in a neonatal intensive care unit. A proportion of these infants will have hypoglycemia that persists for only weeks or months and clears without explanation. This condition is due to congenital hyperinsulinism. The latter may be manifest as near normal insulin levels when the glucose drops below approximately 50 mg/dL. They can be treated with oral diazoxide, a drug formerly used intravenously for the control of severe acute hypertension but in oral form blocks insulin release, or with octreotide. The appropriate threshold for treatment of hypoglycemia has been a matter of debate."

            "content": "Treatment with insulin becomes necessary as type 2 DM enters the phase of relative insulin deficiency (as seen in long-standing DM) and is signaled by inadequate glycemic control with one or two oral glucose-lowering agents. Insulin alone or in combination should be used in patients who fail to reach the glycemic target. For example, a single dose of long-acting insulin at bedtime is often effective in combination with metformin. In contrast, insulin secretagogues have little utility once insulin therapy is started. Experience using incretin therapies and insulin is limited. As endogenous insulin production falls further, multiple injections of long-acting and short-acting insulin regimens are necessary to control postprandial glucose excursions. These insulin regimens are identical to the long-acting and short-acting combination regimens discussed above for type 1 DM. Because the hyperglycemia of type 2 DM tends to be more \u201cstable,\u201d these regimens can be increased in 10% increments"

            "content": "Comprehensive care of type 1 and type 2 DM requires an emphasis on nutrition, exercise, and monitoring of glycemic control but also usually involves glucose-lowering medication(s). This chapter discusses classes of such medications but does not describe every glucose-lowering agent available worldwide. The initial step is to select an individualized, glycemic goal for the patient. Because the complications of DM are related to glycemic control, normoglycemia or near-normoglycemia is the desired, but often elusive, goal for most patients. Normalization or near-normalization of the plasma glucose for long periods of time is extremely difficult, as demonstrated by the DCCT and United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS). Regardless of the level of hyperglycemia, improvement in glycemic control will lower the risk of diabetes-specific complications (Chap. 419)."

They are initiated by autophosphorylation of select tyrosine residues in their receptors. C. They are mediated by binding to adrenergic receptors, which are a class of nuclear receptors. D. They result in the activation of glycogen and triacylglycerol synthesis. Q3. NE bound to certain receptors causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. Why might NE be used clinically in the treatment of septic shock?

Focused History: AZ\u2019s father reports that the boy has always been quite sensitive to the sun.

Studies in Finnish and Chinese populations noted similar efficacy of diet and exercise in preventing or delaying type 2 DM. A number of agents, including \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, metformin, thiazolidinediones, GLP-1 receptor pathway modifiers, and orlistat, prevent or delay type 2 DM but are not approved for this purpose. Individuals with a strong family history of type 2 DM and individuals with IFG or IGT should be strongly encouraged to maintain a normal BMI and engage in regular physical activity. Pharmacologic therapy for individuals with prediabetes is currently controversial because its cost-effectiveness and safety profile are not known. The ADA has suggested that metformin be considered in individuals with both IFG and IGT who are at very high risk for progression to diabetes (age <60 years, BMI \u226535 kg/m2, family history of diabetes in first-degree relative, and women with a history of GDM).

            "content": "The benefits of intensive diabetes management and improved glycemic control include a reduction in the microvascular complications of DM and a reduction in diabetes-related complications. From a psychological standpoint, the patient experiences greater control over his or her diabetes and often notes an improved sense of well-being, greater flexibility in the timing and content of meals, and the capability to alter insulin dosing with exercise. In addition, intensive diabetes management prior to and during pregnancy reduces the risk of fetal malformations and morbidity. Intensive diabetes management is encouraged in newly diagnosed patients with type 1 DM because it may prolong the period of C-peptide production, which may result in better glycemic control and a reduced risk of serious hypoglycemia. Although intensive management confers impressive benefits, it is also accompanied by significant personal and financial costs and is therefore not appropriate for all individuals."
