An experienced ultrasonographer is necessary for the best results.Computed Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies provide excellent imaging of the thyroid gland and adjacent nodes and are particularly useful in evaluating the extent of large, fixed, or substernal goiters (which cannot be evaluated by ultrasound) and their relationship to the airway and vascular structures. Noncontrast CT scans should be obtained for patients who are likely to require subsequent RAI therapy. If contrast is necessary, therapy needs to be delayed by several months. Combined PET-CT scans are increasingly being used for Tg-positive, RAI-negative tumors.Benign Thyroid DisordersHyperthyroidism. The clinical manifestations of hyperthy-roidism result from an excess of circulating thyroid hormone. Hyperthyroidism may arise"

            "content": "Evaluation of thyroid nodules during pregnancy should be similar to that for nonpregnant patients. As discussed in Chapter 46 (p. 908), radioiodine scanning in pregnancy is usually not recommended (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2017). Sonographic examination reliably detects nodules > 5 mm, and their solid or cystic structure also is determined. According to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, sonographic characteristics associated with malignancy include hypoechogenic pattern, irregular margins, and microcalcifications (Gharib, 2005). Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is an excellent assessment method, and histological tumor markers and immunostaining are reliable to evaluate for malignancy (Hegedus, 2004). If the FNA biopsy shows a follicular lesion, surgery may be deferred until after delivery."

            "content": "In iodine-sufficient populations, the data are less impressive. Randomized controlled trial analyses have shown that less than 25% of benign nodules shrink more than 50% with TSH suppression in iodine-replete populations. Thyroidectomy should be performed if a nodule enlarges on TSH suppression, causes compressive symptoms, or for cos-metic reasons. An exception to this general rule is the patient who has had previous irradiation of the thyroid gland or has a family history of thyroid cancer. In these patients, total or near-total thyroidectomy is recommended because of the high incidence of thyroid cancer and decreased reliability of FNAB in this setting.Malignant Thyroid DiseaseIn the United States, thyroid cancer accounts for <1% of all malignancies (2% of women and 0.5% of men) and is the most rapidly increasing cancer in women. Thyroid cancer is respon-sible for six deaths per million persons annually. Most patients present with a palpable swelling in the neck, which initiates"

            "content": "Thyroid tumors range from circumscribed, benign adenomas to highly aggressive, anaplastic carcinomas. From a clinical standpoint, the possibility of a tumor is of major concern in patients who present with thyroid nodules. Fortunately, the overwhelming majority of solitary nodules of the thyroid prove to be either benign adenomas or localized, non-neoplastic conditions (e.g., a dominant nodule in multinodular goiter, simple cysts, or foci of thyroiditis). Carcinomas of the thyroid, by contrast, are uncommon, accounting for less than 1% of solitary thyroid nodules. Several clinical criteria provide a clue to the nature of a given thyroid nodule: Solitary nodules, in general, are more likely to be neoplastic than are multiple nodules. Nodules in very young (<20 years) or very old (>70 years) individuals are more likely to be neoplastic. Nodules in males are more likely to be neoplastic than are those in females."

Using ultrasound, nodules are present in up to 50% of adults, with the majority being <1 cm in diameter. Thyroid nodules may be solitary or multiple, and they may be functional or nonfunctional."
