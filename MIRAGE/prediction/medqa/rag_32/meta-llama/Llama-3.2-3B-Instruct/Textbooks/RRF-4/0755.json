    "question": "A 31-year-old G1-P0 woman at 28-weeks gestation presents with shortness of breath and nonspecific right-sided chest pain that is worse with inspiration. She works as a graduate student at the local university, and she informs you that she recently returned to the west coast from a trip to New York for an Economics conference. Her medical history is positive only for frequent bouts of sinusitis. She currently denies any smoking, drinks a glass of red wine/day, and she denies any past illicit drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 87/min, and respiratory rate 23/min. Her physical examination shows decreased air movement throughout the right lung but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur, and a gravid uterus without acute findings. On physical examination, she is afebrile, tachycardic to 121/min, normotensive, and demonstrates an O2 saturation of 92%. Which of the following is the best next step in the evaluation of the most likely diagnosis for this patient?",

These symptoms, combined with a history of frequent sinusitis and recent travel to New York, suggest a pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's physical examination findings, such as tachycardia and decreased oxygen saturation, also support this diagnosis. The best next step in the evaluation of the most likely diagnosis is to order a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA), which is a sensitive and specific test for diagnosing pulmonary embolism. An ECG (Option A) may show nonspecific findings, and chest radiography (Option B) may not be sensitive enough to detect smaller PE. A V/Q scan (Option C) is also not as sensitive as CTPA. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to order a CTPA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" } ``` The reasoning behind this choice is as follows: * The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, and decreased air movement throughout the right lung, combined with her history of frequent sinusitis and recent travel, suggest a pulmonary embolism (PE). * The physical examination findings, such as tachycardia and decreased oxygen saturation, also support this diagnosis. * A CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the most sensitive and specific test for diagnosing pulmonary embolism, making it the best next step in the evaluation of this patient. * An ECG may show nonspecific findings and is not as sensitive as CTPA. * Chest radiography may not be sensitive enough to detect smaller PE. * A V/Q scan is also not as sensitive as CTPA. Note: The patient's pregnancy status is also an important consideration, but it does not change the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient.",

Inability of the patient to speak in full sentences before stopping to get a deep breath suggests a condition that leads to stimulation of the controller or impairment of the ventilatory pump with reduced vital capacity. Evidence of increased work of breathing (supraclavicular retractions; use of accessory muscles of ventilation; and the tripod position, characterized by sitting with the hands braced on the knees) is indicative of increased airway resistance or stiffness of the lungs and the chest wall. When measuring the vital signs, the physician should accurately assess the respiratory rate and measure the pulsus paradoxus (Chap. 288); if the systolic pressure decreases by >10 mmHg, the presence of COPD, acute asthma, or pericardial disease should be considered. During the general examination, signs of anemia (pale conjunctivae), cyanosis, and cirrhosis (spider angiomata, gynecomastia) should be sought."

She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

Patient A (blue) has mean blood pressures near the 20th percentile throughout pregnancy. Patient B (red) has a similar pattern with mean pressures at the 25th percentile until approximately 36 weeks when her blood pressure begins to rise.

These begin to rise in patient B, who by term has substantively higher blood pressures. However, her pressures are still < 140/90 mm Hg, and thus she is considered to be \"normotensive.\" We use the term delta hypertension to describe this rather acute rise in blood pressure. Some of these women will go on to have obvious preeclampsia, and some even develop eclamptic seizures or HELLP (hemolysis, devatedliver enzyme levels, low 2latelet count) syndrome while still normotensive."

In others, nonspecific indings may include atelectasis, an iniltrate, cardiomegaly, or an efusion (Pollack, 2011). Vascular markings in the lung region supplied by the obstructed artery can be lost. Although most women are hypoxemic, a normal arterial blood gas analysis does not exclude pulmonary embolism. Approximatelyaa third of young patients have P02 values >SO mm Hg. hus, the alveolar-arterial oxygen tension diference is a more useful indicator of disease. More than S6 percent of patients with acute pulmonary embolism will have an alveolar-arterial diference >20 mm Hg (Lockwood, 2012). Even with massive pulmonary embolism, signs, symptoms, and laboratory data to support the diagnosis may be deceptively nonspecific."

Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus.
