    "question": "A 74-year-old woman is brought to her primary care doctor by her adult son. The son says she has been very difficult at home and is \"losing it\". He seems very frustrated about her diminishing ability to take care of herself the way she used to and no longer thinks he can trust her watching his children. At her last visit you noted mild cognitive impairment. Today, she appears withdrawn and hesitates to make eye-contact with you. She lets her son do most of the talking. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Discuss with the son the challenges of having a parent with dementia",
        "B": "Complete a mini-mental exam",

        "D": "Ask the son to step out so you can speak with the patient alone"

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of dementia, as indicated by her withdrawn behavior, hesitation to make eye contact, and her son's concerns about her diminishing ability to care for herself. The patient's son is also expressing frustration and worry about the patient's condition. The patient's history of mild cognitive impairment noted at her previous visit suggests a progression of her condition. The most appropriate next step is to assess the patient's cognitive function to confirm the diagnosis of dementia and to evaluate the severity of her cognitive impairment. This can be done by completing a mini-mental exam, which is a standardized test used to evaluate cognitive function, particularly in older adults. This will also provide valuable information to guide further management and treatment of the patient's condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Crises should be preempted by regular contact with a general physician. If the dementia is slight and circumstances are suitable, patients should remain at home for the first years, continuing to engage in those accustomed activities of which they are capable. They should be spared responsibility and guarded against injury that might result from imprudent action, such as leaving a stove turned on or driving and getting lost\u2014or worse. If they are still at work, plans for occupational retirement should be carried out. In more advanced stages of the disease, when mental and physical enfeeblement become pronounced, a skilled nursing facility or supervised home care should be arranged. In the advanced stages of dementia, as reviewed by Mitchell, feeding tubes are probably not a wise choice and hospice and palliative care may be employed to good benefit."

Proper names are no longer remembered and cannot be recalled with time, to a far greater extent than can be attributed to mild cognitive impairment.

When such patients are calmed by reassurance and encouraged to try harder, their mental function improves, indicating that intellectual deterioration has not occurred. Conversely, it is helpful to remember that demented patients in the mid-stages of the process infrequently have sufficient insight to complain of mental deterioration; if they admit to poor memory, they do so without conviction or full appreciation of the degree of their disability. The physician must not rely on the patient\u2019s statements alone in gauging the efficiency of mental function and should seek corroboration from family members. Yet another problem is that of the impulsive, cantankerous, and quarrelsome patient who is a constant source of distress to employer and family.

Medical workup including complete blood cell count, thyroid func-tion tests, and a chemistry panel reveals no abnormalities. She is started on fluoxetine for a presumed major depressive episode and referred for cognitive behavioral psychotherapy.

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula.

The manner in which the patient tells the story of his illness may betray confusion or incoherence in thinking, impairment of memory or judgment, or difficulty in comprehending or expressing ideas. A more extensive examination of attention, memory, cognitive ability, and language is undertaken if the history or the manner in which it is given indicates the problem lies in those spheres. Otherwise, asking the date and place, repeating and recalling words, and simple arithmetic are adequate screening procedures. One then proceeds from an examination of the cranial nerves to the testing of motor, reflex, and sensory functions of the upper and lower limbs. This is followed by an assessment of gait and station (standing position) are observed before or after the rest of the examination."
