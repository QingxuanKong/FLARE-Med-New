This clinical presentation is highly suggestive of lichen planus, which is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects the skin, mucous membranes, and other tissues. Lichen planus is characterized by the presence of purplish, polygonal papules and plaques, and can affect various parts of the body. The oral lesions in lichen planus are typically found on the buccal mucosa, tongue, and lips, and can be painful. The patient's symptoms of fatigue and joint pain are also common in lichen planus. Given these symptoms, the most likely finding on further evaluation would be a decreased lymphocyte count, as lichen planus is often associated with immunosuppression and lymphopenia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Although called adenoma sebaceum, these nodules are actually angiofibromas; the sebaceous glands are only passively involved (Fig. 37-5). Typically they are red to pink nodules with a smooth, glistening surface, and they tend to be limited to the nasolabial folds, cheeks, and chin; sometimes they also involve the forehead and scalp. The earliest manifestation of facial angiofibromatosis may be a mild erythema over the cheeks and forehead that is intensified by crying. The occurrence of large plaques of connective tissue on the forehead is usually expressive of a severe form of the disease."

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common, chronic disorder characterized by greasy scales overlying erythematous patches or plaques. Induration and scale are generally less prominent than in psoriasis, but clinical overlap exists between these diseases (\u201csebopsoriasis\u201d). The most common location is in the scalp, where it may be recognized as severe dandruff. On the face, seborrheic dermatitis affects the eyebrows, eyelids, glabella, and nasolabial folds (Fig. 71-4). Scaling of the external auditory canal is common in seborrheic dermatitis. In addition, the postauricular areas often become macerated and tender. Seborrheic dermatitis may also develop in the central chest, axilla, groin, submammary folds, and gluteal cleft. Rarely, it may cause widespread generalized dermatitis. Pruritus is variable."

Because they have an affected son, both the biological father and mother must be carriers for this disease. The affected son must have inherited a mutant allele from each parent. Because he shows only the 3kilobase (kb) band on the Southern blot, the mutant allele for this disease must be linked to the 3-kb band. The normal allele must be linked to the 4-kb band, and because the daughter inherited only the 4-kb band, she must be homozygous normal for the hexosaminidase A gene. 4.3. A physician would like to determine the global patterns of gene expression in two different types of tumor cells in order to develop the most appropriate form of chemotherapy for each patient. Which of the following techniques would be most appropriate for this purpose? A. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay B. Microarray"
