    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best pharmacological treatment for this patient's insomnia, we need to consider her symptoms and medical history. She has difficulty initiating sleep, frequent nighttime awakenings, and excessive daytime sleepiness, which are all characteristic of insomnia. She is also experiencing anxiety and worry about losing her job, which may be contributing to her sleep problems. Considering her age and symptoms, we should focus on medications that target insomnia and anxiety. First, let's evaluate the options: A. Chlordiazepoxide is a benzodiazepine, which can be effective for short-term treatment of insomnia but has a high potential for dependence and withdrawal. Given the patient's concern about losing her job, this may not be the best choice. B. Triazolam is also a benzodiazepine and has a similar risk of dependence and withdrawal as chlordiazepoxide. It's primarily used for short-term treatment of insomnia and may not be the best option for this patient. C. Diazepam is another benzodiazepine with a high risk of dependence and withdrawal. While it can be effective for insomnia, its potential for abuse and dependence makes it less desirable for long-term treatment. D. Modafinil is a non-benzodiazepine that targets the histamine system to increase alertness and wakefulness. It's often used off-label for treatment of insomnia, especially in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness. Given the patient's symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness and anxiety, modafinil may be an effective treatment option. Considering the patient's anxiety and worry about losing her job, modafinil may also have an anxiolytic effect, which could complement its sleep-promoting effects. Additionally, modafinil has a lower risk of dependence and withdrawal compared to benzodiazepines. Therefore, the best pharmacological treatment for this patient's insomnia would be Modafinil.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The assessment should focus on identifying predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors. Psychophysiologic Factors Many patients with insomnia have negative expectations and conditioned arousal that interfere with sleep. These individuals may worry about their insomnia during the day and have increasing anxiety as bedtime approaches if they anticipate a poor night of sleep. While attempting to sleep, they may frequently check the clock, which only heightens anxiety and frustration. They may find it easier to sleep in a new environment rather than their bedroom, as it lacks the negative associations."

In contrast, depressive illness produces early morning waking and inability to return to sleep; the quantity of sleep is reduced, and nocturnal motility is increased. REM sleep in depression, although not always reduced, comes earlier in the night. If anxiety is combined with depression, there is a tendency for both the above patterns to be observed. Yet another common pattern of disturbed sleep can be discerned in individuals who are under great tension and worry or are overworked and tired out. These people sink into bed and sleep through sheer exhaustion, but they awaken early with their worries and are unable to get back to sleep."

Thus, excessive attention and efforts to sleep, which override normal sleep-onset mechanisms, may contribute to the development of in- somnia.

Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of \u201closs of vision.\u201d Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver\u2019s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

Her mother states that she has used her albuterol inhaler several times a day for the past 3 days and twice during the previous night. She took an additional two puffs on her way to the emergency department, but her mother states that \u201cthe inhaler didn\u2019t seem to be helping so I told her not to take any more.\u201d What emergency measures are indicated? How should her long-term management be altered? A 14-year-old girl with a history of asthma requiring daily inhaled corticosteroid therapy and allergies to house dust mites, cats, grasses, and ragweed presents to the emergency department in mid-September, reporting a recent \u201ccold\u201d com-plicated by worsening shortness of breath and audible inspi-ratory and expiratory wheezing.

            "content": "Other Causes of Secondary Insomnia Among the secondary insomnias, those caused by some type of psychologic disturbance are particularly common. Domestic or business worries may keep the patient\u2019s mind in turmoil (situational insomnia). A strange bed or unfamiliar surroundings may prevent drowsiness and sleep. Under these circumstances, the main difficulty is in falling asleep, with a tendency to sleep late in the morning. These facts emphasize that conditioning and environmental factors (social and learned) are normally involved in readying the mind and body for sleep."
