    "question": "A 64-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with a complaint of bilateral knee pain that has been present for the past several years but has worsened recently. He reports pain with climbing stairs and with extended walks of greater than 100 yards. The pain worsens with activity throughout the day and is alleviated by periods of rest. He states that he has minimal morning stiffness, lasting approximately 5-10 minutes after waking up most days. Physical examination reveals tenderness to palpation of the bony structures on the medial aspect of the bilateral knees as well as crepitus and a decreased range of motion, limited at the extremes of flexion and extension. Both knee joints are cool to touch and exhibit bony enlargement upon palpation of the medial joint line. Which of the following studies would be indicated for further work-up of this patient's presenting condition?",

The tenderness to palpation of the bony structures on the medial aspect of the bilateral knees, crepitus, and decreased range of motion are also consistent with OA. The minimal morning stiffness lasting 5-10 minutes after waking up is also consistent with OA. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is osteoarthritis (OA) of the knees. Given the clinical presentation, the next step would be to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of joint damage. An MRI of the knee would be an appropriate choice for further work-up as it can provide detailed images of the joint and surrounding soft tissues, helping to confirm the diagnosis of OA and assess the extent of joint damage. The other options, such as a complete blood count (CBC) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), may be useful in ruling out other conditions, but they are not as specific for OA as an MRI. No further work-up is not indicated as the clinical presentation is consistent with OA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

            "content": "OA is the most common cause of chronic knee pain in persons over age 45, but the differential diagnosis is long. Inflammatory arthritis is likely if there is prolonged morning stiffness and many other joints are affected. Bursitis occurs commonly around knees and hips. A physical examination should focus on whether tenderness is over the joint line (at the junction of the two bones around which the joint is articulating) or is outside of it. Anserine bursitis, medial and distal to the knee, is an extremely common cause of chronic knee pain that may respond to a glucocorticoid injection. Prominent nocturnal pain in the absence of end-stage OA merits a distinct workup. For hip pain, OA can be detected by loss of internal rotation on passive movement, and pain isolated to an area lateral to the hip joint usually reflects the presence of trochanteric bursitis. No blood tests are routinely indicated for workup of patients with OA unless symptoms and signs suggest inflammatory arthritis."

A careful history should delineate the chronology of the knee complaint and whether there are predisposing conditions, trauma, or medications that might underlie the complaint. For example, patellofemoral disease (e.g., OA) may cause anterior knee pain that worsens with climbing stairs. Observation of the patient\u2019s gait is also important. The knee should be carefully inspected in the upright (weight-bearing) and supine positions for swelling, erythema, malalignment, visible trauma, muscle wasting, and leg length discrepancy. The most common malalignment in the knee is genu varum (bowlegs) or genu valgum (knock-knees) resulting from asymmetric cartilage loss medially or laterally. Bony swelling of the knee joint commonly results from hypertrophic osseous changes seen with disorders such as OA and neuropathic arthropathy."

For an older person whose daily constitutionals up and down hills bring on knee pain, routing the constitutional away from hills might eliminate symptoms.

These treatments have the potential to decrease symptoms and improve function and quality of life. For example, holding a cane on the opposite side of the symptomatic extremity reduces the forces across the hip joint and subsequently decreases hip pain (Fig. 43-36). In nearly all cases, it is best to treat patients nonoperatively prior to recommending surgery.Health and exercise can also play a role in the prevention of arthritis. Weight loss of as little as 11 lbs (5 kg) has been shown to decrease the risk of developing knee"

Examples include knee or hip pain with going up or down stairs, pain in weight-bearing joints when walking, and, for hand OA, pain when cooking. Early in disease, pain is episodic, triggered often by a day or two of overactive useofadiseasedjoint,suchasapersonwithkneeOAtakingalongrun and noticing a few days of pain thereafter. As disease progresses, the pain becomes continuous and even begins to be bothersome at night. Stiffness of the affected joint may be prominent, but morning stiffness is usually brief (<30 min)."

The examiner should note that this maneuver is only effective in detecting small to moderate effusions (<100 mL). Inflammatory disorders such as RA, gout, pseudogout, and psoriatic arthritis may involve the knee joint and produce significant pain, stiffness, swelling, or warmth. A popliteal or Baker\u2019s cyst may be palpated with the knee partially flexed and is best viewed posteriorly with the patient standing and knees fully extended to visualize isolated or unilateral popliteal swelling or fullness. Anserine bursitis is an often missed periarticular cause of knee pain in adults. The pes anserine bursa underlies the insertion of the conjoined tendons (sartorius, gracilis, semitendinosus) on the anteromedial proximal tibia and may be painful following trauma, overuse, or inflammation. It is often"

The flexed hip will have internal rotation increased to 80\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 (normal 60\u00b0 to 70\u00b0) and external rotation limited to about 10\u00b0.

The pain may additionally have a restricted radiation into the buttocks and posterior thigh, thereby simulating root compression. There are no motor, sensory, or reflex abnormalities. Imaging usually reveals some combination of osteoarthropathy, changes in vertebral discs, osteoarthritic changes in apophyseal joints, and sometimes osteoporosis or slight spondylosis, or they may be entirely normal. Treatment with short-duration bed rest, analgesics, and physiotherapy, as outlined for acute strains, helps to relieve the symptoms, and the majority of patients recover within a few weeks, only to have a recurrence of similar pains in the future."

He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"
