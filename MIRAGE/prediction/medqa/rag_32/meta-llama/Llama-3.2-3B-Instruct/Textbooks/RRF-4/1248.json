The CT scan of the chest is not explicitly described, but the presence of lymphadenopathy and the biopsy results suggest a diagnosis of lymphoma, specifically Hodgkin lymphoma. The biopsy specimen shows organized epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without focal necrosis, which is consistent with a diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma typically involves a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The initial treatment should include corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and prevent organ damage, followed by an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen and radiation therapy. Among the options provided, prednisone is a corticosteroid that can be used to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system, making it a suitable choice for initial treatment. Isoniazid is an antitubercular agent, which is not indicated in this case. Cisplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy agent that can be used in the treatment of lymphoma, but it is not typically used as the initial treatment. Lamivudine is an antiviral agent that is used to treat HIV, but it is not indicated in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

The medical history should reveal the setting in which lymphadenopathy is occurring. Symptoms such as sore throat, cough, fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, or pain in the nodes should be sought. The patient\u2019s age, sex, occupation, exposure to pets, sexual behavior, and use of drugs such as diphenylhydantoin are other important historic points. For example, children and young adults usually have benign (i.e., nonmalignant) disorders that account for the observed lymphadenopathy such as viral or bacterial upper respiratory infections; infectious mononucleosis; toxoplasmosis; and, in some countries, tuberculosis. In contrast, after age 50, the incidence of malignant disorders increases and that of benign disorders decreases."

Review of the past history and growth chart demonstrates normal birth weight and birth length, but a progressive decrease in height per-centiles relative to age-matched normal ranges starting at 6 months of age, and orthostasis with febrile illnesses. Physical examination demonstrates short stature and mild generalized obesity. Genital examination reveals descended but small testes and a phallic length of \u20132 SD. Laboratory evaluations demonstrate growth hormone (GH) deficiency and a delayed bone age of 18 months. The patient is started on replacement with recombinant human GH at a dose of 40 mcg/kg per day subcutaneously. After 1 year of treatment, his height velocity has increased from 5 cm/y to 11 cm/y. How does GH stimulate growth in children? What other hormone deficiencies are sug-gested by the patient\u2019s history and physical examination? What"

Chest x-rays or CT scans may be normal but generally show increased bronchovascular markings. Diffuse miliary lesions or mottled opacities may be present in the middle and lower lung fields. Tests of pulmonary function show restrictive abnormalities in most cases and obstructive defects in half. Characteristically, total serum IgE levels (4\u201340 KIU/ mL) and antifilarial antibody titers are markedly elevated."

However, in up to 90% of cases, cough eventually develops\u2014often initially nonproductive and limited to the morning and subsequently accompanied by the production of purulent sputum, sometimes with blood streaking. Hemoptysis develops in 20\u201330% of cases, and massive hemoptysis may ensue as a consequence of the erosion of a blood vessel in the wall of a cavity. Hemoptysis, however, may also result from rupture of a dilated vessel in a cavity (Rasmussen\u2019s aneurysm) or from aspergilloma formation in an old cavity. Pleuritic chest pain sometimes develops in patients with subpleural parenchymal lesions or pleural disease. Extensive disease may produce dyspnea and, in rare instances, adult respiratory distress syndrome. Physical findings are of limited use in pulmonary TB. Many"

            "content": "Conjunctival inoculation can result in infection of the eye, with regional lymph node enlargement (preauricular lymphadenopathy, Parinaud\u2019s complex). Aerosolization and inhalation or hematogenous spread of organisms can result in pneumonia. In the lung, an inflammatory reaction develops, including foci of alveolar necrosis and cell infiltration (initially polymorphonuclear and later mononuclear) with granulomas. Chest roentgenograms usually reveal bilateral patchy infiltrates rather than large areas of consolidation. Pleural effusions are common and may contain blood. Lymphadenopathy occurs in regions draining infected organs. Therefore, in pulmonary infection, mediastinal adenopathy may be evident, whereas patients with oropharyngeal tularemia develop cervical lymphadenopathy. In gastrointestinal or typhoidal tularemia, mesenteric lymphadenopathy may follow the ingestion of large numbers of organisms. (The term typhoidal tularemia may be used to describe severe bacteremic disease,"

A 44-year-old woman had been recently diagnosed with melanoma on the toe and underwent a series of investigations. Melanoma (properly called malignant melanoma) can be an aggressive form of skin cancer that spreads to lymph nodes and multiple other organs throughout the body. The malignant potential is dependent upon its cellular configuration and also the depth of its penetration through the skin. The patient developed malignant melanoma in the foot, which spread to the lymph nodes of the groin. The inguinal lymph nodes were resected; however, it was noted on follow-up imaging that the patient had developed two metastatic lesions within the right lobe of the liver. Surgeons and physicians considered the possibility of removing these lesions. A CT scan was performed that demonstrated the lesions within segments V and VI of the liver (Fig. 4.186)."

Amphotericin B is the treatment of choice if moderate symptoms persist for 2 to 4 weeks or if the illness is extensive, including dyspnea and hypoxia, and if patients are immunosuppressed.110As the pulmonary infiltrates from acute histoplasmosis heal, consolidation into an asymptomatic solitary nodule or histoplasmoma may occur and is usually seen incidentally on radiographs as a coin-shaped lesion. Central and concentric calcification may occur; if so, no further treatment is required. Noncalcification of the lesion requires further diagnostic workup including chest CT scan, needle biopsy, or surgical excision to rule out a malignancy. Figure 19-34 demonstrates the differ-ences in pathologic findings between infections in normal and immunocompromised hosts.111When lymph nodes and pulmonary granulomas calcify over time, pressure atrophy on the bronchial"
