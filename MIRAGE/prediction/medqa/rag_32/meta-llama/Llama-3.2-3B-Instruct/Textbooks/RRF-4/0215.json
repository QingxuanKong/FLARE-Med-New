He does not complain of any pain during urination. He is frustrated that he has to wake up 2 or 3 times per night to urinate even though he tried reducing the amount of water he consumes before bed and made some other dietary changes without any improvement. He has no family history of prostate disease. Physical examination is negative for any suprapubic mass or tenderness, and there is no costovertebral angle tenderness.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with increased urinary frequency and decreased urine volumes without any pain during urination. This suggests an issue with the bladder's ability to hold urine, which could be related to an overactive bladder or an obstructive cause. Given the lack of pain during urination, an obstructive cause such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is less likely. The next step should be to investigate the bladder's function and rule out any underlying conditions that may be causing the symptoms. A urinalysis and serum creatinine level would provide information on the patient's urine output and kidney function, which would be essential in determining the best course of action. This information will help to distinguish between overactive bladder and other conditions that may be causing the symptoms. Reassurance would not be appropriate as the patient is experiencing significant distress due to the symptoms. A digital rectal examination may be useful in evaluating for BPH, but it would not be the best next step without further investigation. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing may be useful in evaluating for prostate cancer, but it is not directly related to the patient's primary symptoms of urinary frequency and decreased urine volumes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

On direct questioning the patient indicated that the pain was in the inguinal region and radiated posteriorly into his left infrascapular region (loin). A urine dipstick was positive for blood (hematuria). A diagnosis of a ureteric stone (calculus) was made. The patient\u2019s initial infrascapular pain, which later radiated to the left groin, relates to passage of the ureteric stone along the ureter. The origin of the pain relates to ureteral distention. A series of peristaltic waves along the ureter transport urine along the length of the ureter from the kidney to the bladder. As the ureteric stone obstructs the kidney, the ureter becomes distended, resulting in an exacerbation of the pain. The peristaltic waves are superimposed upon the distention, resulting in periods of exacerbation and periods of relief."

A series of training exercises designed to increase the functional bladder capacity and sphincter tone may also be helpful. Sometimes all that is required is to proscribe fluid intake for several hours prior to sleep and to awaken the patient and have him empty his bladder about 3 h after going to sleep. One interesting patient, an elderly physician with lifelong enuresis, reported that he had finally obtained relief (after all other measures had failed) by using a nasal spray of an analogue of antidiuretic hormone (desmopressin) at bedtime.

Owing to the more central hypertrophic change of the prostate, the urethra is compressed, and a urinary outflow obstruction develops in a number of patients.

Renal colic is a misnomer because pain typically does not subside completely; rather, it varies in intensity.

This pain, which is accompanied often by nausea and occasionally by vomiting, may radiate, depending on the location of the stone. If the stone lodges in the upper part of the ureter, pain may radiate anteriorly; if the stone is in the lower part of the ureter, pain can radiate to the ipsilateral testicle in men or the ipsilateral labium in women.

She drinks decaffeinated coffee but only one cup in the morning; however, she drinks as many as six cans per day of diet cola. She drinks a glass of wine with her evening meal but does not like stronger spirits. What other aspects of this patient\u2019s history would you like to know? What therapeutic measures are appropriate for this patient? What drug, or drugs, (if any) would you prescribe? At her annual physical examination, a 53-year-old middle school teacher complains that she has been having difficulty falling asleep, and after falling asleep, she awakens several times during the night. These episodes now occur almost nightly and are interfering with her ability to teach. She has tried various over-the-counter sleep remedies, but they were of little help and she experienced \u201changover\u201d effects on the day following their use. Her general health is good, she is"

A 50-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with severe lower back pain that had started several days ago. In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."

If the volume exceeds 50 mL/kg per day (3500 mL in a 70-kg male) and the osmolarity is below 300 mosmol/L, DI is confirmed and the patient should be evaluated further to determine the type in order to select the appropriate therapy."

            "content": "BPH is a pathologic process that contributes to the development of lower urinary tract symptoms in men. Such symptoms, arising from lower urinary tract dysfunction, are further subdivided into obstructive symptoms (urinary hesitancy, straining, weak stream, terminal dribbling, prolonged voiding, incomplete emptying) and irritative symptoms (urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, urge incontinence, small voided volumes). Lower urinary tract symptoms and other sequelae of BPH are not just due to a mass effect, but are also likely due to a combination of the prostatic enlargement and age-related detrusor dysfunction."
