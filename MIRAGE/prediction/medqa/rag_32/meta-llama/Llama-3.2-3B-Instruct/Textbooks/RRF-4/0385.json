    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the given information and think about the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the context of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The patient has chronic HBV infection, hepatomegaly, and an elevated \\u00b1-fetoprotein (AFP) level of 380 ng/ml, which is significantly above the normal limit of < 10 ng/mL. The CT scan shows a solitary mass in the left lobe of the liver that enhances in the arterial phase, which is a characteristic feature of HCC. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with HCC, and the most likely underlying pathogenesis is the integration of foreign DNA into the host genome. HBV DNA can integrate into the host genome and cause mutations that lead to oncogenesis. This is a well-established mechanism of HBV-related HCC. The other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of HCC in HBV infection. Overexpression of secretory hepatitis antigen (A) is not a known mechanism of HCC development. Intracellular accumulation of misfolded protein (B) is a mechanism of protein misfolding diseases, but not directly related to HBV infection. Gain of function mutation of a proto-oncogene (C) is a mechanism of cancer development, but not specific to HBV infection. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

Review of the past history and growth chart demonstrates normal birth weight and birth length, but a progressive decrease in height per-centiles relative to age-matched normal ranges starting at 6 months of age, and orthostasis with febrile illnesses. Physical examination demonstrates short stature and mild generalized obesity. Genital examination reveals descended but small testes and a phallic length of \u20132 SD. Laboratory evaluations demonstrate growth hormone (GH) deficiency and a delayed bone age of 18 months. The patient is started on replacement with recombinant human GH at a dose of 40 mcg/kg per day subcutaneously. After 1 year of treatment, his height velocity has increased from 5 cm/y to 11 cm/y. How does GH stimulate growth in children? What other hormone deficiencies are sug-gested by the patient\u2019s history and physical examination? What"

As noted above, the onset of the disease tends to be insidious in most patients, with the exception of the very few in whom chronic disease follows failure of resolution of clinically apparent acute hepatitis B. The clinical and laboratory features associated with progression from acute to chronic hepatitis B are discussed in Chap. 360."

            "content": "Laboratory features of autoimmune hepatitis are similar to those seen in chronic viral hepatitis. Liver biochemical tests are invariably abnormal but may not correlate with the clinical severity or histopathologic features in individual cases. Many patients with autoimmune hepatitis have normal serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and globulin levels with only minimal aminotransferase elevations. Serum AST and ALT levels are increased and fluctuate in the range of 100\u22121000 units. In severe cases, the serum bilirubin level is moderately elevated (51\u2212171 \u03bcmol/L [3\u221210 mg/dL]). Hypoalbuminemia occurs in patients with very active or advanced disease. Serum alkaline phosphatase levels may be moderately elevated or near normal. In a small proportion of patients, marked elevations of alkaline phosphatase activity occur; in such patients, clinical and laboratory features overlap with those of primary biliary cirrhosis (Chap. 365). The prothrombin time is often prolonged, particularly late in"

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

Measurement of the prothrombin time (PT) is important in patients with acute viral hepatitis, because a prolonged value may reflect a severe hepatic synthetic defect, signify extensive hepatocellular necrosis, and indicate a worse prognosis. Occasionally, a prolonged PT may occur with only mild increases in the serum bilirubin and aminotransferase levels. Prolonged nausea and vomiting, inadequate carbohydrate intake, and poor hepatic glycogen reserves may contribute to hypoglycemia noted occasionally in patients with severe viral hepatitis. Serum alkaline phosphatase may be normal or only mildly elevated, whereas a fall in serum albumin is uncommon in uncomplicated acute viral hepatitis. In some patients, mild and transient steatorrhea has been noted, as well as slight microscopic hematuria and minimal proteinuria."
