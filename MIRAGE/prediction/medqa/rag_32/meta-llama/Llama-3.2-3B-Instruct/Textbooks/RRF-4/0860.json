Thirty minutes after delivery, the mother\u2019s blood pressure drops to 80/60 mm Hg and her pulse is 124/min. On physical examination, her distal extremities are clammy and cold, and the uterus is boggy. Aggressive fluid resuscitation is initiated. After administering 4 units of IV fluids and 4 units of whole blood, her vitals stabilize. The next morning, she says she is unable to lactate when she tries to breastfeed her child. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the failure of lactation in this patient?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely cause of the failure of lactation in this patient, we need to analyze the given clinical scenario and the provided options. The patient delivered a baby at term with good Apgar scores, but 30 minutes after delivery, she experienced a significant drop in blood pressure and a rapid heart rate, indicating possible shock. After aggressive fluid resuscitation, her vitals stabilized. The next morning, she reported being unable to lactate when trying to breastfeed her child. This suggests that the issue is not related to the initial shock or fluid resuscitation. The options provided are pituitary tumor, remains of placenta in uterus, pituitary infarction, and pituitary hemorrhage. Pituitary tumors are not directly related to lactation failure after delivery. Remains of placenta in the uterus can cause uterine atony, but this would not directly affect lactation. Pituitary infarction and hemorrhage can both affect hormone production, including prolactin, which is essential for lactation. Prolactin levels are usually elevated during the postpartum period to stimulate milk production. A pituitary infarction or hemorrhage could disrupt this process, leading to lactation failure. However, the timing and presentation of the patient's symptoms suggest a more acute event rather than a gradual decline in prolactin production. Therefore, the most likely cause of the failure of lactation in this patient is a pituitary hemorrhage, which can occur during the postpartum period, especially in the context of severe blood loss or shock. This would explain the acute onset of lactation failure after delivery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Although utero tonics are administered, postpartum hemorrhage as the result of uterine atony is most likely at this time. Hematomas may expand. Consequently, uterine tone and the perineum are frequently evaluated. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (20 17b) recommend that maternal blood pressure and pulse be recorded immediately after delivery and every 15 minutes for the first 2 hours. The placenta, membranes, and umbilical cord are examined for completeness and for anomalies, as described in Chapter 6 (p. 111)."

If urine output falls below 30 mLlhr, however, the woman should be reevaluated promptly. The cause of the oliguria can range from unrecognized blood loss to an antidiuretic efect from infused oxytocin. Women undergoing unscheduled cesarean delivery may have pathological retention or constriction of the extracellular fluid compartment caused by severe preeclampsia, sepsis syndrome, vomiting, prolonged labor without adequate fluid intake, or increased blood loss. Women with these complications are generally observed in the recovery room until stabilization is assured."

If less has been lost at delivery, blood volume generally nearly returns to its nonpregnant level by 1 week after delivery. Cardiac output usually remains elevated for 24 to 48 hours postpartum and declines to nonpregnant values by 10 days (Robson, 1987). Heart rate changes follow this pattern, and blood pressure similarly returns to nonpregnant values (Fig. 36-4). Correspondingly, systemic vascular resistance remains in the lower range characteristic of pregnancy for 2 days postpartum and then begins to steadily increase to normal nonpregnant values (Hibbard, 2014). Despite this, Morris and coworkers (2015) found that reduced arterial stifness persists following pregnancy. They suggest a signiicant favorable"

            "content": "Another scenario is that the postterm fetus may continue to gain weight and thus be unusually large at birth. This at least suggests that placental function is not severely compromised. Indeed, continued fetal growth is the norm-albeit at a slower rate beginning at 37 completed weeks (Fig. 43-3). Nahum and colleagues (1995) conirmed that fetal growth continues until at least 42 weeks. However, Link and associates (2007) showed that umbilical blood low did not increase concomitantly. The principal reasons for increased risks to postterm fetuses were described by Leveno and associates (1984). Both antepartum fetal jeopardy and intrapartum fetal distress were found to be the consequence of cord compression associated with oligohydramnios. In their analysis of 727 postterm pregnancies, intrapartum fetal distress detected with electronic monitoring was not associated with late decelerations characteristic of uteroplacental insuiciency.

Instead, experiences illustrate that maternal outcome depends on the diligence with which adequate luid and blood replacement therapy are pursued rather than on the interval to delivery. Observations from Parkland Hospital described by Pritchard and Brekken (1967) are similar to those from the University of Virginia reported by Brame and associates (1968). Specifically, women with severe abruption who were transfused during 18 hours or more before delivery had similar outcomes to those in whom delivery was accomplished sooner.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

In some women, external bleeding can be profuse, yet placental separation may not be so extensive as to compromise the fetus. In others, there may be no external bleeding, but the placenta is suiciently sheared of that the fetus is dead-a concealed abruption. In one unusual case, a multiparous woman cared for at Parkland Hospital presented with a nosebleed. She had no abdominal or uterine pain, tenderness, or vaginal bleeding. Her fetus was dead, however, and her blood did not clot. he plasma ibrinogen level was 25 mg/dL. Labor was induced, and a total abruption was conirmed at delivery."

Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice?

            "content": "In most cases, bearing down is reflexive and spontaneous during second-stage labor. Occasionally, a woman may not employ her expulsive forces to good advantage and coaching is desirable. Her legs should be half-flexed so that she can push with them against the mattress. When the next uterine contraction begins, she is instructed to exert downward pressure as though she were straining at stool. A woman is not encouraged to push beyond the completion of each contraction. Instead, she and her fetus are allowed to rest and recover. During this period of actively bearing down, the fetal heart rate auscultated during the contraction is likely to be slow but should recover to normal range before the next expulsive efort. Fetal and obstetrical outcomes appear to be unafected whether pushing is coached or uncoached during second-stage labor (Bloom, 2006; Tuuli, 2012). Bloom and colleagues (2006) studied efects of actively coaching expulsive eforts in women without epidural analgesia. hey"
