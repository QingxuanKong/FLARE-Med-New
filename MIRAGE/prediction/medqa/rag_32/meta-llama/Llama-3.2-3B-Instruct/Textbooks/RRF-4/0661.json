    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "After analyzing the provided documents, I can provide the following step-by-step thinking and answer: Step 1: The patient is a 3-year-old girl with symptoms of sweating and respiratory distress while eating, which suggests a cardiac issue that may be causing her distress. Step 2: The echocardiogram shows a defect in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum, which is a common location for a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Step 3: The moderately decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) indicates that the left ventricle is not pumping efficiently, which can be a consequence of a VSD. Step 4: Considering the location of the VSD (membranous portion of the interventricular septum) and the age of the patient, we can narrow down the possible types of VSDs. Step 5: The most common type of VSD in children is a ventricular septal defect (VSD) with a membranous or muscular component. However, the question specifically mentions the membranous portion of the interventricular septum. Step 6: Based on the location and type of VSD, the physical examination is most likely to show a systolic murmur that increases with forced expiration against a closed glottis, which is a characteristic of a left-to-right shunt VSD. Step 7: The options can be evaluated as follows: - A: Systolic murmur that increases with hand clenching is more characteristic of a pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary atresia. - B: Systolic murmur that increases with forced exhalation against a closed glottis is characteristic of a left-to-right shunt VSD, such as a membranous VSD. - C: Diastolic murmur preceded by an opening snap is more characteristic of mitral stenosis. - D: Continuous murmur that is loudest at the second heart sound is more characteristic of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) or a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Step 8: Based on the analysis, the correct answer is B: Systolic murmur that increases with forced exhalation against a closed glottis.

These defects are generally asymptomatic because there are few physiologic consequences. However, there is a long-term risk of endocarditis because endo-cardial damage from the jet of blood through the defect may serve as a possible nidus for colonization (Fig. 20-59A,B).Diagnosis. The child with a large VSD will present with severe congestive heart failure and frequent respiratory tract infections. Children with Eisenmenger\u2019s syndrome may be deceptively asymptomatic until frank cyanosis develops.The chest radiograph will show cardiomegaly and pulmo-nary overcirculation, and the ECG will show signs of left ven-tricular or biventricular hypertrophy.

Heart failure onset is most likely at the end of the second/beginning of the third trimester and peripartum (Ruys, 2014). Of symptoms, dyspnea is universal and others are orthopnea, palpitations, substernal chest pain, a sudden decline in the ability to complete usual duties, and nocturnal cough. Clinical findings include persistent basilar rales, hemoptysis, progressive edema, tachypnea, and tachycardia (Sheield, 1999). Hallmark radiographic findings usually are cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema (see Fig. 49-5). Acutely, there is usually systolic failure, and echocardiography shows an ejection fraction <0.45 or a fractional shortening <30 percent, or both, and an end-diastolic dimensionr> 2.7 cm/m2 (Hibbard, 1999). Coincidental diastolic failure may also be found, depending on the underlying cause (Redfield, 2016)."

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

A tumor plop is a lower-pitched sound that rarely can be heard in patients with atrial myxoma. It may be appreciated only in certain positions and arises from the diastolic prolapse of the tumor across the mitral valve. The third heart sound (S3) occurs during the rapid filling phase of ventricular diastole. It can be a normal finding in children, adolescents, and young adults; however, in older patients, it signifies heart failure. A left-sided S3 is a low-pitched sound best heard over the left ventricular (LV) apex. A right-sided S3 is usually better heard over the lower left sternal border and becomes louder with inspiration.

In valvular pulmonic stenosis with intact ventricular septum, right ventricular systolic ejection becomes progressively longer, with increasing obstruction to flow. As a result, the murmur becomes longer and louder, enveloping the aortic component of the second heart sound (A2). The pulmonic component (P2) occurs later, and splitting becomes wider but more difficult to hear because A2 is lost in the murmur and P2 becomes progressively fainter and lower pitched. As the pulmonic gradient increases, the isometric contraction phase shortens until the pulmonic valve ejection sound fuses with the first heart sound (S1). In severe pulmonic stenosis with concentric hypertrophy and decreasing right ventricular compliance, a fourth heart sound appears. Right. In tetralogy of Fallot with increasing obstruction at the pulmonic infundibular area, an increasing amount of right ventricular blood is shunted across the silent ventricular septal defect and flow across the obstructed"
