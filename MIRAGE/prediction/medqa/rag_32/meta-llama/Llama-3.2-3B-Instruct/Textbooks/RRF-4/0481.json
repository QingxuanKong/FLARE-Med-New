    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider how changing the HbA1c threshold from 6.5% to 7.0% would affect the diagnostic accuracy of diabetes mellitus. The HbA1c test is a measure of average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months. A value of 6.5% is currently used as the diagnostic threshold for diabetes, indicating that the average blood glucose levels are above this value. If the threshold is increased to 7.0%, it means that a higher average blood glucose level is required to be considered diagnostic of diabetes. This would result in a decrease in the number of true positive test results, as fewer individuals would meet the new threshold. On the other hand, the number of false positive test results would likely remain the same, as some individuals with normal blood glucose levels would still be classified as having diabetes. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Decrease in true positive test results.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Of these subtypes, hemoglobin type A1c is of clinical sig-nificance because it binds irreversibly to glucose. It is re-ferred to as glycated or glycosylated hemoglobin. Levels of this hemoglobin subtype are used to monitor an individual\u2019s blood glucose levels over the previous 2 to 3 months (clinically referred to as an A1c test). Individuals with diabetes have increased levels of glycated hemoglobin HbA1c in the blood because of their elevated blood glu-cose. Since the normal life span of erythrocytes is about 120 days (see page 295), glycated hemoglobin can only be eliminated when the RBCs containing it are de-stroyed. Thus, HbA1c values are directly proportional to the concentration of glucose in the blood over the"

Untreated proliferative retinopathy is a relative contraindication to vigorous exercise, because this may lead to vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment. Optimal monitoring of glycemic control involves plasma glucose measurements by the patient and an assessment of long-term control by the physician (measurement of hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] and review of the patient\u2019s self-measurements of plasma glucose). These measurements are complementary: the patient\u2019s measurements provide a picture of short-term glycemic control, whereas the HbA1c reflects average glycemic control over the previous 2\u20133 months."

Elevated blood glucose occurs in type 1 diabetes (T1D) as a result of a lack of insulin. In type 2 diabetes (T2D), hyperglycemia is due to a defect in \u03b2-cell function and insulin resistance. The hyperglycemia results in elevated hemoglobin A1c levels. Ketoacidosis is rare in T2D, whereas obesity is rare in T1D. C (connecting)-peptide is a measure of insulin synthesis. It would be virtually absent in T1D and initially increased then decreased in T2D. Both forms of the disease show complex genetics. 5.4. An obese individual with type 2 diabetes typically: A. benefits from receiving insulin about 6 hours after a meal. B. has a lower plasma level of glucagon than does a normal individual. C. has a lower plasma level of insulin than does a normal individual early in the disease process."
