    "question": "Twelve hours after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy for a perforated duodenal ulcer, a 36-year-old man has shortness of breath. He has asthma well controlled with an albuterol inhaler. His father died of lung cancer at 62 years of age. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 14 years. He does not drink alcohol. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 37.4\u00b0C (99.3\u00b0F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 122/76 mm Hg. Examination shows reduced breath sounds over the left lung base. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. There is a clean, dry surgical incision over the midline of the abdomen. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. The calves are soft and nontender. His hemoglobin concentration is 12.9 g/dL, leukocyte count is 10,600/mm3, and platelet count is 230,000/mm3. An x-ray of the chest in supine position is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Given the clinical scenario and the patient's history, let's analyze the situation step by step: 1. **Patient's symptoms and history**: The patient is experiencing shortness of breath 12 hours after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy for a perforated duodenal ulcer. He has a history of asthma, which is well-controlled with an albuterol inhaler, and a family history of lung cancer. 2. **Vital signs**: The patient's temperature is normal, pulse is slightly elevated (98/min), respirations are decreased (19/min), and blood pressure is within normal limits (122/76 mmHg). 3. **Physical examination findings**: Reduced breath sounds over the left lung base, a clean, dry surgical incision over the midline of the abdomen, hypoactive bowel sounds, soft and nontender calves, and normal cardiac examination. 4. **Laboratory results**: Hemoglobin concentration is within normal limits (12.9 g/dL), leukocyte count is slightly elevated (10,600/mm3), and platelet count is normal (230,000/mm3). 5. **Chest X-ray**: Although the description of the X-ray is not provided, the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and reduced breath sounds over the left lung base are consistent with several possible causes. Considering the patient's history of asthma, the most likely cause of his symptoms would be an asthma exacerbation (A). However, the fact that his asthma is well-controlled with an albuterol inhaler makes this less likely. The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and reduced breath sounds over the left lung base could also be consistent with atelectasis (D), but the patient's history of asthma and the fact that his respirations are decreased (19/min) make this less likely. Pulmonary embolism (C) is also a possibility, but the patient's normal temperature and lack of other symptoms such as chest pain or tachycardia make this less likely. Pneumonitis (B) is also a possibility, but the patient's normal leukocyte count makes this less likely. Given the patient's history of asthma and the fact that his respirations are decreased, the most likely cause of his symptoms is an asthma exacerbation. However, considering the patient's recent surgery and the fact that his respirations are decreased, it is also possible that he may be experiencing atelectasis due to the surgical procedure. **Step-by-step thinking and final answer:** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath 12 hours after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy for a perforated duodenal ulcer, reduced breath sounds over the left lung base, and decreased respirations (19/min) are consistent with several possible causes, including asthma exacerbation, atelectasis, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonitis. However, the patient's history of asthma and the fact that his respirations are decreased make asthma exacerbation the most likely cause. However, the patient's recent surgery and decreased respirations also make atelectasis a possibility. The lack of other symptoms such as chest pain or tachycardia makes pulmonary embolism less likely. Pneumonitis is also less likely given the patient's normal leukocyte count. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is an asthma exacerbation, but it is also possible that the patient may be experiencing atelectasis due to the surgical procedure. The correct answer is A, but with the caveat that atelectasis is also a possible cause.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

In severe exacerbations, patients may be so breathless that they are unable to complete sentences and may become cyanotic. Examination usually shows increased ventilation, hyperinflation, and tachycardia. Pulsus paradoxus may be present, but this is rarely a useful clinical sign. There is a marked fall in spirometric values and PEF. Arterial blood gases on air show hypoxemia, and PCO2 is usually low due to hyperventilation. A normal or rising PCO2 is an indication of impending respiratory failure and requires immediate monitoring and therapy. A chest roentgenogram is not usually informative but may show pneumonia or pneumothorax."

            "content": "In this patient, compression of the left external iliac veins by the gravid uterus was the likely cause of stasis, which led to the deep vein thrombosis. The chest pain was due to pulmonary emboli. Small emboli were thrown off from the leading edge of the thrombus through the heart to lodge in the lungs. Small emboli cause typical pleuritic chest pain, which is exacerbated by breathing. In isolation these small pulmonary emboli may affect respiratory function, but they may be the precursor to a large and potentially fatal pulmonary embolus (eFig. 6.143). Anticoagulation was instituted and the patient had an uneventful delivery. A 45-year-old man had recently taken up squash. During a game he attempted a forehand shot and noticed severe sudden pain in his heel. He thought his opponent had hit him with his racket. When he turned, though, he realized his opponent was too far away to have hit him."

Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination?

He attended structured diabetes classes and received indi-vidualized instruction from a diabetes educator and a dieti-tian. Metformin therapy was reinitiated and his insulin doses were reduced. The patient was then given the GLP1 receptor agonist, exenatide. The patient lost about 8 kg in weight over the next 3 years and was able to stop his insulin. He had excellent control with an HbA1c of 6.5 % on a combination of metformin, exenatide, and glimepiride. His antihyperten-sive therapy was optimized and his urine albumin excretion declined to 1569 mg/g creatinine. This case"
