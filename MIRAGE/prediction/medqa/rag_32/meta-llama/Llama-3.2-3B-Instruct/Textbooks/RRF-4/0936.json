The patient states she has pain in the right side of her abdomen which started yesterday and has been worsening. She has experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea during this time. The patient has a past medical history of constipation which is treated with fiber supplements. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/68 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, you note a young woman who appears to be in pain. Cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. Abdominal exam is notable for right lower quadrant pain that is reproducible when the left lower quadrant is palpated. The patient is given morphine.

The pain is reproducible when the left lower quadrant is palpated, suggesting the pain is migrating to the right lower quadrant, which is a classic sign of appendicitis. The patient has a history of constipation, which is treated with fiber supplements, and has experienced vomiting and diarrhea, which are common symptoms of appendicitis. The patient's vital signs are stable, and the physical exam is notable for right lower quadrant pain. The next best step in management would be to consider imaging to confirm the diagnosis. Among the options, a CT scan is the most appropriate choice as it provides detailed images of the abdomen and can help rule out other causes of abdominal pain. An abdominal radiograph may not provide enough detail, and \u00df-hCG is not directly related to the patient's symptoms.

            "content": "The severe, left lower quadrant pain of diverticulitis can occur following a long history of symptoms of irritable bowel (bloating, constipation, and diarrhea), although diverticulosis usually is asymptomatic. Diverticulitis is less likely to lead to perforation and peritonitis than is appendicitis. Fever, chills, and constipation typically are present, but anorexia and vomiting are uncommon. Bowel sounds are hypoactive and are substantially decreased with peritonitis related to a ruptured diverticular abscess. Abdominal examination reveals distention with left lower quadrant tenderness on direct palpation and localized rebound tenderness. Abdominal and bimanual rectovaginal examinations may reveal a poorly mobile, doughy in\ufb02ammatory mass in the left lower quadrant. Leukocytosis and fever are common. Stool guaiac may be positive as a result of in\ufb02ammation of the colon or microperforation."

            "content": "In cases of acute abdominal pain, a diagnosis is readily established in most instances, whereas success is not so frequent in patients with chronic pain. IBS is one of the most common causes of abdominal pain and must always be kept in mind (Chap. 352). The location of the pain can assist in narrowing the differential diagnosis (Table 20-3); however, the chronological sequence of events in the patient\u2019s history is often more important than the pain\u2019s location. If the examiner is sufficiently open-minded and unhurried, asks the proper questions, and listens, the patient will usually provide the diagnosis. Careful attention should be paid to the extraabdominal regions. Narcotics or analgesics should not be withheld until a definitive diagnosis or a definitive plan has been formulated; obfuscation of the diagnosis by adequate analgesia is unlikely."

Few clinical situations require greater judgment, because the most catastrophic of events may be forecast by the subtlest of symptoms and signs. In every instance, the clinician must distinguish those conditions 20 that require urgent intervention from those that do not and can best be managed nonoperatively. A meticulously executed, detailed history and physical examination are critically important for focusing the differential diagnosis, where necessary, and allowing the diagnostic evaluation to proceed expeditiously (Table 20-1). The etiologic classification in Table 20-2, although not complete, provides a useful framework for evaluating patients with abdominal pain."

Reflex activity may therefore occur below the injury, but communication with the brain is lost. A 25-year-old woman complained of increasing lumbar back pain. Over the ensuing weeks she was noted to have an enlarging lump in the right groin, which was mildly tender to touch. On direct questioning, the patient also complained of a productive cough with sputum containing mucus and blood, and she had a mild temperature. The chest radiograph revealed a cavitating apical lung mass, which explains the pulmonary history."

            "content": "Classic appendicitis begins with visceral pain, localized to the periumbilical region. Nausea and vomiting occur soon after, triggered by the appendiceal distention. As the inflammation begins to irritate the parietal peritoneum adjacent to the appendix, somatic pain fibers are activated, and the pain localizes to the right lower quadrant. Examination of the patient reveals a tender right lower quadrant. Voluntary guarding is present initially, progressing to rigidity, then to rebound tenderness with rupture and peritonitis. These classic findings may not be present, especially in young children or if the appendix is retrocecal, covered by omentum, or in another unusual location. Clinical prediction rules have been developed for the diagnosis of appendicitis. The Alvarado/MANTRELS rule is scored by 1 point for each of the following: migration of pain to the right lower quadrant, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, rebound pain, temperature of at least 37.3\u00b0C, and WBC shift to greater than 75%"

Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age. A 35-year-old woman visited her family practitioner because she had a \u201cbloating\u201d feeling and an increase in abdominal girth. The family practitioner examined the lower abdomen, which revealed a mass that extended from the superior pubic rami to the level of the umbilicus. The superior margin of the mass was easily palpated, but the inferior margin appeared to be less well defined. This patient has a pelvic mass. When examining a patient in the supine position, the observer should uncover the whole of the abdomen."
