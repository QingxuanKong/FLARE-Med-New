He was born at 38 weeks' gestation to a 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, after an uncomplicated labor and delivery. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother did not receive prenatal care. She takes codeine syrup frequently for dry cough. The infant's temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), pulse is 165/min, and blood pressure is 83/50 mm Hg. Examination shows hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response. The baby is swaddled to prevent excoriations, and fluid resuscitation is initiated. Complete blood count and serum levels of glucose, bilirubin, and calcium are within normal limits. What is the most appropriate next step in treatment of this newborn?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The newborn is presenting with symptoms of jitteriness, hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response, which are indicative of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). The mother's history of frequent use of codeine syrup for a dry cough during pregnancy may be the cause of NAS. The Apgar scores are normal, but the newborn's symptoms suggest that he may be experiencing withdrawal symptoms. The normal complete blood count, serum levels of glucose, bilirubin, and calcium, and the absence of signs of infection or other underlying conditions make NAS the most likely diagnosis. Oral morphine therapy is often used to manage NAS in newborns. The other options are not appropriate for this diagnosis. Oral methimazole therapy is used to treat hyperthyroidism, and intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin combination therapy is used to treat bacterial infections. Dextrose infusion may be used to treat hypoglycemia, but there is no indication of low blood sugar in this case. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in treatment is oral morphine therapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

For these, initial steps of warming the newborn can be done on the mother's chest or abdomen. Direct skin-to-skin contact with the mother and drying and covering the newborn with a warm blanket will help maintain euthermia (36.5 to 37.5\u00b0C). A vigorously crying newborn does not require routine oral suctioning (Carrasco, 1997; Gungor, 2006). Instead, bulb suctioning to remove secretions is best reserved for those who cannot clear secretions on their own due to apnea or copious secretions. Additional routine care steps include drying, gentle stimulation by rubbing the newborn's back, and continued observation during the transition period."

If the newborn is apneic or has copious secretions that it cannot clear, a bulb syringe or suction catheter may be used to clear the mouth and then the nose. Routine intubation and suctioning of meconium-stained amnionic luid is no longer recommended for the nonvigorous newborn (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2017b; Perlman, 2015). Intubation and suction are reserved for suspected airway obstruction. After completion of the initial stabilization steps, apnea, gasping respirations, or heart rate \ufffd 100 beats per minute (bpm) should prompt immediate administration of positivepressure ventilation with room air (Fig. 32-3). his should be started by 60 seconds of life, if not sooner, once the initial steps are completed."

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"
