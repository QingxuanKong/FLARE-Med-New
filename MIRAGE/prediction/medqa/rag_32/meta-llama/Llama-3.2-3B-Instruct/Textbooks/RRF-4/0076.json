Menopause occurred at 52 years of age. Her last Pap smear 1 year ago was normal. She has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes. Medications include atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and aspirin. She is sexually active with her husband. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 155/65 mm Hg.

Given the patient's age, symptoms, and physical exam findings, a pelvic mass is highly suggestive of cervical cancer. The patient's last Pap smear was normal 1 year ago, but this does not rule out the possibility of cervical cancer, especially if the mass is new and growing. The patient's age and symptoms warrant further evaluation and potential biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes. The other options are not the most appropriate next steps in management. A Pap smear (A) may not provide a definitive diagnosis, and incision and drainage (C) is not indicated for a cervical mass. Urine gonorrhea and chlamydia testing (D) is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Fever is present in about half of these patients; abnormal uterine bleeding occurs in about one-third. New vaginal discharge, urethritis, and chills may be present but are less specific signs. Adnexal pathology can present acutely and may be due to rupture, bleeding or torsion of cysts, or, much less commonly, neoplasms of the ovary, fallopian tubes, or paraovarian areas. Fever may be present with ovarian torsion. Ectopic pregnancy is associated with rightor left-sided lower abdominal pain, with clinical signs generally appearing 6\u20138 weeks after the last normal menstrual period. Amenorrhea is present in ~75% of cases and vaginal bleeding in ~50% of cases. Orthostatic signs and fever may be present. Risk factors include the presence of known tubal disease, previous ectopic pregnancies, a history of infertility,"

She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV.

Focused History: Ten days ago, CR had her spleen removed following a bicycle accident in which she fractured her tibial eminence, necessitating immobilization of the right knee. She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."
