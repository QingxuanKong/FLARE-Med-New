The bladder is the most common source of gross hematuria (40%), but benign cystitis (22%) is a more common cause than bladder cancer (15%) (Chap. 61). Microscopic hematuria is more commonly of prostate origin (25%); only 2% of bladder cancers produce microscopic hematuria. Once hematuria is documented, a urinary cytology, visualization of the urothelial tract by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance urogram or intravenous pyelogram, and cystoscopy are recommended if no other etiology is found. Screening asymptomatic individuals for hematuria increases the diagnosis of tumors at an early stage but has not been shown to prolong life. After hematuria, irritative symptoms are the next most common presentation. Ureteral obstruction may cause flank pain. Symptoms of metastatic disease are rarely the first presenting sign."

Patients with urothelial tumors, whatever their grade, have a tendency to develop new tumors after excision, and recurrences may exhibit a higher grade. The risk for recurrence is related to several factors, including tumor size, stage, grade, multifocality, mitotic index, and associated dysplasia and/or CIS in the surrounding mucosa. Many recurrent tumors arise at sites different than that of the original lesion, yet share the same clonal abnormalities as those of the initial tumor; thus, these are true recurrences that stem from shedding and implantation of the original tumor cells at new sites. Whereas high-grade papillary urothelial carcinomas frequently are associated with either concurrent or subsequent invasive urothelial carcinoma, lower-grade papillary urothelial neoplasms often recur but infrequently invade (see Table 18.2 Fig. 18.18 Carcinomainsitu(CIS)withenlargedhyperchromaticnucleiandamitoticfigure(arrow)."

            "content": "If the stones are too big, it may be necessary to make a suprapubic incision and enter the bladder retroperitoneally to remove them. In the clinic In certain instances it is necessary to catheterize the bladder through the anterior abdominal wall. For example, when the prostate is markedly enlarged and it is impossible to pass a urethral catheter, a suprapubic catheter may be placed. The bladder is a retroperitoneal structure and when full lies adjacent to the anterior abdominal wall. Ultrasound visualization of the bladder may be useful in assessing the size of this structure and, importantly, differentiating this structure from other potential abdominal masses. The procedure of suprapubic catheterization is straightforward and involves the passage of a small catheter on a needle in the midline approximately 2 cm above the pubic symphysis. The catheter passes easily into the bladder without compromise of other structures and permits free drainage. In the clinic"

            "content": "A typical patient presents to the primary clinician after days, weeks, or months of pain, urgency, frequency, and/or nocturia. The presence of urinary nitrites, leukocytes, or uropathogenic bacteria should prompt treatment for UTI in women and chronic bacterial prostatitis in men. Persistence or recurrence of symptoms in the absence of bacteriuria should prompt a pelvic examination for women, an assay for serum prostate-specific antigen for men, and urine cytology and inclusion of IC/BPS in the differential diagnosis for both sexes."

            "content": "Malignant tumors of the ureter are pathologically similar to those arising in the renal pelvis, calyces, and bladder (discussed later). Most are urothelial carcinomas. Retroperitoneal fibrosis is an uncommon cause of ureteral narrowing or obstruction characterized by a fibrous proliferative inflammatory process encasing the retro-peritoneal structures and causing hydronephrosis. The disorder occurs in middle to old age. At least a proportion of these cases occur in association with IgG4-related disease, characterized by fibroinflammatory lesions rich in IgG4-secreting plasma cells (Chapter 5). Other cases are associated with drug exposures (ergot derivatives, adrenergic blockers), radiation, infection, prior surgery, or malignant disease (lymphomas, urinary tract carcinomas). Most cases, however, have no obvious cause and are considered primary, or idiopathic (Ormond disease)."

For low-grade disease localized to the renal pelvis and ureter, nephroureterectomy (including excision of the distal ureter with a portion of the bladder) is associated with 5-year survival of 80\u201390%. More invasive or poorly differentiated tumors are more likely to recur locally and to metastasize. Metastatic disease is treated with the chemotherapy used in bladder cancer, and the outcome is similar to that of metastatic bladder cancer."

            "content": "The following three brief scenarios of a patient with hemoptysis demonstrate three distinct patterns: A 46-year-old man presents to his internist with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."
