    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's break it down step by step. The patient was treated with metronidazole for a vaginal infection and then experienced symptoms after consuming alcohol. Metronidazole is known to cause a disulfiram-like reaction when combined with alcohol. This reaction is characterized by facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps. The reaction occurs because metronidazole inhibits the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which is responsible for oxidizing acetaldehyde to acetate. When alcohol is consumed, the acetaldehyde builds up and causes these symptoms. Therefore, we need to identify the substance whose levels are likely elevated in this patient following alcohol consumption.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The onset is typically acute and often follows a bout of particularly heavy drinking. Symptoms and laboratory abnormalities range from minimal to severe. Most patients present with malaise, anorexia, weight loss, upper-abdominal discomfort, tender hepatomegaly, and fever. Typical findings include hyperbilirubinemia, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels, and neutrophilic leukocytosis. Serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases are elevated but usually remain below 500 U/mL. The outlook is unpredictable; each bout of alcoholic hepatitis carries a 10% to 20% risk for death.

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

For example, dyspepsia, nausea, and bloat\u2014 ing can accompany gastritis, and hepatomegaly, esophageal varices, and hemorrhoids may re\ufb02ect alcohol-induced changes in the liver. Other physical signs of heavy drinking include tremor, unsteady gait, insomnia, and erectile dysfunction. Males with chronic alcohol use dis- order may exhibit decreased testicular size and feminizing effects associated with reduced testosterone levels. Repeated heavy drinking in females is associated with menstrual irregu- larities and, during pregnancy, spontaneous abortion and fetal alcohol syndrome. Individu- als with preexisting histories of epilepsy or severe head trauma are more likely to develop alcohol-related seizures. Alcohol withdrawal may be associated with nausea, vomiting, gas- tritis, hematemesis, dry mouth, puffy blotchy complexion, and mild peripheral edema."

            "content": "Alcohol Myopathy (See Also Chap. 41) Several forms of muscle weakness have been ascribed to alcoholism. In one type, a painless and predominantly proximal weakness develops over a period of several days or weeks in the course of a prolonged drinking bout and is associated with severe degrees of hypokalemia (serum levels <2 mEq/L). The urinary excretion of potassium is not significantly increased, and depletion is probably the result of vomiting and diarrhea. In addition, serum levels of liver and muscle enzymes are markedly elevated. Biopsies from severely weakened muscles show single-fiber necrosis and vacuolation. Treatment consists of the administration of potassium chloride intravenously (about 120 mEq daily for several days), after which oral administration suffices. Strength returns gradually in 7 to 14 days, and enzyme levels return to normal concomitantly."

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

            "content": "A 19-year-old college freshman began drinking alcohol at 8:30 pm during a hazing event at his new fraternity. Between 8:30 and approximately midnight, he and several other pledges consumed beer and a bottle of whiskey, and then he consumed most of a bottle of rum at the urging of upperclassmen. The young man complained of feeling nau-seated, lay down on a couch, and began to lose conscious-ness. Two upperclassmen carried him to a bedroom, placed him on his stomach, and positioned a trash can nearby. Approximately 10 minutes later, the freshman was found unconscious and covered with vomit. There was a delay in treatment because the upperclassmen called the college police instead of calling 911. After the call was transferred to 911, emergency medical technicians responded quickly and discovered that the young man was not breathing and that he had choked on his vomit. He was rushed to the hospital, where he remained in a coma for 2 days before ultimately being pronounced dead. The"
