She is sexually active with 2 male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic examination shows multiple hyperkeratotic exophytic papules over the vulva.

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to identify the likely cause of the patient's condition based on the symptoms and examination findings. The patient is a 15-year-old girl with a 2-week history of genital lesions, which are hyperkeratotic exophytic papules over the vulva. The lesions turn white on application of 3% acetic acid, which suggests that they are likely caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a common cause of genital warts, which are characterized by hyperkeratotic exophytic papules. The patient's sexual activity with 2 male partners and inconsistent condom use increases her risk of HPV infection. The other options are not directly related to the prevention of HPV infection. Condoms (A) are used to prevent sexually transmitted infections, but they do not prevent HPV infection. Anti-HIV prophylaxis (B) is used to prevent HIV infection, but it does not prevent HPV infection. Vaccination (D) is not currently available for HPV, although there are vaccines available for other types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer. Therefore, the most likely preventive measure for this patient's condition is consistent condom use, which can reduce the risk of HPV transmission.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Because body hair is felt by many to be culturally unacceptable in women and girls, sensitive questioning about specific hair removal techniques (bleaching, waxing, use of depilatories, shaving, plucking, threading) is warranted during an examination. A complete pelvic examination is appropriate in patients who are sexually active, are having severe pain, or may have an anatomic anomaly. Testing for gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis infection is appropriate during a speculum examination if the patient is sexually active. Some young teens who have a history that is classic for anovulation, who deny sexual activity, and who agree to return for follow-up evaluation may be managed with a limited gynecologic examination supplemented with pelvic ultrasonography.

In addition, because genital shedding and sexual transmission of HSV-2 often occur in the absence of symptoms and signs of recurrent herpetic lesions, persons who have a history of genital herpes or who are seropositive for HSV-2 should consider the use of condoms or suppressive antiviral therapy, both of which can reduce the risk of HSV-2 transmission to a sexual partner."

Inspect the mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, perineal body, and anal region for characteristics of the skin, distribution of the hair, contour, and swelling. Palpate any abnormality. 2. Separate the labia majora with the index and middle fingers of the gloved hand and inspect the epidermal and mucosal characteristics and anatomic configuration of the following structures in the order indicated below: a. b. c. d. e. f. g. 3."

            "content": "Discharge is one of the most common vaginal symptoms. Conditions ranging from vaginal candidiasis to chlamydia cervicitis to bacterial vaginosis may cause vaginal discharge in adolescents. Infectious vaginal conditions are described in more detail in Chapter 18. The risks of self-diagnosis of vaginal discharge in adolescents may be greater than in adult women, as infection with STDs\u2014including Neisseria gonorrhoea, Trichomonas vaginalis, C. trachomatis, herpes simplex, and Condyloma acuminata\u2014are common in adolescents and may be less likely recognized. Use of tampons is associated with both microscopic and macroscopic ulcerations. Healing of the macroscopic ulcerations occurs within several weeks without specific therapy if tampon use is suspended. A follow-up examination to demonstrate healing is appropriate, with biopsy of any persistent ulcerations to rule out other lesions."
