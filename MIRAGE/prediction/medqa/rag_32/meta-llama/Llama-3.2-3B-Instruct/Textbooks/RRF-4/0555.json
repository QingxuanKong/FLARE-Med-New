    "question": "A previously healthy 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation because of loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and extreme irritability for the past 3 weeks. He was recently kicked off of the school's football team after missing too many practices. He has also been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them, but he admits that he is lonely. He has not left his room for 2 days, which prompted his father to bring him to the physician. He has no medical conditions and does not take any medications. He does not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs. While the father is in the waiting room, a mental status examination is conducted, which shows a constricted affect. Cognition is intact. He says that he would be better off dead and refuses to be treated. He says he wants to use his father's licensed firearm to \u201cend his misery\u201d over the weekend when his parents are at church. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "A": "Agree to his wish for no further treatment",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is exhibiting symptoms of depression, irritability, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and extreme mood swings, which are classic symptoms of major depressive disorder. The patient's statement of wanting to use a firearm to end his life is a clear indication of suicidal ideation. The patient's constricted affect, refusal of treatment, and statements of wanting to harm himself necessitate immediate action to ensure his safety. The most appropriate next step in management is to involuntarily hospitalize the patient after informing the parents, as this is a life-threatening situation that requires professional intervention. Agreeing to the patient's wish for no further treatment (A) would be inappropriate and potentially lethal. Reassuring the patient that he will feel better (C) is not a sufficient response to a patient who is suicidal. Starting outpatient psychotherapy (D) may be beneficial in the long term, but it is not an appropriate next step in a crisis situation where the patient is at risk of harming himself.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

He may talk incessantly and incoherently, and look distressed and perplexed; his expression may be in keeping with vague notions of being annoyed or threatened by someone. From his manner and the content of speech, it is evident that he misinterprets the meaning of ordinary objects and sounds, misidentifies the people around him, and is experiencing vivid visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations, often of a most unpleasant type. At first the patient can be brought into touch with reality and may identify the examiner and answer other questions correctly; but almost at once he relapses into a preoccupied, confused state, giving incorrect answers and being unable to think coherently. As the process evolves, the patient cannot shake off his hallucinations and is unable to make meaningful responses"

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."

He is rushed to a nearby level 1 trauma center where he is found to have multiple facial fractures, a severe, unstable cervical spine injury, and significant left eye trauma. Further examination of his left eye reveals rupture of his globe. The ophthalmolo-gist requests emergency surgery to repair and save his eye. Because the patient has suffered a recent trauma, you decide to perform a rapid sequence intubation in preparation for the surgical procedure. What muscle relaxant would you use to facilitate tracheal intubation? What is the proper dose for your chosen muscle relaxant? After intravenous infusion of your chosen muscle relaxant, you are unable to adequately visualize the patient\u2019s larynx and vocal cords and cannot successfully pass an endotracheal tube. You switch to mask ventilation but are barely able to mask ventilate the patient, and you become worried"

They are initiated by autophosphorylation of select tyrosine residues in their receptors. C. They are mediated by binding to adrenergic receptors, which are a class of nuclear receptors. D. They result in the activation of glycogen and triacylglycerol synthesis. Q3. NE bound to certain receptors causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. Why might NE be used clinically in the treatment of septic shock?
