The L3 level is located in the lower back, and the major vascular structures in this region include the aorta, inferior vena cava, renal arteries, and iliac veins. However, the internal iliac vein is not as likely to be injured at this level as the other options. The renal arteries are also less likely to be injured at the L3 level as they are more superiorly located. The portal vein is not a likely candidate as it is more superiorly located and not directly in the path of a bullet wound at the L3 level. The inferior vena cava is a major vein that could be injured at this level, especially considering the high-energy transfer associated with gunshot wounds. Given the location of the wound and the potential for high-energy transfer, the most likely vascular structure to be injured is the inferior vena cava.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Although the diagnosis usually is obvious, in some instances wounds in the auditory canal, mouth, and nose can be elusive. Prognosis is variable, but virtually all supratentorial wounds that injure both hemispheres are fatal.Neck.

Blood loss sufficient to cause shock is generally of a large volume, and there are a limited number of sites that can harbor sufficient extravascular blood volume to induce hypotension (e.g., external, intratho-racic, intra-abdominal, retroperitoneal, and long bone fractures). In the nontrauma patient, the GI tract must always be considered as a site for blood loss. Substantial blood loss externally may be suspected from prehospital medical reports documenting a sub-stantial blood loss at the scene of an accident, history of massive Table 5-5Classification of hemorrhage CLASSPARAMETERIIIIIIIVBlood loss (mL)<750750\u201315001500\u20132000>2000Blood loss (%)<1515\u20133030\u201340>40Heart rate (bpm)<100>100>120>140Blood pressureNormalOrthostaticHypotensionSevere hypotensionCNS symptomsNormalAnxiousConfusedObtundedbpm = beats per minute; CNS = central nervous"

Hemodynamic abnormalities generally stimulate a search for blood loss before the appearance of obvious abdominal findings. Adjunctive tests are essential in the diagnosis of intraperitoneal bleeding; intraperitoneal blood may be rapidly identified by diagnostic ultrasound or diagnostic peritoneal lavage. Further-more, patients that have sustained high-energy blunt trauma that are hemodynamically stable or that have normalized their vital signs in response to initial volume resuscitation should undergo computed tomography scans to assess for head, chest, and/or abdominal bleeding.Treatment. Control of ongoing hemorrhage is an essential component of the resuscitation of the patient in shock.

Consultations for these injuries must be evaluated urgently.Initial treatment for an actively bleeding wound should be direct local pressure for no less than 10 continuous minutes. If this is unsuccessful, an upper extremity tourniquet inflated to 100 mmHg above the systolic pressure should be used. One should keep this tourniquet time to less than 2 hours to avoid tissue necrosis. Once bleeding is controlled well enough to evaluate the wound, it may be cautiously explored to evaluate for bleeding points.
