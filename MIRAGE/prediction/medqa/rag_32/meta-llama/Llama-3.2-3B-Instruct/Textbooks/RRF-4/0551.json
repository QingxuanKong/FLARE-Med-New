    "question": "A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother with confusion, abdominal pain, and vomiting for the previous day. The patient\u2019s mother says he started complaining of pain in his abdomen after he got back from school yesterday and vomited 3 times during the night. This morning, he seemed confused so she rushed him to the ER. She has also noticed that he has been urinating frequently and drinking a lot of water recently, and he has lost 6 kg (13.2 lb) over the past 20 days. His vital signs include: blood pressure 100/50 mm Hg, heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 27/min, and temperature 35.6\u00b0C (96.0\u00b0F). His BMI is 18 kg/m2. On physical examination, he is disoriented to time and place and is taking deep and labored breaths. There is diffuse tenderness to palpation in the abdomen with guarding. Laboratory tests are significant for a pH of 7.19 and a blood glucose level of 754 mg/dL. The doctor explains to his mother that her son has developed a life-threatening complication of a disease characterized by decreased levels of a hormone. Which of the following would you most likely expect to see in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes",
        "B": "Decreased activity of hormone sensitive lipase",
        "C": "Decreased proteolysis",
        "D": "Increased lipoprotein lipase activity"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to identify the hormone that has decreased levels in the patient and then determine the expected effect of its decrease on the listed options. The patient's symptoms, such as confusion, abdominal pain, vomiting, frequent urination, and low blood glucose, are suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a complication of diabetes mellitus. The key hormone involved in DKA is glucagon. Glucagon is a hormone produced by the alpha cells of the pancreas that raises blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. A decrease in glucagon levels would lead to decreased glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, resulting in decreased glucose production in the liver. This would cause a rise in blood glucose levels. Now, let's analyze the options in the context of decreased glucagon levels: A. Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes: Glucagon stimulates lipolysis, which increases the availability of fatty acids for glucose production in the liver. With decreased glucagon, lipolysis would decrease, leading to decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes. B. Decreased activity of hormone-sensitive lipase: Hormone-sensitive lipase is an enzyme involved in lipolysis. Decreased glucagon would lead to decreased lipolysis, so this option is correct. C. Decreased proteolysis: Glucagon has a minor role in protein metabolism, but its primary function is glucose homeostasis. Decreased glucagon would not have a direct impact on proteolysis. D. Increased lipoprotein lipase activity: Glucagon inhibits lipoprotein lipase, which breaks down triglycerides in the bloodstream. Decreased glucagon would lead to increased lipoprotein lipase activity, not decreased. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension.

The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"
