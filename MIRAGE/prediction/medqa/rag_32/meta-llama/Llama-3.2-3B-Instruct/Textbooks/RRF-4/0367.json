She complains of a rash involving her chest, face, and arms, a watery nasal discharge, and mild bilateral knee pain. She has had these symptoms for about 5 days. The symptoms do not seem to bother her too much, but she is concerned for the baby. She had contact with her younger sister, who also had a rash and was diagnosed with rubella infection about 10 days ago at a family gathering. She cannot confirm her vaccination history. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; heart rate, 89/min; respiratory rate, 12/min; and temperature, 37.6\u2103 (99.7\u2109). Examination shows a moderately dense maculopapular lacy rash spread over the patient\u2019s trunk, extremities, and face. No lymph node, liver, or spleen enlargement is noted.

Given her symptoms and recent exposure to a family member with rubella, serological testing is crucial to confirm the diagnosis. The patient's serology results show high IgG avidity, which indicates an infection at least 2 months in the past, making it unlikely that she is currently infected. However, the presence of IgM antibodies is not detected, which is unusual for a confirmed infection. The patient's symptoms could be related to a false-positive IgM result or a recent exposure to another virus. The patient's vaccination history is unknown, and she is pregnant, so vaccination against rubella postpartum is not recommended. Pregnancy termination is not indicated based on the provided information. Chorionic villus sampling is not necessary as the diagnosis can be made with serological testing. Parvovirus B19 testing is not indicated based on the symptoms and serological results provided.

Avidity testing may be particularly useful in diagnosing rubella in pregnant women and assessing the risk of CRS. Rubella virus can be isolated from the blood and nasopharynx during the prodromal period and for as long as 2 weeks after rash onset. However, as the secretion of virus in individuals with acquired rubella is maximal just before or up to 4 days after rash onset, this is the optimal time frame for collecting specimens for viral cultures.

            "content": "Case 2: Skin Rash Patient Presentation: KL is a 34-year-old woman who presents with a red, nonitchy rash on her left thigh and flu-like symptoms. Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

            "content": "Rubella (German measles) also spreads from the hairline downward; unlike that of measles, however, the rash of rubella tends to clear from originally affected areas as it migrates, and it may be pruritic (Chap. 230e). Forchheimer spots (palatal petechiae) may develop but are nonspecific because they also develop in infectious mononucleosis (Chap. 218) and scarlet fever (Chap. 173). Postauricular and suboccipital adenopathy and arthritis are common among adults with rubella. Exposure of pregnant women to ill individuals should be avoided, as rubella causes severe congenital abnormalities. Numerous strains of enteroviruses (Chap. 228), primarily echoviruses and coxsackieviruses, cause nonspecific syndromes of fever and eruptions that may mimic rubella or measles. Patients with infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus (Chap. 218) or with primary HIV infection (Chap. 226) may exhibit pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and a nonspecific maculopapular exanthem."

In unvaccinated populations, rubella usually occurs in the spring, with epidemics occurring in cycles of every 6 to 9 years. Approximately 25% to 50% of cases are subclinical. Fewer than 20 cases of rubella now occur annually in the United States. Outbreaks of rubella occasionally occur in nonvaccinated groups from internationally imported cases. Transplacental antibody is protective during the first 6 months of life. Available @ StudentConsult.com"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

            "content": "Congenital Rubella Syndrome The most serious consequence of rubella virus infection can develop when a woman becomes infected during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester. The resulting complications may include miscarriage, fetal death, premature delivery, or live birth with congenital defects. Infants infected with rubella virus in utero may have myriad physical defects (Table 230e-1), which most commonly relate to the eyes, ears, and heart. This constellation of severe birth defects is known as congenital rubella syndrome. In addition to permanent manifestations, there are a host of transient physical manifestations, including thrombocytopenia with purpura/petechiae (e.g., dermal erythropoiesis, \u201cblueberry muffin syndrome\u201d). Some infants may be born with congenital rubella virus infection but have no apparent signs or symptoms of CRS and are referred to as \u201cinfants with congenital rubella infection only.\u201d"
