The Kozak sequence is a region upstream of the Beta-globin gene that is crucial for the initiation of translation. A mutation in this region can affect the efficiency of translation, leading to reduced production of Beta-globin chains. In thalassemia intermedia, there is a reduction in Beta-globin chain synthesis, but not complete absence. This results in a milder phenotype compared to beta-thalassemia major. Considering the effects of this mutation on the Beta-globin gene, we can expect the blood smear to show microcytic and hypochromic red blood cells, which are characteristic of thalassemia intermedia. The reduced Beta-globin chain synthesis leads to smaller (microcytic) and paler (hypochromic) red blood cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

No physiologically useful hemoglobin is produced beyond the embryonic stage. Excess \u03b3 globin forms tetramers called Hb Barts (\u03b34), which has a very high oxygen affinity. It delivers almost no O2 to fetal tissues, causing tissue asphyxia, edema (hydrops fetalis), congestive heart failure, and death in utero. \u03b1 Thalassemia-2 trait is common (15\u201320%) among people of African descent. The cis \u03b1 thalassemia-1 deletion is almost never seen, however. Thus, \u03b1 thalassemia-2 and the trans form of \u03b1 thalassemia-1 are very common, but HbH disease and hydrops fetalis are rare. It has been known for some time that some patients with myelodysplasia or erythroleukemia produce RBC clones containing HbH. This phenomenon is due to mutations in the ATRX pathway that affect the LCR of the \u03b1-globin gene cluster."

Anemia is of moderate severity and patients usually do not require transfusions. Thus, the iron overload that is so common in \u03b2-thalassemia major is rarely seen."

For example, loss of a single \u03b1-globin gene produces a silent-carrier state, whereas deletion of all four \u03b1-globin genes is lethal in utero because the red cells have virtually no oxygen-delivering capacity. With loss of three \u03b1-globin genes there is a relative excess of \u03b2-globin or (early in life) \u03b3-globin chains. Excess \u03b2-globin and \u03b3-globin chains form relatively stable \u03b24 and \u03b34 tetramers known as HbH and Hb Bart, respectively, which cause less membrane damage than the free \u03b1-globin chains that are found in \u03b2-thalassemia; as a result, ineffective erythropoiesis is less pronounced in \u03b1-thalassemia. Unfortunately, both HbH and Hb Bart have an abnormally high affinity for oxygen, which renders them ineffective at delivering oxygen to the tissues."

Because of this, routine carrier screening is not ofered. If there is microcytic anemia in the absence of iron deiciency and the hemoglobin electrophoresis is normal, then testing for a-thalassemia can be considered, particularly among individuals of Southeast Asian descent (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2015). Mutations in 3-globin genes may cause reduced or absent production of 3-globin chains. If the mutation afects one gene, it results in 3-thalassemia minor. If both copies are afected, the result is either 3-thalassemia major-termed Cooley anemiaor 3-thalassemia intermedia. Because of reduced production of hemoglobin A among carriers, electrophoresis demonstrates elevated levels of hemoglobins that do not contain 3-chains. hese include hemoglobins F and A2."

            "content": "allelic HeteroGeneity Allelic heterogeneity refers to the fact that different mutations in the same genetic locus can cause an identical or similar phenotype. For example, many different mutations of the \u03b2-globin locus can cause \u03b2 thalassemia (Table 82-3) (Fig. 82-9). In essence, allelic heterogeneity reflects the fact that many different mutations are capable of altering protein structure and function. For this reason, maps of inactivating mutations in genes usually show a near-random distribution. Exceptions include (1) a founder effect, in which a particular mutation that does not affect reproductive capacity can be traced to a single individual; (2) \u201chot spots\u201d for mutations, in which the nature of the DNA sequence predisposes to a recurring mutation; and (3) localization of mutations to certain domains that are particularly critical for protein function. Allelic heterogeneity creates a practical problem for genetic testing because one must often examine the entire genetic locus"
