Over the next 3 days, the patient's drainage output is noted to exceed 1 liter per day. In the early morning of postoperative day 4, the nurse states that the patient is difficult to arouse. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 107/88 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with symptoms of dehydration, as evidenced by dry skin and mucous membranes, and is at risk for hypovolemic hyponatremia. The patient's serum sodium concentration is 154 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. However, the patient's serum osmolality is not provided, but given the clinical presentation, it is likely that the patient is hypovolemic. The best next step in management is to administer free water replacement to correct the dehydration and prevent further fluid loss. Oral free water replacement is the most appropriate choice as it will help to correct the dehydration without further increasing the risk of hyponatremia. The other options are not appropriate as they do not address the underlying cause of the dehydration and may further exacerbate the condition. 0.9% saline IV may further reduce serum sodium levels, 5% dextrose IV may further increase serum osmolality, and 5% dextrose IV with 0.45% saline IV may also further increase serum osmolality and is not the best choice for free water replacement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}}",

            "content": "A 45-year-old man with no significant medical history was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 10 days ago after suffering third-degree burns over 40% of his body. He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases.

It is 64e-6 conceivable that residual hypovolemic hyponatremia attenuated the recovery of the plasma Na+ concentration. Alternatively, attenuated recovery was due to persistent effects of the single dose of DDAVP. Of note, although the plasma half-life of DDAVP is only 1\u20132 h, pharmacodynamic studies indicate a much more prolonged effect on urine output and/or urine osmolality. One final consideration is the effect of the patient\u2019s initial renal dysfunction on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the administered DDAVP, which is renally excreted; DDAVP should be administered with caution for the reinduction of hyponatremia in patients with chronic kidney disease or acute renal dysfunction.

Treatment: Imaging studies of the abdomen were done to locate the tumor. Surgical resection of the tumor was performed. The tumor was found to be nonmalignant. Follow-up measurement of plasma metanephrines was performed 2 weeks later and was in the normal range. Prognosis: The 5-year survival rate for nonmalignant pheochromocytomas is >95%.

Most notable are the marked hyperglycemia (plasma glucose may be >55.5 mmol/L [1000 mg/dL]), hyperosmolality (>350 mosmol/L), and prerenal azotemia. The measured serum sodium may be normal or slightly low despite the marked hyperglycemia. The corrected serum sodium is usually increased (add 1.6 meq to measured sodium for each 5.6-mmol/L [100-mg/dL] rise in the serum glucose). In contrast to DKA, acidosis and ketonemia are absent or mild. A small anion-gap metabolic acidosis may be present secondary to increased lactic acid. Moderate ketonuria, if present, is secondary to starvation."
