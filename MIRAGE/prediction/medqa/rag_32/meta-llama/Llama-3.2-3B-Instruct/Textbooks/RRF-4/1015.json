Her parents note that she was diagnosed with a heart murmur, but it was never treated. Physical examination reveals a small child in distress. She is laying on the examination table with her knees drawn to her chest. Cardiac auscultation reveals a harsh, systolic ejection murmur that is best heard at the upper left sternal border. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "B": "Transposition of great vessels",

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's analyze the key points from the given documents: 1. The patient is a 2-year-old girl presenting with irritability, pallor, and cyanosis, which suggests a possible cardiac condition. 2. The presence of a harsh, systolic ejection murmur best heard at the upper left sternal border is a critical finding. 3. The murmur is described as harsh, which is more characteristic of a stenotic lesion (narrowing) rather than an atrophic lesion (thinning). 4. The location of the murmur at the upper left sternal border is consistent with pulmonary stenosis (PS). 5. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of pulmonary stenosis, particularly the type that is often seen in infants and young children. Given these points, let's evaluate the options: A. Tetralogy of Fallot - This condition is characterized by four components: ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta. While it can cause cyanosis and a harsh murmur, the location of the murmur is typically at the left lower sternal border, not the upper left sternal border. B. Transposition of great vessels - This condition involves an abnormal connection between the aorta and pulmonary artery. It can cause cyanosis and a harsh murmur, but the murmur is typically best heard at the left lower sternal border, not the upper left sternal border. C. Pulmonary hypoplasia - This condition involves underdevelopment of the lungs, which can cause respiratory distress and a harsh murmur. However, the murmur is typically not localized to the upper left sternal border. D. Atrial septal defect - This condition involves a hole in the septum between the atria. It can cause a systolic ejection murmur, but it is typically best heard at the left lower sternal border, not the upper left sternal border. Based on the analysis, the most likely diagnosis is pulmonary stenosis, which is option C. Pulmonary hypoplasia is the most likely diagnosis given the location of the murmur and the patient's symptoms.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",

A systolic ejection sound is audible in patients with BAV disease, and occasionally an S4 also may be heard. The murmur of chronic AR is typically a high-pitched, blowing, decrescendo diastolic murmur, heard best in the third intercostal space along the left sternal border (see Fig. 267-5B). In patients with mild AR, this murmur is brief, but as the severity increases, it generally becomes louder and longer, indeed holodiastolic. When the murmur is soft, it can be heard best with the diaphragm of the stethoscope and with the patient sitting up, leaning forward, and with the breath held in forced expiration. In patients in whom the AR is caused by primary valvular disease, the diastolic murmur is usually louder along the left than the right sternal border.

            "content": "A history of cyanosis is always present, although it depends on the amount of mixing. Quiet tachypnea and a single S2 are typically present. If the ventricular septum is intact, there may be no murmur. Children with transposition and a large VSD have improved intracardiac mixing and less cyanosis. They may present with signs of heart failure. The heart is hyperdynamic, with palpable left and right ventricular impulses. A loud VSD murmur is heard. S2 is single. ECG findings typically include right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy. The chest x-ray reveals increased pulmonary vascularity, and the cardiac shadow is classically an egg on a string created by the narrow superior mediastinum. Echocardiography shows the transposition of the great arteries, the sites and amount of mixing, and any associated lesions. Figure 144-3 Tricuspid atresia with ventricular septal defect. AO, Aorta; LA, left atrium; LV, left ventricle; PA, pulmonary artery; RA, right atrium."

Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of \u201closs of vision.\u201d Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver\u2019s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

Diastolic murmurs are much less common than systolic murmurs, and should be considered abnormal. Early diastolic murmurs occur when there is regurgitation through the aortic or pulmonary valve. Mid-diastolic murmurs are caused by increased flow (ASD, VSD) or anatomic stenosis across the mitral or tricuspid valves. Continuous murmurs are heard when there is flow through the entire cardiac cycle and are abnormal with one common exception, the venous hum. A PDA is the most common abnormal continuous murmur. Continuous murmurs can also be heard with coarctation of the aorta when collateral vessels are present."

            "content": "The physical examination should be methodical and thorough, with consideration given to the patient\u2019s comfort and modesty. Although attention is often directed by the history to the diseased organ or part of the body, the examination of a new patient must extend from head to toe in an objective search for abnormalities. Unless the physical examination is systematic and is performed consistently from patient to patient, important segments may be omitted inadvertently. The results of the examination, like the details of the history, should be recorded at the time they are elicited\u2014not hours later, when they are subject to the distortions of memory. Skill in physical diagnosis is acquired with experience, but it is not merely technique that determines success in eliciting signs of disease. The detection of a few scattered petechiae, a faint diastolic murmur, or a small mass in the abdomen is not a question of keener eyes and ears or more sensitive fingers but of a mind alert to those"

            "content": "A history of a heart murmur is important, but many wellchildren have an innocent murmur at some time in their lives. Other cardiac symptoms include cyanosis, palpitations, chest pain, syncope, and near-syncope. A review ofsystems assesses for possible systemic diseases or congenitalmalformation syndromes that may cause cardiac abnormalities (Tables 139-1 and 139-2). Current and past medication use as well as history of drug use, is important. Family history should be reviewed for hereditary diseases, early atherosclerotic heart disease, congenital heart disease, suddenunexplained deaths, thrombophilia, rheumatic fever, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. A complete cardiovascular examination starts in the supine position and includes evaluation in sitting and standing positions when possible. Inspection is supplemented by palpation and auscultation to provide a complete examination."

            "content": "The murmur of mild or moderate PS is mid-systolic in timing, crescendo-decrescendo in configuration, heard best in the left second interspace, and usually introduced by an ejection sound (click) in younger adults whose valves are still pliable. The ejection sound is the only right-sided acoustic event that decreases in intensity with inspiration. This phenomenon reflects premature opening of the pulmonic valve by the elevated RV end-diastolic (postatrial a wave) pressure. The systolic murmur increases in intensity during inspiration. With progressively severe PS, the ejection sound moves closer to the first heart sound and eventually becomes inaudible. A right-sided fourth heart sound may emerge. The systolic murmur peaks later and may persist through the aortic component of the second heart sound (A2). Pulmonic valve 1550 closure is delayed, and the pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) is reduced or absent. A prominent a wave, indicative of the higher atrial pressure"
