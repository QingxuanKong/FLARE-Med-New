    "question": "A 78-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressively worsening fatigue and headache for 6 months and occasional abdominal pain. He has not had any changes in his weight. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic shoulder pain. Current daily medications include hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and ibuprofen. He does not drink alcohol and does not smoke. His diet has mostly consisted of potatoes and lean meats since his wife passed away 1 year ago. His pulse is 92/min and blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg. Examination shows conjunctival and mucosal pallor. Abdominal and rectal examination shows no abnormalities. Neurological exam shows mild postural tremor. Peripheral blood smear shows red blood cells with increased zones of central pallor and anisocytosis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient\u2019s symptoms?",

He is currently taking hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and ibuprofen.\\n\\nThe patient's diet has been limited to potatoes and lean meats since his wife passed away 1 year ago, which may indicate a lack of essential nutrients.\\n\\nThe patient's pulse is 92/min and blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg, with conjunctival and mucosal pallor. The abdominal and rectal examination shows no abnormalities, but the neurological exam reveals mild postural tremor.\\n\\nThe peripheral blood smear shows red blood cells with increased zones of central pallor and anisocytosis.\\n\\nConsidering the patient's symptoms, nutritional deficiencies are a possible cause. The limited diet may not provide adequate iron, which is essential for the production of hemoglobin. Iron deficiency anemia is characterized by anisocytosis and central pallor on the peripheral blood smear.\\n\\nFolic acid deficiency (A) can cause megaloblastic anemia, which is not supported by the patient's blood smear results.\\n\\nIntravascular hemolysis (B) would likely present with hemolytic anemia, which is not indicated by the patient's blood smear.\\n\\nImpaired erythropoietin production (C) is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and diet.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms is iron deficiency (D).\\n\\nAnswer: D\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

            "content": "The physical examination complements the history. Orthostatic hypotension and reduced skin turgor indicate intravascular fluid loss. Pulmonary abnormalities raise concern for aspiration of vomitus. Abdominal auscultation may reveal absent bowel sounds with ileus. High-pitched rushes suggest bowel obstruction, whereas a succussion splash upon abrupt lateral movement of the patient is found with gastroparesis or pyloric obstruction. Tenderness or involuntary guarding raises suspicion of inflammation, whereas fecal blood suggests mucosal injury from ulcer, ischemia, or tumor. Neurologic disease presents with papilledema, visual field loss, or focal neural abnormalities. Neoplasm is suggested by palpation of masses or adenopathy."

Case 3: Blood on the Toothbrush Patient Presentation: LT is an 84-year-old man whose gums have been bleeding for several months. Focused History: LT is a widower and lives alone in a suburban community on the East Coast. He no longer drives. His two children live on the West Coast and come east infrequently. Since the death of his wife 11 months ago, he has been isolated and finds it hard to get out of the house. His appetite has changed, and he is content with cereal, coffee, and packaged snacks. Chewing is difficult."

            "content": "During a routine check and on two follow-up visits, a 45-year-old man was found to have high blood pressure (160\u2013165/95\u2013100 mm Hg). His physician initially prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic commonly used to treat hyper-tension. His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic. Because the patient had elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, hydrochlorothiazide was replaced with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril lowered his blood pressure to almost normotensive levels. However, after several weeks on enalapril, the patient returned complaining of a persistent cough. In addition, some signs of angioedema were detected. How does enalapril lower blood pressure? Why does it occasionally cause coughing and angioedema? What other drugs could be used to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and decrease blood pressure,"

He had had limited instruction on how to manage his dia-betes. He had peripheral neuropathy, proteinuria, low HDL cholesterol levels, and hypertension. The patient underwent multifactorial intervention targeting his weight, glucose levels, and blood pressure. He was advised to stop smoking. He attended structured diabetes classes and received indi-vidualized instruction from a diabetes educator and a dieti-tian. Metformin therapy was reinitiated and his insulin doses were reduced. The patient was then given the GLP1 receptor agonist, exenatide. The patient lost about 8 kg in weight over the next 3 years and was able to stop his insulin. He had excellent control with an HbA1c of 6.5 % on a combination of metformin, exenatide, and glimepiride. His antihyperten-sive therapy was optimized and his urine albumin excretion declined to 1569 mg/g creatinine. This case"

            "content": "History and Physical Examination The chest discomfort, often severe enough to be described as frank pain, is typically located in the sub-sternal region or sometimes in the epigastrium, and radiates to the left arm, left shoulder, and/or neck. Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."

            "content": "INITIAL APPROACH History and Physical Examination Symptoms and overt signs of kidney disease are often subtle or absent until renal failure supervenes. Thus, the diagnosis of kidney disease often surprises patients and may be a cause of skepticism and denial. Particular aspects of the history that are germane to renal disease include a history of hypertension (which can cause CKD or more commonly be a consequence of CKD), diabetes mellitus, abnormal urinalyses, and problems with pregnancy such as preeclampsia or early pregnancy loss. A careful drug history should be elicited: patients may not volunteer use of analgesics, for example. Other drugs to consider include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, antimicrobials, chemotherapeutic agents, antiretroviral agents, proton pump inhibitors, phosphate-containing bowel cathartics, and lithium. In evaluating the uremic syndrome, questions about appetite, weight loss, nausea, hiccups, peripheral edema,"

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."
