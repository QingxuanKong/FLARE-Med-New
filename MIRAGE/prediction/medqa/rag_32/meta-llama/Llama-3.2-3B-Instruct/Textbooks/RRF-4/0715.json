    "question": "A mother brings her 6-year-old daughter to the pediatrician to discuss her child's sleeping troubles. Three times now in the last month the child has begun screaming and crying in the middle of the night. When the parents rush to the child's room, they find her crying inconsolably. They try to ask her what is wrong, but she does not respond and persists crying for approximately 20 minutes, after which she goes back to sleeping comfortably. Upon awaking the following morning, she has no recollection of the night's events. Which of the following is true about these episodes?",
    "options": {
        "A": "They will be persistent into adulthood",
        "B": "They occur only during non-REM sleep",
        "C": "They are associated with child abuse",
        "D": "They are associated with later development of a mood disorder"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the symptoms described in the scenario: The child screams and cries in the middle of the night, becomes inconsolable, and has no recollection of the event in the morning. This suggests a sleep disorder that occurs during NREM sleep, as the child does not remember the episode, unlike nightmares which occur during REM sleep. The child's behavior during the episode, such as screaming and crying, is also consistent with sleep terrors. The fact that the child goes back to sleeping comfortably after the episode also suggests that it is a sleep disorder that is self-limiting and not a sign of a more serious underlying condition. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. They will be persistent into adulthood - This is not necessarily true. While some children may outgrow sleep terrors, others may continue to experience them into adulthood. B. They occur only during non-REM sleep - This is true. Sleep terrors occur during NREM sleep, specifically stage 3 or 4, which is also known as slow-wave or deep sleep. C. They are associated with child abuse - There is no indication in the scenario that the child's behavior is a result of child abuse. The child's parents rush to the room to comfort the child, and the child does not respond, but this does not necessarily imply abuse. D. They are associated with later development of a mood disorder - There is no clear link between sleep terrors and the development of a mood disorder. Sleep terrors and mood disorders are distinct conditions that can co-occur, but they are not directly related. Based on the information provided, the most accurate statement is that sleep terrors occur only during non-REM sleep.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

It usually occurs soon after falling asleep, during stage 3 or 4 sleep and therefore is not aligned with nightmares. The child awakens abruptly in a state of intense fright, screaming or moaning, with marked tachycardia (150 to 170 beats/min) and deep, rapid respirations. Children with night terrors are often sleepwalkers as well, and both kinds of attack may occur simultaneously. The entire episode lasts several minutes and in the morning the child recalls nothing of it or only a vague unpleasant dream. It has been suggested that night terrors and somnambulism represent impaired or partial arousal from deep sleep, as EEGs taken during such episodes show a waking type of mixed frequency and alpha pattern. Children with night terrors and somnambulism do not show an increased incidence of psychologic abnormalities and tend to outgrow these disorders. The persistence of such problems into adult life, however, has, in a"

Sleep terrors are best managed by minimal intervention, because conversation with the child is impossible during the episode. Anticipatory brief awakening of the child shortly before the typical occurrence of a parasomnia may be effective in aborting the event. Children with frequent or prolonged parasomnias may need a sleep study to evaluate for possible coexisting sleep disorders or nocturnal seizures. Medications that suppress slow-wave sleep may be indicated in severe cases. Circadian rhythm disorders are also treated by ensuring sleephygiene practices and gradual resetting of the biologic clock.Bedtime fading involves allowing the child to go to bed at thetime he or she naturally feels tired, then gradually advancingthe bedtime forward over the course of several weeks."

            "content": "Much can be done to prevent colic, beginning with education ofprospective parents about the normal pattern of infant crying.Prospective parents often imagine that their infant will cry onlybriefly for hunger. Increased contact and carrying of the infantin the weeks before the onset of colic may decrease the duration of crying episodes. Similarly other soothing strategies may be more effective if the infant has experienced them before theonset of excessive crying. Infants who have been tightly swaddled for sleep and rest during the first weeks of life often calmto swaddling during a crying episode; this is not true for infantswho have not experienced swaddling before a crying episode.Parents also can be coached to learn to read their infant\u2019s cues of hunger, discomfort, boredom, or overstimulation. It is important to understand that there are times when the infant\u2019s cry isnot interpretable, and caregivers can do only their best."

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

            "content": "Choose the ONE best answer. For Questions 26.1 and 26.2, use the following scenario. A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."
