    "question": "A 17-year-old high school student was in shop class when he accidentally sawed off his pointer finger while making a bird house. He fainted when he realized his finger had been cut off. The teacher immediately transported the patient to the emergency department and he arrived within 20 minutes. He has a past medical history of asthma, and his only medication is an albuterol inhaler. The patient's current blood pressure is 122/78 mmHg. Analgesics are administered. The teacher states that he left the amputated finger in the classroom, but that the principal would be transporting it to the hospital. Which of the following is the correct method of transporting the amputated finger?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Submerge the finger in ice water",
        "B": "Wrap the finger in moist gauze",
        "C": "Wrap finger in moist gauze, put in a plastic bag, and place on ice",
        "D": "Wrap the finger in moist gauze and submerge in ice water"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct method of transporting the amputated finger, we need to consider the best practices for preserving the tissue and preventing infection. The finger has been amputated and is being transported to the hospital, so it needs to be kept cool and moist to slow down the metabolic processes and prevent tissue damage. Submerging the finger in ice water (A) could cause the tissue to freeze, which would be detrimental. Wrapping the finger in moist gauze and submerging it in ice water (D) is also not recommended as it may cause the tissue to freeze. Wrapping the finger in moist gauze and placing it on ice (B) may not be enough to keep the tissue cool. Therefore, the most appropriate method is to wrap the finger in moist gauze, put it in a plastic bag, and place it on ice (C), which will help to keep the tissue cool and moist while preventing bacterial contamination. This method is recommended by the American College of Surgeons and the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The more senior student said to the freshman that he would bet him $50 that he could not lift a matchbook with a finger. The freshman placed $50 on the table and the bet was on. The senior medical student told the freshman to make a fist and place it in a palm-downward position, so that the middle phalanges of the fingers were in direct contact with the bar counter. He was then told to extend his middle finger so that it stuck forward while maintaining the middle phalanges of the index finger, the ring finger, and the little finger on the bar surface. A matchbook was placed on top of the freshman\u2019s middle fingernail and he was told to flip it. He couldn\u2019t. He lost the $50. Extension of the index, middle, ring, and little fingers is performed by the extensor digitorum muscle."

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

            "content": "A 20-year-old man visited his family doctor because he had a cough. A chest radiograph demonstrated translucent notches along the inferior border of ribs III to VI (eFig. 3.119). He was referred to a cardiologist and a diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta was made. The rib notching was caused by dilated collateral intercostal arteries. Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. This narrowing can markedly reduce blood flow to the lower body. Many of the vessels above the narrowing therefore enlarge due to the increased pressure so that blood can reach the aorta below the level of the narrowing. Commonly, the internal thoracic, superior epigastric, and musculophrenic arteries enlarge anteriorly. These arteries supply the anterior intercostal arteries, which anastomose with the posterior intercostal arteries that allow blood to flow retrogradely into the aorta. Enlargement of the intertcostal vessels results in notching of the ribs."

            "content": "A 19-year-old college freshman began drinking alcohol at 8:30 pm during a hazing event at his new fraternity. Between 8:30 and approximately midnight, he and several other pledges consumed beer and a bottle of whiskey, and then he consumed most of a bottle of rum at the urging of upperclassmen. The young man complained of feeling nau-seated, lay down on a couch, and began to lose conscious-ness. Two upperclassmen carried him to a bedroom, placed him on his stomach, and positioned a trash can nearby. Approximately 10 minutes later, the freshman was found unconscious and covered with vomit. There was a delay in treatment because the upperclassmen called the college police instead of calling 911. After the call was transferred to 911, emergency medical technicians responded quickly and discovered that the young man was not breathing and that he had choked on his vomit. He was rushed to the hospital, where he remained in a coma for 2 days before ultimately being pronounced dead. The"

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"
