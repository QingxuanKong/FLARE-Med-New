Abnormal values are confirmed using quantitative analysis of plasma amino acids. Dietary phenylalanine restriction is usually instituted if blood phenylalanine levels are >360 \u03bcmol/L (6 mg/dL). Treatment consists of a special diet low in phenylalanine and supplemented with tyrosine, since tyrosine becomes an essential amino acid in phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. With therapy, plasma phenylalanine concentrations should be maintained between 120 and 360 \u03bcmol/L (2 and 6 mg/dL). Dietary restriction should be continued and monitored indefinitely.

            "content": "Many female patients with PKU who receive dietary treatment beginning early in life reach childbearing age and are clinically normal. Most of them have marked hyperphenylalaninemia, because dietary treatment is discontinued after they reach adulthood. Between 75% and 90% of children born to such women are mentally retarded and microcephalic, and 15% have congenital heart disease, even though the infants themselves are heterozygotes. This syndrome, termed maternal PKU, results from the teratogenic effects of phenylalanine or its metabolites that cross the placenta and affect specific fetal organs during development. The presence and severity of the fetal anomalies directly correlate with the maternal phenylalanine level, so it is imperative that maternal dietary restriction of phenylalanine be initiated before conception and continued throughout pregnancy."

            "content": "Organic Acidurias of Infancy These have been divided into ketotic and nonketotic types. Most of these disorders are included in newborn screening. Among the ketotic types, the main one is propionic acidemia. This is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a primary defect in organic acid metabolism that is expressed clinically by episodes of vomiting, lethargy, coma, convulsions, hypertonia, and respiratory difficulty. The onset is in the neonatal or early infantile period; in time, psychomotor retardation becomes evident. Death usually occurs within a few months despite dietary treatment. Propionic acid, glycine, various forms of fatty acids, and butanone are elevated in the serum. As with other ketotic organic acidurias, high protein intake induces ketotic attacks. Marked restriction of dietary protein (specifically leucine) may prevent attacks of ketoacidosis and permit relatively good psychomotor development."

            "content": "The biochemical abnormality in PKU is an inability to convert phenylalanine into tyrosine. In normal children, less than 50% of the dietary intake of phenylalanine is necessary for protein synthesis. The remainder is converted to tyrosine by the phenylalanine hydroxylase system ( Fig. 7.7 ). When phenylalanine metabolism is blocked because of a lack of PAH enzyme, shunt pathways come into play, yielding several intermediates that are excreted in large amounts in the urine and in the sweat. These impart a strong musty or mousy odor to affected infants. It is believed that excess phenylalanine or its metabolites contribute to the brain damage in PKU. Concomitant lack of tyrosine ( Fig. 7.7 ), a precursor of melanin, is responsible for the light color of hair and skin."

            "content": "more than 18 years, reported that maintenance of serum phenylalanine levels in the recommended range between 2 and 6 mg/dL signiicantly reduced the fetal abnormality risk and resulted in childhood IQ scores in the normal range (Koch, 2003; Platt, 2000). Preconceptional counseling and consultation with providers from experienced PKU centers is recommended."
