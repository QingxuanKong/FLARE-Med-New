    "question": "A 27-year-old gentleman is brought into the ED after being stabbed in the back by a knife. In addition to the pain from the wound, he complains of weakness in his left leg. Upon physical examination you find that he has no other visible injuries; however, he has 2/5 strength in the left lower extremity. Complete neurologic exam also finds a deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity as well as a loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity. Which of the following lesions would result in the syndrome described?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a syndrome that involves a combination of motor weakness, sensory loss, and specific sensory modalities. The motor weakness is localized to the left lower extremity, while the sensory loss is described as a deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity, and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right lower extremity. This pattern of sensory loss is characteristic of a lateral medullary syndrome, also known as Wallenberg syndrome. This syndrome typically results from a lesion in the lateral medulla oblongata, which is the part of the brainstem that controls the function of the spinal cord. Given the location of the lesion, the most likely answer is a lesion to the left cord, as the lateral medulla oblongata is supplied by the left vertebral artery. The correct answer is therefore D.

These symptoms precede weakness and may be mistaken for lumbar disc disease, back strain, and orthopedic diseases. A few patients describe burning in the fingers and toes, and if this appears as an early symptom, it may become a persistent problem. Despite sensory symptoms, sensory loss is variable during the first days and may initially be barely detectable so that the typical case has the character of a predominantly motor neuropathy. By the end of a week, vibration and joint position sense in the toes and fingers are usually reduced; when such loss is present, deep sensibility (touch-pressure-vibration) tends to be more affected than superficial (pain-temperature)."

Physical findings include loss of pulses distal to the occlusion, cyanosis or pallor, mottling, decreased skin temperature, muscle stiffening, loss of sensation, weakness, and/or absent deep tendon reflexes. If acute arterial occlusion occurs in the presence of an adequate collateral circulation, as is often the case in acute graft occlusion, the symptoms and findings may be less impressive. In this situation, the patient complains about an abrupt decrease in the distance walked before claudication occurs or of modest pain and paresthesia.

            "content": "Harry W. Lampiris, MD, & Daniel S. Maddix, Pharm D The patient is a 37-year-old African-American man who lives in San Jose, California. He was recently incarcerated near Bakersfield, California and returned to Oakland about 3 months ago. He is currently experiencing one month of severe headache and double vision. He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

            "content": "A 45-year-old man with diabetes mellitus visited his nurse because he had an ulcer on his foot that was not healing despite daily dressings. Diabetes can lead to vascular disease of large and medium arteries, narrowing the lumen and reducing blood supply to the extremities, thereby impairing healing. In addition, diabetes can also affect blood supply to nerves, which leads to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy results in reduced sensation, and therefore minor injuries can often go unnoticed. This patient has developed an ulcer on his heel, which is a pressure point and likely to be under repeated strain. The nurse examined the ulcer and found that the ulcer was looking infected with pus at the base of the ulcer and asked for a specialist orthopedic opinion, who requested an x-ray and an MRI. The MRI and x-ray both demonstrated infection invading into the calcaneus with destruction of the bone (Fig. 6.141A,B)."

            "content": "Most patients, however, are symptomatic and have weakness, paresthesias, and pain as the usual complaints. The symptoms are insidious in onset and slowly progressive, but occasionally they seem to evolve or to worsen rapidly over a matter of days. The initial symptoms are usually referred to the distal portions of the limbs and progress proximally if the illness remains untreated. The feet are always affected earlier and more severely than the hands. Usually some aspect of motor disability is part of the chief complaint, but in about one-third of the patients the main complaints are pain and paresthesias. It is this painful syndrome that has been the most prominent feature in the patients we have encountered. The discomfort takes several forms: a dull, constant ache in the feet or legs; sharp and lancinating pains, momentary in duration, like those of tabes dorsalis; sensations of cramping or tightness in the muscles of the feet and calves; or band-like feelings around the legs."

            "content": "A primarily neurologic problem may characterize the thoracic outlet syndrome. There is slight wasting and weakness of the hypothenar, interosseous, adductor pollicis, and deep flexor muscles of the fourth and fifth fingers (i.e., the muscles innervated by the lower trunk of the brachial plexus and ulnar nerve). Weakness of the flexor muscles of the forearm may be present in advanced cases. Tendon reflexes are usually preserved. In addition, most patients complain of an intermittent aching of the arm, particularly of the ulnar side, and about half of them complain also of numbness and tingling along the ulnar border of the forearm and hand. A loss of superficial sensation in these areas is variable. It may be possible to reproduce the sensory symptoms by firm pressure just above the clavicle or by traction on the arm. Vascular features are often absent or minimal in patients with the neurologic form of the syndrome."

            "content": "The neurologic examination includes a search for focal weakness or muscle atrophy, focal reflex changes, diminished sensation in the legs, or signs of spinal cord injury. The examiner should be alert to the possibility of breakaway weakness, defined as fluctuations in the maximum power generated during muscle testing. Breakaway weakness may be due to pain or a combination of pain and an underlying true weakness. Breakaway weakness without pain is almost always due to a lack of effort. In uncertain cases, electromyography (EMG) can determine if true weakness due to nerve tissue injury is present. Findings with specific lumbosacral nerve root lesions are shown in Table 22-2 and are discussed below. LABORATORY, IMAgINg, AND EMg STuDIES"
