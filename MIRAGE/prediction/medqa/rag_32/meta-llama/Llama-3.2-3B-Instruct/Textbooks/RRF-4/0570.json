    "question": "A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of pain in his right knee for the past week. The pain is exacerbated by jogging and climbing up stairs. He has no history of trauma to the knee. He is otherwise healthy. He is an active member of his school's gymnastics team. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the right knee shows a tender swelling at the proximal tibia; range of motion is full. Knee extension against resistance causes pain in the anterior proximal tibia. The remainder of the examinations shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the right knee shows anterior tibial soft tissue swelling with fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 13-year-old boy with pain in his right knee that worsens with activities such as jogging and climbing stairs. The examination reveals a tender swelling at the proximal tibia, pain with knee extension against resistance, and X-ray findings of anterior tibial soft tissue swelling with fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity. These findings are suggestive of Osgood-Schlatter disease, a common cause of knee pain in adolescents. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The next step should be to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of knee pain. Joint aspiration may be performed to evaluate for synovial fluid analysis and to rule out other conditions such as septic arthritis. However, given the clinical presentation and X-ray findings, joint aspiration is not the most appropriate next step. Administration of oral pain medication such as ketorolac may be considered for symptom management, but it does not address the underlying cause of the condition. Open reduction of the tuberosity is not indicated as the fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity is not causing a significant displacement that requires surgical intervention. Application of a lower leg cast may be considered for symptom management, but it does not address the underlying cause of the condition. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform joint aspiration to evaluate for synovial fluid analysis and to rule out other possible causes of knee pain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

A careful history should delineate the chronology of the knee complaint and whether there are predisposing conditions, trauma, or medications that might underlie the complaint. For example, patellofemoral disease (e.g., OA) may cause anterior knee pain that worsens with climbing stairs. Observation of the patient\u2019s gait is also important. The knee should be carefully inspected in the upright (weight-bearing) and supine positions for swelling, erythema, malalignment, visible trauma, muscle wasting, and leg length discrepancy. The most common malalignment in the knee is genu varum (bowlegs) or genu valgum (knock-knees) resulting from asymmetric cartilage loss medially or laterally.

During his tumble he heard an audible \u201cclick.\u201d After recovering from his spill, he developed tremendous pain in his right knee. He was unable to carry on skiing for that day, and by the time he returned to his chalet, his knee was significantly swollen. He went immediately to see an orthopedic surgeon. The orthopedic surgeon carefully reviewed the mechanism of injury."

The child may have kissing kneecaps due to increased internal rotation of the femur. While walking, the entire leg will appear internally rotated, and with running the child may appear to have an egg-beatergait where the legs flip laterally. The flexed hip will have internal rotation increased to 80\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 (normal 60\u00b0 to 70\u00b0) and external rotation limited to about 10\u00b0.

The slippage occurs through the weak zone (hypertrophic zone) of the growth plate. When slippage occurs in young patients, check for endocrine disorders such as hypothyroid-ism, renal osteodystrophy, and growth hormone deficiency. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is associated with African-American heritage and obesity, and it is more com-mon in boys than in girls. One-quarter of cases are bilateral. In patients with endocrine etiology, the condition is usually bilateral. Patients generally present with groin and anterior thigh pain, and the patient may have antalgic gait and a limp. Patient may present with knee pain that can lead to missing the diagnosis. In pediatric patients with knee pain, the ipsi-lateral hip should be assessed as well.Examination of the patient will show obligatory"

It is often tender in patients with fibromyalgia, obesity, and knee OA. Other forms of bursitis may also present as knee pain. The prepatellar bursa is superficial and is located over the inferior portion of the patella. The infrapatellar bursa is deeper and lies beneath the patellar ligament before its insertion on the tibial tubercle. Internal derangement of the knee may result from trauma or degenerative processes. Damage to the meniscal cartilage (medial or lateral) frequently presents as chronic or intermittent knee pain.

            "content": "OA is the most common cause of chronic knee pain in persons over age 45, but the differential diagnosis is long. Inflammatory arthritis is likely if there is prolonged morning stiffness and many other joints are affected. Bursitis occurs commonly around knees and hips. A physical examination should focus on whether tenderness is over the joint line (at the junction of the two bones around which the joint is articulating) or is outside of it. Anserine bursitis, medial and distal to the knee, is an extremely common cause of chronic knee pain that may respond to a glucocorticoid injection. Prominent nocturnal pain in the absence of end-stage OA merits a distinct workup. For hip pain, OA can be detected by loss of internal rotation on passive movement, and pain isolated to an area lateral to the hip joint usually reflects the presence of trochanteric bursitis. No blood tests are routinely indicated for workup of patients with OA unless symptoms and signs suggest inflammatory arthritis."
