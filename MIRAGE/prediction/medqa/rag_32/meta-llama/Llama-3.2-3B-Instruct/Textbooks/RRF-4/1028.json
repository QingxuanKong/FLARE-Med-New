    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to a surgeon with painless swelling over his right leg. He noticed the swelling 6 months ago, but he ignored it because it was painless. However, he is now concerned as the swelling has been increasing in size over the last 6 months. He also mentions that his father and brother have lipomas over the extremities. On physical examination, the swelling is well-circumscribed and non-tender, measuring approximately 4 x 5 cm. After evaluation, the surgeon performs a surgical resection of the tumor and sends the tissue for histopathological examination. The pathologist reports the tumor to be a liposarcoma rather than a lipoma. Which of the following enzymes is most likely to show increased activity in the cells of this patient\u2019s tumor?",

Lipomas are benign tumors of fat, while liposarcomas are malignant tumors of adipose tissue. Lipomas are well-circumscribed, painless, and slow-growing, whereas liposarcomas are often deep-seated, painful, and rapidly growing. Given that the patient's tumor is a liposarcoma, we need to identify an enzyme that is associated with malignant transformation or tumor progression. Telomerase is an enzyme that is often elevated in malignant tumors, including liposarcomas, as it is involved in the lengthening of telomeres, which is a hallmark of cancer cells. The other options are not directly related to the malignant transformation of lipomas to liposarcomas. Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme involved in bone growth and development, RNase is a ribonuclease involved in RNA degradation, and superoxide dismutase is an antioxidant enzyme involved in protecting cells from oxidative stress. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Telomerase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Both epidermoid inclusion cysts and lipomas are very common mobile subcutaneous nodules\u2014the former are rubbery and drain cheese-like material (sebum and keratin) if incised. Lipomas are firm and somewhat lobulated on palpation. When extensive facial epidermoid inclusion cysts develop during childhood or there is a family history of such lesions, the patient should be examined for other signs of Gardner syndrome, including osteomas and desmoid tumors. Rheumatoid nodules are firm 0.5to 4-cm nodules that favor the extensor aspect of joints, especially the elbows. They are seen in ~20% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 6% of patients with Still\u2019s disease. Biopsies of the nodules show palisading granulomas. Similar lesions that are smaller and shorter-lived are seen in rheumatic fever."

At the time of surgery, the initial dissection mobilized the kidney on its vascular pedicle; however, a large portion of tumor became detached in the inferior vena cava. The tumor embolus passed through the right atrium and right ventricle and occluded the pulmonary artery. This could not be cleared at the time of surgery, and the patient succumbed. A 65-year-old businessman came to the emergency department with severe lower abdominal pain that was predominantly central and left sided. He had pain radiating into the left loin, and he also noticed he was passing gas and fecal debris as he urinated. A CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis was performed (eFig. 4.191)."

A 33-year-old man was playing cricket for his local Sunday team. As the new bowler pitched the ball short, it bounced higher than he anticipated and hit him on the side of his head. He immediately fell to the ground unconscious, but after about 30 seconds he was helped to his feet and felt otherwise well. It was noted he had some bruising around his temple. He decided not to continue playing and went to watch the match from the side. Over the next hour he became extremely sleepy and was eventually unrousable. He was rushed to hospital. When he was admitted to hospital, the patient\u2019s breathing was shallow and irregular and it was necessary to intubate him. A skull radiograph demonstrated a fracture in the region of the pterion. No other abnormality was demonstrated other than minor soft tissue bruising over the left temporal fossa. A CT scan was performed."

Liposarco-mas may contain both well-differentiated, mature adipocytes and early, undifferentiated cells (Fig. F9.2.1). Tumors containing more cells in earlier stages of differenti-ation are more aggressive and more frequently metasta-size. Typically, liposarcomas are surgically removed, but if a tumor has already metastasized, then both chemotherapy and radiation therapy can be utilized as a preor postsurgi-cal treatment. Although the term lipoma relates primarily to white adi-pose tissue tumors, tumors of brown adipose tissue are also found. Not surprisingly, these are called hibernomas. They are rare, benign, and slow-growing soft tissue tumors of brown fat most commonly arising in the periscapular region, axillary fossa, neck, or mediastinum. Most hibernomas contain a mixture of white and brown adipose tissue; pure hibernomas are very rare."

A 62-year-old man came to the emergency department with swelling of both legs and a large left varicocele (enlarged and engorged varicose veins around the left testis and within the left pampiniform plexus of veins). The patient was known to have a left renal cell carcinoma and was due to have this operated on the following week. Anatomically it is possible to link all of the findings with the renal cell carcinoma by knowing the biology of the tumor. Renal cell carcinoma tends to grow steadily and predictably. Typically, when the tumor is less than 3 to 4 cm, it remains confined to the kidney. Large tumors have the propensity to grow into the renal vein, the inferior vena cava and the right atrium and through the heart into the pulmonary artery."

Afterward an appreciable subcutaneous hematoma developed in the ankle. The diagnostic possibilities include a bone or soft tissue injury. A bony injury was excluded because there was no bone tenderness. The patient had a significant soft tissue injury. On examination he had significant swelling of the ankle with a subcutaneous hematoma. He was unable to stand on tiptoe on the right leg, and in the prone position a palpable defect was demonstrated within the calcaneal tendon. A diagnosis of calcaneal tendon rupture was made. This patient has a typical history of ruptured calcaneal tendon and the clinical findings support this. Magnetic resonance imaging was carried out and confirmed the diagnosis (eFig. 6.144). The patient underwent an operative repair. The tendon healed well, though the patient has not gone back to playing squash."

Lymphedema of the lower extremity initially involves the foot and gradually progresses up the leg so that the entire limb becomes edematous (Fig. 303-2). In the early stages, the edema is soft and pits easily with pressure. Over time, subcutaneous adipose tissue accumulates, the limb enlarges further and loses its normal contour, and the toes appear square. Thickening of the skin is detected by Stemmer\u2019s sign, which is the inability to tent the skin at the base of the toes. Peau d\u2019orange is a term used to describe dimpling of the skin, resembling that of an orange peel, caused by lymphedema. In the chronic stages, the edema no longer pits and the limb acquires a woody texture as the tissues become indurated and fibrotic. The International Society of Lymphology describes four"

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."
