He reports that for the last several years he has noticed this \"shaking\" when he brushes his teeth and prepares a cup of coffee in the morning. The shaking then gradually improves over the course of the day. His past medical history is otherwise notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His only home medication is pravastatin.

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a high-frequency bilateral hand tremor that is more pronounced when performing fine motor tasks such as brushing teeth and preparing a cup of coffee. This type of tremor is typically associated with essential tremor (ET), which is a common movement disorder characterized by a resting tremor that is most noticeable when the limb is at rest. The tremor improves with voluntary movement. The patient's family history of Parkinson's disease is also relevant, as Parkinson's disease is a movement disorder that can cause tremors, but the tremor in ET is typically more prominent when the limb is at rest and improves with movement. The patient's age, lack of other neurological symptoms, and the absence of rigidity, bradykinesia, or postural instability make Parkinson's disease less likely. Therefore, the most appropriate medication for this patient is a beta-blocker, which can help reduce the amplitude of the tremor. Propranolol is a commonly used beta-blocker for the treatment of essential tremor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

As described by Elble, the tremor frequency diminishes slightly with age while its amplitude increases. The tremor practically always begins in the hands and is said to be symmetrical; in approximately 15 percent of patients, however, it appears first in the dominant hand and an emerging concept has been that it is more often asymmetric than stated in older descriptions. It is also possible, of course, that the patient does not find a mild bilateral tremor troublesome until it affects activities that are dependent on the dominant hand.

On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

Subtle impairment of coordination or tandem walking may be present, and disturbances of hearing, cognition, personality, mood, and olfaction have also been described, but usually the neurologic examination is normal aside from tremor. The major differential is a dystonic tremor (see below) or PD. PD can usually be differentiated from ET based on the presence of bradykinesia, rigidity, micrographia, and other parkinsonian features. However, the examiner should be aware that PD patients may have a postural tremor and ET patients may develop a rest tremor. These typically begin after a latency of a few seconds (emergent tremor). The examiner must take care to differentiate the effect of tremor on measurement of tone in ET from the cogwheel rigidity found in PD."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

However, folate has no effect on the neurologic damage caused by B12 deficiency. Over time, then, the neurologic effects can become severe and irreversible. Thus, folate can mask a deficiency of B12 and prevent treatment until the neuropathy is apparent. III. Focused Cases Case 1: Microcytic Anemia Patient Presentation: ME is a 24-year-old man who is being evaluated as a follow-up to a preplacement medical evaluation he had prior to starting his new job.

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."

If the patient is unobservant or imprecise in descriptions, a helpful tactic is to provoke sensations by rapid rotation, or by asking the patient to stoop for a minute and straighten up; having him stand relaxed for 3 min and checking his blood pressure for orthostatic effect; and, particularly, having him hyperventilate for 3 min. Should the patient be unable to distinguish among these several types of induced dizziness or to ascertain the similarity of one of the types to his own condition, the history is probably too inaccurate for purposes of diagnosis."

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

            "content": "tremor in repose is a more accurate description. Volitional movement dampens it momentarily. The rhythmic beat coincides with an alternating burst of activity in agonist and antagonist muscles in the electromyogram (EMG) and sometimes palpable by the examiner; hence, the description alternating tremor is applied. The arm, jaw, tongue, eyelids, and foot are less often involved. Even the least degree of tremor is felt during passive movement of a rigid part (cogwheel phenomenon, or Negro sign, or at least this is the ostensible explanation for cogwheeling but there has been a dissociation of these two signs in many of our patients). The tremor shows surprising fluctuations in severity and is aggravated by walking and excitement, but its frequency remains constant (Hunker and Abbs). It bears repetition that one side of the body is typically involved before the other with tremor and rigidity, and the tremor in particular remains asymmetrical as the illness advances."
