    "question": "A 74-year-old man has been treated for prostate cancer for the past 6 months. He is on an experimental drug (drug X) that is used to reduce the action of testosterone by blocking the androgen receptor. Since the initiation of therapy, the growth of the cancerous tissue has slowed. This medication is known to be excreted by the kidneys at the current dose that he is taking. The patient has no significant complaints, except for excessive sweating at times. On physical examination, a small area of tissue around his nipples is enlarged bilaterally. No other abnormal findings are present. Which of the following drugs most likely belongs to be the same class as drug X?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the mechanism of action of drug X and the other options. Drug X is used to reduce the action of testosterone by blocking the androgen receptor, which suggests that it is an antiandrogen. The patient's symptoms of excessive sweating and gynecomastia (enlarged breast tissue) are also consistent with antiandrogen therapy. We need to examine the other options to determine which one shares a similar mechanism of action. A. Leuprolide is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, which reduces testosterone production by the testes, not by blocking the androgen receptor. B. Finasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, which reduces dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels by blocking the conversion of testosterone to DHT, but it does not directly block the androgen receptor. C. Flutamide is an antiandrogen that directly blocks the androgen receptor, which would reduce the action of testosterone by blocking its binding to the receptor. This matches the mechanism of action of drug X. D. Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor, which reduces estrogen production by blocking the enzyme aromatase, and is primarily used in breast cancer treatment, not prostate cancer. Based on the mechanism of action, the correct answer is C. Flutamide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

This guidance is based on observations that testosterone promotes the growth of metastatic prostate cancer. Metastatic prostate cancer generally regresses after orchidectomy and androgen deprivation therapy. Androgen receptor signaling plays a central role in maintaining growth of normal prostate and prostate cancer. PSA levels are lower in hypogonadal men and increase after testosterone therapy. Prostate volume is lower in hypogonadal men and increases after testosterone therapy to levels seen in age-matched controls."

Diethylstilbestrol (DES) acting as an estrogen at the level of the hypothalamus to downregulate hypothalamic luteinizing hormone (LH) production results in decreased elaboration of testosterone by the testicle. For this reason, orchiectomy is equally as effective as moderate-dose DES, inducing responses in 80% of previously untreated patients with prostate cancer but without the prominent cardiovascular side effects of DES, including thrombosis and exacerbation of coronary artery disease. In the event that orchiectomy is not accepted by the patient, testicular androgen suppression can also be effected by luteinizing hormone\u2013releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists such as leuprolide and goserelin. These agents cause tonic stimulation of the LHRH receptor, with the loss of its normal pulsatile activation resulting in decreased output of LH by the anterior pituitary.

The suppression of circulating testosterone levels by a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist also does not affect intraprostatic androgen concentrations. Open-label trials and retrospective analyses of testosterone therapy in men with prostate cancer, who have undergone radical prostatectomy 7e-5 and have undetectable PSA levels after radical prostatectomy, have found very low rates of PSA recurrence.

Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

            "content": "Dutasteride has also been evaluated as a preventive agent for prostate cancer. The Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial was a randomized double-blind trial in which approximately 8200 men with an elevated PSA (2.5\u201310 ng/mL for men age 50\u201360 years and 3\u201310 ng/mL for men age 60 years or older) and negative prostate biopsy on enrollment received daily 0.5 mg of dutasteride or placebo. The trial found a statistically significant 23% relative risk reduction in the incidence of biopsy-detected prostate cancer in the dutasteride arm at 4 years of treatment (659 cases vs 858 cases, respectively). Overall, across years 1 through 4, there was no difference between the arms in the number of tumors with a Gleason score of 7 to 10; however, during years 3 and 4, there was a statistically significant difference in tumors with Gleason score of 8 to 10 in the dutasteride arm (12 tumors vs 1 tumor, respectively)."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia.

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

            "content": "Prostate cancer was the second cancer shown to be responsive to hormonal manipulation. The treatment of choice for patients with metastatic prostate cancer is elimination of testosterone production by the testes through either surgical or chemical castration. Bilateral orchiectomy or estrogen therapy in the form of diethylstilbestrol was previously used as first-line therapy. Presently, the use of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists\u2014including leuprolide and goserelin agonists, alone or in combination with an antiandrogen (eg, flutamide, bicalutamide, or nilutamide)\u2014 is the preferred approach (see Chapter 40). There appears to be no survival advantage of total androgen blockade using a combination of LHRH agonist and antiandrogen agent compared with single-agent therapy. Abiraterone, an inhibitor of steroid synthesis (see Chapter 39), has recently been approved. Hormonal treatment reduces symptoms\u2014especially bone pain\u2014in 70\u201380% of patients and may cause a significant"
