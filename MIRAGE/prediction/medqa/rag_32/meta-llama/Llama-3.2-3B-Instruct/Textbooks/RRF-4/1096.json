Her mother reports that the patient recently received a pair of fashionable silver earrings from her older sister as a birthday present. Physical examination is only significant for erythema and tenderness over the lobules of the ears bilaterally. Her vital signs show a blood pressure of 121/73 mm Hg, heart rate of 72/min, and a respiratory rate of 21/min. Her medical history is non-significant.

The patient presents with red scaly plaques over both ears after receiving a pair of silver earrings. This suggests an allergic reaction to the metal. Type I-hypersensitivity reactions are immediate allergic reactions that involve IgE antibodies, which are not typically associated with reactions to metals. Type III-immune complex-mediated reactions involve the formation of immune complexes, which can cause tissue damage, but this reaction seems to be localized to the skin and doesn't involve systemic symptoms. Type IV-cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reactions involve T-cells, which also don't seem to fit this localized reaction. Type IV reactions are often associated with contact dermatitis, which matches the symptoms described. Therefore, the most likely mechanism of this reaction is a Type IV-cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction, also known as contact dermatitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",
