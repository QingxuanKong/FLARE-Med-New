    "question": "A 3-week-old newborn is brought to the physician by his parents because of poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting over the past week. The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. His parents have tried to feed him every 4 hours, but the patient often spits up or refuses to eat. The patient was born at term and had his first bowel movement at 50 hours of life. He has since had one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 40th percentile for head circumference. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. When the finger is removed following a rectal exam, there is an explosive release of stool from the patient's rectum. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's consider the symptoms and examination findings presented in the scenario. The patient is a 3-week-old newborn with poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting, with greenish vomitus and a history of meconium ileus. The physical examination reveals a distended abdomen, small low-set ears, broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The explosive release of stool from the rectum following a rectal exam is a key finding. The abdominal x-ray shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Hirschsprung disease, a condition characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon. To confirm the diagnosis, a rectal suction biopsy is the most appropriate choice because it allows for the examination of the rectal tissue for the absence of ganglion cells, which is diagnostic of Hirschsprung disease. Anorectal manometry may also be used to assess the function of the rectal muscles, but it is not as definitive as a rectal suction biopsy. A CT scan of the abdomen or transabdominal ultrasonography may show the dilated colon, but they are not specific for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease. An x-ray of the abdomen may show the characteristic \"coffee-bean\" appearance of the colon, but it is not as sensitive as a rectal suction biopsy for confirming the diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Preterm neonates lose relatively more weight and regain their birthweight more slowly. Conversely, growth-restricted but otherwise healthy newborns regain their initial weight more quickly than those born preterm. With proper nourishment, birthweight of term newborns usually is regained by 10 days. For the irst 2 or 3 days after birth, the colon contains sot, brown-green meconium. his consists of desquamated epithelial cells from the intestinal tract, mucus, epidermal cells, and lanugo (fetal hair) that have been swallowed along with amnionic luid. The characteristic color results from bile pigments. During fetal life and for a few hours after birth, the intestinal contents are sterile, but bacteria quickly colonize the bowel contents."

As the intussusception progresses, and obstruction becomes prolonged, bilious vomiting becomes prominent, and the dilated, fatigued intestine generates less pressure and less pain. As the intussuscepted bowel is pulled further and further into the downstream intestine by motility, the mesentery is pulled with it and becomes stretched and compressed. The venous outflow from the intussusceptum is obstructed, leading to edema, weeping of fluid, and congestion with bleeding. Third space fluid losses and \u201ccurrant jelly\u201d stools result.

Infantile GER (\u201cspitting up\u201d) occurs in most infants and can be large in volume, but is effortless and these infants do not appear ill. Pyloric stenosis occurs in the first months of life and is characterized by steadily worsening, forceful vomiting that occurs immediately after feedings. A visibly distended stomach, often with visible peristaltic waves, is often seen before vomiting. Pyloric stenosis is more common in male infants; the family history may be positive.

Barium enema is the imaging study of choice and reveals a narrowed distal colon with proximal dilation. Plain films reveal distended bowel loops with a paucity of air in the rectum. Anorectal manometry detects a failure of the internal sphincter to relax after distention of the rectal lumen. It is typically used in atypical presentations or older children. Full-thickness rectal biopsy confirms the diagnosis and reveals absence of the myenteric (Auerbach\u2019s) plexus and submucosal (Meissner\u2019s) plexus along with hypertrophied nerve trunks enhanced with acetylcholinesterase stain. Traditionally a two-stage surgical repair is used involving the creation of a diverting colostomy at the time of diagnosis, followed several weeks later by a definitive \u201cpull-through\u201d procedure connecting the remaining colon to the rectum.

            "content": "Most cases of intestinal obstruction during pregnancy result from pressure of the growing uterus on intestinal adhesions. According to Davis and Bohon (1983), this more likely occurs around midpregnancy when the uterus becomes an abdominal organ; in the third trimester when the fetal head descends; or immediately postpartum when uterine size acutely shrinks. Perdue (1992) reported that 98 percent of afected pregnant women had either continuous or colicky abdominal pain, and 80 percent had nausea and vomiting. Abdominal tenderness was found in 70 percent, and abnormal bowel sounds noted in only 55 percent. Plain abdominal radiographs following soluble contrast showed evidence of obstruction in 90 percent of women (Fig. 54-3). Plain radiographs, however, are less accurate for diagnosing small-bowel obstruction, and we and others have found that CT and MR imaging can be diagnostic (Biswas, 2006; Essilie, 2007; McKenna, 2007). Colonoscopy can be both diagnostic and therapeutic for colonic"

These infants are colloqui-ally described as suffering from an \u201cNEC scare\u201d and represent a population of neonates who are at risk of developing more severe NEC if a more prolonged period of stress supervenes.Infants with Bell stage II have established NEC that is not immediately life-threatening. Clinical findings include abdomi-nal distention and tenderness, bilious nasogastric aspirate, and bloody stools. These findings indicate the development of intestinal ileus and mucosal ischemia, respectively. Abdominal examination may reveal a palpable mass indicating the pres-ence of an inflamed loop of bowel, diffuse abdominal tender-ness, cellulitis, and edema of the anterior abdominal wall. The infant may appear systemically ill, with decreased urine output, hypotension,"

Centers of ossiication have appeared in most fetal bones, and the fingers and toes have become diferentiated. Skin and nails develop, and scattered rudiments of hair appear. he external genitalia are beginning to show deinitive signs of male or female gender. he fetus begins to make spontaneous movements. Fetal growth slows at this time. The crown-rump length is 12 cm, and the fetal weight approximates 150 g (Hadlock, 1991). Practically speaing, the sonographic crown-rump length is not measured beyond 13 weeks, which corresponds to approximately 8.4 cm. Instead, biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length are measured. Fetal weight in the second and third trimesters is estimated from a combination of these measurements (Chap. 10, p. 184)."

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

            "content": "Stool form and consistency are well correlated with the time elapsed from the preceding defecation. Hard, pellety stools occur with slow transit, whereas loose, watery stools are associated with rapid transit. Both small pellety or very large stools are more difficult to expel than normal stools. The perception of hard stools or excessive straining is more difficult to assess objectively, and the need for enemas or digital disimpaction is a clinically useful way to corroborate the patient\u2019s perceptions of difficult defecation. Psychosocial or cultural factors may also be important. A person whose parents attached great importance to daily defecation will become greatly concerned when he or she misses a daily bowel movement; some children withhold stool to gain attention or because of fear of pain from anal irritation; and some adults habitually ignore or delay the call to have a bowel movement."
