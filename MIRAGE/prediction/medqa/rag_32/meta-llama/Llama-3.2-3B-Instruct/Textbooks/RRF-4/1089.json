    "question": "A 42-year-old man presents to your office complaining of right-sided facial swelling that has progressively worsened over the last month after returning from a trip to India. On examination, the patient has an obvious distortion of the facial features on the right without erythema or lymphadenopathy. A neurological exam reveals no deficits. His blood pressure is 115/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 65/min, and the temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (98.9\u00b0F). The patient states that he has been having trouble chewing his food, but is not experiencing any pain. The patient is up to date on all of his immunizations. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his facial swelling?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the cause of the patient's facial swelling, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and examination findings. The patient presents with progressive facial swelling on the right side, distortion of facial features without erythema or lymphadenopathy, and difficulty chewing without pain. The patient has returned from a trip to India, which may suggest an infectious etiology. The patient is up to date on all immunizations, making an infectious cause less likely. The patient's neurological exam is unremarkable, which suggests that the swelling is not due to a space-occupying lesion or a tumor. Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most likely cause of his facial swelling is a benign salivary gland tumor composed of stromal and epithelial tissue, such as a pleomorphic adenoma or a mucocele of the parotid gland. This type of tumor is common in the parotid gland and can cause facial swelling and distortion without pain. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination?

A clue that the patient has neurogenic OH is the aggravation or precipitation of OH by autonomic stressors (a meal, hot bath, or exercise). Neurologic examination should include mental status (neurodegenerative disorders), cranial nerves (impaired downgaze with progressive supranuclear palsy; abnormal pupils with Horner\u2019s or Adie\u2019s syndrome), motor tone (Parkinson\u2019s disease and parkinsonism), and sensation (polyneuropathies). In patients without a clear diagnosis initially, follow-up evaluations every few months or whenever symptoms worsen may reveal the underlying cause."

They are initiated by autophosphorylation of select tyrosine residues in their receptors. C. They are mediated by binding to adrenergic receptors, which are a class of nuclear receptors. D. They result in the activation of glycogen and triacylglycerol synthesis. Q3. NE bound to certain receptors causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. Why might NE be used clinically in the treatment of septic shock? Case 5: Sun Sensitivity Patient Presentation: AZ is a 6-year-old boy who is being evaluated for freckle-like areas of hyperpigmentation on his face, neck, forearms, and lower legs. Focused History: AZ\u2019s father reports that the boy has always been quite sensitive to the sun. His skin turns red (erythema) and his eyes hurt (photophobia) if he is exposed to the sun for any period of time."

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet.
