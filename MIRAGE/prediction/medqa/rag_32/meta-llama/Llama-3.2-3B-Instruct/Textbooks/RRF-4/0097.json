A urethral smear shows gram negative diplococci within white blood cells. The organism grows well when cultured on Thayer-Martin agar.

N. gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative diplococci bacterium that causes gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted infection. The patient's symptoms and the urethral smear showing gram-negative diplococci within white blood cells are consistent with gonococcal urethritis. The organism grows well on Thayer-Martin agar, which is a selective medium for N. gonorrhoeae. The patient's response to ceftriaxone, a cephalosporin antibiotic, indicates that the infection is caused by N. gonorrhoeae. However, the patient returns with the same infection one year later, suggesting that the patient did not develop lasting immunity. This suggests that the immune system was not able to clear the infection, which is consistent with the fact that N. gonorrhoeae is known to cause recurrent infections in some individuals. Now, let's evaluate the answer choices in light of this understanding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Pregnant patients: Treat asymptomatic bacteruria or symptomatic UTI with nitrofurantoin or cephalosporin \u00d7 3\u20137 days. Avoid f uoroquinolones. Confrm clearance with a repeat culture post-treatment. Patients with urosepsis should be hospitalized and initially treated with IV antibiotics. Consider broader coverage to include resistant GNRs or enterococcus. Prophylactic antibiotics may be given to women with uncomplicated recurrent UTIs. Check for prostatitis in men. Nearly 85% of community-acquired cases of pyelonephritis result from the same pathogens that cause cystitis. Cystitis and pyelonephritis have similar risk factors. \u25a0Signs and symptoms are similar to those of cystitis but show evidence of upper urinary tract disease."

            "content": "The following three brief scenarios of a patient with hemoptysis demonstrate three distinct patterns: A 46-year-old man presents to his internist with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

            "content": "LGV begins as a small painless papule that tends to ulcerate at the site of inoculation, often escaping attention. This primary lesion heals in a few days without scarring and is usually recognized as LGV only in retrospect. LGV strains of C. trachomatis have occasionally been recovered from genital ulcers and from the urethra of men and the endocervix of women who present with inguinal adenopathy; these areas may be the primary sites of infection in some cases. Proctitis is more common among people who practice receptive anal intercourse, and an elevated white blood cell count in anorectal smears may predict LGV in these patients. Ulcer formation may facilitate transmission of HIV infection and other sexually transmitted and blood-borne diseases."

The highest incidence in the United States is in 15to 24-year-old females and 20to 24-year-old males, and incidence rates differ by race. The organism causes infection at the site of acquisition, which commonly results in mucopurulent cervicitis and urethritis (see Table 116-1), but infection of the rectum and pharynx can also occur. Disseminated gonococcal infections can occur with hematogenous spread and results in petechial or pustular acral skin lesions, asymmetric arthralgia, tenosynovitis or septic arthritis, and, occasionally, endocarditis or meningitis. Perinatal transmission of maternal infection can lead to neonatal sepsis and meningitis (see Chapter 65) and ophthalmia neonatorum (see Chapter 119)."

The urine culture is refrigerated and delivered to the physician\u2019s office for confirmation of the diagnosis. When an established and reliable patient-provider relationship exists, the urine culture can be omitted as long as the symptomatic episodes respond completely to short-course therapy and are not followed by relapse."
