    "question": "A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a change in his behavior over the past few months. Initially, the patient was noted to be behaving inappropriately including using foul language and grabbing people unexpectedly. This has progressed to a worsening of his memory and trouble caring for himself. His temperature is 98.1\u00b0F (36.7\u00b0C), blood pressure is 162/103 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an elderly man who laughs inappropriately at times and who is a poor historian. When he is engaged in conversation, he exhibits word finding difficulty and is rather inattentive. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and behavioral changes. The patient is a 65-year-old man who has exhibited inappropriate behavior, such as using foul language and grabbing people unexpectedly, which has progressed to worsening memory and difficulty caring for himself. He also exhibits inappropriate laughter, word finding difficulty, and inattentiveness. These symptoms suggest a change in personality and cognitive function. Let's evaluate the options: A. Alzheimer dementia: This condition typically presents with memory loss, cognitive decline, and personality changes, but the patient's behavior seems to be more prominent in the early stages. B. Frontotemporal dementia: This condition is characterized by changes in personality, behavior, and language, often with relatively preserved memory. The patient's inappropriate behavior, laughter, and word finding difficulty are consistent with frontotemporal dementia. C. Kluver-Bucy syndrome: This syndrome is associated with bilateral temporal lobe lesions and typically presents with hyperorality, hypersexuality, and hypermetamorphosis, which are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms. D. Vascular dementia: This condition is caused by cerebrovascular disease and typically presents with step-wise cognitive decline, with memory loss and attention deficits, but the patient's behavioral changes seem more prominent. Based on the analysis, the most likely diagnosis is B. Frontotemporal dementia, given the prominent changes in personality, behavior, and language, with relatively preserved memory.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",

Within a few weeks or months, these symptoms become more prominent. When the patient is questioned, a long pause precedes each reply (abulia); at times the patient may not respond at all. Or, at the moment the examiner decides that the patient has not heard the question and prepares to repeat it, an appropriate answer is given, usually in few words. Moreover, the responses are often more intelligent than one would expect, considering the patient\u2019s torpid mental state. Many of these features will be recognized as components of a frontal lobe syndrome, but the tumor is often situated elsewhere, or is diffusely infiltrative. There are, in addition, patients who are overtly confused or demented.

At first the patient can be brought into touch with reality and may identify the examiner and answer other questions correctly; but almost at once he relapses into a preoccupied, confused state, giving incorrect answers and being unable to think coherently.

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

            "content": "David Robertson, MD, & Italo Biaggioni, MD* A 38-year-old man has been experiencing palpitations and headaches. He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

            "content": "The neurologic examination begins with observations in the waiting room, and continues as the patient proceeds to the examination room and while the history is being obtained. The manner in which the patient tells the story of his illness may betray confusion or incoherence in thinking, impairment of memory or judgment, or difficulty in comprehending or expressing ideas. A more extensive examination of attention, memory, cognitive ability, and language is undertaken if the history or the manner in which it is given indicates the problem lies in those spheres. Otherwise, asking the date and place, repeating and recalling words, and simple arithmetic are adequate screening procedures. One then proceeds from an examination of the cranial nerves to the testing of motor, reflex, and sensory functions of the upper and lower limbs. This is followed by an assessment of gait and station (standing position) are observed before or after the rest of the examination."

He has been generally healthy, is sedentary, drinks several cocktails per day, and does not smoke cigarettes. He has a family history of hypertension, and his father died of a myocardial infarction at age 55. Physical examination is remarkable only for moderate obesity.

The patient\u2019s temperature was normal. He explained that the episode had occurred following a birthday party at which he had participated in an ice cream\u2013eating contest. The patient reported prior episodes of a similar nature following ingestion of a significant amount of dairy products. This clinical picture is most probably due to a deficiency in the activity of: A. isomaltase. B. lactase. C. pancreatic \u03b1-amylase. D. salivary \u03b1-amylase. E. sucrase. Correct answer = B. The physical symptoms suggest a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for carbohydrate degradation. The symptoms observed following the ingestion of dairy products suggest that the patient is deficient in lactase as a result of the age-dependent reduction in expression of the enzyme."

Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

Psychologic testing discloses that certain cognitive and perceptual functions that depend little or not at all on retentive memory are also impaired. As a rule, the Korsakoff patient has no insight into his illness and is characteristically apathetic and inert, lacking in spontaneity and initiative, and indifferent to everything and everybody around him. However, the patient has a relatively normal capacity to reason with data immediately before him."
