    "question": "A 65-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of yellowish discoloration of his skin and generalized pruritus. Examination shows jaundice of the skin and scleral icterus. Urinalysis shows an elevated concentration of bilirubin and a low concentration of urobilinogen. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's break down the key information provided and analyze it step by step.\\n\\nThe patient presents with yellowish discoloration of the skin and generalized pruritus, jaundice of the skin and scleral icterus, elevated bilirubin concentration in the urine, and low concentration of urobilinogen in the urine.\\n\\nFirst, let's consider the causes of jaundice and bilirubinuria. Jaundice is typically caused by an increase in serum bilirubin levels, which can be due to increased bilirubin production, decreased uptake or conjugation of bilirubin, or decreased excretion of bilirubin.\\n\\nBilirubinuria, on the other hand, is the presence of bilirubin in the urine. This can occur when there is a blockage in the bile ducts, which prevents bilirubin from being excreted into the intestine, causing it to be excreted in the urine instead.\\n\\nNow, let's evaluate the options given in the context of these facts.\\n\\nOption A, absent UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity, refers to a deficiency in the enzyme responsible for conjugating bilirubin. This would lead to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms of jaundice and bilirubinuria.\\n\\nOption B, increased hemoglobin breakdown, would lead to an increase in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms.\\n\\nOption C, increased intestinal bilirubin reabsorption, would also lead to an increase in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.\\n\\nOption D, defective hepatic bile excretion, is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. This would lead to an increase in conjugated (direct) bilirubin, which can be excreted in the urine, resulting in bilirubinuria. This is consistent with the patient's symptoms of jaundice, bilirubinuria, and low urobilinogen concentration in the urine.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's findings is a defective hepatic bile excretion, which is characteristic of Dubin-Johnson syndrome.\\n\\nAnswer: D\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

            "content": "Jaundice, or icterus, is a yellowish discoloration of tissue resulting from the deposition of bilirubin. Tissue deposition of bilirubin occurs only in the presence of serum hyperbilirubinemia and is a sign of either liver disease or, less often, a hemolytic disorder. The degree of serum bilirubin elevation can be estimated by physical examination. Slight increases in serum bilirubin level are best detected by examining the sclerae, which have a particular affinity for bilirubin due to their high elastin content. The presence of scleral icterus indicates a serum bilirubin level of at least 51 \u03bcmol/L (3 mg/dL). The ability to detect scleral icterus is made more difficult if the examining room has fluorescent lighting. If the examiner suspects scleral icterus, a second site to examine is underneath the tongue. As serum bilirubin levels rise, the skin will eventually become yellow in light-skinned patients and even green if the process is long-standing; the green color is produced by"

In male patients with cirrhosis, particularly that related to alcohol use, signs of hyperestrogenemia such as gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and loss of male-pattern hair distribution may be found. Icterus is best appreciated when the sclera is inspected under natural light. In fair-skinned individuals, a yellow tinge to the skin may be obvious. In dark-skinned individuals, examination of the mucous membranes below the tongue can demonstrate jaundice. Jaundice is rarely detectable if the serum bilirubin level is <43 \u03bcmol/L (2.5 mg/dL) but may remain detectable below this level during recovery from jaundice (because of protein and tissue binding of conjugated bilirubin)."

The data are consistent with an obstructive jaundice in which a block in the common bile duct decreases the secretion of bile containing conjugated bilirubin (CB) into the intestine (stool will be pale in color). The CB regurgitates into the blood (conjugated hyperbilirubinemia). The CB is excreted in the urine (which darkens) and is referred to as urinary bilirubin. Urinary urobilinogen is not present because its source is intestinal urobilinogen, which is low. The other choices do not match the data."

Patients often describe their urine as teaor cola-colored. Bilirubinuria indicates an elevation of the direct serum bilirubin fraction and, therefore, the presence of liver disease. Serum bilirubin levels increase when an imbalance exists between bilirubin production and clearance. A logical evaluation of the patient who is jaundiced requires an understanding of bilirubin production and metabolism.

ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AMA, antimitochondrial antibody; ANA, antinuclear antibody; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; LKM, liver-kidney microsomal antibody; MRCP, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; SMA, smooth-muscle antibody; SPEP, serum protein electrophoresis. Simply stated, the initial step is to perform appropriate blood tests in order to determine whether the patient has an isolated elevation of serum bilirubin. If so, is the bilirubin elevation due to an increased unconjugated or conjugated fraction? If the hyperbilirubinemia is accompanied by other liver test abnormalities, is the disorder hepatocellular or cholestatic? If cholestatic, is it intraor extrahepatic? All of these questions can be answered with a thoughtful history, physical examination, and interpretation of laboratory and radiologic tests and procedures."

Rather, the chapter is intended to offer a framework that helps a physician to evaluate the patient with jaundice in a logical way (Fig. 58-1).

On physical examination, the liver and spleen may be enlarged, with the liver edge being firm and nodular. Other frequent findings include scleral icterus, palmar erythema (Fig. 365-1), spider angiomas (Fig. 365-2), parotid gland enlargement, digital clubbing, muscle wasting, or the development of edema and ascites. Men may have decreased body hair and gynecomastia as well as testicular atrophy, which may be a consequence of hormonal abnormalities or a direct toxic effect of alcohol on the testes. In women with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis, menstrual irregularities usually occur, and some women may be amenorrheic. These changes are often reversible following cessation of alcohol."

Associated findings can include hypertrichosis of the lateral malar region (men) or face (women) and, in sun-exposed areas, hyperpigmentation and firm sclerotic plaques. An elevated level of urinary uroporphyrins confirms the diagnosis and is due to a decrease in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity. PCT can be exacerbated by alcohol, hemochromatosis and other forms of iron overload, chlorinated hydrocarbons, hepatitis C and HIV infections, and hepatomas."

The patient had noted progressive weakness over several days, to the point that he was unable to rise from bed. Past medical history was notable for small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, liver, and adrenals. The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced. Blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, increasing to 160/98 mmHg after 1 L of saline, with a JVP at 8 cm. There was generalized muscle weakness.

Total bilirubin concentrations are typically between 34 and 85 \u03bcmol/L (2 and 5 mg/dL) but on occasion can be in the normal range or as high as 340\u2013430 \u03bcmol/L (20\u201325 mg/dL) and can fluctuate widely in any given patient. The degree of hyperbiliru-2003 binemia may be increased by intercurrent illness, oral contraceptive use, and pregnancy. Because the hyperbilirubinemia is due to a predominant rise in conjugated bilirubin, bilirubinuria is characteristically present. Aside from elevated serum bilirubin levels, other routine laboratory tests are normal. Physical examination is usually normal except for jaundice, although an occasional patient may have hepatosplenomegaly."
