    "question": "A 30-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of infertility. He and his wife have been trying to get pregnant for the past two years. They have used fertility monitors and other aids without success. A hysterosalpingogram in his wife was normal. The patient has a history of cleft lip and recurrent upper respiratory infections as a child. He was briefly hospitalized for severe pneumonia when he was 9-years-old. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/85 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min. On examination, he is a healthy-appearing male in no acute distress with fully developed reproductive organs. Notably, cardiac auscultation is silent in the left 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. This patient most likely has a mutation in which of the following classes of proteins?",

    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: **Step 1: Analyze the patient's symptoms and history** The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of infertility, cleft lip, and recurrent upper respiratory infections. He has a normal physical examination, but there is a notable finding of a \"s4th heart sound\" (also known as a \"S4 gallop\") heard during cardiac auscultation. **Step 2: Understand the significance of the S4 gallop** The S4 gallop is a heart sound that occurs during diastole, specifically at the beginning of diastole, just before the first heart sound (S1). It is often associated with atrial contraction and can be a sign of conditions that affect the heart's ability to relax and fill during diastole. **Step 3: Relate the S4 gallop to the patient's symptoms** The patient's history of recurrent upper respiratory infections and cleft lip may be related to a condition that affects the heart's ability to relax and fill during diastole. This could be due to a mutation in a protein that plays a crucial role in the relaxation of the heart muscle during diastole. **Step 4: Identify the protein class** Based on the patient's symptoms and the significance of the S4 gallop, I believe the mutation is likely related to a protein that is involved in the regulation of the heart's relaxation during diastole. The correct answer is **D. Anterograde cytoskeletal motor protein**. **Rationale** The anterograde cytoskeletal motor protein, specifically dynein, plays a crucial role in the regulation of the heart's relaxation during diastole. Dynein is a type of motor protein that is involved in the anterograde transport of molecules along microtubules. In the heart, dynein helps to regulate the relaxation of the heart muscle during diastole by transporting actin and myosin filaments away from the contractile apparatus, allowing the heart to relax and fill with blood. Mutations in the dynein gene (DNAH9) have been associated with a condition known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), which can cause respiratory and cardiac problems, including the S4 gallop. PCD is characterized by defective cilia function, which can lead to respiratory and sinusitis, as well as cardiac problems. Therefore, the patient's symptoms and the presence of the S4 gallop are consistent with a mutation in the dynein gene, which is an anterograde cytoskeletal motor protein. **JSON output** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a condition that affects the heart's ability to relax and fill during diastole.

Past medical history was notable for laryngeal carcinoma treated 15 years prior with radiation therapy, renal cell carcinoma, peripheral vascular disease, and hypothyroidism. On review of systems, he denied headache, nausea, and vomiting. He had chronic hip pain, managed with acetaminophen with codeine. Other medications included cilostazol, amoxicillin/clavulanate, digoxin, diltiazem, and thyroxine. He was euvolemic on examination, with no lymphadenopathy and a normal chest examination.

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension.

The chest pain was due to pulmonary emboli. Small emboli were thrown off from the leading edge of the thrombus through the heart to lodge in the lungs. Small emboli cause typical pleuritic chest pain, which is exacerbated by breathing. In isolation these small pulmonary emboli may affect respiratory function, but they may be the precursor to a large and potentially fatal pulmonary embolus (eFig. 6.143). Anticoagulation was instituted and the patient had an uneventful delivery. A 45-year-old man had recently taken up squash. During a game he attempted a forehand shot and noticed severe sudden pain in his heel. He thought his opponent had hit him with his racket. When he turned, though, he realized his opponent was too far away to have hit him."

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination?

In afected individuals, the ovaries and female internal ductal structures such as the uterus, cervix, and upper vagina are present. hus, patients are potentially fertile. he external genitalia, however, are virilized to a varying degree depending on the amount and timing of androgen exposure. he three embryonic structures that are commonly afected by elevated androgen levels or ovarian development disorders are the clitoris, labioscrotal folds, and urogenital sinus. As a result, virilization may range from modest clitoromegaly to posterior labial fusion and development of a phallus with a penile urethra. Degrees of virilization can be described by the Prader score, which ranges from 0 for a normal-appearing female to 5 for a normal, virilized male."
