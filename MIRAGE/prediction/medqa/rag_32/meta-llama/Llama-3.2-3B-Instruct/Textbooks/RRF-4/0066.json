These symptoms, along with the presence of dilated loops of bowel on the abdominal x-ray, suggest a surgical emergency, such as intestinal obstruction or perforation. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) recommend that children under the age of 18 years require informed consent from a parent or guardian for surgical procedures, including emergency surgeries. In this scenario, the patient's parents are away visiting friends and cannot be reached. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to try to contact the parents to obtain consent. If the parents cannot be reached, the surgeon should contact local authorities or the child's emergency contact to obtain consent. Delaying surgery until parental consent is not an option as the child's condition is life-threatening. Emergency laparotomy should only be performed after obtaining parental consent or when the parents cannot be reached and the child's life is in imminent danger.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

In young children, malrotation with volvulus, incarcerated hernia, congenital anomalies, and intussusception are common concerns. In older children and teenagers, appendicitis is more common. An acute surgical abdomen is characterized by signs of peritonitis, including tenderness, abdominal wall rigidity, guarding, and absent or diminished bowel sounds. Helpful characteristics of onset, location, referral, and quality of pain are noted in Table 126-3. Available @ StudentConsult.com Recurrent abdominal pain is a common problem, affecting more than 10% of all children. The peak incidence occurs between ages 7 and 12 years. Although the differential diagnosis of recurrent abdominal pain is fairly extensive (Table 126-4),most children do not have a serious (or even identifiable) underlying illness causing the pain."

Abnormalities of intensity and pitch of bowel sounds can occur with bowel obstruction. When palpating for tenderness, the examiner should note location, facial expression, guarding, and rebound tenderness. Palpation can also detect enlargement of the liver or spleen as well as feces and masses. If detected, organomegaly should be measured (with a tape measure), noting abnormal firmness or contour.

            "content": "Christian L\u00fcscher, MD A 15-year-old high school student is brought to the emergency department after his parents found him in his room staring at the ceiling and visibly frightened. Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

Focused History: DW is the full-term product of a normal pregnancy and delivery. She appeared normal at birth. DW is the first child of parents of Northern European ethnicity. The parents are both in good health, and their family histories are unremarkable. Pertinent Findings: DW has a distended abdomen. She recently vomited small amounts of bilious (green-colored) material. Diagnosis: Meconium ileus (obstruction of the ileum by meconium, the first stool produced by newborns) was confirmed by abdominal x-rays. About 98% of full-term newborns with meconium ileus have cystic fibrosis (CF). Diagnosis of CF was subsequently confirmed with a chloride sweat test. Treatment: The ileus was successfully treated nonsurgically. For management of the CF, the family was referred to the CF center at the regional children\u2019s hospital."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

When there is diag-nostic uncertainty, the child may be observed, rehydrated, and reassessed. In girls of menstruating age, an US may be obtained to exclude ovarian pathology (cysts, torsion, or tumor). If all studies are negative, yet the pain persists, and the abdominal findings remain equivocal, diagnostic laparoscopy may be employed to determine the etiology of the abdominal pain. The appendix should be removed even if it appears to be normal, unless another pathologic cause of the abdominal pain is defini-tively identified and the appendectomy would substantially increase morbidity.Surgical Treatment of Appendicitis.
