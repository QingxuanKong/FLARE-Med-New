    "question": "A 3-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents for an acute arm injury. The mother reports that they were walking in the park and the patient\u2019s dad was swinging the patient in the air by her arms. The dad reports he then heard a click and the patient immediately began to cry. On examination, the patient is holding her right forearm in a pronated position and her elbow slightly flexed. Pain is localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow. She refuses to use the affected limb. She does allow passive flexion and extension with full range of motion but supination is limited and causes pain. Which of the following is the next step in management?",

        "A": "Immobilization",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with a classic presentation of radial head subluxation, also known as nursemaid's elbow. The mechanism of injury is consistent with the description provided by the parents, where the child was swung in the air by her father, which is a common cause of this injury. The patient's refusal to use the affected limb and limited supination with pain are also consistent with radial head subluxation. The key diagnostic feature is the pain localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow, which is a common location for the radial head. The patient's refusal to use the limb and the presence of pain with supination make the diagnosis of radial head subluxation highly likely. The next step in management should be to attempt to reduce the subluxation. The correct answer is D. Supination then maximal extension, as this is the recommended method for reducing radial head subluxation in children. This involves supinating the forearm and then extending the elbow to reduce the subluxation. If this is unsuccessful, further steps may be necessary, but initial reduction is the first line of treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

            "content": "Radial head subluxation is more commonly known as nursemaid\u2019s elbow. Because the radial head is not as bulbous in infants and young children, the annular ligament that passes around it can partially slip off the radial head with traction across the elbow (Fig. 203-1). The subluxation is usually caused by a quick pull on the extended elbow when a child is forcefully lifted by the hand or when the child falls while holding hands with an adult. After a subluxation, the child usually holds the hand in a pronated position and will refuse to use the hand or move the elbow. Moving the hand into the supinated position while applying pressure to the radial head will usually reduce the injury. Usually, radiographs are not necessary unless reduction cannot be obtained or there is concern for fracture (swelling and bruising). Once the injury is reduced, the child will begin using the arm again without complaint. Parents should be educated about the mechanism of injury and encouraged to avoid that"

Pulled elbow is extremely painful, but can be treated easily by simple supination and compression of the elbow joint by the clinician. When the radial head is relocated the pain subsides immediately and the child can continue with normal activity.

A conventional test for hypotonia is to tap the wrists of the outstretched arms and to detect a displacement through a wider range than normal in the affected limb (or both limbs in diffuse cerebellar disease), sometimes causing the limb to oscillate; this is presumably the result of a failure of the hypotonic muscles to fixate the arm at the shoulder. Another test for hypotonia is to shake the affected limb and demonstrate that the flapping movements of the hand are of wider excursion than normal. If the patient places his elbows on the table with the arms flexed and the hands are allowed to hang limply, the hand of the hypotonic limb will sag. If the standing patient is rotated to and fro at the shoulders, the hypotonic arm will be seen to continue to swing after the other has come to rest.

The pain began after a fall on his outstretched hand approximately 6 months previously. The patient recalled having some minor shoulder tenderness but no other specific symptoms. He was otherwise fit and well. On examination of the shoulder, there was marked wasting of the muscles in the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae. The patient found initiation of abduction difficult and there was a weakness of lateral rotation of the humerus. The wasted muscles were the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The cause of the muscle wasting was disuse. Muscle atrophy (wasting) occurs through a variety of disorders. Disuse atrophy is one of the most common causes. Examples of disuse atrophy include the loss of muscle bulk after fracture immobilization in a plaster cast. The opposite effect can also be demonstrated\u2014when muscles are overused they become bulkier (hypertrophy)."

The patient is asked to hold both arms fully extended and parallel to the ground with eyes closed. This position should be maintained for ~10 s; any flexion at the elbow or fingers or pronation of the forearm, especially if asymmetric, is a sign of potential weakness. Muscle strength is further assessed by having the patient exert maximal effort for the particular muscle or muscle group being tested. It is important to isolate the muscles as much as possible, i.e., hold the limb so that only the muscles of interest are active. It is also helpful to palpate accessible muscles as they contract. Grading muscle strength and evaluating the patient\u2019s effort is an art that takes time and practice.

When the inflammation is acute, patients experience anterior shoulder pain that radiates down the biceps into the forearm. Abduction and external rotation of the arm are painful and limited. The bicipital groove is very tender to palpation. Pain may be elicited along the course of the tendon by resisting supination of the forearm with the elbow at 90\u00b0 (Yergason\u2019s supination sign). Acute rupture of the tendon may occur with vigorous exercise of the arm and is often painful. In a young patient, it should be repaired surgically. Rupture of the tendon in an older person may be associated with little or no pain and is recognized by the presence of persistent swelling of the biceps produced by the retraction of the long head of the biceps.

            "content": "The diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasound scan. The patient was seated on a stool and her right shoulder was uncovered. The patient\u2019s hand was placed over her right buttock, a position that acts to externally rotate and extend the shoulder, exposing the supraspinatus tendon for ultrasound scan examination. The ultrasound revealed a completely torn tendon with fluid in the subacromial subdeltoid bursa (eFig. 7.128). The patient underwent a surgical repair and made a good recovery. A 35-year-old baseball pitcher came to the clinic with a history of a recurrent dislocation of the shoulder (eFig. 7.129). An MRI scan was performed to assess the shoulder joint prior to any treatment. The MRI demonstrates the anatomical structures in multiple planes, allowing the physician to obtain an overview of the shoulder and to assess any intraarticular or extraarticular structures that may have been damaged and require surgical repair."

A young long-distance runner came to her physician with acute swelling around the lateral aspect of her ankle. This injury occurred directly after accidentally running into a pothole in the pavement. A fractured ankle was suspected. Plain anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the ankle revealed no evidence of any bone injury to account for the patient\u2019s soft tissue swelling. The patient was given a pair of crutches and analgesics and told to rest. A diagnosis of a simple sprain was made. Over the ensuing weeks the swelling and edema within the soft tissue of the ankle decreased and the patient began to run, but noted that the ankle kept \u201cgiving way.\u201d She went to an orthopedic surgeon for further assessment. There was a positive anterior drawer test of the ankle joint."

Tear of the rotator cuff is common in the elderly and often results from trauma; it may manifest in the same manner as tendinitis. The drop arm test is abnormal with supraspinatus pathology and is demonstrated by passive abduction of the arm to 90\u00b0 by the examiner. If the patient is unable to hold the arm up actively or unable to lower the arm slowly without dropping, the test is positive. Tendinitis or tear of the rotator cuff is best confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound."
