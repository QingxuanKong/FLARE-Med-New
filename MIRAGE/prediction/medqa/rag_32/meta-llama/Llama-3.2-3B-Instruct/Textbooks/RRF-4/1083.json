    "question": "A previously healthy 18-year-old army recruit is brought to a military treatment facility because of a 3-week history of right foot pain. He recently started basic infantry training and has been running several kilometers daily. Initially, the pain only occurred while running, but now it is also present at rest. The pain is located diffusely over the right forefoot. Vital signs are within normal range. Examination shows mild swelling over the distal right forefoot. Pressing the metatarsal of the third right toe results in pain. He walks with an antalgic gait. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the right foot shows a slight loss of cortical density and callus formation at the third metatarsal shaft. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is an 18-year-old army recruit with a 3-week history of right foot pain that worsens over time, especially at rest. The pain is diffuse over the right forefoot, and pressing the metatarsal of the third right toe results in pain. The patient walks with an antalgic gait. The x-ray shows a slight loss of cortical density and callus formation at the third metatarsal shaft. These findings are suggestive of a stress fracture, specifically a metatarsal stress fracture. The patient's activity level and recent increase in running distance may have contributed to the fracture. The most appropriate next step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the fracture. Among the options provided, ultrasonography is not typically used for this purpose, and internal fixation is usually reserved for more severe fractures. A technetium bone scan may be useful for detecting stress fractures, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. Therefore, the best choice is to obtain a technetium bone scan to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The peripheral sensory neuropathy interferes with normal protective mechanisms and allows the patient to sustain major or repeated minor trauma to the foot, often without knowledge of the injury. Disordered proprioception causes abnormal weight bearing while walking and subsequent formation of callus or ulceration.

If the foot is caught in a pothole or divot, this supinating maneuver continues and inverts the ankle joint in plantarflexion. This puts significant strain on the lateral ligament complex and, given the appropriate circumstances, disruption (in order) of the ligament structures occurs from anterior to posterior. First, the anterior talofibular ligament is disrupted, followed by the calcaneofibular ligament, and then the posterior talofibular ligament. As each of these ligaments is disrupted, the severity of the soft tissue injury is significantly enhanced and the chance of permanent ankle instability is increased."

            "content": "Unfortunately, the dissection extended, the aorta ruptured, and the patient succumbed. A 55-year-old woman came to her physician with sensory alteration in the right gluteal (buttock) region and in the intergluteal (natal) cleft. Examination also demonstrated low-grade weakness of the muscles of the foot and subtle weakness of the extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, and fibularis tertius on the right. The patient also complained of some mild pain symptoms posteriorly in the right gluteal region. A lesion was postulated in the left sacrum."

            "content": "The normal gait cycle, defined as the period between successive points at which the heel of the same foot strikes the ground, is illustrated in Fig. 6-1, based on the studies of Murray and coworkers, and of Olsson. In this figure, the cycle is initiated by the heel strike of the right foot. The stance phase, during which one foot is in contact with the ground, occupies 60 to 65 percent of the cycle. The swing phase begins when the left toes leave the ground. For 20 to 25 percent of the walking cycle, both feet are in contact with the ground (double-limb support). In later life, when the steps shorten and the cadence (the rhythm and number of steps per minute) decreases, the proportion of double-limb support increases (see further on). Surface electromyograms show an alternating pattern of activity in the legs, predominating in the flexors during the swing phase and in the extensors during the stance phase."

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

            "content": "With lesions of the first sacral root (S1), the pain is felt in the midgluteal region, mid-posterior part of the thigh, posterior region of the calf to the heel, outer plantar surface of the foot, and fourth and fifth toes. Tenderness is most pronounced over the midgluteal region. Paresthesia and sensory loss are mainly in the lower part of the leg and outer toes, and weakness, if present, involves the plantar flexor muscles of the foot and toes, abductors of the toes, and hamstring muscles. The Achilles reflex is diminished or absent in the majority of cases. In fact, loss of the Achilles reflex may be the only objective sign. Walking on the toes is more difficult and uncomfortable than walking on the heels because of weakness of the plantar flexors."
