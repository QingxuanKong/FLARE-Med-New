    "question": "A 16-year-old patient presents to the physician\u2019s office with an absence of menstruations. Her last period was 6 months ago. Since almost a year and a half ago, she intentionally restricted her diet at the expense of carbohydrates, exercised intensively, and lost 18.0 kg (39.7 lb). She had her menarche at the age of 12 and menstruated normally until last year. She is not sexually active. On physical examination, the vital signs include blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate 55/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and temperature 35.9\u00b0C (96.6\u00b0F). Her weight is 55.0 kg (121.3 lb), and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 5 in). Physical examination reveals the good development of muscles and decreased adiposity. A bone scan shows decreased calcium mineral deposits. Which statement about this patient\u2019s condition is correct?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thought process and the answer in JSON format: **Step-by-Step Thinking:** 1. The patient is a 16-year-old girl who has amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) and has been dieting and exercising intensely for a year and a half, resulting in a significant weight loss of 18.0 kg (39.7 lb). 2. The patient's physical examination reveals good muscle development and decreased adiposity, indicating that she has lost body fat but not muscle mass. 3. The bone scan shows decreased calcium mineral deposits, which is a common finding in patients with eating disorders. 4. Given the patient's history of dieting and intense exercise, it is likely that she has developed a condition characterized by excessive weight loss and decreased body fat. **Analysis of Options:** A. Insulin resistance is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. B. Decreased adiposity may actually contribute to increased estrogen levels, not hypoestrogenemia. Estrogen levels are often elevated in individuals with low body fat. C. The patient's extensive weight loss is unlikely to result from increased liver metabolism, as the liver is not a primary site of estrogen production. D. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with anorexia nervosa, a condition characterized by excessive weight loss and decreased body fat, which is often associated with low estrogen levels due to the lack of body fat. **Answer:** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has the physical and behavioral characteristics of anorexia nervosa, a condition characterized by excessive weight loss and decreased body fat, which is often associated with low estrogen levels due to the lack of body fat. The patient's decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia, making option B incorrect. Options A and C are also incorrect as they do not accurately reflect the patient's condition. Option D is the correct answer as it is consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension.

The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

The course of the disorder is variable, with some individuals recovering after a single episode, while others exhibit recurrent episodes or a chronic course. Untreated anorexia has a mortality of 5.1/1000, the highest among psychiatric conditions. Maudsley family-based therapy has proven to be an effective therapy in younger individuals, with strict behavioral contingencies used when weight loss becomes critical. No pharmacologic intervention has proven to be specifically beneficial, but comorbid depression and anxiety should be treated. Weight gain should be undertaken gradually with a goal of 0.5 to 1 pound per week to prevent refeeding syndrome. Most individuals are able to achieve remission within 5 years of the original diagnosis."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

The medical consequences of prolonged anorexia nervosa are multisystemic and can be life-threatening in severe presentations. Changes in blood chemistry include leukopenia with lymphocytosis, elevations in blood urea nitrogen, and metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia when purging is present. History and physical examination may reveal amenorrhea in females, skin abnormalities (petechiae, lanugo hair, dryness), and signs of hypometabolic function, including hypotension, hypothermia, and sinus bradycardia. Endocrine effects include hypogonadism, growth hormone resistance, and hypercortisolemia. Osteoporosis is a longer-term concern. The course of the disorder is variable,"

Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"
