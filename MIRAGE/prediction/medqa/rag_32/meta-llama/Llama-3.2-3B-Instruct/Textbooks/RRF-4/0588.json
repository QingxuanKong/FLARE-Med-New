    "question": "A 45-year-old G3P3 presents complaining of the feeling of a foreign body in her vagina that worsens on standing. She does not have urinary or fecal incontinence or any other genitourinary symptoms. She has no known gynecologic diseases. There were no complications with her pregnancies, all of which were full-term vaginal deliveries. She is sexually active with her husband and no longer uses oral contraceptives. She has an 11 pack-year history of smoking. Her weight is 79 kg (174 lb) and her height is 155 cm (5 ft). Her vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination is unremarkable. The gynecologic examination reveals descent of the cervix halfway towards the introitus. On Valsalva and standing, the cervix descents to the plane of the hymen. The uterus is not enlarged and the ovaries are non-palpable. Which of the following treatments is most reasonable to offer this patient?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient complains of a feeling of a foreign body in her vagina that worsens on standing. This symptom, combined with the physical examination finding of the cervix descending halfway towards the introitus on Valsalva and standing, suggests cystocele, which is a condition where the bladder slips out of its normal position and into the vagina. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The next step is to consider treatment options. A support pessary is a device that provides support to the vagina and can help alleviate symptoms of cystocele. A space-filling pessary is a type of pessary that fills the space in the vagina to provide support. Posterior colporrhaphy is a surgical procedure that repairs the vaginal wall and provides long-term support. Sacral colpopexy is a surgical procedure that attaches the vagina to the sacrum and provides long-term support. Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most reasonable treatment option is a support pessary. This is because the patient's symptoms are likely related to the cystocele, and a support pessary can provide temporary relief and support to the vagina without the need for surgery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Frequently, the findings before rupture and hemorrhage are nonspecific, and vital signs are normal. The abdomen may be nontender or mildly tender, with or without rebound. The uterus may be slightly enlarged, with findings similar to a normal pregnancy (103,104). Cervical motion tenderness may or may not be present. An adnexal mass may be palpable in up to 50% of cases, but the mass varies markedly in size, consistency, and tenderness. A palpable mass may be the corpus luteum and not the ectopic pregnancy. With rupture and intra-abdominal hemorrhage, the patient develops tachycardia followed by hypotension. Bowel sounds are decreased or absent. The abdomen is distended, with marked tenderness and rebound tenderness. Cervical motion tenderness is present. Frequently, the findings of the pelvic examination are inadequate because of pain and guarding."

The extent of the physical examination during the gynecologic visit is often dictated by the patient\u2019s primary concerns and symptoms. For example, for healthy teens without symptoms who are requesting oral contraceptives before the initiation of intercourse, a gynecologic examination is not necessarily required. Some aspects of the examination\u2014such as assessment of vital signs and measurement of height, weight, blood pressure, and calculation of a body mass index\u2014 should be performed routinely during most office visits. Typically, examination of the breasts and abdomen and a complete examination of the pelvis are considered to be essential parts of the gynecologic examination. It is often helpful to ask the patient if the gynecologic examination was difficult for her in the past; this"

On gynecologic examination, the vaginal introitus and suburethral area, and the entire vagina and cervix, should be carefully inspected and palpated. Bimanual rectovaginal examination should be performed specifically to evaluate the uterus for size and mobility, the adnexa for masses, the parametria for induration, and the cul-de-sac for nodularity."

A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative."

Other less common symptoms are vaginal discharge, abdominal or pelvic pain, weight loss, and passage of tissue from the vagina. The duration of symptoms usually is only a few months. On physical examination, uterine enlargement is present in 50% to 95% of patients, and a polypoid mass may be seen within or protruding from the endocervical canal in up to 50% of patients. Diagnosis can usually be determined by biopsy of an endocervical mass or endometrial curettage."

Manipulate the abdominal hand gently downward toward the vaginal fingers to outline the adnexa. A normal tube is not palpable. A normal ovary (about 4 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 cm in size, sensitive, firm, and freely movable) is often not palpable. If an adnexal mass is found, evaluate its location relative to the uterus and cervix, architecture, consistency, tenderness, and mobility. 5. Palpate the left adnexal region, repeating the technique described previously, but place the vaginal fingers in the left fornix and the abdominal hand on the left lower quadrant. 6. Follow the bimanual examination with a rectovaginal\u2013abdominal examination."

            "content": "Physical Examination Routine pelvic examination is an essential component of general medical care; this is not the case with women who seek care for sexual concerns. Given the prevalence of negative past sexual experiences, including abuse, a pelvic examination should be performed only in the presence of a definite indication, and the procedure should be clearly explained to the patient (Table 11.6). Management of dyspareunia mandates careful vulvar, vaginal, and pelvic examination. A physical examination can confirm normal anatomy and the healthy nonaroused state of the genitalia, it does not confirm healthy sexual function. Nevertheless, such an examination can be both instructive and therapeutic."

Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age. A 35-year-old woman visited her family practitioner because she had a \u201cbloating\u201d feeling and an increase in abdominal girth. The family practitioner examined the lower abdomen, which revealed a mass that extended from the superior pubic rami to the level of the umbilicus. The superior margin of the mass was easily palpated, but the inferior margin appeared to be less well defined. This patient has a pelvic mass. When examining a patient in the supine position, the observer should uncover the whole of the abdomen."

She is obese (body mass index [BMI] 33), does not exercise, and spends a good portion of her work day in a seated position. She eats a low-sugar diet and regularly eats packaged frozen meals for dinner because she doesn\u2019t have time to cook regularly. Her most recent laboratory values include a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that is above goal at 160 mg/dL (goal < 100 mg/dL) and a hemo-globin A1c that is well controlled at 6%. Her blood pressure is high at 160/100 mm Hg. Her prescription medications include simvastatin, metformin, and benazepril. She also takes over-the-counter ibuprofen for occasional knee pain and a multivitamin supplement once daily.

In some women, a longer speculum (either Pederson or Graves) may facilitate visualization of the cervix in a manner that is less uncomfortable to the patient. If any speculum other than the typically sized specula is used, the patient should be informed and encouraged to remind the clinician before her next examination. The speculum should be warmed before it is inserted into the vagina; a heating pad or speculum warmer should be placed under the supply of specula. If lubrication is required, warm water generally is sufficient or a small amount of lubricant can be used without interfering with cervical cytology testing. The patient should be asked to relax the muscles of her distal vagina before the insertion of the speculum to facilitate the placement and to avoid startling her by this portion of the examination.
