The various phases of the cardiac action potential are associated with changes in cell membrane permeability, mainly by Na+, K+, and Ca++ ions.

The heartbeat is initiated, locally regulated, and coordinated by specialized, modified cardiac muscle cells called cardiac conducting cells (Plate 25, page 348). These cells are organized into nodes and highly specialized conducting fibers called Purkinje fibers that generate and rapidly transmit the contractile impulse to various parts of the myocardium in a precise sequence. Both parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve fibers terminate in the nodes. Sympathetic stimulation accelerates the heartbeat by increasing the frequency of impulses to the cardiac conducting cells. Parasympathetic stimulation slows down the heartbeat by decreasing the frequency of the impulses. The impulses carried by these nerves do not initiate contraction but only modify the rate of intrinsic cardiac muscle contraction by their effect at the nodes."

During relaxation, the Ca++ that dissociates from the contractile proteins is taken up by the sarcoplasmic reticulum for subsequent release. However, there is a lag of approximately 500 to 800 msec before this Ca++ is available for release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in response to the next depolarization. Thus the strength of the premature beat is reduced because the time during the preceding relaxation is insufficient to allow much of the Ca++ taken up by the sarcoplasmic reticulum to become available for release during the premature beat. Conversely, the postextrasystolic beat is considerably stronger than normal because more Ca++ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum as a result of the"

Smooth muscle in the uterus proliferates \u0081 FOLDER 11.5 Functional Considerations: Comparison of the Three Muscle Types 337 Cardiac muscle shares structural and functional charac-teristics with skeletal muscle and smooth muscle. In both cardiac and skeletal muscle, the contractile elements\u2014 thick and thin filaments\u2014are organized into sarcomeres surrounded by sER and mitochondria. Both cardiac and smooth muscle cells retain their individuality, although both are in functional communication with their neighbors through gap junctions. In addition, cardiac and smooth muscle cells have a spontaneous beat that is regulated but not initiated by autonomic or hormonal stimuli. Both have centrally located nuclei and perinuclear organelles. These common characteristics suggest that cardiac mus-cle may have evolved in the direction of skeletal muscle from"

The signal from the nerve triggers an action potential in the muscle cell plasma membrane (discussed in Chapter 11), and this electrical excitation spreads swiftly into a series of membranous folds\u2014the transverse tubules, or T tubules\u2014that extend inward from the plasma membrane around each myofibril. The signal is then relayed across a small gap to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, an adjacent weblike sheath of modified endoplasmic reticulum that surrounds each myofibril like a net stocking (Figure 16\u201335A and B)."

This calcium-triggered calcium release mechanism causes a massive and rapid release of additional Ca2 that initiates subsequent steps of the contraction cycle, which are identical to those in skeletal muscle. The differences between initiation of cardiac and skeletal muscle contractions\u2014the longer-lasting membrane depolarization and activation of voltage-sensitive Ca2 channels in the wall of the T tubule\u2014account for an approximately 200-millisecond delay from the start of a depolarization in a cardiac muscle twitch (see Fig. 11.11). Cardiac muscle cells exhibit a spontaneous rhythmic contraction."
