    "question": "A 77-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with the complaints of fever, malaise, and night sweats. She recently observed an enlargement of her axillary lymph nodes, which she examines on a weekly basis. She has a remote history of breast cancer in her 60s that was treated with radiation and chemotherapy. She also reports a history of extensive travel to Africa and a 30-pack-year history of smoking. On physical exam, several axillary lymph nodes are palpable with a large non-tender palpable mass in her right axilla measuring 10 x 8 cm. Fine-needle aspiration demonstrates what the pathologist describes as \"a centroblastic and immunoblastic cell presence, suspicious for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL)\u2013diffuse large B cell variant\". Which of the following risk factors is responsible for this patient\u2019s condition?",

The patient also has a large non-tender palpable mass in her right axilla, which is a common site for lymphoma metastasis. The fine-needle aspiration results show a centroblastic and immunoblastic cell presence, suspicious for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)-diffuse large B cell variant. To determine the risk factor responsible for this patient's condition, let's analyze the options: Option A: Travel to Africa - While travel to Africa may increase the risk of certain infections, it is not a direct risk factor for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Option B: Axillary lymph node involvement - The patient has a large non-tender palpable mass in her right axilla, which is a common site for lymphoma metastasis. However, axillary lymph node involvement is a symptom of the disease, not a risk factor. Option C: Previous radiation therapy - The patient had previous radiation therapy for breast cancer, which can increase the risk of developing secondary cancers, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Option D: Previous breast cancer - The patient had previous breast cancer, but this is not a direct risk factor for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Based on the analysis, the most likely risk factor for this patient's condition is previous radiation therapy, which can increase the risk of developing secondary cancers, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Of cancers in pregnancy, lymphomas are common, and gestational rates are rising because of delayed childbearing (Horowitz, 2016). In pregnant women, Hodgkin lymphomas are more frequent than non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In one populationbased review of 7.9 million births from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, El-Messidi and colleagues (2015) reported its incidence to be 1 in 12,400. In more than 70 percent of Hodgkin disease cases, lymph nodes painlessly enlarge at sites above the diaphragm, that is, in the axillary, cervical, or submandibular chains. Approximately one third of patients have symptoms such as fever, night sweats, malaise, weight loss, and pruritus. Diagnosis is by histological examination of involved nodes (Longo, 2015)."

It generally presents as a nontender lymph node swelling, most often in the left supraclavicular region. It may be accompanied by B symptoms (fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss). Excisional biopsy is the preferred diagnostic procedure because fine-needle aspiration cannot reveal the architectural framework that is an essential component of Hodgkin\u2019s disease diagnosis.

Diagnosis relies on an excisional biopsy of a tumor mass, not fine-needle aspiration. Staging evaluation is generally limited to ultrasound or MRI examinations. Diagnosis in the first trimester should prompt termination of the pregnancy followed by definitive treatment with combination chemotherapy, because aggressive lymphomas are not likely to be held at bay with single-agent chemotherapy.

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

In terms of medicine, this resulted in the abandonment of Galen\u2019s humoral pathology, which was repudi-ated by Le Dran, and the subsequent rise in cellular pathology as espoused by Virchow. Le Dran stated that breast cancer was a local disease that spread by way of lymph vessels to axillary lymph nodes. When operating on a woman with breast cancer, he routinely removed any enlarged axillary lymph nodes.4In the 19th century, Moore, of the Middlesex Hospital, London, emphasized complete resection of the breast for cancer and stated that palpable axillary lymph nodes also should be removed.5 In a presentation before the British Medical Asso-ciation in 1877, Banks supported Moore\u2019s concepts and advo-cated the resection of axillary lymph nodes even when palpable lymphadenopathy was not evident, recognizing that occult involvement of axillary lymph nodes was frequently present.

In the United States, most patients have nodular sclerosing Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, with a minority of patients having mixed-cellularity Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Lymphocyte-predominant and lymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma are rare. Mixed-cellularity Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma or lymphocyte-depletion Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma are seen more frequently in patients infected by HIV (Fig. 134-11). Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma is a tumor characterized by rare neoplastic cells of B-cell origin (immunoglobulin genes are rearranged but not expressed) in a tumor mass that is largely polyclonal inflammatory infiltrate, probably a reaction to cytokines produced by the tumor cells. The differential diagnosis of a lymph node biopsy suspicious for Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma includes inflammatory processes, mononucleosis, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, phenytoin-induced adenopathy, and nonlymphomatous malignancies."

A 45-year-old woman, with a history of breast cancer in the left breast, returned to her physician. Unfortunately the disease had spread to the axillary lymph nodes and bones (bony metastatic disease). A surgeon duly resected the primary breast tumor with a wide local excision and then performed an axillary nodal clearance. The patient was then referred to an oncologist for chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was delivered through a portacath, which is a subcutaneous reservoir from which a small catheter passes under the skin into the internal jugular vein. The patient duly underwent a portacath insertion without complication, completed her course of chemotherapy, and is currently doing well 5 years later."

The majority of these are related to cell damage caused by smoking and alcohol use. Certain viruses are also related to cancers in the head and neck, including human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). A 50-year-old overweight woman came to the doctor complaining of hoarseness of voice and noisy breathing. She was also concerned at the increase in size of her neck. On examination she had a slow pulse rate (45 beats per minute). She also had an irregular knobby mass in the anterior aspect of the lower neck, which deviated the trachea to the right. A clinical diagnosis of a multinodular goiter and hypothyroidism was made."

These include a clonal proliferation of B cells and a distinctive immunophenotype; tumor cells express J chain and display CD45 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and do not express two markers normally found on Reed-Sternberg cells, CD30 and CD15. This lymphoma tends to have a chronic, relapsing course and sometimes transforms to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The treatment of patients with nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma is controversial. Some clinicians favor no treatment and merely close follow-up. In the United States, most physicians will treat localized disease with radiotherapy and disseminated disease with regimens used for patients with classical Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.
