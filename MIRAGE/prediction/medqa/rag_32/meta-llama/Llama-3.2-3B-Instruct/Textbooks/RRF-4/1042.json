He is relatively high functioning and currently has no additional significant medical conditions. He feels well and a physical examination shows that he is within normal limits. He denies any current tobacco use, alcohol use, or illicit drug use. His vital signs include: temperature, 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F); blood pressure, 126/74 mm Hg; heart rate, 87/min; and respiratory rate, 17/min.

To answer this question, we need to identify the correct neoplasm that is commonly associated with Down syndrome. Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21). Individuals with Down syndrome are at increased risk for developing certain types of cancer, particularly leukemia. Among the options provided, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a well-documented association with Down syndrome. The other options, such as gastric adenocarcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, and cardiac rhabdomyoma, are not as strongly linked to Down syndrome. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D.

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

            "content": "The following three brief scenarios of a patient with hemoptysis demonstrate three distinct patterns: A 46-year-old man presents to his internist with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

            "content": "The acuity of a patient\u2019s illness may override considerations of prevalence and the other issues described above. \u201cDiagnostic imperatives\u201d recognize the significance of relatively rare but potentially catastrophic diagnoses if undiagnosed and untreated. For example, clinicians are taught to consider aortic dissection routinely as a possible cause of acute severe chest discomfort. Even though the typical history of dissection differs from that of MI, dissection is far less prevalent, so diagnosing dissection remains challenging unless it is explicitly and routinely considered as a diagnostic imperative (Chap. 301). If the clinician fails to elicit any of the characteristic features of dissection by history and finds equivalent blood pressures in both arms and no pulse deficits, he may feel comfortable discarding the aortic dissection hypothesis. If, however, the chest x-ray shows a possible widened mediastinum, the hypothesis may be reinstated and an appropriate imaging test ordered"

A chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a right 2.8 \u00d7 1.6 cm infrahilar mass and postobstructive pneumonia. The patient was an active smoker. Past medical history was notable for laryngeal carcinoma treated 15 years prior with radiation therapy, renal cell carcinoma, peripheral vascular disease, and hypothyroidism. On review of systems, he denied headache, nausea, and vomiting. He had chronic hip pain, managed with acetaminophen with codeine. Other medications included cilostazol, amoxicillin/clavulanate, digoxin, diltiazem, and thyroxine. He was euvolemic on examination, with no lymphadenopathy and a normal chest examination.

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

Older patients with comorbidities (including cardiovascular disease) or predisposing factors often require inpatient fluid and electrolyte replacement, monitoring, and reassessment. The clinical manifestations of heatstroke reflect a total loss of thermo-regulatory function. Typical vital-sign abnormalities include tachypnea, various tachycardias, hypotension, and a widened pulse pressure. Although there is no single specific diagnostic test, the historical and physical triad of exposure to a heat stress, CNS dysfunction, and a core temperature >40.5\u00b0C helps establish the preliminary diagnosis."

Other cardiac symptoms include cyanosis, palpitations, chest pain, syncope, and near-syncope. A review ofsystems assesses for possible systemic diseases or congenitalmalformation syndromes that may cause cardiac abnormalities (Tables 139-1 and 139-2). Current and past medication use as well as history of drug use, is important. Family history should be reviewed for hereditary diseases, early atherosclerotic heart disease, congenital heart disease, suddenunexplained deaths, thrombophilia, rheumatic fever, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. A complete cardiovascular examination starts in the supine position and includes evaluation in sitting and standing positions when possible. Inspection is supplemented by palpation and auscultation to provide a complete examination."

However, folate has no effect on the neurologic damage caused by B12 deficiency. Over time, then, the neurologic effects can become severe and irreversible. Thus, folate can mask a deficiency of B12 and prevent treatment until the neuropathy is apparent. III. Focused Cases Case 1: Microcytic Anemia Patient Presentation: ME is a 24-year-old man who is being evaluated as a follow-up to a preplacement medical evaluation he had prior to starting his new job. Focused History: ME has no significant medical issues. His family history is unremarkable, but he knows little of the health status of those family members who remain in Greece. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination was normal. Routine analysis of his blood included the following results:"
