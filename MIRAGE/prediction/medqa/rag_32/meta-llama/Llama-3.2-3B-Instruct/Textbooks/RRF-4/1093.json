Her last mammography 1 year ago showed no abnormalities. Two years ago, a pap smear and colonoscopy were normal. She has a history of hypertension. Her father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 50 years. She emigrated from Japan 30 years ago. She has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for the last 18 years. She drinks 4\u20135 glasses of wine per day. She goes ballroom dancing twice each week. Her medications include enalapril and low-dose aspirin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 50 kg (110 lb); BMI is 18 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary examination shows a soft S4 gallop.

The presence of a soft S4 gallop on physical examination suggests cardiac disease. The most appropriate next step in management would be to evaluate for cardiac disease, as indicated by option D. Transesophageal echocardiography, which can provide detailed images of the heart valves and chambers, is a non-invasive and sensitive test for detecting cardiac abnormalities such as aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation. This is particularly important given the patient's family history of myocardial infarction and the presence of a soft S4 gallop. Options A, B, and C are not the most appropriate next steps in management, as they do not directly address the patient's cardiovascular risk factors and symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The prevention of heart disease, especially of CAD, is one of the most important tasks of primary care health givers as well as cardiologists. Prevention begins with risk assessment, followed by attention to lifestyle, such as achieving optimal weight, physical activity, and smoking cessation, and then aggressive treatment of all abnormal risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (Chap. 417). After a complete diagnosis has been established in patients with known heart disease, a number of management options are usually available.

Examination of patients experiencing stable angina is generally unremarkable. Look for carotid and peripheral bruits suggesting atherosclerosis and hypertension. Rule out pulmonary, GI, or other cardiac causes of chest pain. Angina may be diagnosed from the history alone, but significant ST-segment changes on exercise stress test with ECG monitoring is diagnostic of CAD. Women and diabetics classically experience \u201csilent\u201d ischemic events and present \u201catypically\u201d; for this reason, it is necessary to maintain a high index of suspicion in this patient population. Treat acute symptoms with ASA, O2 and/or IV nitroglycerin, and IV morphine, and consider IV \u03b2-blockers. The efficacy of nondihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem, verapamil) and ACEIs has also been validated."

She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV.

Focused History: Ten days ago, CR had her spleen removed following a bicycle accident in which she fractured her tibial eminence, necessitating immobilization of the right knee. She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"
