    "question": "A 36-year-old man undergoes open reduction and internal fixation of a left femur fracture sustained after a motor vehicle collision. Three days after the surgery, he develops fever and redness around the surgical site. His temperature is 39.5\u00b0C (103.1\u00b0F). Physical examination shows purulent discharge from the wound with erythema of the surrounding skin. Wound culture of the purulent discharge shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. Treatment with oral dicloxacillin is initiated. Four days later, the patient continues to have high-grade fever, pain, and purulent discharge. Which of the following characteristics of the infecting organism best explains the failure to improve with antibiotic therapy?",

The wound culture showed gram-positive cocci in clusters, and treatment with oral dicloxacillin was initiated.\\n\\nThe patient did not improve with antibiotic therapy, and the infection continued to progress.\\n\\nNow, let's evaluate the options given:\\n\\nA. Presence of an impenetrable outer membrane: This characteristic is more relevant to gram-negative bacteria, which are not indicated by the gram-positive cocci in clusters shown in the wound culture.\\n\\nB. Ability to cleave \u03b2-lactam rings: This is a characteristic of \u03b2-lactamase-producing bacteria, which are typically gram-negative. Dicloxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin, and its effectiveness against \u03b2-lactamase-producing bacteria would not be compromised by the presence of \u03b2-lactamase.\\n\\nC. Development of efflux pumps: Efflux pumps are a mechanism of antibiotic resistance that can affect both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. However, the fact that dicloxacillin was initiated as the initial treatment suggests that the infection was initially responsive to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, making efflux pumps less likely to be the primary cause of resistance.\\n\\nD. Adaptation in binding proteins: This is a characteristic of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is a gram-positive bacterium that can develop resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics by adapting to binding proteins. The fact that the patient's infection did not improve with dicloxacillin, a penicillinase-resistant penicillin, suggests that the infection may be caused by MRSA.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely explanation for the failure to improve with antibiotic therapy is the adaptation in binding proteins, which is a characteristic of MRSA.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"D\"}}",

Empirical antimicrobial therapy, pending the results of Gram\u2019s stain and culture of the purulent material obtained at surgery, should include a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin, vancomycin, and metronidazole (Table 164-1). Ceftazidime or meropenem should be substituted for ceftriaxone or cefotaxime in neurosurgical patients. Metronidazole is not necessary for antianaerobic coverage in patients receiving meropenem. When the organism has been identified, antimicrobial therapy can be modified accordingly. Antibiotics should be continued for 3\u20136 weeks after surgical drainage. Patients with associated osteomyelitis may require additional therapy. The mortality rate is <5% in modern series, and full recovery is the rule in most survivors."

Laparoscopic findings may include swollen erythematous tubes with purulent exudates.55Several outpatient parenteral and oral antimicrobial regi-mens have been effective in achieving clinical and microbio-logic cure. Hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics may be necessitated in cases of where surgical emergencies cannot be ruled out, tubo-ovarian abscess is identified, pregnancy, severe illness (nausea and vomiting, or high fever), inability to follow or tolerate an outpatient oral regimen; or failure of outpatient oral antimicrobial therapy. Treatment of a tubo-ovarian abscess may include placement of a percutaneous drain in addition to intravenous antibiotics.55Surgical intervention becomes necessary if medical therapy fails or if the patient becomes unstable. Hysterec-tomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is the procedure of choice; however, conservative surgery must be considered in young patients"

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

Sheridan, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston; with permission.) for definitive diagnosis of infection. The timing of these biopsies can be guided by clinical changes, but in some centers burn wounds are routinely biopsied at regular intervals. The biopsy specimen is examined for histologic evidence of bacterial invasion, and quantitative microbiologic cultures are performed. The presence of >105 viable bacteria per gram of tissue is highly suggestive of invasive infection and of a dramatically increased risk of sepsis. Histopathologic evidence of the invasion of viable tissue and the presence of microorganisms in unburned blood vessels and lymphatics is a more definitive indicator of infection.

Chest radiographic abnormalities are slowest to resolve (4\u201312 weeks), with the speed of clearance depending on the patient\u2019s age and underlying lung disease. Patients may be discharged from the hospital once their clinical conditions, including comorbidities, are stable. The site of residence after discharge (nursing home, home with family, home alone) is an important discharge timing consideration, particularly for elderly patients. For a hospitalized patient, a follow-up radiograph \u223c4\u20136 weeks later is recommended. If relapse or recurrence is documented, particularly in the same lung segment, the possibility of an underlying neoplasm must be considered."
