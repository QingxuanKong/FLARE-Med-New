    "question": "A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of increasing weakness and numbness of the upper extremities for 5 days. During the past 2 days, she has had urinary incontinence not related to sneezing or laughing. Last summer, she had weakness and numbness of her right lower extremity that was worse when she was outside; she regained her strength 3 weeks later. She has no history of serious illness. She has had 10 male sexual partners in her lifetime and uses condoms inconsistently. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows an impaired tandem gait. There is mild spasticity and muscle strength is decreased in both upper extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 4+ bilaterally. The abdominal reflex is absent. Muscle strength in the right lower extremity is mildly decreased. Sensation to vibration and fine touch is decreased over the upper extremities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with increasing weakness and numbness of the upper extremities, urinary incontinence, and impaired tandem gait, with a history of similar symptoms in the past (weakness and numbness of the right lower extremity that worsened when outside). The presence of urinary incontinence and impaired tandem gait, along with the history of similar symptoms, suggests a possible spinal cord injury or lesion. The absence of deep tendon reflexes in the abdominal region and decreased sensation to vibration and fine touch over the upper extremities further supports this suspicion. Given the symptoms and physical examination findings, the most appropriate next step in diagnosis is to perform a lumbar puncture to rule out multiple sclerosis (MS) or another demyelinating disease, as well as to assess for signs of inflammation or infection in the spinal cord. This is a critical step in the diagnostic process, as MS and other demyelinating diseases can cause similar symptoms, and a lumbar puncture can help differentiate these conditions from other possible causes of the patient's symptoms. The other options, such as muscle biopsy, rapid plasma reagin test, and MRI of the brain and spine, may be useful in the diagnostic process, but they are not the most appropriate next step given the patient's presentation and physical examination findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Symptoms of tingling of the extremities and tight band-like sensations around the trunk or limbs are commonly associated and are probably the result of involvement of the posterior columns of the spinal cord. The symptoms generally appear over hours or days, at times being so trifling that they are ignored, and other times coming on so acutely and prominently as to bring the patient urgently to the doctor. The resulting clinical syndromes vary from a mere dragging or poor control of one or both legs to a spastic or ataxic paraparesis. The tendon reflexes are retained and later become hyperactive with extensor plantar reflexes; varying degrees of deep and superficial sensory loss may be associated. It is a useful adage that the patient with MS often presents with symptoms in one leg but with signs in both; the patient will complain of weakness, incoordination, or numbness"

Patients develop numbness and paresthesias in the extremities or trunk. Loss of sensibility to pinprick is as common as loss of sensibility to vibration or position. The upper limit of the zone of sensory loss is often one or two vertebrae below the site of compression. Motor findings include weakness, spasticity, and abnormal muscle stretching. An extensor plantar reflex reflects significant compression. Deep tendon reflexes may be brisk. Motor and sensory loss usually precedes sphincter disturbance. Patients with autonomic dysfunction may present with decreased anal tonus, decreased perineal sensibility, and a distended bladder. The absence of the anal wink reflex or the bulbocavernosus reflex confirms cord involvement. In doubtful cases, evaluation of postvoiding urinary residual volume can be helpful.

Later, examination discloses a disorder of the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord, predominantly of the former. Loss of vibration sense is the most consistent sign; it is more pronounced in the feet and legs than in the hands and arms and frequently extends over the trunk. Position sense is usually impaired in parallel. The motor signs, usually limited to the legs, include a mild symmetrical loss of strength in proximal limb muscles, spasticity, enhanced tendon reflexes, clonus, and extensor plantar responses. At first, the patellar and Achilles reflexes are diminished as frequently as they are increased; they may even be absent. This is most likely the result of a neuropathy due to multiple vitamin deficiencies as cases of pure cobalamin loss, for example due to nitrous oxide, almost never obliterate the tendon reflexes.

Paresthesias and slight numbness in the toes and fingers are the earliest symptoms; only infrequently are they absent throughout the illness. The major clinical manifestation is weakness that evolves more or less symmetrically over a period of several days to a week or two, or somewhat longer. The proximal as well as distal muscles of the limbs are involved, usually the lower extremities before the upper (thus the older term Landry ascending paralysis); the trunk, intercostal, neck, and cranial muscles may be affected later. Weakness progresses in approximately 5 percent of patients to total motor paralysis with respiratory failure within a few days. In severe cases, the ocular motor nerves are paralyzed and even the pupils may be unreactive."

Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

            "content": "More than half of the patients complain of pain and an aching discomfort in the muscles, mainly those of the hips, thighs, and back. These symptoms precede weakness and may be mistaken for lumbar disc disease, back strain, and orthopedic diseases. A few patients describe burning in the fingers and toes, and if this appears as an early symptom, it may become a persistent problem. Despite sensory symptoms, sensory loss is variable during the first days and may initially be barely detectable so that the typical case has the character of a predominantly motor neuropathy. By the end of a week, vibration and joint position sense in the toes and fingers are usually reduced; when such loss is present, deep sensibility (touch-pressure-vibration) tends to be more affected than superficial (pain-temperature)."

Reflex activity may therefore occur below the injury, but communication with the brain is lost. A 25-year-old woman complained of increasing lumbar back pain. Over the ensuing weeks she was noted to have an enlarging lump in the right groin, which was mildly tender to touch. On direct questioning, the patient also complained of a productive cough with sputum containing mucus and blood, and she had a mild temperature. The chest radiograph revealed a cavitating apical lung mass, which explains the pulmonary history."

The need for mechanical ventilation is associated with more severe weakness on admission, a rapid tempo of progression, and the presence of facial and/or bulbar weakness during the first week of symptoms. Fever and constitutional symptoms are absent at the onset and, if present, cast doubt on the diagnosis. Deep tendon reflexes attenuate or disappear within the first few days of onset. Cutaneous sensory deficits (e.g., loss of pain and temperature sensation) are usually relatively mild, but functions subserved by large sensory fibers, such as deep tendon reflexes and proprioception, are more severely affected. Bladder dysfunction may occur in severe cases but is usually transient. If bladder dysfunction is a prominent feature and comes early in the course, diagnostic possibilities other than GBS should be considered, particularly spinal"

            "content": "The physical examination of patients with fatigue is guided by the history and differential diagnosis. A detailed mental status examination should be performed with particular attention to symptoms of depression and anxiety. A formal neurologic examination is required to determine whether objective muscle weakness is present. This is usually a straightforward exercise, although occasionally patients with fatigue have difficulty sustaining effort against resistance and sometimes report that generating full power requires substantial mental effort. On confrontational testing, they are able to generate full power for only a brief period before suddenly giving way to the examiner. This type of weakness is often referred to as breakaway weakness and may or may not be associated with pain. This is contrasted with weakness due to lesions in the motor tracts or lower motor unit, in which the patient\u2019s resistance can be overcome in a smooth and steady fashion and full power can never be"
