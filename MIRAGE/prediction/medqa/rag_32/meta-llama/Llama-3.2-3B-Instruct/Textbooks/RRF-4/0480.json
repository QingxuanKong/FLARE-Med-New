    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has not undergone puberty yet, while her classmates have. This suggests a possible endocrine disorder. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and she has undeveloped breasts and normal external and internal female genitalia in Tanner I stage of development. The patient is also agreeable and pleasant during the interview, which suggests that she may not have any significant psychological issues. Considering the patient's age and the lack of pubertal development, the possible causes of primary amenorrhea should be considered. The patient's body mass index is within normal limits, and she is in the 40th percentile for height, which suggests that her growth pattern is normal. The patient's normal external and internal female genitalia also suggests that she may not have any significant genital abnormalities. Therefore, the possible causes of primary amenorrhea that should be considered are Kallmann syndrome, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and aromatase enzyme deficiency. However, given the patient's normal external and internal female genitalia, aromatase enzyme deficiency is less likely. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is also less likely given the patient's normal growth pattern and lack of other symptoms. Therefore, the most likely cause of primary amenorrhea in this patient is Kallmann syndrome, which is characterized by delayed or absent puberty and anosmia (loss of the sense of smell). However, since anosmia is not mentioned in the patient's history, Kallmann syndrome is unlikely. The most likely cause of primary amenorrhea in this patient is hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is characterized by delayed or absent puberty and is often caused by a problem with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The patient's lack of pubertal development and normal external and internal female genitalia support this diagnosis. The patient's normal body mass index and growth pattern also support this diagnosis. Therefore, the correct answer is C. XY karyotype, which is a possible cause of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The XY karyotype is a possible cause of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is characterized by delayed or absent puberty and is often caused by a problem with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The patient's lack of pubertal development and normal external and internal female genitalia support this diagnosis. The patient's normal body mass index and growth pattern also support this diagnosis. Therefore, the correct answer is C. XY karyotype.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of \u201closs of vision.\u201d Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver\u2019s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

True or false: Withdrawing a nonbeneficial treatment is ethically similar to withholding a nonindicated one. When can a physician refuse to continue treating a patient on the grounds of futility? An eight-year-old child is in a serious accident. She requires emergent transfusion, but her parents are not present. Conditions in which confidentiality must be overridden. Involuntary commitment or isolation for medical treatment may be undertaken for what reason? A 10-year-old child presents in status epilepticus, but her parents refuse treatment on religious grounds. A son asks that his mother not be told about her recently discovered cancer. False. Patients may change their minds at any time. Exceptions to the requirement of informed consent include emergency situations and patients without decision-making capacity."

The examiner\u2019s right or left hand, depending on his or her preference, is gloved. The pelvic area is illuminated well, and the examiner faces the patient. The following order of procedure is suggested for the pelvic examination: A. External genitalia 1. Inspect the mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, perineal body, and anal region for characteristics of the skin, distribution of the hair, contour, and swelling. Palpate any abnormality. 2. Separate the labia majora with the index and middle fingers of the gloved hand and inspect the epidermal and mucosal characteristics and anatomic configuration of the following structures in the order indicated below: a. b. c. d. e. f. g. 3."

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

Often 30 percent or more of the body weight will have been lost by the time the patient\u2019s family insists on medical consultation. Bradycardia and hypotension are indicators for hospitalization. A fine lanugo covers the face, body, and limbs. The skin is thin and dry, without its normal elasticity, and the nails are brittle. The dental enamel is eroded. Pubic hair and breast tissue (except for loss of fat) are normal, and, in this respect, anorexia nervosa is unlike hypopituitary cachexia (Simmonds disease). Surprisingly, however, there are no neurologic signs of nutritional deficiency. The patient is alert and cheerfully indifferent to her condition. Any suggestion that she is unattractively thin or seriously depleted is rejected."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"
