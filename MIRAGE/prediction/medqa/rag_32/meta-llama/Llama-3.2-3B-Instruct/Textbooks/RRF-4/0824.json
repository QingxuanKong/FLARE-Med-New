    "question": "A 47-year-old man with a history of HIV1 infection presents to his HIV clinic to discuss his antiretroviral medications. He is interested in including maraviroc in his maintenance regimen after seeing advertisements about the medication. On exam, his temperature is 98.8\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 116/74 mmHg, pulse is 64/min, and respirations are 12/min. His viral load is undetectable on his current regimen, and his blood count, electrolytes, and liver function tests have all been within normal limits. In order to consider maraviroc for therapy, a tropism assay needs to be performed. Which of the following receptors is affected by the use of maraviroc?",

Maraviroc is a CCR5 antagonist that interferes with HIV binding at the stage of co-receptor engagement. The correct answer can be deduced by understanding the role of the co-receptors in HIV entry into host cells. HIV uses two co-receptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, to enter host cells. Maraviroc specifically targets the CCR5 co-receptor, which is one of the two chemokine receptors necessary for HIV entry into CD4+ T cells. Therefore, the correct answer is the co-receptor affected by the use of maraviroc.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The antiretroviral agent maraviroc is effective only against CCR5-tropic viruses. Because the genotypic determinants of cellular tropism are poorly defined, a phenotypic assay is necessary to determine this property of HIV. Two commercial assays, the Trofile assay (Monogram Biosciences) and the Phenoscript assay (VIRalliance), are available to make this determination.

The decision regarding choice of drugs not only will affect the immediate response to therapy but also will have implications regarding options for future therapeutic regimens. The initial regimen is usually the most effective insofar as the virus has yet to develop significant resistance. HIV is capable of rapidly developing resistance to any single agent, and therapy must be given as a multidrug combination. Given that patients can be infected with viruses that harbor drug resistance mutations, it is recommended that a viral genotype be done prior to the initiation of therapy to optimize the selection of antiretroviral agents. The combination regimens currently recommended for initial therapy in any treatment-na\u00efve patient are listed in Table 226-24.

Patients initiating antiretroviral therapy must be willing to commit to life-long treatment and understand the importance of adherence to their prescribed regimen. The importance of adherence is illustrated by the observation that treatment interruption is associated with rapid increases in HIV RNA levels, rapid declines in CD4+ T cell counts, and an increased risk of clinical progression.

Total cholesterol is 220, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level is 40 mg/dL. Fasting glucose is 105 mg/dL. Chest X-ray is normal. Electrocardiogram shows left ven-tricular enlargement. How would you treat this patient?"

In general, the standard 6-month daily regimen is equally efficacious in HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients for treatment of drug-susceptible TB. As for any other adult living with HIV (Chap. 226), first-line ART for TB patients should consist of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Although TB treatment modalities are similar to those in HIV-negative patients, adverse drug effects may be more pronounced in HIV-infected patients. In this 1."

His physician initially prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic commonly used to treat hyper-tension. His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic. Because the patient had elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, hydrochlorothiazide was replaced with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril lowered his blood pressure to almost normotensive levels. However, after several weeks on enalapril, the patient returned complaining of a persistent cough. In addition, some signs of angioedema were detected. How does enalapril lower blood pressure? Why does it occasionally cause coughing and angioedema? What other drugs could be used to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and decrease blood pressure,"

A pregnancy test should be done in women in whom the drug efavirenz is being considered, and HLA-B5701 testing should be done in all patients in whom the drug abacavir is being considered. Patients should be immunized with pneumococcal polysaccharide, with annual influenza shots, and, if seronegative for these viruses, with HPV, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B vaccines. The status of hepatitis C infection should be determined. In addition, patients should be counseled with regard to sexual practices and needle sharing, and counseling should be offered to those whom the patient knows or suspects may also be infected.

Most of the drug (\u2265 75%) is excreted in the feces, whereas approximately 20% is excreted in urine. The recommended dose of maraviroc varies according to renal function and the concomitant use of CYP3A inducers or inhibitors (Table 49\u20133). Maraviroc is contraindicated in patients with severe or end-stage renal impairment and caution is advised when used in patients with preexisting hepatic impairment and in those co-infected with HBV or HCV. Maraviroc has excellent penetration into the cervicovaginal fluid, with levels almost four times higher than the corresponding concentrations in blood plasma."
