    "question": "In a study to determine the risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age (age < 30 years), 30 young patients with the condition are recruited into the study group. Sixty similar but healthy individuals are recruited into the control group. Educational status is considered to be an important variable, as it would affect the awareness of the disease and its risk factors among the participants. Based on the level of education, 2 groups are formed: low educational status and high educational status. A chi-square test is performed to test the significance of the relationship, and an odds ratio of 2.1 was computed for the association between low education and the risk of MI, with a confidence interval of 0.9\u20139.7. What inference can be made on the association between young age MI and educational status from this study?",

        "A": "The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the association between young age MI and educational status, we need to analyze the given data. The chi-square test was performed to test the significance of the relationship between low educational status and the risk of MI. The odds ratio of 2.1 was computed for the association between low education and the risk of MI, with a confidence interval of 0.9\u20139.7. The confidence interval includes 1, which suggests that the association may not be statistically significant. However, since the confidence interval is quite wide (0.9\u20139.7), it is still possible that low education is a risk factor for MI. Therefore, we cannot conclude that low education is not a risk factor. On the other hand, the odds ratio of 2.1 indicates a possible association between low education and the risk of MI, but it is not strong enough to be considered statistically significant. Hence, we cannot say that the association is statistically significant. Thus, we can conclude that the association between young age MI and educational status is not definitively established from this study.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The actual numbers of people who will be age 80 and older in 2050 will therefore depend almost solely on adult and old age mortality rates over the next 35 years. The history of the decline of mortality suggests that improvements in the standard of living, including increased and improved education and improved nutrition, coupled with improvements in public health stemming from an understanding of the germ theory of disease initially led to the decline in mortality, with medical achievements such as antibiotics and improved understanding of risk factors for cardiovascular and circulatory diseases becoming factors only in the post\u2013World War II period; the largest strides in cardiovascular disease came only in more recent decades.

The difference in risk for SCD parallels the differences in age-related risks for other manifestations of coronary heart disease (CHD) between men and women. As the gender gap for manifestations of CHD closes in the sixth to eighth decades of life, the excess risk of SCD in males progressively narrows. Despite the lower incidence among younger women, coronary risk factors such as cigarette smoking, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension are highly influential, and SCD remains an important clinical and epidemiologic problem. The incidence of SCD among the African-American population appears to be higher than it is among the white population; the reasons remain uncertain."

The major underlying cause of IHD is atherosclerosis; while MIs can occur at virtually any age, the frequency rises progressively with aging and with increasing risk factors for atherosclerosis (Chapter 10). Nevertheless, approximately 10% of MIs occur before 40 years of age, and 45% occur before 65 years of age. Blacks and whites are equally affected. Men are at greater risk than women, although the gap progressively narrows with age. In general, women tend to be protected against MI during their reproductive years. However, menopause\u2014with declining estrogen production\u2014is associated with exacerbation of coronary artery disease, and IHD is the most common cause of death in older adult women.

The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT), which included >350,000 male participants, demonstrated a continuous and graded influence of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure on CHD mortality, extending down to systolic blood pressures of 120 mmHg. Similarly, results of a meta-analysis involving almost 1 million participants indicate that ischemic heart disease mortality, stroke mortality, and mortality from other vascular causes are directly related to the height of the blood pressure, beginning at 115/75 mmHg, without evidence of a threshold. Cardiovascular disease risk doubles for every 20-mmHg increase in systolic and 10-mmHg increase in diastolic pressure. Among older individuals, systolic blood"

In Caucasian populations, smoking is an important risk factor in IBD with opposite effects on UC (odds ratio [OR] 0.58) and CD (OR 1.76), whereas in other ethnic groups with different genetic susceptibility, smoking may play a lesser role. There is a protective effect of previous appendectomy with confirmed appendicitis (reduction of 13\u201326%), particularly at a young age, on the development of UC across different geographical regions and populations. There is a modest association with the development of CD. Oral contraceptive use is associated with the risk of CD (OR 1.4). The association between oral contraceptive use and UC is limited to women with a history of smoking. There is an association between antibiotic use and the development of childhood IBD with children who received one or more dispensations of antibiotics during the first year of life"

Specific learning disorder can have negative functional consequences across the lifespan, including lower academic attainment, higher rates of high school dropout, lower rates of postsecondary education, high levels of psychological distress and poorer overall mental health, higher rates of unemployment and under-employment, and lower incomes. School dropout and co-occurring depressive symptoms increase the risk for poor mental health outcomes, including suicidality, whereas high levels of social or emotional support predict better mental health outcomes."

The 30-day risk of stroke was 4.1% in the stent group and 2.3% in the surgical group, but the 30-day risk of MI was 1.1% in the stent group and 2.3% in the surgery group, suggesting relative equivalence of risk between the procedures. At median follow-up of 2.5 years, the combined endpoint of stroke, MI, and death was the same (7.2% stent vs 6.8% surgery). The rate of restenosis at 2 years was also similar in both groups. The International Carotid Stenting (ICSS) trial randomized symptomatic patients to stents versus endarterectomy and found a different result: At 120 days, the incidence of stroke, MI, or death was 8.5% in the stenting group versus 5.2% in the endarterectomy group (p = .006); longer-term follow-up is currently under way. Differences between trial designs, selection of stent, and operator experience may explain these important differences. Until more data are available, there remains controversy as to who should receive a stent or have"

The Look AHEAD study randomized 5145 adults with obesity to either an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) or to a diabetes support group and education group (DSE) to assess the impact on weight loss, T2DM, and cardiovascular outcomes. At 1 year, the intensive intervention group lost an average of 8.6% initial weight compared to 0.7% in the support and educa-tion group. As shown in Fig. 27-4, 68% of participants in the Look AHEAD study lost at least 5% of their initial weight, and 37% of these participants lost at least 10%. Also at 1 year, par-ticipants undergoing the more intensive program experienced improved cardiovascular risk factors and glycemic control.36At 4 years, participants in the intensive intervention group experienced more weight loss (\u22126.15% ILI compared to \u22120.88% DSE), better glycemic control, fitness, and an improvement in cardiovascular risk factors.37 Nevertheless, the beneficial clinical effects of the"
