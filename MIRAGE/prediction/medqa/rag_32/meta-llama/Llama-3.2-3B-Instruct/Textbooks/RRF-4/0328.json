    "question": "A 27-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 40 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. The patient reports severe pelvic pain. Pregnancy has been complicated by gestational diabetes. Pregnancy and delivery of her first child were uncomplicated. Current medications include insulin, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Vital signs are within normal limits. The cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated; the vertex is at -1 station. The fetal heart rate is reactive with no decelerations. Epidural anesthesia is performed and the patient's symptoms improve. Ten minutes later, the patient has dizziness. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's hypotension?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely underlying cause of the patient's hypotension, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient is a 27-year-old woman at 40 weeks' gestation in active labor, with a history of gestational diabetes. She is currently 10 cm dilated and 100% effaced, with a reactive fetal heart rate. After epidural anesthesia, she experiences dizziness, tachycardia (68/min), bradycardia (16/min), and hypotension (90/60 mmHg). The patient's vital signs indicate a significant drop in blood pressure, which is a concerning sign that requires prompt attention. Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, we need to consider several possible causes of hypotension in a pregnant woman. Hypovolemia (B) is a possible cause, but the patient's vital signs do not indicate dehydration or hypovolemia. Acute pulmonary hypertension (C) is also a possibility, but there is no indication of pulmonary hypertension in the patient's history or physical examination. Aortocaval compression (D) is unlikely, as it typically occurs in the supine position, and the patient is likely in a lateral decubitus position after epidural anesthesia. Sympathetic block (A) is the most likely cause of the patient's hypotension. The patient's symptoms of dizziness, tachycardia, and bradycardia, followed by hypotension, are consistent with a sympathetic block caused by the epidural anesthesia. The epidural anesthesia can cause a sympathetic block, leading to vasodilation and decreased blood pressure. This is a common side effect of epidural anesthesia, especially if the catheter is not placed correctly or if the anesthetic agent is too concentrated. The patient's improvement in symptoms after fluid resuscitation suggests that the hypotension is likely caused by the sympathetic block rather than hypovolemia or another underlying condition. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's hypotension is a sympathetic block.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

The pregnancy record is promptly reviewed to identiY complications. Problems identiied or anticipated during prenatal care should be displayed prominently in the pregnancy record. Most often, unless there has been bleeding in excess of bloody show, a cervical examination is performed. he gloved index and second ingers are introduced into the vagina while avoiding the anal region. During prenatal care, the woman is instructed to be aware of luid leakage from the vagina and to report such an event promptly. Rupture of the membranes is signiicant for three reasons. First, if the presenting part is not ixed in the pelvis, the umbilical cord can prolapse and be compressed. Second, labor is likely to begin soon if the pregnancy is at or near term."

            "content": "In some women, the clinical appearance of uterine rupture mirrors that of placental abruption. In most, however, there is remarkably little appreciable pain or tenderness. Also, because most women in labor are treated for discomfort with either narcotics or epidural analgesia, pain and tenderness may not be readily apparent. The condition usually becomes evident because of fetal distress and occasionally because of maternal hypovolemia from concealed hemorrhage. If the fetal presenting part has already entered the pelvis with labor, loss of station may be detected by pelvic examination. If the fetus is partly or totally extruded from the uterine rupture site, abdominal palpation or vaginal examination may be help ful to identiY the presenting part, which will have moved away from the pelvic inlet. A irm contracted uterus may at times be felt alongside the fetus. Sonography may be helpful."

During the course of progressive hypoxia that led to death over 2 to 13 days, monkey fetuses invariably exhibited late decelerations before development of acidemia. Variability of the baseline heart rate disappeared as acidemia developed. Generally, any process that produces maternal hypotension, excessive uterine activity, or placental dysfunction can induce late decelerations. The two most common sources are hypotension from epidural analgesia and uterine hyperactivity from onset : sece: 1 ... FIGURE 24-14 Features ofvariable fetal heart rate decelerations.

            "content": "At Parkland Hospital, women are admitted if active labor is diagnosed or if ruptured membranes are conirmed. Labor is defined as cervical dilation of 3 to 4 cm or more in the presence of uterine contractions. Management guidelines direct that a pelvic examination be performed approximately every 2 hours. Inefective labor is suspected when the cervix does not dilate within approximately 2 hours of admission. Amniotomy is then performed, and labor progress determined at the next 2-hour evaluation. In women whose labors do not progress, an intrauterine pressure catheter is placed to assess uterine function. Hypotonic contractions and no cervical dilation after an additional 2 to 3 hours result in stimulation of labor using the high-dose oxytocin regimen described in Chapter 26 (p. 509). The goal is uterine activity of 200 to 250 Montevideo units for 2 to 4 hours before dystocia can be diagnosed. If hypotonic contractions are strongly suspected, internal monitors may be placed with"
