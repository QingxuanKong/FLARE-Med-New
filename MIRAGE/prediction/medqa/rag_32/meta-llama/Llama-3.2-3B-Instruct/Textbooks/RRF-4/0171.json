She reports that she feels well and has not experienced any contractions or vaginal bleeding. She also reports good fetal movement. The patient declined prenatal screening earlier in the pregnancy for religious reasons but would now like an anatomy ultrasound to ensure the fetus is growing appropriately. The patient\u2019s previous pregnancies were uncomplicated, and she delivered three healthy babies at full term. On the ultrasound, the technician observes a male fetus with likely intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). She also notes microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, and clenched fists with overlapping fingers. The technician further notes a medium-sized ventricular septal defect (VSD). The amniotic fluid index (AFI) is 26 cm.\n\nWhich of the following additional findings is most likely to be observed in this fetus?",

The patient is a 38-year-old G4P3 who is at 20 weeks of gestation and presents for an anatomy ultrasound due to concerns about fetal growth and development. The ultrasound reveals a male fetus with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, and a ventricular septal defect (VSD). These findings are concerning for a specific genetic syndrome. Let's evaluate the options given in the context of these findings.\\n\\nOption A, cleft palate, is a common congenital anomaly that can be seen in various genetic syndromes, but it is not as strongly associated with the described findings as some other options. \\n\\nOption B, epicanthal folds, are a characteristic feature of Down syndrome, but the presence of microcephaly, IUGR, and VSD in this fetus makes Down syndrome less likely. \\n\\nOption C, microphthalmia, refers to abnormally small eyes, which can be seen in several genetic syndromes, including Turner syndrome and CHARGE syndrome. However, the combination of microcephaly, IUGR, and VSD in this fetus is more suggestive of a different syndrome.\\n\\nOption D, prominent occiput, is a characteristic feature of Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), which is often associated with IUGR, microcephaly, and VSD. This combination of findings is most suggestive of Trisomy 18.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the ultrasound findings, the most likely diagnosis is Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Moreover, unlike cephalic presentations, the head of a breech-presenting fetus does not undergo appreciable molding during labor. Thus, if vaginal delivery is considered, fetal size, type of breech, and degree of neck lexion or extension are evaluated. In addition, pelvic dimensions are assessed to avoid head entrapment from cephalopelvic disproportion. Sonography and fetal pelvimetry are options. Sonographic fetal evaluation will have been performed in most cases as part of prenatal care. If not, gross fetal abnormalities, such as hydrocephaly or anencephaly, can be rapidly ascertained with sonography. This will identiy many fetuses not suitable for vaginal delivery. It will also help to ensure that a cesarean delivery is not performed under emergency conditions for an anomalous fetus with no chance of survival."

            "content": "Only about 50% of IUGR infants are identified before delivery.Measurement and recording of maternal fundal height in conjunction with serial ultrasound assessment of the fetus (growthrate, amniotic fluid volume, malformations, anomalies, and Doppler velocimetry of uterine, placental, and fetal blood flow) can aid detection. When suspected and identified, IUGR and SGA fetuses must be monitored for fetal well-being, and appropriate maternal care needs to be instituted (see Chapter 58)."

Early-onset growth restriction is especially problematic. In pregnancies in which fetal anomalies are suspected, patient counseling and prenatal diagnostic testing are indicated (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2015). Ifnoindications for immediate delivery, Ifnoindications for immediate delivery: begin antepartum fetal surveillance: -Antepartum fetal surveillance-BPP, NST, etc. -Regular fetal testing -Umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry weekly -Weekly umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry -Amnionic fluid evaluation weekly -Weekly evaluation of amnionic fluid surveillance until delivery 38 weeks, then deliver delivery 34 weeks, then begin FIGURE 44-9 Algorithm for management of fetal-growth restriction at Parkland Hospital.

Indeed, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2016a) concludes that clinical fetal weight estimates are just as accurate as sonographic ones."

            "content": "As long as interval fetal growth and fetal surveillance test results are normal, pregnancy is allowed to continue until fetal lung maturity is reached (see Fig. 44-9). Reassessment of fetal growth is typically made no sooner than 3 to 4 weeks. Weekly assessment of umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry and amnionic fluid volume is combined with periodic nons tress testing, although the optimal frequency has not been determined. As mentioned, we hospitalize these women in our High-Risk Pregnancy Unit and monitor their fetuses daily. If interval growth, amnionic luid volume, and umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry are normal, then the mother is discharged home and seen intermittently for outpatient surveillance."

            "content": "Head flexion can usually also be determined sonographically, and for vaginal delivery, the fetal head should not be extended (Fontenot, 1997; Rojansky, 1994). If imaging is uncertain, then simple two-view radiography of the maternal abdomen is useful to define fetal head inclination. Sonographic identification of a nuchal arm may warrant cesarean delivery to avoid neonatal harm (Sherer, 1989). he accuracy of fetal weight estimation by sonography is not altered by breech presentation (McNamara, 2012). Although variable, many protocols use fetal weights >2500 g and <3800 to 4000 g or evidence of growth restriction as exclusion criteria for planned vaginal delivery (Azria, 2012; Kotaska, 2009). Similarly, a biparietal diameter (BPD) >90 to 100 mm is often considered exclusionary (Giuliani, 2002; Roman, 2008)."
