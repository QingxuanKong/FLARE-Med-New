The abdomen is nontender, and regular contractions are felt every 2 minutes. The uterus is consistent in size with a 20-week gestation. There is blood on the vulva, introitus, and medial aspect of the thighs. Ultrasound shows complete detachment of the placenta from the uterus. Fetal heart tones are absent. An emergent cesarean delivery is performed. Following the procedure, the patient becomes tearful and distraught. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial response by the physician?",

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

Although these tears develop primarily in the lower uterine segment, they can extend upward into the active segment or downward through the cervix and into the vagina (Fig. 41-13). In some cases, the bladder may also be lacerated. If the rupture is of suicient size, the uterine contents will usually escape into the peritoneal cavity. If the presenting fetal part is firmly engaged, however, then only a portion of the fetus may be extruded from the uterus.

            "content": "Another caveat is that a gestational sac may appear similar to other intrauterine fluid accumulations-the so-called pseudogestational sac (Fig. 19-4, p. 375). his pseudosac may be blood derived from a bleeding ectopic pregnancy and is easier to exclude once a yolk sac is seen. Typically, the yolk sac is visible by 5.5 weeks and with a mean gestational-sac diameter of 10 mm. Thus, the diagnosis of an IUP should be made cautiously if the yolk sac is not yet seen (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 20 16h). For management of threatened abortion, observation is the norm. Acetaminophen-based analgesia will help relieve discomfort from cramping. Bed rest is often recommended but does not improve outcomes. The hematocrit and blood type is determined. If anemia or hypovolemia is signiicant, then pregnancy evacuation is generally indicated. In cases in which there is a live fetus, some instead may choose transfusion and further observation."

The patient had Crohn\u2019s disease and was maintained on 6-mercaptopurine and prednisone. She presented with abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, and small-bowel obstruction. The image reveals a 7to 10-cm long stricture at the terminal ileum (white arrows) causing obstruction and significant dilatation of the proximal small bowel (white asterisk). A fetus is seen in the uterus (dashed white arrows). (Courtesy of Drs. J. F. B. Chick and"

The gravid uterus is a large target, and any penetrating injury to the abdomen may result in fetal injury depending on trajectory and uterine size. Gunshot wounds to the abdomen are associated with a 70% injury rate to the uterus and 35% mortality rate of the fetus. If the bul-let traverses the uterus and the fetus is viable, cesarean section should be performed. On the other hand, stab wounds do not often penetrate the thick wall of the uterus.Any patient with a viable pregnancy should be monitored after trauma, with the length of monitoring determined by the injury mechanism and patient physiology.

Bed rest apparently has no added advantage. Antenatal corticosteroids can be provided as indicated or given prophylactically at 28 to 32 weeks' gestation to cover possible urgent preterm delivery. Antenatal hospitalization may be considered at 30 to 34 weeks to permit surveillance and expedited delivery for labor, bleeding, or rupture of membranes. Data supporting is limited, and admission may best serve women with risk factors that portend early delivery (Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, 2015). A few cases FIGURE 6-7 Vasa previa. Using color Doppler, an umbilical vessel (red circle) is seen overlying the internal os. At the bottom, the Doppler waveform seen with this vasa previa has the typical appearance of an umbilical artery, with a pulse rate of 141 beats per minute."
