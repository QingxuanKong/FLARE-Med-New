    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best long-term prophylaxis for the cause of this patient's acute symptoms, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory values. The patient has confusion, somnolence, increased urine output, and weight loss, which are suggestive of hypercalcemia. The laboratory values show hypercalcemia (Ca2+ 12.2 mg/dL), normal PTH (8 pg/mL), and elevated creatinine (1.1 mg/dL), which suggests impaired renal excretion of calcium. The patient's symptoms and laboratory values are consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism, which can cause hypercalcemia due to overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The best long-term prophylaxis for primary hyperparathyroidism is surgical removal of the parathyroid glands, but this is not listed as an option. However, among the given options, calcitonin is a medication that can help lower calcium levels by suppressing osteoclast activity and reducing calcium release from bones. It is often used to treat hypercalcemia, especially in cases of primary hyperparathyroidism. Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that can help reduce bone resorption and increase calcium excretion, but it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for hypercalcemia. IV fluids may be used to treat acute hypercalcemia, but they are not a long-term prophylaxis. Teriparatide is a recombinant form of PTH that can increase calcium levels, which is the opposite of what is needed to treat hypercalcemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Daily random urine electrolytes and urinary volume measurement can be used to monitor CeH2O and adjust daily fluid administration in this manner, while following plasma Na+ concentration. Physicians often calculate the free water deficit to guide therapy of hypernatremia, providing half the deficit in the first 24 h. This approach can be adequate in patients who do not have significant ongoing losses of free water, e.g., with hypernatremia due to decreased free water intake.

The room should be kept dimly lighted at night, and, if possible, the patient should not be moved from one room to another. Every procedure should be explained to the patient, even such simple ones as the taking of blood pressure or temperature. It may be some consolation and also a source of professional satisfaction to remember that most confused and delirious patients recover if they receive competent medical and nursing care (and are almost always amnestic for the ordeal). The family may be reassured on this point but forewarned that improvement may take several days or weeks and that episodes of confusion may be exposing an underlying dementia. They must also understand that the patient\u2019s abnormal behavior is not willful but rather symptomatic of a transitory brain disease. (See also Chap. 41 for specific aspects of"

At blood lithium concentrations above 3.5 mEq/L, these symptoms are replaced by stupor and coma, sometimes with convulsions, and may prove fatal. Discontinuing lithium in the intoxicated patient, which is the initial step in therapy, does not result in immediate disappearance of toxic symptoms. This may be delayed by a week or two, and the diabetes insipidus may persist even longer. Fluids, sodium chloride, aminophylline, and acetazolamide promote the excretion of lithium. Lithium coma may require hemodialysis, which has proved to be the most rapid means of reducing the blood lithium concentration."

A comatose patient may arrive with no available history, and in such cases, the approach is as described in Chap. 328. In other patients, an inadequate history may be overcome by a succession of examinations from which the course of the illness can be inferred. In perplexing cases it is useful to remember that uncommon presentations of common diseases are more likely than rare etiologies. Thus, even in tertiary care settings, multiple strokes are usually due to emboli and not vasculitis, and dementia with myoclonus is usually Alzheimer\u2019s disease and not a prion disorder or a paraneoplastic illness.

It is 64e-6 conceivable that residual hypovolemic hyponatremia attenuated the recovery of the plasma Na+ concentration. Alternatively, attenuated recovery was due to persistent effects of the single dose of DDAVP. Of note, although the plasma half-life of DDAVP is only 1\u20132 h, pharmacodynamic studies indicate a much more prolonged effect on urine output and/or urine osmolality. One final consideration is the effect of the patient\u2019s initial renal dysfunction on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the administered DDAVP, which is renally excreted; DDAVP should be administered with caution for the reinduction of hyponatremia in patients with chronic kidney disease or acute renal dysfunction.

Presumably, the liability to this state is determined by preexisting brain disease, most often Alzheimer disease but sometimes Parkinson disease, multiple small deep cerebral infarctions, or another dementing process, which may or may not have been obvious to the family before. All the clinical features that one observes in the acute confusional states may be present, but their severity varies greatly. Confusion may be reflected only in the patient\u2019s inability to relate the history of the illness sequentially, or it may be so severe that the patient is virtually non compos mentis.

The measured serum sodium may be normal or slightly low despite the marked hyperglycemia. The corrected serum sodium is usually increased (add 1.6 meq to measured sodium for each 5.6-mmol/L [100-mg/dL] rise in the serum glucose).
