    "question": "A 29-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain for 2 hours. Her current pregnancy was achieved by means of in vitro fertilization due to azoospermia in her partner. Prenatal course has been uncomplicated with regular prenatal visits. After a period of having avoided sexual intercourse during her early pregnancy, she resumed sexual activity with her partner at week 22 of gestation. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate; her other child was delivered vaginally. She has had abnormal Pap smears due to HPV in the past. Her pulse is 82/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. The abdomen is nontender, the uterus is consistent with 24 weeks' gestation, and the fetus is in a cephalic presentation. There are traces of blood on the vulva and the introitus. Speculum examination shows a tender, bruised cervix, with a closed cervical os. Fetal heart rate is 166/min and CTG shows a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. Ultrasound shows a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall. What is the most likely cause of this patient's antepartum bleeding?",

With a living viable-aged fetus, and with vaginal delivery not imminent, emergency cesarean delivery is chosen by most. In some women, fetal compromise will be evident as shown in Figure 41-19. When evaluating fetal status, sonographic conirmation of fetal heart activity may be necessary because sometimes an electrode applied directly to a dead fetus will provide misleading information by recording the maternal heart rate.

The condition usually becomes evident because of fetal distress and occasionally because of maternal hypovolemia from concealed hemorrhage. If the fetal presenting part has already entered the pelvis with labor, loss of station may be detected by pelvic examination. If the fetus is partly or totally extruded from the uterine rupture site, abdominal palpation or vaginal examination may be help ful to identiY the presenting part, which will have moved away from the pelvic inlet.

Occasionally, a woman may not employ her expulsive forces to good advantage and coaching is desirable. Her legs should be half-flexed so that she can push with them against the mattress. When the next uterine contraction begins, she is instructed to exert downward pressure as though she were straining at stool. A woman is not encouraged to push beyond the completion of each contraction. Instead, she and her fetus are allowed to rest and recover. During this period of actively bearing down, the fetal heart rate auscultated during the contraction is likely to be slow but should recover to normal range before the next expulsive efort. Fetal and obstetrical outcomes appear to be unafected whether pushing is coached or uncoached during second-stage labor (Bloom, 2006; Tuuli, 2012).

Antepartum, we usually give hydralaxine as described. We do not limit the total dose, and seldom is a second antihypertensive agent needed. We estimate that by severe superimposed preeclampsia, and hydralazine was injected more frequently than recommended. Her blood pressure in less than 1 hour dropped from 240-270/130-150 mm Hg to 1r10/80 mm Hg. Fetal heart rate decelerations characteristic of utero placental insuiciency became evident. Decelerations persisted until her blood pressure was increased with rapid crystalloid infusion. In some cases, this fetal response to diminished uterine perfusion may be confused with placental abruption and may result in unnecessary and potentially dangerous emergency cesarean delivery."

Ulti mately, the choice of abdominal or vaginal delivery is based on factors discussed earlier and listed in Table 28-1. During labor, one-on-one nursing is ideal because of cord prolapse risks, and physicians must be readily available for such emergencies. Guidelines for monitoring the high-risk fetus are applied (Chap. 24, p. 478). For first-stage labor, while most clini cians prefer continuous electronic monitoring, the fetal heart rate is recorded at a minimum of every 15 minutes. A scalp electrode can be safely aixed to the buttock, but genitalia are avoided. If a nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern develops, then a decision must be made regarding the necessity of cesarean delivery."

Typical indications for cesarean deliv-ery include nonreassuring fetal status, breech or other malpre-sentations, triplet and higher order gestations, cephalopelvic disproportion, failure to progress in labor, placenta previa, and active genital herpes. Previous low transverse cesarean deliv-ery is not a contraindication to subsequent vaginal birth after cesarean; however, much of the increase in cesarean delivery in the past two decades is attributable to planned repeat cesareans. Cesarean deliveries typically are performed via a lower anterior (caudal) uterine transverse incision because there is decreased blood loss, and the uterine rupture rate with future pregnancies is about 0.5% (Fig. 41-15). A prior classical cesarean delivery is an absolute indication for a planned repeat cesarean delivery because of a high rate of uterine rupture during labor, unlike with the lower anterior uterine transverse incision.

Often, clots are admixed with products of conception.

A vasovagal bradycardia may occur and responds to removal of the tissue.
