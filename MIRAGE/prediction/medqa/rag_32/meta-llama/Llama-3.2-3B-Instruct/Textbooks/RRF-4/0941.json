Esophageal varices - This condition is more commonly associated with liver disease and cirrhosis, which is not indicated in the patient's history. C. Porcelain gallbladder - This condition is more commonly associated with gallstones, which is not indicated in the patient's history. D. Hepatic steatosis - This condition is also known as fatty liver disease, which is more commonly associated with obesity and excessive alcohol consumption, but the patient's alcohol consumption is relatively low (2-3 glasses of wine weekly).

The Obesity-Focused History Information from the history should address the following seven questions: What factors contribute to the patient\u2019s obesity? How is the obesity affecting the patient\u2019s health? What is the patient\u2019s level of risk from obesity? What does the patient find difficult about managing weight?

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Similarly, physicians should advise all patients about prudent dietary and physical activity habits for maintaining ideal body weight. Both National Institutes of Health (NIH) and AHA statements recommend at least 30 min of moderate-intensity physical activity per day. Obesity, particularly the male pattern of centripetal or visceral fat accumulation, can contribute to the elements of the \u201cmetabolic syndrome\u201d cluster.

The prevention of heart disease, especially of CAD, is one of the most important tasks of primary care health givers as well as cardiologists. Prevention begins with risk assessment, followed by attention to lifestyle, such as achieving optimal weight, physical activity, and smoking cessation, and then aggressive treatment of all abnormal risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (Chap. 417). After a complete diagnosis has been established in patients with known heart disease, a number of management options are usually available.

A 50-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with severe lower back pain that had started several days ago. In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."

With this approach, it is expected that 50% of diagnosed cancers will be early stage. Screening of patients age 50 years or older with a 20 pack-year or greater history and additional risk factors (as determined by the Tammemagi lung cancer risk calculator or other validated risk scores) that increase the risk of lung cancer to 1.3% or greater should also be considered as part of lung cancer screening programs. In all cases, patient\u2013physician shared decision-making should be undertaken, with a discussion of the risks and benefits of screening.5 Assessment of patient risk before thoracic resection is based on clinical judgment and systematic assessment of"
