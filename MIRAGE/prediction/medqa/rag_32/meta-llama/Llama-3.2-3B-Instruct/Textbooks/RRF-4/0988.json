The fact that he rejects his null hypothesis does not necessarily mean that he has found an association between low birth weight and obesity. The p-value of 0.049 is close to the significance level of 0.05, which means that there is a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. This suggests that the researcher may have made a type I error, which is a false positive. The 95% confidence interval does not provide sufficient information to confirm the association between low birth weight and obesity. Therefore, we cannot conclude that a type 2 error has been made.

In a population-based cohort of more than 120,000 obese pregnant women, those who gained <15 lb had the lowest rates of preeclampsia, large-for-gestational age neonates, and cesarean delivery (Kiel, 2007). Among 100,000 women with normal prepregnancy BMI, De Vader and colleagues (2007) found that those who gained <25 Ib during pregnancy had a lower risk for preeclampsia, failed induction, cephalopelvic disproportion, cesarean delivery, and large-for-gestational age neonates. his cohort,"

Early pregnancy deprivation was associated with greater obesity rates in adult women but not men. Early starvation was also linked to higher rates of central nervous system anomalies, schizophre nia, and schizophrenia-spectrum personality disorders. hese observations and others have led to the concept of etal programming by which adult morbidity and mortality are related to fetal health.

And, although almost 70 percent of low-birthweight neonates are born preterm, the balance of low-birthweight newborns accounted for approximately 3 percent of term births in 2015 (Martin, 2017). Between 1990 and 2006, the proportion of newborns with birthweights <2500 g grew by more than 20 percent when the rate peaked at 8.3 percent (Martin, 2012). his trend toward smaller babies has slowed since the mid-to late-2000s and might partly be explained by the concurrent movement toward fewer deliveries prior to 39 weeks' gestation (Richards, 2016). In contrast, between 1990 and 2006, the incidence of birth weights >4000 g declined approximately 30 percent to a nadir of 7.6 percent in 2010 (Martin, 2012).

Furthermore, P values provide no insight into the effect size being measured. Simply, an intervention may be statistically significant but lack any clinical significance. Purely utilizing a P value to determine the value of research findings without assessing the effect size, confidence interval, and power of the study can be misleading.Despite these flaws identified in P values, the frequency of their appearance in modern literature has continued to increase.34 Each reader should be carefully skeptical of P values and await replication with similar significance for confirmation. Fisher did not anticipate or endorse the use of the modern P <0.05 criteria. Rather, he envisioned that experiments would be repeated until the investigator was sure that he or she had learned how to use the experimental intervention to get a predictable result.Alternative to P"

            "content": "One of the more controversial hypotheses centers on the role of total body weight and body composition on the age of menarche. It is argued that a girl must reach a critical body weight (47.8 kg) before menarche can occur (7). Body fat must increase to 23.5% from the typical 16% of the prepubertal state, which presumably is in\ufb02uenced by nutritional status (8). This hypothesis is supported by observations that menarche occurs earliest in obese girls, followed by normal-weight girls, then underweight girls, and lastly anorectic girls (Fig. 29.1). The importance of other factors is indicated by observations that menarche is often delayed in morbidly obese girls, those with diabetes, and those who exercise intensely but are of normal body weight and body fat percentage. Girls with precocious puberty may undergo menarche even if they have a low body fat percentage, and other girls show no pubertal development with a body fat percentage of 27% (9). The hypothesis linking menarche to body"

Battaglia and Lubchenco (1967) then classiied smalor-gestational-age neonates as those whose weights were below the 10th percentile for their gestational age. Low-birthweight newborns who are small for gestational age are often designated as having etalgrowth restriction. Such infants were shown to be at increased risk for neonatal death. For example, the mortality rate of SGA neonates born at 38 weeks was 1 percent compared with 0.2 percent in those with appropriate birthweights."
