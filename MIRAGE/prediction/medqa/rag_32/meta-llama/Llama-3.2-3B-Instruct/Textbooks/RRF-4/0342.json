    "question": "A 55-year-old woman with a history of HIV presents to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea, fever, and dry cough for the past 4 days. She has not been compliant with antiretroviral or prophylactic medication. On evaluation, the patient is in moderate respiratory distress. The temperature is 38.8\u00b0C (102.0\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 124/82 mm Hg, the pulse is 96/min, and the respiratory rate is 20/min. Pulse oximetry is 92% on 4 L oxygen by nasal cannula. Her CD4 count is 180 cells/\u03bcL. IV antibiotics and glucocorticoids are administered. After 30 minutes, the patient develops severe respiratory distress. Repeat vital signs show: temperature 38.3\u00b0C (101.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 80/50 mm Hg, pulse 104/min, respiration rate 32/min and pulse oximetry 85% on nasal cannula. The trachea deviates to the left. Breath sounds are absent on the right side and the neck veins are distended. Telemetry shows sinus tachycardia.

The patient has a history of HIV and is not compliant with antiretroviral or prophylactic medication, making her susceptible to opportunistic infections. The patient's symptoms and signs, such as respiratory distress, fever, and tracheal deviation to the left, suggest a possible pneumothorax. The patient's low blood pressure and decreased oxygen saturation also indicate a severe respiratory compromise. The patient's CD4 count is 180 cells/\u03bcL, which is considered immunocompromised. The administration of IV antibiotics and glucocorticoids may have contributed to the patient's worsening condition, possibly due to the development of a contrast-induced nephropathy or a severe allergic reaction. The patient's symptoms and signs suggest that a needle thoracostomy should be performed to relieve the tension in the pleural space and improve oxygenation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Assessment of the patient\u2019s general appearance and vital signs, skin and soft tissue examination, and the neurologic evaluation are of particular importance. The patient may appear either anxious and agitated or lethargic and apathetic. Fever is usually present, although elderly patients and compromised hosts (e.g., patients who are uremic or cirrhotic and those who are taking glucocorticoids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be afebrile despite serious underlying infection. Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate helps determine the degree of hemodynamic and metabolic compromise.

            "content": "A 69-year-old retired teacher presents with a 1-month history of palpitations, intermittent shortness of breath, and fatigue. She has a history of hypertension. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

Replacement of intravascular volume due to postcapillary venular leakage may require several liters of saline. Epinephrine provides both \u03b1and \u03b2-adrenergic effects, resulting in vasoconstriction, bronchial smooth-muscle relaxation, and attenuation of enhanced venular permeability. Oxygen alone via a nasal catheter or with nebulized albuterol may be helpful, but either endotracheal intubation or a tracheostomy is mandatory for oxygen delivery if progressive hypoxia develops. Ancillary agents such as the antihistamine diphenhydramine, 50\u2013100 mg IM or IV, and aminophylline, 0.25\u20130.5 g IV, are appropriate for urticaria-angioedema and bronchospasm, respectively.

These complaints are new since she used to always feel \u201chot,\u201d noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to \u201cprotect her bones\u201d and omeprazole for \u201cheartburn.\u201d On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm.

Questioning of her parents reveals that they are homeless and have been living in their car (a small van). The nights have been cold, and they have used a small char-coal burner to keep warm inside the vehicle. What is the most likely diagnosis? What treatment should be instituted immediately?

Administration of 600 cGy of whole-brain irradiation can protect against this complication and can be followed by rapid institution of antileukemic therapy. Hydroxyurea, 3\u20135 g, can rapidly reduce a high blast cell count while the accurate diagnostic workup is in progress. Pulmonary leukostasis may present as respiratory distress and hypoxemia, and progress to respiratory failure. Chest radiographs may be normal but usually show interstitial or alveolar infiltrates. Hyperleukocytosis rarely may cause acute leg ischemia, renal vein thrombosis, myocardial ischemia, bowel infraction, and priapism. Arterial blood gas results should be interpreted cautiously. Rapid consumption of plasma oxygen by the markedly increased number of white blood cells can cause spuriously low arterial oxygen tension.
