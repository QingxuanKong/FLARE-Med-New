    "question": "A 55-year-old woman presents to the office because she has been feeling weak. For the past 2 years, she has been urinating a considerable volume every time she goes to the bathroom. She has no past medical history. Her heart rate is 86/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, temperature is 37.4\u00b0C (99.3\u00b0F), and blood pressure is 111/79 mm Hg. Laboratory studies are significant for the following:\nCalcium 13.8 mg/dL\nPTH 230 pg/mL\nHer complete metabolic panel is otherwise within normal limits. Imaging studies show subperiosteal resorption and osteoporosis. Scintigraphy reveals the most common pathologic condition associated with the patient\u2019s diagnosis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and laboratory results.\\n\\nThe patient presents with polyuria (excessive urine production) and is found to have hypercalcemia (elevated calcium levels in the blood), hyperparathyroidism (elevated parathyroid hormone levels), and subperiosteal resorption and osteoporosis on imaging studies. These findings suggest a condition that affects calcium metabolism and bone health.\\n\\nThe patient's scintigraphy results indicate the most common pathologic condition associated with this diagnosis. This suggests that the condition is related to abnormal bone metabolism.\\n\\nLet's evaluate the options given:\\n\\nA. Adenoma - While adenomas can cause hypercalcemia, they are not typically associated with the full spectrum of findings seen in this patient, including hyperparathyroidism and subperiosteal resorption.\\n\\nB. Carcinoma - Bone cancer can cause hypercalcemia, but it is not the most common pathologic condition associated with the patient's diagnosis.\\n\\nC. Decreased calcitriol concentration - This option suggests hypoparathyroidism, which is the opposite of hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.\\n\\nD. Phosphate retention - This option is consistent with hyperparathyroidism, as elevated parathyroid hormone levels can lead to increased renal excretion of phosphate, resulting in hypophosphatemia (low phosphate levels) rather than retention. However, the patient has normal phosphate levels, making this option less likely. However, the patient's hypercalcemia and elevated PTH levels are consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism, which is often associated with subperiosteal resorption and osteoporosis. The scintigraphy results are also consistent with this diagnosis. The most common pathologic condition associated with primary hyperparathyroidism is hyperparathyroid adenoma, which is a benign tumor of the parathyroid gland. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma.\\n\\nThe correct answer is A. Adenoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

A general evaluation that includes complete blood count, serum and 24-h urine calcium, renal and hepatic function tests, and a 25(OH)D level is useful for identifying selected secondary causes of low bone mass, particularly for women with fractures or very low Z-scores. An elevated serum calcium level suggests hyperparathyroidism or malignancy, whereas a reduced serum calcium level may reflect malnutrition and osteomalacia. In the presence of hypercalcemia, a serum PTH level differentiates between hyperparathyroidism (PTH\u2191) and malignancy (PTH\u2193), and a high PTHrP level can help document the presence of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (Chap. 424). A low urine calcium (<50 mg/24 h) suggests osteomalacia, malnutrition, or malabsorption; a high urine calcium (>300 mg/24 h) is indicative of hypercalciuria and must be investigated further. Hypercalciuria occurs primarily in three situations: (1)"

A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative."

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV.
