    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of worsening shortness of breath for 6 hours. For the past 5 days, he has had intermittent stabbing pain in the middle of his chest that worsens with lying down or taking deep breaths. He has also had a runny nose and a dry cough for the past 2 weeks. He has hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 34 years. His current medications include atorvastatin, enalapril, and hydrochlorothiazide. He appears pale and sweaty. His temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 25/min. Blood pressure is 107/72 mm Hg during expiration and 86/65 mm Hg during inspiration. Examination shows jugular venous distention and pitting edema below the knees. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the given question: Step 1: The patient presents with worsening shortness of breath, stabbing chest pain that worsens with lying down or deep breathing, runny nose, dry cough, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and a history of smoking. These symptoms are suggestive of a cardiac condition. Step 2: The patient's symptoms of chest pain that worsen with lying down or deep breathing are classic for pericarditis, a condition characterized by inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart. Step 3: The patient's pale and sweaty appearance, tachycardia (pulse 105/min), and jugular venous distention further support the diagnosis of pericarditis. Step 4: The patient's blood pressure readings of 107/72 mm Hg during expiration and 86/65 mm Hg during inspiration are consistent with pulsus paradoxus, a condition characterized by a greater than 10 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure with inspiration, often seen in pericarditis. Step 5: The presence of pitting edema below the knees suggests right-sided heart failure, which can be a complication of pericarditis. Considering the above points, the most likely cause of the patient's findings is pericarditis. Here's the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with worsening shortness of breath, stabbing chest pain that worsens with lying down or deep breathing, runny nose, dry cough, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and a history of smoking.

In more severe HF, the patient must sit upright, may have labored breathing, and may not be able to finish a sentence because of shortness of breath. Systolic blood pressure may be normal or high in early HF, but it generally is reduced in advanced HF because of severe LV dysfunction. The pulse pressure may be diminished, reflecting a reduction in stroke volume. Sinus tachycardia is a nonspecific sign caused by increased adrenergic activity. Peripheral vasoconstriction leading to cool peripheral extremities and cyanosis of the lips and nail beds is also caused by excessive adrenergic activity."

Dyspnea may occur with multiple conditions considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain and thus is not discriminative, but the presence of dyspnea is important because it suggests a cardiopulmonary etiology.

A 14-year-old girl with a history of asthma requiring daily inhaled corticosteroid therapy and allergies to house dust mites, cats, grasses, and ragweed presents to the emergency department in mid-September, reporting a recent \u201ccold\u201d com-plicated by worsening shortness of breath and audible inspi-ratory and expiratory wheezing. She appears frightened and refuses to lie down but is not cyanotic. Her pulse is 120 bpm,"

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."

His heart fail-ure must be treated first, followed by careful control of the hypertension. He was initially treated with a diuretic (furo-semide, 40 mg twice daily). On this therapy, he was less short of breath on exertion and could also lie flat without dyspnea. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhib-itor was added (enalapril, 20 mg twice daily), and over the next few weeks, he continued to feel better. Because of continued shortness of breath on exercise, digoxin at 0.25 mg/d was added with a further modest improvement in exercise tolerance. The blood pressure stabilized at 150/90 mm Hg, and the patient will be educated regarding the relation between his hypertension and heart failure and the need for better blood pressure control. Cautious addition of a \u03b2 blocker (metoprolol) will be considered. Blood lipids, which are currently in the normal range, will be monitored."

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

            "content": "The diagnosis of PH can be missed without a reasonable index of suspicion. Dyspnea is the most common presenting symptom, but this complaint is far from specific for the diagnosis of PH. PH symptoms are insidious and overlap considerably with many common conditions, including asthma and other lung disease and cardiac disease. The symptoms of PH are often nonspecific and variable. Most patients will present with dyspnea and/or fatigue, whereas edema, chest pain, presyncope, and frank syncope are less common and associated with more advanced disease. On examination, there may be evidence of right ventricular failure with elevated jugular venous pressure, lower extremity edema, and ascites. Additionally, the cardiovascular examination may reveal an accentuated P2 component of the second heart sound, a right-sided S3 or S4, and a holosystolic tricuspid regurgitant murmur. It is also important to seek signs of the diseases that are often concurrent with PH: clubbing may be seen in some"

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

Fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and orthopnea are the most prominent complaints in patients with chronic severe MR. Palpitations are common and may signify the onset of AF. Right-sided heart failure, with painful hepatic congestion, ankle edema, distended neck veins, ascites, and secondary TR, occurs in patients with MR who have associated pulmonary vascular disease and pulmonary hypertension. Acute pulmonary edema is common in patients with acute severe MR. In patients with chronic severe MR, the arterial pressure is usually normal, although the carotid arterial pulse may show a sharp, low-volume upstroke owing to the reduced forward CO. A systolic thrill is often palpable at the cardiac apex, the LV is hyperdynamic with a brisk systolic impulse and a palpable rapid-filling wave (S3), and the apex beat is often displaced laterally."
