The key points to consider in this scenario are the patient's age, his athletic abilities, and the fact that he seems embarrassed and avoids eye contact during the examination. These factors suggest that the patient is likely experiencing normal adolescent development. The patient's masturbation is a common phenomenon during puberty, and his athletic abilities and school performance suggest that he is functioning normally. The physical examination shows no abnormalities, which further supports the idea that there is no underlying medical condition causing his behavior. The most appropriate next step in management would be to reassure the mother and the patient, as there is no indication of any underlying pathology or concern for the patient's well-being or behavior.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

            "content": "Edward Chu, MD are the possible benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy? The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy. One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC). He undergoes surgical resection and is found to have high-risk stage III CRC with five positive lymph nodes. After surgery, he feels entirely well with no symptoms. Of note, he has no other illnesses. What is this patient\u2019s overall prognosis? Based on his prognosis, what"

The patient\u2019s temperature was normal. He explained that the episode had occurred following a birthday party at which he had participated in an ice cream\u2013eating contest. The patient reported prior episodes of a similar nature following ingestion of a significant amount of dairy products. This clinical picture is most probably due to a deficiency in the activity of: A. isomaltase. B. lactase. C. pancreatic \u03b1-amylase. D. salivary \u03b1-amylase. E. sucrase. Correct answer = B. The physical symptoms suggest a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for carbohydrate degradation. The symptoms observed following the ingestion of dairy products suggest that the patient is deficient in lactase as a result of the age-dependent reduction in expression of the enzyme."

            "content": "Testing for apraxia is carried out in several ways. First, one observes the actions of the patient as he engages in simulated tasks as dressing, washing, shaving, and using eating utensils. Second, the patient is asked to carry out familiar symbolic acts\u2014wave goodbye, salute the flag, shake a fist as though angry, or blow a kiss. If he fails, he is asked to imitate such acts made by the examiner. Finally, he is asked to show how he would hammer a nail, brush his teeth, take a comb out of his pocket and comb his hair, or to execute a more complex act, such as lighting and smoking a cigarette or opening a bottle of soda, pouring some into a glass, and drinking it. These latter actions, involving more complex sequences, are said to be tests of ideational apraxia; the simpler and familiar acts are considered tests of ideomotor apraxia. To perform these tasks in the absence of the tool or utensil is always more demanding because the patient must mentally formulate a plan of action rather"

            "content": "Readiness for school (kindergarten) requires emotionalmaturity, peer group and individual social skills, cognitive abilities, and fine and gross motor skills (Table 7-1). Other issuesinclude chronologic age and gender. Children tend to do betterin kindergarten if their fifth birthday is at least 4 to 6 monthsbefore the beginning of school. Girls usually are ready earlierthan boys. If the child is in less than the average developmentalrange, he or she should not be forced into early kindergarten.Holding a child back for reasons of developmental delay, inthe false hope that the child will catch up, can also lead to difficulties. The child should enroll on schedule, and educational planning should be initiated to address any deficiencies. Physicians should be able to identify children at risk for school difficulties, such as those who have developmental delays or physical disabilities. These children may require specialized school services."

These problems usually come to light in the school-age child (hence the term school dysfunction), whose aptitude for classroom learning is poorer than the child\u2019s general intelligence. The medical referral may be from a parent, teacher, or psychologist. The clinician\u2019s objective is to determine by history and examination whether there is (1) a general congenital developmental abnormality impairing intelligence; (2) a specific deficit in reading, writing, arithmetic, or attention, any one of which may interfere with the child\u2019s ability to learn; (3) a primary sensory defect, particularly in audition; or (4) neither of these\u2014for example, a behavior disorder or home situation that interferes with schooling."
