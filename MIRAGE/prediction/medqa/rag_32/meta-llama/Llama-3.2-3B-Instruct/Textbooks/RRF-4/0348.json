    "question": "A 23-year-old woman presents to her psychiatrist concerned about her mood. She has felt tired and unwilling to engage in any activities lately. She states that her limbs feel heavy all the time and that completing any activity takes tremendous effort. She no longer finds any happiness in activities that she previously enjoyed. She also states that she really struggles to sleep and at times can't sleep for several days. The patient is started on appropriate first-line therapy and sent home. She returns 1 week later stating that her symptoms have not improved. She is requesting help as her performance at work and school is suffering. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",

        "A": "Add lithium to treatment regimen",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of depression, including tiredness, lack of motivation, heavy limbs, and decreased interest in activities. She has not improved with first-line therapy and is seeking additional help. The next step in management should be to reassess the patient's condition and consider the possibility of treatment resistance or non-response to first-line therapy. Given the severity of her symptoms and the impact on her daily functioning, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be a viable option. ECT is often considered when patients with severe depression do not respond to pharmacotherapy, and it can be effective in reducing symptoms quickly. The other options, adding lithium to the treatment regimen or changing the treatment to lithium, may not be the best next steps without further evaluation and consideration of the patient's specific situation. Continuing the current therapy may not be sufficient given the patient's lack of response.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The correct conclusion can usually be reached by keeping these illnesses in mind as one elicits the history from patient and family. Difficulty arises when symptoms of the psychiatric illness are so inconspicuous as not to be appreciated; one comes then to suspect the diagnosis only by having eliminated the common medical causes. Repeated observation may bear out the existence of an anxiety state or gloomy mood. Reassurance in combination with a therapeutic trial of antidepressant drugs may suppress symptoms of which the patient was barely aware, thus clarifying the diagnosis. The best that can be done is to assist the patient in adjusting to the adverse circumstances that have brought him under medical surveillance."

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

True or false: Withdrawing a nonbeneficial treatment is ethically similar to withholding a nonindicated one. When can a physician refuse to continue treating a patient on the grounds of futility? An eight-year-old child is in a serious accident. She requires emergent transfusion, but her parents are not present. Conditions in which confidentiality must be overridden. Involuntary commitment or isolation for medical treatment may be undertaken for what reason? A 10-year-old child presents in status epilepticus, but her parents refuse treatment on religious grounds. A son asks that his mother not be told about her recently discovered cancer. False. Patients may change their minds at any time. Exceptions to the requirement of informed consent include emergency situations and patients without decision-making capacity."

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet.
