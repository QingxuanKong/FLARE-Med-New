    "question": "A 22-year-old woman from a rural area who recently discovered she was pregnant is referred for a cardiology consultation due to cyanosis, dyspnea, and a cardiac murmur revealed at the initial prenatal visit. She is gravida 1, para 0 with an estimated gestational age of 19 weeks. She says that the murmur was found in her childhood, and the doctor at that time placed her under observation only. However, she has been lost to follow-up and has not had proper follow up in years. Currently, she complains of dizziness and occasional dyspnea on exertion which has gradually increased during her pregnancy. Prior to her pregnancy, she did not have any symptoms. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/60 mm Hg, heart rate 81/min, respiratory rate 13/min, and temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F). Her examination is significant for acrocyanosis and a fixed splitting of S2 and grade 3/6 midsystolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border. Which of the following physiological pregnancy changes is causing the change in this patient\u2019s condition?",

        "A": "Increase in heart rate",
        "B": "Decrease in systemic vascular resistance",

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings in the context of pregnancy. The patient presents with cyanosis, dyspnea, and a cardiac murmur, which suggests a congenital heart defect. The fixed splitting of S2 and the midsystolic murmur are also indicative of a ventricular septal defect (VSD). We need to consider how pregnancy affects the cardiovascular system and which physiological changes could exacerbate or alleviate the patient's condition.\\n\\nPregnancy is associated with several cardiovascular changes, including an increase in blood volume, cardiac output, and heart rate. However, the key consideration in this case is the impact of these changes on a patient with a pre-existing VSD.\\n\\nAn increase in blood volume (D) could potentially worsen the patient's condition by increasing the volume load on the heart, which could exacerbate the VSD. However, this is not the most likely explanation for the change in the patient's condition.\\n\\nA decrease in systemic vascular resistance (B) is not a direct consequence of pregnancy and is not relevant to the patient's condition.\\n\\nAn increase in cardiac output (C) is a normal physiological change in pregnancy, but it is unlikely to be the primary cause of the patient's symptoms, as the patient's cardiac output would likely be adequate to compensate for the increased blood volume and other changes.\\n\\nAn increase in heart rate (A) is a common physiological change in pregnancy, and it is possible that the increased heart rate could be contributing to the patient's symptoms. However, the fixed splitting of S2 and the presence of a midsystolic murmur suggest that the patient's cardiac output is not increasing in a way that would be expected with a normal physiological increase in heart rate. Instead, the patient's condition appears to be related to the pre-existing VSD.\\n\\nGiven the patient's history of a childhood VSD and the presence of a midsystolic murmur, it is likely that the patient has a significant VSD. The fixed splitting of S2 and the increased heart rate in pregnancy could be contributing to the patient's symptoms, but the primary factor is the increased blood volume in pregnancy. The increased blood volume can cause increased pulmonary blood flow, which can worsen the VSD and lead to symptoms such as cyanosis and dyspnea.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Increase in blood volume.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}}",

The duration of the murmur lengthens and the intensity of P2 diminishes with increasing degrees of valvular stenosis (Fig. 51e1D). An early ejection sound, the intensity of which decreases with inspiration, is heard in younger patients. A parasternal lift and ECG evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy indicate severe pressure overload. If obtained, the chest x-ray may show poststenotic dilation of the main pulmonary artery. TTE is recommended for complete characterization. Significant left-to-right intracardiac shunting due to an ASD (Chap. 282) leads to an increase in pulmonary blood flow and a grade 2\u20133 mid-systolic murmur at the middle to upper left sternal border CHAPTER 51e Approach to the Patient with a Heart Murmur"

For example, in normal pregnancy, functional systolic heart murmurs are common, respiratory efort is accentuated, edema frequently accrues in lower extremities after midpregnancy, and fatigue and exercise intolerance often develop. Some systolic flow murmurs can be loud, and normal changes in the various heart sounds depicted in Figure 49-1 may erroneously suggest cardiac disease. In con trast, clinical findings that are more likely to suggest heart disease are listed in Table 49-2. Noninvasive cardiovascular studies such as electrocardiography, chest radiography, and echocardiography will provide the data necessary for evaluation in most women."

Angina and syncope occur when right ventricular output is ixed, and they suggest advanced disease. Chest radiography often shows enlarged pulmonary hilar arteries and attenuated peripheral markings. It also may disclose parenchymal causes of hypertension. N oninvasive echocardiography can provide an estimate of pulmonary artery pressures, although cardiac catheterization remains the standard for measurement. In two studies with a combined 51 pregnant women who underwent both echo cardiography and cardiac catheterization, pulmonary artery pressures were significantly overestimated by echocardiography in approximately one third of cases (Penning, 2001; Wylie, 2007)."

Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin.

The classic history presented by patients with severe aortic stenosis includes exercise dyspnea, angina, and syncope, whereas symptoms of mitral stenosis are paroxysmal and effort dyspnea, hemoptysis, and orthopnea. Most patients have a remote history of rheumatic fever. Severe stenosis of either valve is considered to be a valvular area of less than 1 cm2, and diagnosis can be confirmed by echocardiography or cardiac catheterization."

They may present with signs of heart failure. The heart is hyperdynamic, with palpable left and right ventricular impulses. A loud VSD murmur is heard. S2 is single. ECG findings typically include right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy. The chest x-ray reveals increased pulmonary vascularity, and the cardiac shadow is classically an egg on a string created by the narrow superior mediastinum.
