    "question": "A 54-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he was found outside in the middle of a blizzard. On presentation, he is conscious but does not know where he is nor how he got there. His wife is contacted and says that he has been getting increasingly confused over the past 6 weeks. This progressed from misplacing objects to getting lost in places that he knew how to navigate previously. Most worryingly, he has recently started forgetting the names of their children. In addition to these memory changes, she says that he now has rapid jerky movements of his extremities as well as coordination and balance problems. Finally, he has become extremely paranoid about government surveillance and has had hallucinations about secret agents in their house. His previous medical history is significant for a previous car crash in which the patient required internal fixation of a femur fracture and a corneal transplant for corneal degeneration. Otherwise he had no neurologic deficits prior to 6 weeks ago. Physical exam reveals myoclonus and ataxia. Which of the following is true of the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Can be transmitted on medical equipment even after autoclaving instruments",
        "B": "Contains genetic material but is unable to survive independent from a host",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of confusion, memory loss, myoclonus, ataxia, and hallucinations, which have progressed over 6 weeks. These symptoms are characteristic of a neurodegenerative disorder. The patient's previous medical history of a car crash and corneal transplant may be relevant, but the most likely cause of his symptoms is a prion disease. Prion diseases are infectious proteins that can cause neurodegeneration and are typically transmitted through direct contact with infected tissue. The fact that the patient's symptoms have progressed rapidly over 6 weeks is also consistent with a prion disease. The other options do not match the patient's symptoms and history as closely. Option A refers to a type of bacterial infection that can be transmitted through medical equipment, but it does not match the patient's symptoms. Option B refers to viruses, which can also cause neurodegenerative disorders, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a prion disease. Option C refers to gram-positive bacteria, which are not typically associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Option D refers to tau protein phosphorylation, which is associated with some neurodegenerative disorders, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a prion disease. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is a prion disease, which is characterized by the intracellular aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the context of a misfolded prion protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Most such patients are actively engaged in litigation when first seen. Another interesting feature is the frequency with which the patient expresses extreme dissatisfaction with the medical care given him; he is often hostile toward the physicians and nurses. Many of these patients have already been subjected to an excessive number of hospitalizations and rather dramatic mishaps have allegedly occurred in carrying out diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

He may talk incessantly and incoherently, and look distressed and perplexed; his expression may be in keeping with vague notions of being annoyed or threatened by someone. From his manner and the content of speech, it is evident that he misinterprets the meaning of ordinary objects and sounds, misidentifies the people around him, and is experiencing vivid visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations, often of a most unpleasant type. At first the patient can be brought into touch with reality and may identify the examiner and answer other questions correctly; but almost at once he relapses into a preoccupied, confused state, giving incorrect answers and being unable to think coherently.

Otherwise, asking the date and place, repeating and recalling words, and simple arithmetic are adequate screening procedures.

Sometimes, the patient\u2019s attention can be best engaged by speaking softly or whispering rather than shouting or using a conversational amplitude of voice. A subtle disorder of orientation may be betrayed by an incorrect response regarding dates (off by more than one day of the month or day of the week), or in misnaming the hospital.

He is rushed to a nearby level 1 trauma center where he is found to have multiple facial fractures, a severe, unstable cervical spine injury, and significant left eye trauma. Further examination of his left eye reveals rupture of his globe. The ophthalmolo-gist requests emergency surgery to repair and save his eye. Because the patient has suffered a recent trauma, you decide to perform a rapid sequence intubation in preparation for the surgical procedure. What muscle relaxant would you use to facilitate tracheal intubation? What is the proper dose for your chosen muscle relaxant? After intravenous infusion of your chosen muscle relaxant, you are unable to adequately visualize the patient\u2019s larynx and vocal cords and cannot successfully pass an endotracheal tube. You switch to mask ventilation but are barely able to mask ventilate the patient, and you become worried"

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."

Following a sleepless night with significant dyspnea, the patient develops nausea and vomiting and collapses. He presents to the emergency department in cardiac arrest and is unable to be resuscitated. His autopsy shows a posterior wall myocardial infarction and a fresh thrombus in an atherosclerotic right coronary artery. What went wrong? The clinician had decided, based on the patient\u2019s appearance, even before starting the history, that the patient\u2019s complaints were not serious. Therefore, he felt confident that he could perform an abbreviated and focused examination by using the URI assessment protocol rather than considering the broader range of possibilities and performing appropriate tests to confirm or refute his initial hypotheses. In particular, by concentrating on the URI, the clinician failed to elicit the full dyspnea history, which would have"

After 6 months, these patients\u2019 nervous system function was essentially restored to normal. In reference to the pathogenesis of this lesion, originally both patients had serum Na levels of 99 mEq/L, but information about the rate of correction of serum Na was not available. Another of our patients developed a typical locked-in syndrome after the rapid correction of a serum sodium of 104 mEq/L. He had large symmetrical lesions of the frontal cortex and underlying white matter but no pontine lesion."

The patient should be discouraged from framing his symptom(s) in terms of a diagnosis that he may have heard; rather, he should be urged to give a simple description\u2014 being asked, for example, to choose a word that best describes his pain and to report precisely what he means by a particular term such as dizziness, imbalance, or vertigo. Otherwise there is disposition on the part of the patient to emphasize aspects of the history that support a superficially plausible diagnosis. This problem is now amplified by the wide array of medical information available to patients through various sources such as the Internet. The patient who is given to highly circumstantial and rambling accounts can be kept on the subject of his illness by directive questions that draw out essential points. One should avoid suggesting terms to the patient, particularly those that prematurely confirm the physician\u2019s"
