    "question": "A 69-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with hip and back pain. The patient states that this weekend he had a barbecue. When he was lifting a heavy object he suddenly felt pain in his lower back. He describes the pain as in his buttocks but states that at times it travels down his leg. The patient states that it feels, \"electrical.\" The patient has a past medical history of obesity, diabetes, depression, anxiety, diverticulosis, constipation, and a surgical repair of his anterior cruciate ligament. His current medications include metformin, insulin, lisinopril, fluoxetine, and sodium docusate. Which of the following is most likely to help confirm the diagnosis?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with hip and back pain, particularly radiating pain down the leg that feels like 'electrical.' This symptomatology is highly suggestive of sciatica, which is often caused by a herniated disc in the lumbar spine. The patient's history of a recent heavy lifting incident at a barbecue is a common precipitating factor for such an injury. The physical examination findings of sciatica can be confirmed with specific maneuvers such as straight leg raise (SLR) test, which is a common diagnostic tool for sciatica. The SLR test involves lifting the patient's leg 90 degrees and then slowly lowering it to 0 degrees while observing for pain. If the patient experiences pain, it is likely that the sciatic nerve is irritated or compressed at the L4-S3 nerve roots. The other options are not as directly related to the diagnosis of sciatica.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

            "content": "A 45-year-old man with no significant medical history was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 10 days ago after suffering third-degree burns over 40% of his body. He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

Enzymatic analysis revealed a deficiency of \u03b1galactosidase, and enzyme replacement therapy was recommended. The most likely diagnosis is: A. Fabry disease. B. Farber disease. C. Gaucher disease. D. Krabbe disease. E. Niemann-Pick disease. Correct answer = A. Fabry disease, a deficiency of \u03b1-galactosidase, is the only X-linked sphingolipidosis. It is characterized by pain in the extremities, a red-purple skin rash (generalized angiokeratomas), and kidney and cardiac complications. Protein in his urine indicates kidney damage. Enzyme replacement therapy is available. 7.4. Current medical advice for individuals experiencing chest pain is to call emergency medical services and chew a regular strength, noncoated aspirin. What is the basis for recommending aspirin?"
