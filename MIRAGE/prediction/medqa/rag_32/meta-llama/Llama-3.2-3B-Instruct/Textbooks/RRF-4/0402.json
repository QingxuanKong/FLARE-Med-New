    "question": "A 27-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder presents for a 3-month follow-up after starting treatment with lithium. She says she has been compliant with her medication but has experienced no improvement. The patient has no other significant past medical history and takes no other medications. She reports no known allergies. The patient is afebrile, and her vital signs are within normal limits. A physical examination is unremarkable. The patient is switched to a different medication. The patient presents 2 weeks later with an acute onset rash on her torso consisting of targetoid lesions with a vesicular center. She says the rash developed 2 days ago which has progressively worsened. She also says that 1 week ago she developed fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days. Which of the following drugs was this patient most likely prescribed?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which medication the patient was most likely prescribed, let's consider the symptoms presented. The patient has an acute onset of a rash with targetoid lesions and a vesicular center, which developed 2 days ago and progressively worsened. She also had a previous episode of fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days. These symptoms suggest a drug reaction, possibly a severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR). Given the patient's history of bipolar disorder and the switch from lithium to another medication, we need to consider medications known to cause SCARs. Lamotrigine is a known cause of SCARs, particularly in patients with a history of depression or bipolar disorder. Valproate can also cause SCARs, but it is less common. The OFC combination is not typically associated with SCARs. Paroxetine is an SSRI and not commonly associated with SCARs. Considering the patient's history and symptoms, lamotrigine is the most likely medication that was prescribed, leading to the severe cutaneous adverse reaction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

            "content": "Treat with systemic antihistamines. Topical medications are of no benefit. Maintain a high suspicion for a cutaneous drug reaction in patients who are hospitalized and develop rashes. Such reactions can take many forms, including urticarial, lupus-like, vasculitic, purpuric, lichenoid, and vesicular. Drugs can cause all four types of hypersensitivity reactions, and sometimes the same drug may cause different types of reactions in different patients. Eruptions occur 7\u201314 days after exposure, so if a patient reacts within a day or two of starting a new drug (i.e., a drug they have never taken before), that drug is probably not the causative agent. Eruptions are generally widespread, relatively symmetrical, and pruritic. Most are relatively short-lived, disappearing within 1\u20132 weeks following removal of the offending agent."

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

She became convinced that her roommate was listening in on her phone conversations and planning to alter her essays. She became reclusive and spent most of her time locked in her room. After much difficulty, her teachers convinced her to be seen by the student health service. It was believed she was beginning to show signs of schizophrenia and she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where she was started on antipsychotic medications. While in the hospital, she had a generalized seizure which prompted her transfer to our service. Her spinal fluid analysis showed 10 lymphocytes per mL3. She was found to have an anti-NMDA receptor antibody, which prompted an ultrasound examination of the pelvis. The left ovary was thought to show a benign cyst. Because of the neurological syndrome, the ovarian cyst was resected and revealed a microscopic ovarian teratoma. The neuropsychiatric syndrome resolved. She has since graduated and"

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."
