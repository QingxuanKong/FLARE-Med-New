    "question": "An 18-year-old patient is visiting the pediatrician with her mother for her annual exam before college starts. Her height and weight are appropriate for her age, and she is up to date on all her vaccinations and has no medical complaints. She is doing well in school and has a part-time job stocking shelves at a clothing store. She was offered a higher-paying job as a cashier at the store, but she declined. She is very shy and withdrawn with the physician. Afterwards, her mother asks to speak to the physician alone and expresses concern that her daughter is very socially isolated and feels lonely. She is also worried that her daughter is extremely sensitive to criticism, even from family. The daughter is interested in art and music, but hasn\u2019t participated in any extracurriculars because she says that she is untalented and thinks nobody wants to hang out with her. When her mother has encouraged her to invite friends over, the daughter bursts into tears and says, \u201cNobody wants to be friends with me, I am too lame and ugly and I just know I\u2019ll end up getting rejected.\u201d Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the daughter\u2019s behavior?",

The key points to consider are the patient's social isolation, sensitivity to criticism, feeling of inadequacy, and fear of rejection. These symptoms are common in avoidant personality disorder, which is characterized by pervasive feelings of social inadequacy, hypersensitivity to criticism or rejection, and social avoidance due to feelings of inadequacy. In contrast, schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by eccentric behavior, anomalies of thinking and speech, and unusual perceptual experiences, which are not mentioned in the scenario. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive worry about everyday things, which may be a part of the daughter's anxiety, but it does not fully explain her social isolation and feelings of inadequacy. Dependent personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive need to be taken care of, which is not mentioned in the scenario. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the daughter's behavior is avoidant personality disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

It may help the child to understand that the death occurred and provide an opportunity to say good-bye. Seeing others express their grief and sadness may help the child to express these feelings. Going to the funeral helps prevent the child from having fears or fantasies about what happened at the funeral. If the child is going to attend the funeral, he or she should be informed of what will happen. If a preschool-age child expresses a desire not to attend the funeral, he or she should not be encouraged to attend. For older children, it may be appropriate to encourage attendance, but a child who feels strongly about not wanting to go to the funeral should not be required to attend.

However they are not likely to understand fully the subtleties of parental conflict or the idea that multiple factors contribute to a conflict.

Many young school-age children worry about what will happen to one or both parents. School performance often deteriorates. Older elementary school\u2013age children may believe that one parent was wronged by the other. This belief, in conjunction with their concrete understanding of cause and effect, allows children to be easily co-opted by one parent to take sides against the other.

Preschool children may reason that if the parents left each other they also might leave the child. To counteract this fear of abandonment, children may need to be reassured that although parents separated, they will not abandon the child and that the child\u2019s relationship with both parents will endure."

She is comatose, tachypneic (25 breaths per minute), and tachycardic (150 bpm), but she appears flushed, and fingertip pulse oximetry is normal (97%) breathing room air. Questioning of her parents reveals that they are homeless and have been living in their car (a small van). The nights have been cold, and they have used a small char-coal burner to keep warm inside the vehicle. What is the most likely diagnosis? What treatment should be instituted immediately? If her mother is pregnant, what additional measures should be taken?"

She is obese (body mass index [BMI] 33), does not exercise, and spends a good portion of her work day in a seated position. She eats a low-sugar diet and regularly eats packaged frozen meals for dinner because she doesn\u2019t have time to cook regularly. Her most recent laboratory values include a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that is above goal at 160 mg/dL (goal < 100 mg/dL) and a hemo-globin A1c that is well controlled at 6%. Her blood pressure is high at 160/100 mm Hg. Her prescription medications include simvastatin, metformin, and benazepril. She also takes over-the-counter ibuprofen for occasional knee pain and a multivitamin supplement once daily. She has heard good things about natural products and asks you if taking a garlic supplement daily could help to bring her blood"

Sometimesa child might express a wish to die so that he or she canvisit the dead relative, but a plan or desire to commit suicide is uncommon and would need immediate evaluation. A decrease in academic functioning, lack of enjoymentwith activities, and changes in appetite and sleep can occur.About half of children have their most severe symptomsabout 1 month after the death, but for many the most severesymptoms in reaction to the death do not occur until 6 to12 months after the death.

This may appear before the more obvious memory or language defects announce themselves. The patient becomes convinced that relatives are stealing his possessions or that an elderly and even infirm spouse is guilty of infidelity. He may hide his belongings, even relatively worthless ones, and go about spying on family members. Hostilities arise, and wills may be altered irrationally. Many of these patients are constantly worried, tense, and agitated. Of course, paranoid delusions may be part of a depressive psychosis and of other dementias, but most of the elderly patients in whom paranoia is the presenting problem, seem not to be depressed, and their cognitive functions are for a time relatively well preserved. Social indiscretions, rejection of old friends, embarking on imprudent financial ventures, or an amorous pursuit that is"

Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of \u201closs of vision.\u201d Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver\u2019s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"
