    "question": "A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a neck mass. He first noticed a firm mass on the anterior aspect of his neck approximately 4 months ago. The mass is painless and has not increased in size since then. He has also noticed occasional fatigue and has gained 10 pounds in the past 4 months despite no change in his diet or exercise frequency. His past medical history is notable for gout for which he takes allopurinol. He denies any prior thyroid disorder. He runs 4 times per week and eats a balanced diet of mostly fruits and vegetables. He does not smoke and drinks a glass of wine with dinner. His family history is notable for medullary thyroid cancer in his maternal uncle. His temperature is 97.8\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 127/72 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 19/min. On exam, he has a firm, symmetric, and stone-firm thyroid.

The most common clinically apparent cause of chronic thyroiditis is Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, an autoimmune disorder that often presents as a firm or hard goiter of variable size (see above). Riedel\u2019s thyroiditis is a rare disorder that typically occurs in middle-aged women. It presents with an insidious, painless goiter with local symptoms due to compression of the esophagus, trachea, neck veins, or recurrent laryngeal nerves. Dense fibrosis disrupts normal gland architecture and can extend outside the thyroid capsule. Despite these extensive histologic changes, thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The goiter is hard, nontender, often asymmetric, and fixed, leading to suspicion of a malignancy. Diagnosis requires open biopsy as FNA biopsy is usually inadequate.

An estimate of thyroid size (normally 12\u201320 g) should be made, and a drawing is often the best way to record findings. However, ultrasound is the method of choice when it is important to determine thyroid size accurately. The size, location, and consistency of any nodules should also be defined. A bruit or thrill over the gland, located over the insertion of the superior and inferior thyroid arteries (superoor inferolaterally), indicates increased vascularity, as occurs in hyperthyroidism. If the lower borders of the thyroid lobes are not clearly felt, a goiter may be retrosternal. Large retrosternal goiters can cause venous distention over the neck and difficulty breathing, especially when the arms are raised (Pemberton\u2019s sign).

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

After admission a bronchoscopy was carried out and sputum was aspirated from the left upper lobe bronchus. This was cultured in the laboratory and also viewed under the microscope and tuberculous bacilli (TB) were identified. A 68-year-old man came to his family physician complaining of discomfort when swallowing (dysphagia). The physician examined the patient and noted since his last visit he had lost approximately 18 lb over 6 months. Routine blood tests revealed the patient was anemic and he was referred to the gastroenterology unit. A diagnosis of esophageal cancer was made and the patient underwent a resection, which involved a chest and abdominal incision. After 4 years the patient remains well though still subject to follow-up."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

His blood urate was 8.5 mg/dl (reference = 2.5\u20138.0). The unusually young age of presentation is suggestive of an enzymopathy of purine metabolism, and additional blood tests are ordered. Diagnosis: IR has gout (MSU crystal deposition disease), a type of inflammatory arthritis. Treatment: IR was given prescriptions for allopurinol and colchicine. The treatment goals are to reduce his blood urate levels to <6.0 mg/dl and prevent additional attacks. He was advised to lose weight because being overweight or obese is a risk factor for gout. His BMI of 31 puts him in the obese category. He was also given written information on the association between diet and gout. Prognosis: Gout increases the risk of developing renal stones. It is also associated with hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease."

For unclear reasons the incidence of papillary cancer increased by almost threefold in the past 30 years, from 2.7 to 7.7 per 100,000 people (55). This may represent the more ready diagnosis of smaller cancers. The majority of cancers are found incidentally during routine examinations. Risk factors include a history of radiation exposure during childhood and family history. Signs include rapid growth of neck mass, new onset hoarseness, or vocal cord paralysis. In the setting of rapid growth, fixed nodule, new onset hoarseness, or the presence of lymphadenopathy, it is important to be sure a fine-needle aspiration is done. Thyroidectomy is the primary treatment with radioactive iodine and TSH suppression with thyroxine. Patients younger than 50 years of age with a primary tumor of less than 4 cm at presentation, even with associated cervical lymph node metastasis, are usually cured. In the"

Given this high prevalence rate, practitioners commonly identify thyroid nodules either on physical examination or as incidental findings on imaging performed for another indication (e.g., carotid ultrasound, cervical spine MRI). The main goal of this evaluation is to identify, in a cost-effective manner, the small subgroup of individuals with malignant lesions."

On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."
