Option A, age, is not a reliable indicator of prognosis in acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). While age can affect treatment outcomes, it is not a strong predictor of prognosis in this context. Option C, fever and neutropenia, are symptoms of febrile neutropenia, which is a common complication in patients with cancer, including T-ALL. While these symptoms require prompt treatment, they do not necessarily indicate a poor prognosis. Option D, initial presentation, is also not a reliable indicator of prognosis. The initial presentation of T-ALL can vary widely, and the prognosis depends on various factors, including cytogenetics, immunophenotype, and response to treatment. Option B, cytogenetics, is a strong predictor of prognosis in T-ALL. Specific chromosomal abnormalities, such as the t(9;22) translocation, can influence treatment outcomes and overall survival. The presence of this translocation is associated with a poorer prognosis and a higher risk of relapse. Therefore, the factor that most strongly indicates a poor prognosis in this patient is the presence of the t(9;22) translocation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

Common symptoms, if any, include fever, fatigue, rash, headache, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, myalgias, nausea, and diarrhea. After symptoms abate, the level of viremia usually decreases to a set point, and patients with the highest viral burden at this time progress more rapidly to AIDS and death (Fauci, 2007). According to the CDC, AIDS is defined by a CD4 T-cell count <200 cells/lLL, by CD4 T-cells comprising < 14 percent of alirlymphocytes, or one of several AIDS-defining illnesses (Schneider, 2008; Selik, 2014). Route of infection, the pathogenicity of the infecting viral strain, the initial viral inoculum, and the immunological status of the host all afect the rapidity of progression."

Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse.

Common presenting symptoms are fever, pallor, petechiae or ecchymoses, lethargy, malaise, anorexia, and bone or joint pain. Physical examination frequently reveals lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. The testes and central nervous system (CNS) are common extramedullary sites for ALL; neurologic symptoms or a painless enlargement of one or both testes may be seen. Patients with T-cell ALL often have high white blood cell (WBC) counts, anterior mediastinal masses, bulky disease ALL, B cell\u2014L3 morphology (i.e., Burkitt leukemia)"
