The X-linked recessive autoimmune syndrome IPEX (immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked) is typically caused by missense mutations in the gene encoding the transcription factor FoxP3, which is key in the differentiation and function of some types of Treg cells (see Section 9-21). This disease is characterized by severe allergic inflammation, autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, secretory diarrhea, hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia, and usually leads to early death. Despite mutation of the FOXP3 gene, the number of FoxP3+ Treg cells in the blood of individuals with IPEX is comparable to the number in healthy individuals; however, the"

Smallplatelets are seen on a peripheral blood smear. Nevertheless,thrombocytopenia often is improved by splenectomy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation cures the immunodeficiencyand thrombocytopenia. Familial X-linked thrombocytopeniacan be seen as a variant of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome or amutation in the GATA1 gene. Autosomal macrothrombocytopenia is due to deletions in chromosomes 22q11 or mutationsin 22q12."

            "content": "Suppression by regulatory T cells. A population of T cells called regulatory T cells functions to prevent immune reactions against self antigens. Regulatory T cells develop mainly in the thymus, but they also may be induced in peripheral lymphoid tissues. The best-defined regulatory T cells are CD4+ cells that express high levels of CD25, the \u03b1 chain of the IL-2 receptor, and a transcription factor of the forkhead family, called FOXP3. Both IL-2 and FOXP3 are required for the development and maintenance of functional CD4+ regulatory T cells. Mutations in the FOXP3 gene result in severe autoimmunity in humans and mice; in humans, these mutations are the cause of a systemic autoimmune disease called IPEX (an acronym for immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked)."

The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy. One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC). He undergoes surgical resection and is found to have high-risk stage III CRC with five positive lymph nodes. After surgery, he feels entirely well with no symptoms. Of note, he has no other illnesses. What is this patient\u2019s overall prognosis? Based on his prognosis, what"

            "content": "Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, and X-linked disease (IPEX; OMIM 304790) is a rare X-linked recessive disorder. The disease onset is in infancy and is characterized by severe enteropathy, T1D, and skin disease, as well as variable association with several other autoimmune disorders. Many infants die within the first days of life, but the course is variable, with some children surviving for 12\u201315 years. Early onset of T1D, often at birth, is highly suggestive of the diagnosis because nearly 80% of IPEX patients develop T1D. Although treatment of the individual disorders can temporarily improve the situation, treatment of the underlying immune deficiency is required and includes immunosuppressive therapy generally followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Transplantation is the only life-saving form of therapy and can be fully curative by normalizing the imbalanced immune system found in this disorder."
