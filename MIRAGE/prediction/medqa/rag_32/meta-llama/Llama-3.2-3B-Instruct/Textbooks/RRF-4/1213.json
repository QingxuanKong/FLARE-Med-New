This suggests a tremor, which is a common symptom of Parkinson's disease. The patient's father had a similar condition, which suggests a possible genetic component. The patient's anxiety and low-amplitude tremor bilaterally when the arms are outstretched are also consistent with Parkinson's disease.\\n\\nThe normal muscle strength and tone, as well as deep tendon reflexes, help rule out other conditions that may cause tremors, such as upper motor neuron lesions or peripheral neuropathy.\\n\\nGiven the patient's symptoms and family history, the most likely diagnosis is Parkinson's disease.\\n\\nThe next step in management would be to initiate treatment with levodopa and carbidopa therapy, which is the first-line treatment for Parkinson's disease. This combination of medications can help alleviate symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slowness of movement).\\n\\nDeep brain stimulation (A) and thalamotomy (B) are surgical options that may be considered for patients who do not respond to medication or have severe symptoms. Propranolol therapy (D) is not typically used to treat Parkinson's disease, as it can actually worsen tremors.\\n\\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to initiate levodopa and carbidopa therapy.\\n\\nAnswer: C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

First, in recording observations, it is important to describe what is found rather than to apply a poorly defined medical term (e.g., \u201cpatient groans to sternal rub\u201d rather than \u201cobtunded\u201d). Second, subtle CNS abnormalities are best detected by carefully comparing a patient\u2019s performance on tasks that require simultaneous activation of both cerebral hemispheres (e.g., eliciting a pronator drift of an outstretched arm with the eyes closed; extinction on one side of bilaterally applied light touch, also with eyes closed; or decreased arm swing or a slight asymmetry when walking). Third, if the patient\u2019s complaint is brought on by some activity, reproduce the activity in the office. If the complaint is of dizziness when the head is turned in one direction, have the patient do this and also look for associated signs on examination (e.g., nystagmus or dysmetria).

Even the least degree of tremor is felt during passive movement of a rigid part (cogwheel phenomenon, or Negro sign, or at least this is the ostensible explanation for cogwheeling but there has been a dissociation of these two signs in many of our patients). The tremor shows surprising fluctuations in severity and is aggravated by walking and excitement, but its frequency remains constant (Hunker and Abbs).

A formal neurologic examination is required to determine whether objective muscle weakness is present. This is usually a straightforward exercise, although occasionally patients with fatigue have difficulty sustaining effort against resistance and sometimes report that generating full power requires substantial mental effort. On confrontational testing, they are able to generate full power for only a brief period before suddenly giving way to the examiner. This type of weakness is often referred to as breakaway weakness and may or may not be associated with pain.

Another test for hypotonia is to shake the affected limb and demonstrate that the flapping movements of the hand are of wider excursion than normal. If the patient places his elbows on the table with the arms flexed and the hands are allowed to hang limply, the hand of the hypotonic limb will sag.

Alternatively, the patient is asked to produce a maximal contraction and the examiner estimates power by the force needed to overcome or \u201cbreak\u201d it (isometric contraction or maximum voluntary isometric contraction).

Her vital signs include the following: temperature 99.8\u00b0F, blood pressure 132/64 mm Hg, pulse 78 bpm, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, she had left upper abdominal tenderness with evidence of hepatomegaly and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory data revealed the following: alanine aminotransferase, 527 IU/L (normal 10\u201335 IU/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 425 IU/L (normal < 35 IU/L); and bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL (normal 0.1\u20130.3 mg/dL).

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

An eight-year-old child is in a serious accident. She requires emergent transfusion, but her parents are not present. Conditions in which confidentiality must be overridden. Involuntary commitment or isolation for medical treatment may be undertaken for what reason? A 10-year-old child presents in status epilepticus, but her parents refuse treatment on religious grounds.

Accurate recording of negative data may be useful in relation to some future illness that requires examination. As indicated in Table 1-4, the patient\u2019s orientation, insight, judgment, and the integrity of language function are readily assessed in the course of taking the history. With respect to the cranial nerves, the size of the pupils and their reaction to light, ocular movements, visual and auditory acuity, and movements of the face, palate, and tongue should be tested. Observing the bare outstretched arms for atrophy, weakness (pronator drift), tremor, or abnormal movements; checking the strength of the extended and outstretched fingers; inquiring about sensory disturbances; and eliciting the biceps, brachioradialis, and triceps reflexes are usually sufficient for the upper limbs. Inspection of the legs while the feet, toes,"

The patient\u2019s temperature was normal. He explained that the episode had occurred following a birthday party at which he had participated in an ice cream\u2013eating contest. The patient reported prior episodes of a similar nature following ingestion of a significant amount of dairy products. This clinical picture is most probably due to a deficiency in the activity of: A. isomaltase. B. lactase. C. pancreatic \u03b1-amylase. D. salivary \u03b1-amylase. E. sucrase. Correct answer = B. The physical symptoms suggest a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for carbohydrate degradation. The symptoms observed following the ingestion of dairy products suggest that the patient is deficient in lactase as a result of the age-dependent reduction in expression of the enzyme."
