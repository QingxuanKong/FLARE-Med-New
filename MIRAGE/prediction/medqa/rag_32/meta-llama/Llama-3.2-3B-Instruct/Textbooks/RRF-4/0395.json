    "question": "A six-year-old boy with a history of asthma currently uses an albuterol inhaler as needed to manage his asthma symptoms. His mother brings him into your office because she feels she has had to increase the patient\u2019s use of his inhaler to four times per week for the past month. She also reports that he has woken up three times during the night from his symptoms this month. The boy reports that he is upset because he can\u2019t always keep up with his friends in the playground. His past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis. The patient\u2019s temperature is 98\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% O2 on room air. Auscultation of his lungs reveals bilateral late expiratory wheezes.\n\nWhat changes should be made to his current asthma treatment regimen?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a six-year-old boy with a history of asthma who has been using an albuterol inhaler as needed. His mother has noticed an increase in his inhaler use and nocturnal symptoms, which suggests that his asthma may be uncontrolled. The patient also reports difficulty keeping up with his friends, which could be related to his asthma symptoms. The current treatment regimen should be adjusted to better control his symptoms and prevent exacerbations. Options B, C, and D are not supported by current asthma guidelines. Fluticasone is an inhaled corticosteroid, but it is not recommended for children under 6 years old. Salmeterol is a long-acting beta2-agonist, but it is not recommended for children under 6 years old. Zileuton is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, but it is not commonly used in pediatric asthma treatment. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children with persistent asthma should use an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) as their first-line treatment. The patient should be considered for step-up therapy, which involves increasing the dose of his current ICS or adding a second ICS. However, the AAP also recommends that children under 6 years old can be started on a low-dose ICS, such as fluticasone, if their symptoms are not well-controlled on a low-dose albuterol. Therefore, option B, adding fluticasone daily, is the most appropriate choice. The patient's symptoms and history suggest that he may be a candidate for step-up therapy, and adding a second ICS would be a reasonable next step.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Status asthmaticus is an acute exacerbation of asthma that does not respond adequately to therapeutic measures and may require hospitalization. Exacerbations may progress over several days or occur suddenly and can range in severity from mild to life threatening. Significant respiratory distress, dyspnea, wheezing, cough, and a decrease in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) characterize deterioration in asthma control. During severe episodes of wheezing, pulse oximetry is helpful in monitoring oxygenation. In status asthmaticus, arterial blood gases may be necessary for measurement of ventilation. As airway obstruction worsens and chest compliance decreases, carbon dioxide retention can occur. In the face of tachypnea, a normal pCO2 (40 mm Hg) indicates impending respiratory arrest."

Her past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis and chronic lower back pain secondary to a work-related fall 2 years ago. Her current medications include Norco 5/325 (hydrocodone 5 mg/ acetaminophen 325 mg per tablet; two tablets four times daily for pain) and loratadine (10 mg daily). The patient also reported recent use of several over-the-counter (OTC) medications over the past 3 days to treat the new-onset flu symptoms, including Alka-Seltzer Plus Severe Cold + Flu (two tablets every 4 hours during the day) and Tylenol PM (two tablets at bedtime)."

            "content": "Brittle Asthma Some patients show chaotic variations in lung function despite taking appropriate therapy. Some show a persistent pattern of variability and may require oral corticosteroids or, at times, continuous infusion of \u03b22-agonists (type 1 brittle asthma), whereas others have generally normal or near-normal lung function but precipitous, unpredictable falls in lung function that may result in death (type 2 brittle asthma). These latter patients are difficult to manage because they do not respond well to corticosteroids, and the worsening of asthma does not reverse well with inhaled bronchodilators. The most effective therapy is subcutaneous epinephrine, which suggests that the worsening is likely to be a localized airway anaphylactic reaction with edema. In some of these patients, there may be allergy to specific foods. These patients should be taught to self-administer epinephrine and should carry a medical warning accordingly."

The number of people with asthma continues to grow. One in 11 children (7 million) had asthma, and 1 in 12 (18.7 million) adults (totaling over 25 million or 8% of U.S. population) had asthma in 2010 compared to 1 in 14 people (about 20 million, or 7%) in 2001. One in 5 children went to the emergency department for an asthma-related visit in 2009. Women are more likely than men to have asthma, and boys are more likely than girls to have asthma.

He is rushed to a nearby level 1 trauma center where he is found to have multiple facial fractures, a severe, unstable cervical spine injury, and significant left eye trauma. Further examination of his left eye reveals rupture of his globe. The ophthalmolo-gist requests emergency surgery to repair and save his eye. Because the patient has suffered a recent trauma, you decide to perform a rapid sequence intubation in preparation for the surgical procedure. What muscle relaxant would you use to facilitate tracheal intubation? What is the proper dose for your chosen muscle relaxant? After intravenous infusion of your chosen muscle relaxant, you are unable to adequately visualize the patient\u2019s larynx and vocal cords and cannot successfully pass an endotracheal tube. You switch to mask ventilation but are barely able to mask ventilate the patient, and you become worried"

Early intervention with inhaled corticosteroids reduces morbidity but does not alter the natural history of asthma. Regular use reduces airway hyperreactivity, the need for rescue bronchodilator therapy, risk of hospitalization, and risk of death from asthma. Inhaled corticosteroids are available as an inhalation aerosol, dry powder inhaler, and nebulizer solution."

All patients with asthma should be instructed in a simple action plan for severe, frightening attacks: to take up to four puffs of albuterol every 20 minutes over 1 hour. If no improvement is noted after the first four puffs, additional treatments should be taken while on the way to an emergency department or other higher level of care."

They are initiated by autophosphorylation of select tyrosine residues in their receptors. C. They are mediated by binding to adrenergic receptors, which are a class of nuclear receptors. D. They result in the activation of glycogen and triacylglycerol synthesis. Q3. NE bound to certain receptors causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. Why might NE be used clinically in the treatment of septic shock?

He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"
