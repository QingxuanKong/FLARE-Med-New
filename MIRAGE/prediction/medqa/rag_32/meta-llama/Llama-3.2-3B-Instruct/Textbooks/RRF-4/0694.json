His vital signs are as follows: T 39.1 C, HR 82, BP 122/76, RR 14, and SpO2 99%. Physical examination is significant for splenomegaly, tonsillar exudate, and posterior auricular lymphadenopathy.

The laboratory results show an elevated lymphocyte count, atypical lymphocytes on a peripheral blood smear, and a positive heterophile antibody screen. These findings are consistent with infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The management of infectious mononucleosis typically involves supportive care, rest, and hydration to manage symptoms. Antibiotics are not effective against EBV and may not be necessary. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, may be used to manage certain complications, but they are not typically used as a first-line treatment. Ganciclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, not EBV infections. Amoxicillin is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, not viral infections like EBV. Therefore, the best management option for this patient's condition is bed rest and activity limitation to manage symptoms and allow the body to recover.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The onset of streptococcal pharyngitis is often rapid and associated with prominent sore throat and moderate to high fever. Headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are frequent. In a typical, florid case, the pharynx is distinctly red. The tonsils are enlarged and covered with a yellow, blood-tinged exudate. There may be petechiae or doughnut-shapedlesions on the soft palate and posterior pharynx. The uvula may be red, stippled, and swollen. Anterior cervical lymph nodes are enlarged and tender to touch. Many children, however, present with only mild pharyngeal erythema without tonsillar exudate or cervical lymphadenitis. Conjunctivitis, cough, coryza, hoarseness, or ulcerations suggest a viral etiology. The diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis cannot be made on clinical features alone."

Infectious mononucleosis is characterized by lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes; thrombocytopenia and elevated hepatic enzymes are common. Cultures of infected skin lesions and tonsillar exudates should be obtained. Isolation of group A streptococci from the oropharynx suggests, but does not confirm, streptococcal cervical lymphadenitis. A blood culture should be obtained from children with systemic signs and symptoms of bacteremia. Serologic testing for EBV and for B. henselae should be obtained if there are appropriate findings. The most reliable test for diagnosis of acute EBV infection is the IgM antiviral capsid antigen (Fig. 99-1). Heterophil antibody is also diagnostic but is not reliably positive in children younger than 4 years with infectious mononucleosis."

The medical history should reveal the setting in which lymphadenopathy is occurring.

The patient\u2019s age, sex, occupation, exposure to pets, sexual behavior, and use of drugs such as diphenylhydantoin are other important historic points. For example, children and young adults usually have benign (i.e., nonmalignant) disorders that account for the observed lymphadenopathy such as viral or bacterial upper respiratory infections; infectious mononucleosis; toxoplasmosis; and, in some countries, tuberculosis. In contrast, after age 50, the incidence of malignant disorders increases and that of benign disorders decreases."

His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a"

            "content": "Lymphocytosis is present in 75% to 85% of infants and young children but is not diagnostic. The white blood cell count may increase from 20,000 cells/mm3 to more than 50,000 cells/mm3, consisting primarily of mature lymphocytes. Physical examination and radiographic signs of segmental lung atelectasis may develop during pertussis, especially during the paroxysmal stage. Perihilar infiltrates are common and are similar to those seen in viral pneumonia. For a young child with classic pertussis, the diagnosis based on the pattern of illness is quite accurate. The paroxysmal stage is the most distinctive part of the syndrome. Other causes of per-tussis-like prolonged cough illnesses include Bordetella parapertussis, which causes a similar but milder illness and is not prevented by B. pertussis vaccination, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, adenoviruses, and respiratory syncytial virus."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

EBV also is associated with numerous complicationsduring the acute illness. Neurologic complications includeseizures, aseptic meningitis syndrome, Bell palsy, transversemyelitis, encephalitis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Hematologic complications include Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia, antibody-mediated thrombocytopenia, hemophagocyticsyndrome, and, rarely, aplastic anemia. Corticosteroids havebeen used for respiratory compromise resulting from tonsillar hypertrophy, which responds rapidly, and for thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and neurologic complications.Splenic rupture is very rare. X-linked lymphoproliferative disease, which results from a mutation of the SH2D1A gene located in the Xq25 region, manifests as fulminant infectiousmononucleosis with primary EBV infection and progresses tomalignant lymphoproliferative disease or dysgammaglobulinemia."

The sensitivity of these rapid tests varies, however, and negative rapid tests should be confirmed by a throat culture. Throat culture is the diagnostic gold standard for establishing the presence of streptococcal pharyngitis. False-positive cultures can occur if other organisms are incorrectly identified as group A streptococcus. As many as 20% of positive cultures in children during winter months reflect streptococcal carriers and not acute pharyngitis. The predictive values of white blood cell count and differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein arenot sufficient to distinguish streptococcal from nonstreptococcal pharyngitis, and these tests are not routinely recommended.The white blood cell count in patients with infectious mononucleosis usually shows a predominance of atypical lymphocytes.
