She has a history of regular menses since menarche at the age of 12 and no history of serious illness.

Administering ulipristal acetate is a nonsteroidal progesterone receptor modulator that can be used for emergency contraception within 5 days of unprotected intercourse and can provide effective contraception for up to 5 years. Given the timeframe of 3 days, this option is a suitable choice.\\n\\nD. Administering depot medroxyprogesterone acetate is a long-acting reversible contraceptive injection that would provide effective contraception for 3 months but is not suitable for this patient's needs as she only wants contraception for six months.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate next step in management is to administer ulipristal acetate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The number of false-positive findings for allodynia can be limited if the patient touches the rim of the vaginal opening. Provoked vestibulodynia or other gynecologic findings should be treated. 8. Once the patient is able to use larger inserts, the following steps can be undertaken: a. Encourage the woman to allow her partner to assist her in placing the insert in her vagina. b. Encourage the couple during their sexual times to brie\ufb02y use the insert\u2014to prove to her that the insert will still go in when her body is physiologically aroused. c."

She became convinced that her roommate was listening in on her phone conversations and planning to alter her essays. She became reclusive and spent most of her time locked in her room. After much difficulty, her teachers convinced her to be seen by the student health service. It was believed she was beginning to show signs of schizophrenia and she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where she was started on antipsychotic medications. While in the hospital, she had a generalized seizure which prompted her transfer to our service. Her spinal fluid analysis showed 10 lymphocytes per mL3. She was found to have an anti-NMDA receptor antibody, which prompted an ultrasound examination of the pelvis. The left ovary was thought to show a benign cyst. Because of the neurological syndrome, the ovarian cyst was resected and revealed a microscopic ovarian teratoma. The neuropsychiatric syndrome resolved. She has since graduated and"

Physical examination should also assess for signs of anemia, bruising or petechia, signs of hyperandrogenism or thyroid disease. A complete blood count, pregnancy test, thyroid function tests, and coagulation screen should be performed. In sexually active adolescents, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) should be ruled out."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously.

She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy.

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"
