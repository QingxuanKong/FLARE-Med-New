    "question": "A 25-year-old primigravida is admitted to the hospital at 36 weeks gestation after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. She is conscious, but lethargic and complains of a headache that started 2 hours prior to the seizure. She denies alcohol intake or drug use. She has no history of convulsive disorders and the antepartum course has been unremarkable. She was compliant with the recommended prenatal care and her last prenatal visit was 2 weeks ago. She has gained 2 kg (4.4 lb) since her last visit. The blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg, the heart rate was 79/min, the respiratory rate was 14/min, and the temperature was 37.0\u2103 (98.6\u2109). The physical examination shows leg and perineal edema. The neurologic examination is significant for symmetric upper and lower extremity hyperreflexia and ankle clonus. Which of the following laboratory findings would be most common in this patient?",

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of eclampsia, a severe complication of preeclampsia. Eclampsia is characterized by new-onset seizures in a pregnant woman with hypertension and proteinuria. The patient's symptoms of headache, leg and perineal edema, symmetric upper and lower extremity hyperreflexia, and ankle clonus are consistent with eclampsia. The patient's blood pressure is 160/90 mmHg, which is consistent with severe hypertension. The patient's pregnancy and eclampsia diagnosis suggest that the patient is at risk for complications such as placental abruption, fetal growth restriction, and maternal cardiovascular complications. The patient's laboratory findings should include proteinuria, which is a hallmark of preeclampsia. Proteinuria is not listed as an option, but the closest related finding would be elevated protein levels in the urine, which could be detected by a protein-to-creatinine ratio or dipstick test. However, the closest option is not listed, but we can deduce that the correct answer would be related to the complications of eclampsia and preeclampsia. Therefore, we can infer that the correct answer is related to the complications of preeclampsia and eclampsia.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"D\"} Note: The correct answer is not explicitly stated in the options, but based on the step-by-step thinking, the closest related finding would be elevated protein levels in the urine, which is not listed as an option.

The standard practice is to induce labor or perform a cesarean section and manage the seizures as one would manage those of hypertensive encephalopathy (of which this is one type). The administration of magnesium sulfate continues to be the favored treatment by obstetricians for the prevention of eclamptic seizures; two randomized trials have reestablished its value in preventing seizures in preeclamptic women (Lucas et al) and in avoiding a second convulsion once one had occurred (Eclampsia Trial Collaborative Group). Magnesium sulfate, 10 g IM, followed by 5 g every 4 h, proved comparable to standard doses of phenytoin as prophylaxis for seizures. Our colleagues use a regimen of 4 g IV more than 5 to 10 min followed by a maintenance dose of 5 g every 4 h IM or 1 to 2 g/h IV. In nontoxic"

She has a history of heroin use and is currently receiving methadone. Physical examination reveals normal vital signs and no abnormalities. White blood cell count is 5800 cells/mm3 with a normal differential, hemoglobin is 11.8 g/dL, all liver tests are within normal limits, CD4 cell count is 278 cells/mm3, and viral load (HIV RNA) is 110,000 copies/mL. What other laboratory tests should be ordered? Which antiretroviral medica-tions would you begin?"

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg.

Exposure of the fetus late in gestation poses few teratogenic risks. If a woman discovers she is pregnant while on an antiepileptic drug, changing medications is unlikely to reduce the chances of birth defects, even for valproate, but this drug retains the risk of lower IQ in the child. The special case of eclamptic seizures is managed by infusion of magnesium as noted below."

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."
