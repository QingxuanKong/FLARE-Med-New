    "question": "Two hours following an elective cholecystectomy, a 43-year-old woman has fever and chills. The patient received cephalexin for antibiotic prophylaxis and one unit of packed red blood cells during the procedure. She underwent a hysterectomy 9 years ago for leiomyomata uteri. She has a 5-year history of hypertension treated with lisinopril. Her temperature is 39.5\u00b0C (102.3\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 125/90 mm Hg. Examination shows a mildly tender abdominal wound without erythema. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. She had a Foley catheter and peripheral line access placed at the time of the procedure. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and answer in JSON format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and history. The patient is a 43-year-old woman who has fever and chills 2 hours following an elective cholecystectomy. She received cephalexin for antibiotic prophylaxis and one unit of packed red blood cells during the procedure. She has a history of hypertension treated with lisinopril. The patient's temperature is 39.5\u00b0C (102.3\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 125/90 mm Hg. Examination shows a mildly tender abdominal wound without erythema. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. She had a Foley catheter and peripheral line access placed at the time of the procedure. The patient's symptoms of fever and chills following surgery are suggestive of an infection. Given that the patient received cephalexin for antibiotic prophylaxis, it's likely that the infection is related to the surgery. The patient's history of hypertension and the use of lisinopril may be relevant, but it's not directly related to the patient's current symptoms. Considering the options, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is a urinary tract infection (C). The patient had a Foley catheter and peripheral line access, which increases the risk of urinary tract infections. The patient's symptoms of fever and chills, along with the presence of a urinary catheter, make urinary tract infection a more likely cause than the other options. The other options are less likely: A. Adverse effect of medication: While it's possible that the patient may have an adverse effect of medication, the symptoms of fever and chills are more suggestive of an infection rather than an adverse effect. B. Malignant hyperthermia: Malignant hyperthermia is a rare but life-threatening complication of general anesthesia. The patient's symptoms do not suggest malignant hyperthermia. D. Transfusion reaction: The patient did receive a unit of packed red blood cells during the procedure, but the symptoms of fever and chills are not typical of a transfusion reaction. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" } ``` The final answer is C. Urinary tract infection.",

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

These complaints are new since she used to always feel \u201chot,\u201d noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to \u201cprotect her bones\u201d and omeprazole for \u201cheartburn.\u201d On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm. Her weight is 136 lb (61.8 kg), an increase of 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the last year. Her thyroid gland is not palpable and her reflexes are delayed.

            "content": "the open (Hasson) approach should be 6used in favor of direct puncture laparoscopy. The patient should be positioned slightly on the left side to avoid compression of the vena cava by the uterus. Because pregnancy poses a risk for thromboembolism, sequential compression devices are essential for all procedures. Fetal acidosis induced by maternal hypercar-bia also has been raised as a concern. The arterial pH of the fetus follows the pH of the mother linearly; and therefore, fetal acido-sis may be prevented by avoiding a respiratory acidosis in the mother.93 The pneumoperitoneum pressure induced by laparos-copy is not a safety issue either as it has been proved that mid-pregnancy uterine contractions provide a much greater pressure in utero than a pneumoperitoneum of 15 mmHg. More than 100 cases of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in pregnancy have been reported with uniformly good results.94 The operation should be performed during the second trimester of pregnancy if possible."

Focused History: Ten days ago, CR had her spleen removed following a bicycle accident in which she fractured her tibial eminence, necessitating immobilization of the right knee. She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

In more than half of patients with acute cholecystitis, a history of prior right upper quadrant pain from cholelithiasis is elicited. With acute disease, pain is accompanied by anorexia, nausea and vomiting, low-grade fever, and mild leukocytosis. As shown in Figure 55-3, sonography can help visualize stones, and both false-positive and false-negative rates range from 2 to 4 percent (Greenberger, 2015). In acute cases, medical therapy consists of IV luids, antimicrobials, analgesics, and in some instances, nasogastric suction, before surgical therapy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the preferred treatment for most patients."

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."
