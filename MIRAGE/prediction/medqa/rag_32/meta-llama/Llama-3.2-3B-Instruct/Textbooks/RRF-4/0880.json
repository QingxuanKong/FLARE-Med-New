    "question": "A 21-year-old woman presents with sudden onset of high blood pressure. She is concerned about her health especially after her colleagues noticed that her face gets red at times while at work. She has even started to use blankets to cover her feet, even on the warmest days in the summer, even though her hands feel warm to the touch. She is a student who exercises and eats a well-balanced diet every day. There is no family history of hypertension or other metabolic syndromes. On examination, her blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg, respirations are 19/min, pulse is 64/min, and temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F). An echocardiogram is ordered for investigation.

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the condition the patient is likely affected by, let's analyze the symptoms and examination findings. The patient presents with sudden onset of high blood pressure (145/92 mm Hg), flushing (face gets red at times), and cold intolerance (uses blankets to cover her feet even on warm days). These symptoms are suggestive of a condition that affects blood vessel regulation. The patient is a young, otherwise healthy individual with no family history of hypertension or metabolic syndromes. The lack of family history and the absence of other symptoms such as weight gain, headache, or visual disturbances make some conditions like primary aldosteronism (Document [30]) or pheochromocytoma (Document [29]) less likely. The patient's symptoms of flushing and cold intolerance are also seen in Takayasu's arteritis (Document [D]), a large vessel vasculitis that affects the aorta and its major branches. This condition can cause hypertension due to the narrowing or occlusion of blood vessels, leading to reduced blood flow to the skin, resulting in flushing. The patient's echocardiogram is ordered for investigation, which may show abnormalities consistent with Takayasu's arteritis, such as stenosis or occlusion of the aorta or its branches. The other options are less likely: A. Fibromuscular dysplasia (Document [A]) is a non-inflammatory vascular disease that affects medium-sized arteries, typically in young women, leading to hypertension. While it can cause hypertension, the patient's symptoms of flushing and cold intolerance are not characteristic. B. Marfan syndrome (Document [B]) is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue, leading to tall stature, long limbs, and aortic root dilatation, which can cause aortic aneurysm or dissection. The patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest Marfan syndrome. C. Turner syndrome (Document [C]) is a genetic disorder that affects females, causing short stature, infertility, and heart defects. The patient's presentation does not match Turner syndrome. D. Takayasu's arteritis (Document [D]) is the most likely diagnosis, given the patient's symptoms of hypertension, flushing, and cold intolerance, along with the potential findings on the echocardiogram. The answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

The affected arteries no longer pulsate, hence the descriptive term pulseless disease. When renal arteries are involved, hypertension results, and there may be coronary occlusion, which may be fatal. Involvement of the pulmonary artery may lead to pulmonary hypertension. Coolness of the hands and weak radial pulses are common indicators of the disease and headaches are frequent.

            "content": "Case 2: Skin Rash Patient Presentation: KL is a 34-year-old woman who presents with a red, nonitchy rash on her left thigh and flu-like symptoms. Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative."

Therefore, they should be carried out only if the results can be expected to modify the patient\u2019s management. The prevention of heart disease, especially of CAD, is one of the most important tasks of primary care health givers as well as cardiologists. Prevention begins with risk assessment, followed by attention to lifestyle, such as achieving optimal weight, physical activity, and smoking cessation, and then aggressive treatment of all abnormal risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (Chap. 417). After a complete diagnosis has been established in patients with known heart disease, a number of management options are usually available. Several examples may be used to demonstrate some of the 1441 principles of cardiovascular therapeutics: 1."

These begin to rise in patient B, who by term has substantively higher blood pressures. However, her pressures are still < 140/90 mm Hg, and thus she is considered to be \"normotensive.\" We use the term delta hypertension to describe this rather acute rise in blood pressure. Some of these women will go on to have obvious preeclampsia, and some even develop eclamptic seizures or HELLP (hemolysis, devatedliver enzyme levels, low 2latelet count) syndrome while still normotensive."

Although this pulse-temperature dissociation is not highly sensitive or specific for establishing a diagnosis, it is potentially useful in low-resource settings given its ready availability and simplicity."

Hypertension is usually mild to moderate but occasionally may be severe; primary aldosteronism should be considered in all patients with refractory hypertension. Hypertension in these patients may be associated with glucose intolerance. Most patients are asymptomatic; however, infrequently, polyuria, polydipsia, paresthesias, or muscle weakness may be present as a consequence of hypokalemic alkalosis. Although aldosterone is a salt-retaining hormone, patients with primary aldosteronism rarely have edema. Renal dysfunction and cardiovascular disease are strikingly increased in patients with primary aldosteronism compared to those with primary hypertension."

OH is defined as a sustained drop in systolic (\u226520 mmHg) or diastolic (\u226510 mmHg) BP after 2\u20133 min of standing. In nonneurogenic causes of OH (such as hypovolemia), the BP drop is accompanied by a compensatory increase in heart rate of >15 beats/min. A clue that the patient has neurogenic OH is the aggravation or precipitation of OH by autonomic stressors (a meal, hot bath, or exercise). Neurologic examination should include mental status (neurodegenerative disorders), cranial nerves (impaired downgaze with progressive supranuclear palsy; abnormal pupils with Horner\u2019s or Adie\u2019s syndrome), motor tone (Parkinson\u2019s disease and parkinsonism), and sensation (polyneuropathies). In patients without a clear diagnosis initially, follow-up evaluations every few months or whenever symptoms worsen may reveal the underlying cause."
