The parents report that 2 weeks ago, his daycare group visited an animal shelter, after which he developed a rash on the left hand. His temperature is 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F). Physical examination shows three linear crusts on an erythematous background on the dorsum of the left hand. There is tender left-sided axillary and cervical lymphadenopathy. Histopathologic examination of an axillary lymph node shows necrotizing granulomas.

The presence of linear crusts on an erythematous background on the dorsum of the left hand and necrotizing granulomas in the axillary lymph node suggest a zoonotic infection. The most common zoonotic infection that causes lymphadenopathy and necrotizing granulomas is cat-scratch disease, which is caused by Bartonella henselae. Bartonella henselae is also involved in the pathogenesis of bacillary angiomatosis. Bacillary angiomatosis is a condition characterized by the growth of abnormal blood vessels in various organs, including the skin, liver, and spleen, and is typically seen in immunocompromised individuals.

Lymphadenitis manifests as a tense, tender swelling (bubo) that, when palpated, has a boggy consistency with an underlying hard core. Generally, there is one painful and erythematous bubo with surrounding periganglionic edema. The bubo is most commonly inguinal but can also be crural, axillary (Fig. 196-2), cervical, or submaxillary, depending on the site of the bite. Abdominal pain from intraabdominal node involvement can occur without other visible signs. Children are most likely to present with cervical or axillary buboes."

The papule may begin as an erythematous lesion that is tender or pruritic; it evolves over several days into an ulcer with sharply demarcated edges and a yellow exudate. The ulcer gradually develops a black base, and simultaneously the regional lymph nodes become tender and severely enlarged (Fig. 195-1). The affected lymph nodes may become fluctuant and drain spontaneously, but the condition usually resolves with effective treatment. Late suppuration of lymph nodes has been described in up to 25% of patients with ulceroglandular/glandular tularemia. Examination of material taken from these late fluctuant nodes after successful antimicrobial treatment reveals sterile necrotic tissue.

She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days.

The patient\u2019s age, sex, occupation, exposure to pets, sexual behavior, and use of drugs such as diphenylhydantoin are other important historic points.

In contrast, after age 50, the incidence of malignant disorders increases and that of benign disorders decreases."

            "content": "Lymphadenitis is acute or chronic inflammation of lymph nodes. Acute lymphadenitis usually results when bacteria and toxins from a site of acute inflammation are carried via lymph to regional nodes. Numerous infections cause lymphadenopathy and lymphadenitis (Tables 99-1 and 99-2). Causes of inguinal regional lymphadenopathy also include sexually transmitted infections (see Chapter 116). Regional lymphadenitis associated with a characteristic skin lesion at the site of inoculation defines various lymphocutaneous syndromes. Lymphangitis is an inflammation of subcutaneous lymphatic channels that presents as an acute bacterial infection, usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococci."

            "content": "The patient is usually referred to the pedi-atric surgeon for evaluation after the mass has been present for several weeks. A detailed history and physical examination often helps determine the likely etiology of the lymph node and the need for excisional biopsy. Enlarged tender lymph nodes are usually the result of a bacterial infection (Staphy-lococcus or Streptococcus). Treatment of the primary cause (e.g., otitis media or pharyngitis) with antibiotics often is all that is necessary. However, when the involved nodes become fluctuant, incision and drainage are indicated. In many North American institutions, there has been an increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection of the skin and soft tissues, leading to increased staphylococcal lymphadenitis in children. More chronic forms of lymphadeni-tis, including infections with atypical mycobacteria, as well as cat-scratch fever, are diagnosed based on serologic findings or excisional biopsy. The"

Important findings include presence or absence of dental disease, oropharyngeal or skin lesions, ocular disease, other nodal enlargement, and any other signs of systemic illness, including hepatosplenomegaly and skin lesions. Acute cervical lymphadenopathy associated with pharyngitis is characterized by small and rubbery lymph nodes in the anterior cervical chain with minimal to moderate tenderness. Suppurative cervical lymphadenitis, frequently caused by S. aureus or group A streptococcus, shows erythema and warmth of the overlying skin with moderate to exquisite tenderness."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

Graham, Centre for International Child Health, University of Melbourne, Australia; with permission.) 1110 postprimary disease. Depending on the extent of reactivity, the effusion may be small, remain unnoticed, and resolve spontaneously or may be sufficiently large to cause symptoms such as fever, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea. Physical findings are those of pleural effusion: dullness to percussion and absence of breath sounds. A chest radiograph reveals the effusion and, in up to one-third of cases, also shows a parenchymal lesion. Thoracentesis is required to ascertain the nature of the effusion and to differentiate it from manifestations of other etiologies. The fluid is straw colored and at times hemorrhagic; it is an exudate with a protein concentration >50% of that in serum (usually ~4\u20136 g/dL), a normal to low glucose concentration, a pH of ~7.3"
