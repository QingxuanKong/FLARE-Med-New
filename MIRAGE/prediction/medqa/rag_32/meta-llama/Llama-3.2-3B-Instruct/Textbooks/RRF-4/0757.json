    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, here's my step-by-step thinking and the answer: **Step 1: Analyze the patient's symptoms** The patient presents with lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, occasional episodes of vomiting, myalgia (muscle pain), and a generalized rash. She also reports feeling lethargic. These symptoms suggest a systemic illness. **Step 2: Consider the rash** The patient has a widespread erythematous rash on the trunk and extremities with skin peeling on the palms and soles. This type of rash is characteristic of several conditions, including viral exanthems, bacterial infections, and some types of vasculitis. **Step 3: Review laboratory results** The patient's laboratory results show an elevated leukocyte count (19,300/mm3), which indicates an inflammatory response. The liver enzymes (AST and ALT) are also elevated, which suggests liver damage. The urinalysis shows no abnormalities, which makes a urinary tract infection less likely. **Step 4: Consider the patient's history** The patient has no short history of serious illness, no family history of serious illness, and no recent travel or exposure to certain pathogens (e.g., meningococcal disease). However, she is 18 years old, and some conditions are more common in this age group. **Step 5: Analyze the options** Now, let's analyze the options: A. **Recent hiking trip**: While hiking can increase the risk of certain infections (e.g., tick-borne illnesses), the patient's symptoms and laboratory results don't strongly suggest a tick-borne illness. B. **Intravenous heroin abuse**: Heroin use can lead to various health issues, including infections and liver damage, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results don't specifically suggest heroin use. C. **Exposure to a patient with meningococcal disease**: Meningococcal disease can cause a rash and systemic illness, but the patient's rash is not typically described as petechial (small, pinpoint spots). D. **Currently menstruating**: Menstruation is not typically associated with the symptoms and laboratory results presented. **Step 6: Make an educated guess** Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and the analysis of the options, the most likely explanation is a viral infection, possibly a viral exanthem. However, the patient's rash and systemic symptoms, particularly the elevated liver enzymes, suggest a more severe condition. Considering the options, **C. Exposure to a patient with meningococcal disease** is the most plausible explanation, as meningococcal disease can cause a rash and systemic illness, and the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with this diagnosis. **Answer:** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a severe infection, and exposure to a patient with meningococcal disease is the most plausible explanation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Physical examina-tion reveals a pale woman with diminished vibration sen-sation, diminished spinal reflexes, and extensor plantar reflexes (Babinski sign). Examination of her oral cavity reveals atrophic glossitis, in which the tongue appears deep red in color and abnormally smooth and shiny due to atro-phy of the lingual papillae. Laboratory testing reveals a mac-rocytic anemia based on a hematocrit of 30% (normal for women, 37\u201348%), a hemoglobin concentration of 9.4 g/dL, an erythrocyte mean cell volume (MCV) of 123 fL (nor-mal, 84\u201399 fL), an erythrocyte mean cell hemoglobin con-centration (MCHC) of 34% (normal, 31\u201336%), and a low reticulocyte count.

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

The febrile stage lasts 3 or 4 days and is identified by the abrupt onset of fever, headache, severe myalgia, thirst, anorexia, and often nausea and vomiting. Photophobia, retroorbital pain, and pain on ocular movement are common, and the vision may become blurred with ciliary body inflammation. Flushing over the face, the V area of the neck, and the back is characteristic, as are pharyngeal injection, periorbital edema, and conjunctival suffusion. Petechiae often develop in areas of pressure, the conjunctivae, and the axillae. Back pain and tenderness to percussion at the costovertebral angle reflect massive retroperitoneal edema. Laboratory evidence of mild to moderate DIC is present. Other laboratory findings of HFRS include proteinuria and active urinary sediment. The hypotensive stage lasts from a few hours to 48 h and begins with falling blood pressure and sometimes shock. The relative bradycardia typical of the febrile"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, neurologic, or pulmonary disease help focus the differential diagnosis, as do findings relevant to the jugular venous pressure and waveforms, the arterial pulses, other heart sounds, the lungs, the abdomen, the skin, and the extremities. In many instances, laboratory studies, an ECG, and/or a chest x-ray may have been obtained earlier and may contain valuable information. A patient with suspected infective endocarditis, for example, may have a murmur in the setting of fever, chills, anorexia, fatigue, dyspnea, splenomegaly, petechiae, and positive blood cultures. A new systolic murmur in a patient with a marked fall in blood pressure after a recent MI suggests myocardial rupture.
