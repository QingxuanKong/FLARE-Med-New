    "question": "A 20-year-old woman in the army recruit collapses during an especially hot day at basic training. She was in her normal excellent state of health prior to this event. Two weeks ago, she had an upper respiratory infection (URI) but has since recovered. Her father has chronic kidney disease (CKD), bilateral hearing loss, and vision problems. At the hospital, her temperature is 40.3\u00b0C (104.5\u00b0F), blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical exam, the patient appears to have altered mental status and her skin is dry, hot, and erythematous. She is complaining of severe bilateral flank pain and generalized myalgia. Catheterization produces 200 mL of tea-colored urine. Urine dipstick is positive for blood, but urinalysis is negative for RBCs or WBCs. Which of the following is most likely responsible for her condition?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. The patient is a 20-year-old woman in the army who collapsed during an exercise in the hot sun, and she has a history of a recent upper respiratory infection. She has a fever, low blood pressure, high pulse rate, and altered mental status. The physical exam shows dry, hot, and erythematous skin, severe bilateral flank pain, and generalized myalgia. The catheterization produces tea-colored urine with a positive dipstick for blood but no RBCs or WBCs on urinalysis. These symptoms and lab results suggest a renal issue, possibly a kidney injury or a urinary tract infection. However, the tea-colored urine is a key clue. Tea-colored urine is often associated with myoglobinuria, which can occur in rhabdomyolysis, a condition where muscle tissue breaks down and releases myoglobin into the urine. Given the patient's symptoms of severe muscle pain and myalgia, rhabdomyolysis is a possible cause. The patient's family history of chronic kidney disease, bilateral hearing loss, and vision problems also suggests a possible genetic component to her condition. The COL4A5 gene mutation is associated with Alport syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the type IV collagen in the kidneys, ears, and eyes, leading to kidney disease, hearing loss, and vision problems. This, combined with the patient's symptoms and tea-colored urine, makes A a likely cause. \", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Focused History: Ten days ago, CR had her spleen removed following a bicycle accident in which she fractured her tibial eminence, necessitating immobilization of the right knee. She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"
