Therefore, malignant potential should not be used as an argument for surgical resection, and the majority of these lesions can be safely observed in the absence of symptoms due to mass effect or rapid growth. The average rate of growth is about 0.5 cm per year. About 50% of cystadenomas are asymptomatic and detected as an incidental finding. Most symptomatic patients have mild upper abdominal pain, epigastric fullness, or moderate weight loss. Occasionally, cystadenomas can grow to a size capable of producing jaundice or GI obstruction due to mass effect (Fig. 33-77). For symptomatic patients with serous cystadenoma, surgical resection is indicated. For lesions in the tail, splenectomy is not necessary, given the benign nature of the tumor. In appropriate candidates, a laparoscopic approach to distal pancreatectomy with or without splenic preservation can be considered. These cysts are frequently found in older women in which pancreatic resection for"

Generally, the management that optimizes maternal physiology is also best for the fetus. However, the dilemma occasionally arises that what is best for the mother may be harmful to the fetus, and what is best for the fetus may compromise the ultimate prognosis for the mother. The best way to approach management of a pregnant woman with cancer is to ask, \u201cWhat would we do for this woman in this clinical situation if she was not pregnant? Now, which, if any, of those plans need to be modified because she is pregnant?\u201d"

Despite the fact that many tumor markers such as CA19-9 have been studied, there are still no effective screening tests for pancreatic cancer."

Occasionally, it is perceived in the lower midabdomen but is frequently described as penetrating through to the back (Fig. 33-31). The pain is typically steady and boring, but not colicky. It persists for hours or days and may be chronic with exacerbations caused by eating or drink-ing alcohol. Chronic alcoholics also describe a steady, constant pain that is temporarily relieved by alcohol, followed by a more severe recurrence hours later.Patients with chronic pancreatic pain typically flex their abdomen and either sit or lie with their hips flexed, or lie on their side in a fetal position.
