More sensitive methods of detection, such as CT, thyroid ultrasound, and pathologic studies, reveal thyroid nodules in up to 50% of glands in individuals over the age of 50.

After injection of radioactive iodine, most adenomas take up iodine less avidly than normal thyroid parenchyma. On radionuclide scanning, therefore, adenomas appear as cold nodules relative to the adjacent normal thyroid gland. Toxic adenomas, however, appear as warm or hot nodules in the scan. As many as 10% of cold nodules eventually prove to be malignant. By contrast, malignancy is uncommon in hot nodules. Essential techniques used in the preoperative evaluation of suspected adenomas are ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Because of the need for evaluating capsular integrity, the definitive diagnosis of thyroid adenoma can be made only after careful microscopic examination of the resected specimen."

            "content": "Thyroid Ultrasound Ultrasonography is valuable for the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with nodular thyroid disease (Table 405-4). Evidence-based guidelines recommend thyroid ultrasonography for all patients suspected of having thyroid nodules by either physical examination or another imaging study. Using 10to 12-MHz linear transducers, resolution and image quality are excellent, allowing the characterization of nodules and cysts >3 mm. Certain sonographic patterns are highly suggestive of malignancy (e.g., hypoechoic solid nodules with infiltrative borders and microcalcifications), whereas other features correlate with benignity (e.g., spongiform nodules defined as those with multiple small internal cystic areas) (Fig. 405-5). In addition to evaluating thyroid nodules, ultrasound is useful for monitoring nodule size and for the aspiration of nodules or cystic lesions. Ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy of thyroid lesions lowers the rate of inadequate sampling and decreases sample"

FNAB is recommended in patients who have a dominant nodule or one that is painful or enlarging, as carcinomas have been reported in 5% to 10% of multinodular goiters. CT scans are helpful to evaluate the extent of retrosternal extension and airway compression (Fig. 38-13B).Treatment Most euthyroid patients with small, diffuse goi-ters do not require treatment. Some physicians give patients with large goiters exogenous thyroid hormone to reduce the TSH stimulation of gland growth; this treatment may result in decrease and/or stabilization of goiter size and is most effective for small diffuse goiters. Endemic goiters are treated by iodine administration. Surgical resection is reserved for goiters that (a) continue to increase despite T4 suppression, (b) cause obstruc-tive symptoms, (c) have substernal extension (considered a rela-tive indication by some groups), (d) have malignancy suspected or proven by FNAB, and (e) are cosmetically"
