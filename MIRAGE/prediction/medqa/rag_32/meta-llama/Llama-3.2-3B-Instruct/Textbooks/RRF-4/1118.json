This presentation is highly suggestive of gout, a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness, and tenderness, most often in the big toe. The patient's history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease may be relevant, as these conditions can increase the risk of developing gout. The deposition of monosodium urate crystals is a hallmark of gout, and this patient's symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis. The correct answer is therefore C.

Diabetes can lead to vascular disease of large and medium arteries, narrowing the lumen and reducing blood supply to the extremities, thereby impairing healing. In addition, diabetes can also affect blood supply to nerves, which leads to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy results in reduced sensation, and therefore minor injuries can often go unnoticed. This patient has developed an ulcer on his heel, which is a pressure point and likely to be under repeated strain. The nurse examined the ulcer and found that the ulcer was looking infected with pus at the base of the ulcer and asked for a specialist orthopedic opinion, who requested an x-ray and an MRI. The MRI and x-ray both demonstrated infection invading into the calcaneus with destruction of the bone (Fig. 6.141A,B)."

Symptoms of pain, a catching sensation, or stiffness may initially be mild and intermittent and may be present for years before the patient seeks medical attention.

Another common cause of damage to articular carti-lages is the deposition of crystals of uric acid in the joints, particularly those of the toes and fingers. This condition is known as gouty arthritis or, more simply, gout. Gout has become more common because of the widespread use of thiazide diuretics in the treatment of hypertension. In genet-ically predisposed individuals, gout is the most common side effect of these drugs. Gout causes severe, unbear-able pain because of the sharp crystals in the joint. The irritation also causes the formation of calcareous deposits that deform the joint and limit its motion."

Insulin E. pH Case 10: Calf Pain Patient Presentation: CR is a 19-year-old female who is being evaluated for pain and swelling in her right calf. Focused History: Ten days ago, CR had her spleen removed following a bicycle accident in which she fractured her tibial eminence, necessitating immobilization of the right knee. She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."

Recurrent oral ulceration plus two of the following: Superficial or deep peripheral vein thrombosis is seen in 30% of patients. Pulmonary emboli are a rare complication. The superior vena cava is obstructed occasionally, producing a dramatic clinical picture. Arterial involvement occurs in less than 5% of patients and presents with aortitis or peripheral arterial aneurysm and arterial thrombosis. Pulmonary artery vasculitis presenting with dyspnea, cough,chestpain,hemoptysis,andinfiltratesonchestroentgenograms has been reported in 5% of patients and should be differentiated from thromboembolic disease since it warrants anti-inflammatory and not thrombolytic therapy."

Pigmentation of heart valves, larynx, tympanic membranes, and skin occurs, and occasional patients develop pigmented renal or prostatic calculi. Pigment deposition in the heart and blood vessels leads to aortic stenosis necessitating valve replacement, especially after 60 years of age. The diagnosis should be suspected in a patient whose urine darkens to blackness. Homogentisic acid in urine is identified by urine organic acid analysis. Ochronotic arthritis is treated symptomatically with pain medications, spinal surgery, and arthroplasty (Chap. 394). Ascorbic acid and protein restriction are not effective in reducing homogentisic acid production. By contrast, nitisone (2-[2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl]-1,3-cyclohexanedione), a drug used in tyrosinemia type I, reduces urinary excretion of homogentisic acid and, in conjunction with a low-protein diet,"

Diminished skinfold thickness reflects the loss of fat reserves; reduced arm muscle circumference with temporal and interosseous muscle wasting reflects the catabolism of protein throughout the body, including in vital organs such as the heart, liver, and kidneys. Routine laboratory findings in cachexia/marasmus are relatively unremarkable. The creatinine-height index (24-h urinary creatinine excretion compared with normal values based on height) is low, reflecting the loss of muscle mass. Occasionally, the serum albumin level is reduced, but it remains above 2.8 g/dL when systemic inflammation is absent. Despite a morbid appearance, immunocompetence, wound healing, and the ability to handle short-term stress are reasonably well preserved in most patients."

Enzymatic analysis revealed a deficiency of \u03b1galactosidase, and enzyme replacement therapy was recommended. The most likely diagnosis is: A. Fabry disease. B. Farber disease. C. Gaucher disease. D. Krabbe disease. E. Niemann-Pick disease. Correct answer = A. Fabry disease, a deficiency of \u03b1-galactosidase, is the only X-linked sphingolipidosis. It is characterized by pain in the extremities, a red-purple skin rash (generalized angiokeratomas), and kidney and cardiac complications. Protein in his urine indicates kidney damage. Enzyme replacement therapy is available. 7.4. Current medical advice for individuals experiencing chest pain is to call emergency medical services and chew a regular strength, noncoated aspirin. What is the basis for recommending aspirin?"
