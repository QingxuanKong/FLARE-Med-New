    "question": "A 1-month-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her parents. They are concerned that she becomes lethargic and irritated between meals. They found that feeding her often with small servings helps. She was born at 39 weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is meeting all developmental milestones. Her mother has one brother that occasionally requires blood transfusions. Today, her blood pressure is 55/33 mm Hg, his heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 40/min, and temperature of 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical exam, the infant is irritated. She is slightly jaundiced. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her blood work shows normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin. Sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies are also ruled out. A Coombs test is negative. Red blood cell osmotic fragility gap is normal. The physician determined that these findings are related to an enzyme deficiency. Which of the following allosterically inhibits this enzyme?",

        "A": "Alanine",
        "B": "Adenosine monophosphate",

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to identify the enzyme deficiency that is causing the anemia in the 1-month-old girl. The key findings in this case are normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count, decreased haptoglobin, and a Coombs test that is negative. The red blood cell osmotic fragility gap is normal, ruling out conditions like hereditary spherocytosis. The physician also determined that these findings are related to an enzyme deficiency. Given these clues, we can consider several enzyme deficiencies that can cause hemolytic anemia. One possibility is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which is an X-linked disorder that can cause hemolytic anemia due to oxidative stress. However, the question mentions that sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies are ruled out. Another possibility is pyruvate kinase deficiency, which is an autosomal recessive disorder that can cause hemolytic anemia due to impaired glycolysis. The key clue here is the mention of a 'fructose 2,6-bisphosphate' in the potential choices. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is a potent allosteric inhibitor of phosphofructokinase-1, an enzyme involved in glycolysis. Pyruvate kinase deficiency is an enzyme deficiency that affects glycolysis and can cause hemolytic anemia. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is an allosteric inhibitor of phosphofructokinase-1, which is an enzyme involved in the same pathway as pyruvate kinase. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

            "content": "Available @ StudentConsult.com Isoimmune hemolysis is caused by active maternal immunization against fetal antigens that the mother\u2019s erythrocytes do not express (see Chapter 62). Examples are antibodies to the A, B, and Rh D antigens; other Rh antigens; and the Kell, Duffy, and other blood groups. Anti-A and anti-B hemolysis is caused by the placental transfer of naturally occurring maternal antibodies from mothers who lack A or B antigen (usually blood type O). Positive results of the direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test on the infant\u2019s RBCs (Fig. 150-4), the indirect antiglobulin test on the mother\u2019s serum, and the presence of spherocytes and immature erythroid precursors (erythroblastosis) on the infant\u2019s blood smear confirm this diagnosis. Isoimmune hemolytic disease varies in clinical severity. There may be no clinical manifestations, or the infant may exhibit jaundice, severe anemia, and hydrops fetalis."

            "content": "Coombs tests use anti-immunoglobulin antibodies to detect the antibodies that cause hemolytic disease of the newborn, or erythroblastosis fetalis. Anti-immunoglobulin antibodies were first developed by Robin Coombs, and the test for this disease is still called the Coombs test. Hemolytic disease of the newborn occurs when a mother makes IgG antibodies specific for the rhesus or Rh bloodgroup antigen expressed on the red blood cells of her fetus. Rh-negative mothers make these antibodies when they are exposed at delivery to Rh-positive fetal red blood cells bearing the paternally inherited Rh antigen. During subsequent pregnancies, these antibodies are transported across the placenta to the fetus. This normal process is generally beneficial, as it protects newborn infants against infection. However, IgG anti-Rh antibodies coat the fetal red blood cells, which are then destroyed by phagocytic cells in the liver, causing a hemolytic anemia in the fetus and newborn infant."

            "content": "Physical evidence of jaundice is observed in infants when bilirubin levels reach 5 to 10 mg/dL (versus 2 to 3 mg/dL in adults). When jaundice is observed, the laboratory evaluation for hyperbilirubinemia should include a total bilirubin measurement to determine the magnitude of hyperbilirubinemia. Bilirubin levels greater than 5 mg/dL on the first day of life or greater than 13 mg/dL thereafter in term infants should be evaluated further with measurement of indirect and direct bilirubin levels, blood typing, Coombs test, complete blood count, blood smear, and reticulocyte count. These tests must be performed before treatment of hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy or exchange transfusion. In the absence of hemolysis or evidence for either the common or the rare causes of nonhemolytic indirect hyperbilirubinemia, the diagnosis is either physiologic or breast milk jaundice. Jaundice present after 2 weeks of age is pathologic and suggests a direct-reacting hyperbilirubinemia."

Domestic violence is also common, affecting between 10% and 30% of pregnant women and resulting in fetal mortality of 5%.Pregnancy results in physiologic changes that may impact postinjury evaluation (Table 7-13). Heart rate increases by 10 to 15 beats per minute during the first trimester and remains elevated until delivery. Blood pressure diminishes during the first two trimesters due to a decrease in systemic vascular resis-tance and rises again slightly during the third trimester (mean values: first = 105/60, second = 102/55, third = 108/67). Intra-vascular volume is increased by up to 8 L, which results in a relative anemia but also a relative hypervolemia. Consequently, a pregnant woman may lose 35% of her blood volume before exhibiting signs of shock."
