The p-value is the probability of observing the results (or more extreme results) assuming that the null hypothesis is true. In this case, the null hypothesis is that statin A and statin B have the same effect on LDL levels. The p-value of 0.052 indicates that if we conduct many repeated experiments (100 similar experiments), we would expect about 5.2% of them to show a difference in LDL reduction between statin A and statin B due to chance. This does not necessarily mean that the observed difference is statistically significant. Option A is incorrect because it implies that 5.2 experiments would show a difference in favor of statin A, which is not the correct interpretation of the p-value. Option B is correct because it accurately describes the meaning of the p-value. The p-value of 0.052 indicates that there is a 5.2% chance that the observed difference in LDL reduction between statin A and statin B is due to chance. Option C is incorrect because it incorrectly states that there is a 94.8% chance that the difference observed reflects a real difference. The p-value of 0.052 does not provide any information about the size of the effect or the probability that the observed difference is due to a real effect. Option D is incorrect because the p-value of 0.052 does not indicate that the difference between statin A and statin B is statistically significant. A p-value of 0.052 is considered to be at the threshold of statistical significance, but it is not sufficient to conclude that the difference is statistically significant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

By inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis, statins lead to increased hepatic LDL receptor activity and accelerated clearance of circulating LDL, resulting in a dose-dependent reduction in plasma levels of LDL-C. The magnitude of LDL lowering associated with statin treatment varies widely among individuals, but once a patient is on a statin, the doubling of the statin dose produces an ~6% further reduction in the level of plasma LDL-C. The statins currently available differ in their LDL-C\u2013reducing potency (Table 421-5). Currently, there is no convincing evidence that any of the different statins confer an advantage that is independent of the effect on LDL-C.

Statins, fibrates, and bile acid sequestrants have modest effects (5\u201310%), whereas ezetimibe and omega-3 fatty acids have no effect. Nicotinic acid is the only currently available drug with predictable HDL cholesterol-raising properties. The response is dose related, and nicotinic acid can increase HDL cholesterol by ~30% above baseline. After several trials of nicotinic acid versus placebo in statin-treated patients, there is still no evidence that raising HDL with nicotinic acid beneficially affects CVD events in patients with or without the metabolic syndrome. BLOOD PRESSURE (SEE ALSO CHAP. 298) The direct relationship between blood pressure and all-cause mortality rate has been well established in studies comparing patients"

Establishing that strict glycemic control reduces the risk of macrovascular complications of diabetes has proved much more elusive than the beneficial effects on microvascular complications such as retinopathy and renal disease. Indeed, \u201ctight\u201d glycemic control may increase adverse events in patients with type 2 diabetes, lending even greater importance to aggressive control of other aspects of risk in this patient population. In this regard, multiple clinical trials have demonstrated unequivocal benefit of statin therapy in diabetic patients over all ranges of LDL cholesterol levels (but not those with end-stage renal disease or advanced heart failure). Among the oral hypoglycemic agents, metformin possesses the best evidence base for cardiovascular event reduction. The novel oral hypoglycemic"

The ACC/AHA guidelines do not advocate a specific LDL for statin therapy. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are the agents of choice for lowering LDL. Combination therapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and a fibrate or another lipid-lowering agent (ezetimibe, niacin) may be considered but increases the possibility of side effects such as myositis and has not been shown to be beneficial. Nicotinic acid effectively raises HDL and can be used in patients with diabetes, but may worsen glycemic control and increase insulin resistance and has not been shown to provide additional benefit beyond statin therapy alone. Bile acid\u2013binding resins should not be used if hypertriglyceridemia is present. In large clinical trials, statin usage is associated with a mild increase in the risk"

            "content": "Lifestyle The first approach to a patient with hypercholesterolemia and high cardiovascular risk is to make any necessary lifestyle changes. In obese patients, efforts should be made to reduce body weight to the ideal level. Patients should receive dietary counseling to reduce the content of saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol in the diet. Regular aerobic exercise has relatively little impact on reducing plasma LDL-C levels, although it has cardiovascular benefits independent of LDL lowering. Pharmacologic Therapy for Hypercholesterolemia The decision to use LDL-lowering drug therapy (Table 421-5)\u2014with a statin being first-line therapy\u2014depends on the level of LDL-C as well as the level of cardiovascular risk. In general, patients with a Mendelian disorder of elevated LDL-C such as FH must be treated to reduce the very high lifetime risk of CVD, and treatment should be initiated as early as possible in adulthood or, in some cases, during childhood."

An alternative approach to using population means and standard deviations is to define a range of analyte values that is judged to be consistent with health on the basis of expert consensus opinion. These ranges are often referred to as decision limits. Examples of reference ranges established in this way include those for total, high-density, and low-density cholesterol (Table 480e-2). Such ranges may deviate considerably from those that would be established if the analyte concentrations of the population (mean \u00b1 2 standard deviations) were used as a basis for establishing the reference range. For example, the \u201cdesirable\u201d total cholesterol value according to the National Cholesterol Education Program is <200 mg/dL. This value is actually very close to the mean concentration among U.S. adults; in fact, almost one-half of"
