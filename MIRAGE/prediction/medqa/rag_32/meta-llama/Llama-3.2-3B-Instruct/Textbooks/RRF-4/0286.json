The mother's haphazard use of her anti-retroviral medications increases the risk of transmission to the baby. We need an assay that can detect the genetic material of HIV, not just antibodies. ELISA (A) is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that detects antibodies, not genetic material. Therefore, it is not the correct answer. Rapid HIV antibody test (B) also detects antibodies, not genetic material. So, it is not the correct answer. Southern blot (D) is a laboratory technique used to detect specific DNA sequences. While it can be used to detect HIV genetic material, it is not the most commonly used method for detecting HIV genetic material in clinical settings. Polymerase chain reaction (C) is a molecular biology technique that can amplify and detect specific DNA sequences, including those of HIV. It is widely used in clinical settings to detect HIV genetic material, making it the most suitable option for this scenario. The correct answer is C. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as it can detect the genetic material of HIV in the newborn. answer_choice\": \"C\"",

Infants born to HIV-infected mothers receive prophylaxis and are prospectively tested for infection. The diagnosis of HIV infection in most infants born in the United States is confirmed before development of clinical signs of infection. HIV infection can be diagnosed definitively by 1 month of age and in virtually all infected infants by 6 months of age using viral diagnostic assays (RNA polymerase chain reaction [PCR], DNA PCR, or virus culture). Maternal antibodies may be detectable until 12 to 15 months of age, and a positive serologic test is not considered diagnostic until 18 months of age."

Infection with HIV occurs after the transfer of body fluids from an infected person to an uninfected one. HIV infection is most commonly spread by sexual intercourse. Transmission by the exchange of contaminated needles used for intravenous drug delivery or by the therapeutic use of infected blood or blood products also occurs, although the latter route of transmission has largely been eliminated in countries where blood products are routinely screened for HIV. An important route of virus transmission is from an infected mother to child, which can occur in utero, during birth, or through breast milk. Rates of transmission from an untreated infected mother to her child vary (from about 15% to 45%), depending on the viral load in the mother and whether the mother breastfeeds the child, as breastfeeding increases the risk of transmission."

            "content": "While the immune response to HIV is ultimately unsuccessful, its importance in restraining disease progression is clear. This is perhaps best exemplified in the tragic case of children infected with HIV perinatally, in whom the course of disease is much more fulminant than in adults. This reflects a poor immune response to the virus in the acute phase of infection due to immaturity of the neonatal immune system, as well as infection by a viral strain that has already evaded an immune system that is genetically close to that of the child. In essence, the poor immune response results in the lack of a latent phase, leading rapidly to AIDS. 13-32 Lymphoid tissue is the major reservoir of HIV infection."

            "content": "Viral burden and neonatal infection rates are directly related. In one cohort, neonatal infection was 1 percent with < 400 copies/mL, and it was 23 percent when maternal viral RNA levels were >30,000 copies/mL (Cooper, 2002). Among 2615 infants born to mothers taking ART before conception and during pregnancy, there were no cases of vertical transmission at delivery (Mandelbrot, 2015). Transmis sion of HIV infection, however, has been observed at all HIV RNA levels, including .r assays. Transplacental HIV transmission Negative for HIV-1 and HIV-2 can occur early, and the virus has even antibodies and p24 antigen HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay abortion (Lewis, 1990). Kourtis and col leagues (2001) estimated that 20 percent of vertical transmission occurs before 36"

Detecting exposure to human immunodeficiency virus: ELISA and western blots are commonly used to detect exposure to HIV by measuring the amount of anti-HIV Ab present in a patient\u2019s blood sample. ELISA are used as the primary screening tool because they are very sensitive. Because these assays sometimes give false positives, however, western blots, which are more specific, are often used as a confirmatory test (Fig. 34.24). [Note: ELISA and western blots can only detect HIV exposure after anti-HIV Ab appear in the bloodstream. PCR based testing for HIV is more useful in the first few months after exposure.] C.

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"
