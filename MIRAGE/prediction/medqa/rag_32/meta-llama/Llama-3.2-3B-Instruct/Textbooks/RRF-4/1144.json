    "question": "A 58-year-old Caucasian female presents to her primary care physician with concerns about several recent health changes. The patient has recently gained weight and can't seem to exercise like she used to. She also notes that her thinking seems slow. Physical examination shows thickened, dry skin. Serum analysis confirms the physician's suspicions. Which of the following findings was most helpful in the diagnosis?",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and the potential underlying conditions that could be causing them. The patient is a 58-year-old Caucasian female who has recently gained weight, has difficulty exercising, and notes a slowing of her thinking. She also has thickened, dry skin. These symptoms are suggestive of hypothyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones, which are essential for regulating metabolism, energy generation, and overall health. The thickened, dry skin is a classic symptom of hypothyroidism. The other options are not directly related to the symptoms presented. High T4 and T3 levels would actually be seen in hyperthyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid gland produces too many thyroid hormones. Low T4 and T3 levels would also be seen in hypothyroidism, but the high TSH level would be more indicative of primary hypothyroidism, where the thyroid gland is not producing enough thyroid hormones. Hypercholesterolemia is a condition characterized by high levels of cholesterol in the blood and is not directly related to the symptoms presented.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

A group of laboratory values can conveniently be obtained with a single specimen at relatively low cost. Screening tests are most informative when they are directed toward common diseases or disorders and when their results indicate whether other useful\u2014but often costly\u2014tests or interventions are needed. On the one hand, biochemical measurements, together with simple laboratory determinations such as blood count, urinalysis, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, often provide a major clue to the presence of a pathologic process. On the other hand, the physician must learn to evaluate occasional screening-test abnormalities that do not necessarily connote significant disease. An in-depth workup after the report of an isolated laboratory abnormality in a person who is otherwise well is almost invariably wasteful and unproductive. Because so many tests are performed"

White blood cell count is 5800 cells/mm3 with a normal differential, hemoglobin is 11.8 g/dL, all liver tests are within normal limits, CD4 cell count is 278 cells/mm3, and viral load (HIV RNA) is 110,000 copies/mL. What other laboratory tests should be ordered? Which antiretroviral medica-tions would you begin?"

She initially responded to once-daily topical metronidazole 0.75% gel with excellent clearing of the papulopustular component of her acne rosacea. Recently, she has noted increasing persistent facial erythema. What therapeutic options are available? Diseases of the skin offer special opportunities to the clinician. In particular, the topical administration route is especially appropriate for skin diseases, although some dermatologic diseases respond as well or better to drugs administered systemically."

            "content": "The examination of a peripheral blood smear is one of the most informative exercises a physician can perform. Although advances in automated technology have made the examination of a peripheral blood smear by a physician seem less important, the technology is not a completely satisfactory replacement for a blood smear interpretation by a trained medical professional who also knows the patient\u2019s clinical history, family history, social history, and physical findings. It is useful to ask the laboratory to generate a Wright\u2019s-stained peripheral blood smear and examine it. The best place to examine blood cell morphology is the feathered edge of the blood smear where red cells lie in a single layer, side by side, just barely touching one another but not overlapping. The author\u2019s approach is to look at the smallest cellular elements, the platelets, first and work his way up in size to red cells and then white cells."

More specific tests should be based on specific findings from the history and physical."

In addition, she is on hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol for hypertension. The patient has a history of one depressive episode after a divorce that was treated successfully with fluoxetine. Medical workup including complete blood cell count, thyroid func-tion tests, and a chemistry panel reveals no abnormalities. She is started on fluoxetine for a presumed major depressive episode and referred for cognitive behavioral psychotherapy.

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"
