    "question": "A patient presents to the emergency department with severe pain in her head. She states that the pain started 1 hour ago after rugby practice. Typically, she takes a special medication for bad headaches, but this time she took 2 doses and noticed no improvement in her symptoms. The patient's current medications that she can recall include sumatriptan and naproxen. She has been admitted to the hospital several times recently for panic attacks and suicide attempts. Her temperature is 99.2\u00b0F (37.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 129/65 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient is given dihydroergotamine, IV fluids, and is started on 100% oxygen. Two hours later, the patient demonstrates slurring of her speech. On physical exam there is drooping of the left side of her mouth, and her left upper extremity demonstrates 2/5 strength. A head CT is ordered. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current presentation?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with severe headache after rugby practice, which suggests a possible migraine or other headache disorder. However, the patient's recent history of panic attacks and suicide attempts raises the possibility of a psychogenic cause for her symptoms. The patient's medication regimen includes sumatriptan, which is a triptan used to treat migraines, and naproxen, which is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The patient's symptoms worsened despite taking two doses of sumatriptan, and she was given dihydroergotamine, another medication used to treat migraines. The patient's slurring of speech, drooping of the left side of her mouth, and decreased strength in her left upper extremity are concerning signs that suggest a neurological deficit. The head CT ordered may reveal a stroke. The patient's symptoms could be indicative of a medication reaction, possibly related to the triptans or ergotamines, or a psychogenic cause, possibly related to her history of panic attacks and suicide attempts. However, the presence of a neurological deficit, as evidenced by the patient's slurring of speech and decreased strength, makes a stroke a more likely cause. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's current presentation is a medication reaction, specifically a serotonin syndrome, which can be caused by the combination of triptans and NSAIDs. The patient should be monitored closely for signs of serotonin syndrome, which can include agitation, confusion, rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, and changes in mental status. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Head pain may be unilateral or bilateral and is located temporally in 50% of patients but may involve any and all aspects of the cranium. Pain usually appears gradually over a few hours before peak intensity is reached; occasionally, it is explosive in onset. The quality of pain is only seldom throbbing; it is almost invariably described as dull and boring, with superimposed episodic stabbing pains similar to the sharp pains that appear in migraine. Most patients can recognize that the origin of their head pain is superficial, external to the skull, rather than originating deep within the cranium (the pain site for migraineurs).

However, treatment of acute attacks is required for all cluster headache patients at some time. Cluster headache attacks peak rapidly, and thus a treatment with quick onset is required. Many patients with acute cluster headache respond very well to oxygen inhalation. This should be given as 100% oxygen at 10\u201312 L/min for 15\u201320 min. It appears that high flow and high oxygen content are important. Sumatriptan 6 mg SC is rapid in onset and will usually shorten an attack to 10\u201315 min; there is no evidence of tachyphylaxis. Sumatriptan (20 mg) and zolmitriptan (5 mg) nasal sprays are both effective in acute cluster headache, offering a useful option for patients who may not wish to self-inject daily. Oral sumatriptan is not effective for prevention or for acute treatment of cluster headache."

In the case of headache, a detailed history following these lines will determine the diagnosis more often than will the physical examination or imaging. Nevertheless, a few aspects of the examination are worth emphasizing. For example, auscultation of the skull may rarely disclose a bruit (with large arteriovenous malformations); palpation may disclose the tender, hardened or elevated arteries of temporal arteritis; sensitive areas overlying a cranial metastasis or an inflamed paranasal sinus may be apparent; or there may be a tender occipital nerve. Examination of neck flexion may reveal meningitis; however, apart from such special instances, examination of the head itself, although necessary, seldom discloses the diagnosis."

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

The pain is deep and visceral; adjectives commonly used to 1600 describe it are heavy, squeezing, and crushing, although, occasionally, it is described as stabbing or burning (Chap. 19). It is similar in character to the discomfort of angina pectoris (Chap. 293) but commonly occurs at rest, is usually more severe, and lasts longer. Typically, the pain involves the central portion of the chest and/or the epigastrium, and, on occasion, it radiates to the arms. Less common sites of radiation include the abdomen, back, lower jaw, and neck. The frequent location of the pain beneath the xiphoid and epigastrium and the patients\u2019 denial that they may be suffering a heart attack are chiefly responsible for the common mistaken impression of indigestion. The pain of STEMI may radiate as high as the occipital area but not below the umbilicus. It is often accompanied by weakness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, and a sense"

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."
