    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with swelling and pain in his right testicle, which is a common presentation for testicular torsion or epididymitis. However, the patient's recent history of fever and facial swelling and pain on the right side of his face is a crucial clue. The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible diagnosis of epididymitis, which is often caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. The patient's monogamous relationship with his wife reduces the likelihood of gonorrhea, making chlamydia a more likely cause. The original presentation of chlamydia is often a painless chancre, but the patient's symptoms of swelling and pain in the testicle are consistent with epididymitis, which can be caused by chlamydia. The patient's age and the fact that he recently traveled from Nepal, where chlamydia is common, also support this diagnosis. The correct answer is B, as chlamydia is a common cause of epididymitis in young, monogamous men, and its original presentation is often a painless chancre, although this is not always the case. The other options are incorrect: A, chlamydia can be prevented with a live attenuated vaccine, but there is no vaccine available; C, buboes are a characteristic of syphilis, not chlamydia; and D, septic arthritis is more common in older adults, not in a 22-year-old man.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

He was otherwise healthy and had no other symptoms. During examination, the physician palpated the left testis, which was normal, although he noted soft nodular swelling around the superior aspect of the testes and the epididymis. In his clinical notes, he described these findings as a \u201cbag of worms\u201d (Fig. 5.86). The bag of worms was a varicocele. The venous drainage of the testis is via the pampiniform plexus of veins that runs within the spermatic cord. A varicocele is a collection of dilated veins that arise from the pampiniform plexus. In many ways, they are similar to varicose veins that develop in the legs. Typically, the patient complains of a dragging feeling in the scrotum and around the testis, which is usually worse toward the end of the day. The family physician recommended surgical treatment, with a recommendation for surgery through an inguinal incision."

Persistence of symptoms after a course of therapy for epididymitis suggests the possibility of testicular tumor or of a chronic granulomatous disease, such as tuberculosis. In sexually active men under age 35, acute epididymitis is caused most frequently by C. trachomatis and less commonly by N. gonorrhoeae and is usually associated with overt or subclinical urethritis. Acute epididymitis occurring in older men or following urinary tract instrumentation is usually caused by urinary pathogens. Similarly, epididymitis in men who have practiced insertive rectal intercourse is often caused by Enterobacteriaceae. These older men usually have no urethritis but do have bacteriuria."

On direct questioning the patient indicated that the pain was in the inguinal region and radiated posteriorly into his left infrascapular region (loin). A urine dipstick was positive for blood (hematuria). A diagnosis of a ureteric stone (calculus) was made. The patient\u2019s initial infrascapular pain, which later radiated to the left groin, relates to passage of the ureteric stone along the ureter. The origin of the pain relates to ureteral distention. A series of peristaltic waves along the ureter transport urine along the length of the ureter from the kidney to the bladder. As the ureteric stone obstructs the kidney, the ureter becomes distended, resulting in an exacerbation of the pain. The peristaltic waves are superimposed upon the distention, resulting in periods of exacerbation and periods of relief."

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

Pediatric Patients A careful examination is indicated when a child presents with genital symptoms such as itching, discharge, burning with urination, or bleeding. The examiner should be familiar with the normal appearance of the prepubertal genitalia. The normal unestrogenized hymenal ring and vestibule can appear mildly erythematous. The technique of examination is different from that used for examining an adult and may need to be tailored to the individual child based on her age, size, and comfort with the examiner."

The initial diagnosis of urethritis in men currently includes specific tests only for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis; it does not yet include testing for Mycoplasma or Ureaplasma species. The following summarizes the approach to the patient with suspected urethritis: 1. Establish the presence of urethritis. If proximal-to-distal \u201cmilking\u201d of the urethra does not express a purulent or mucopurulent discharge, even after the patient has not voided for several hours (or preferably overnight), a Gram\u2019s-stained smear of an anterior urethral specimen obtained by passage of a small urethrogenital swab 2\u20133 cm into the urethra usually reveals \u22655 neutrophils per 1000\u00d7 field in areas containing cells; in gonococcal infection, such a smear usually reveals gram-negative intracellular diplococci as well.

C. trachomatis urethritis is generally less severe than gonococcal urethritis, although in any individual patient these two forms of urethritis cannot reliably be differentiated solely on clinical grounds. Symptoms include urethral discharge (often whitish and mucoid rather than frankly purulent), dysuria, and urethral itching. Physical examination may reveal meatal erythema and tenderness as well as a urethral exudate that is often demonstrable only by stripping of the urethra."
