    "question": "An 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician because he has excessively dry skin. His mother says that he has had dry, scaly skin since he was 6 months old. She says it is worse in winter and better in summer. There is no associated itching, redness, or discharge. Examination reveals generalized fine scales with coarse skin all over the body, except in the skin creases of the neck and in the cubital and popliteal fossae (see image). There are multiple papular elevations at the base of hair follicles and darkening of the palmar and plantar creases. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "A": "Psoriasis",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the clinical presentation of the 8-year-old boy and match it with the characteristics of the given options. The key features of the case are the generalized fine scales, coarse skin, and the presence of papular elevations at the base of hair follicles, which are worse in winter and better in summer. The skin involvement is mostly on the body, except in the skin creases of the neck and in the cubital and popliteal fossae. The absence of itching, redness, or discharge is also notable. Let's examine the options: A. Psoriasis: Psoriasis typically presents with well-defined, erythematous plaques covered with silvery scales, not fine scales. The distribution of psoriasis is often symmetric, but it usually spares the skin creases. B. Lichen simplex: Lichen simplex is a form of dermatitis that presents with small, pruritic papules, which is not consistent with this case. C. Ichthyosis vulgaris: Ichthyosis vulgaris is characterized by dry, scaly skin that is worse in winter and better in summer, which matches the boy's presentation. The absence of itching, redness, or discharge also aligns with ichthyosis vulgaris. The fine scales and coarse skin, as well as the papular elevations at the base of hair follicles, are also consistent with ichthyosis vulgaris. D. Pityriasis versicolor: Pityriasis versicolor is a superficial fungal infection that presents with macules or patches of discoloration, not fine scales. The distribution of pityriasis versicolor is typically not as widespread as described in this case. Based on the analysis, the most likely diagnosis is C. Ichthyosis vulgaris.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

Thus, when lesions are distributed on elbows, knees, and scalp, the most likely possibility based solely on distribution is psoriasis or dermatitis herpetiformis (Figs. 70-7 and 70-8, respectively). The primary lesion in psoriasis is a scaly papule that soon forms erythematous plaques covered with a white scale, whereas that of dermatitis herpetiformis is an urticarial papule that quickly becomes a small vesicle. In this manner, identification of the primary lesion directs the examiner toward the proper diagnosis. Secondary changes in skin can also be quite helpful. For example, scale represents excessive epidermis, while crust is the result of a discontinuous epithelial cell layer. Palpation of skin lesions can yield insight into the character of an eruption. Thus, red papules on the lower extremities that blanch with pressure can be a manifestation of many different diseases, but hemorrhagic red papules that do not blanch with pressure indicate palpable purpura"

About 80% ultimately coexpress allergic rhinitis or asthma. The infantile pattern is characterized by weeping inflammatory patches and crusted plaques on the face, neck, and extensor surfaces. The childhood and adolescent pattern is typified by dermatitis of flexural skin, particularly in the antecubital and popliteal fossae (Fig. 71-1). AD may resolve spontaneously, but approximately 40% of all individuals affected as children will have dermatitis in adult life. The distribution of lesions in adults may be similar to those seen in childhood; however, adults frequently have localized disease manifesting as lichen simplex chronicus or hand eczema (see below). In patients with localized disease, AD may be suspected because of a typical personal or family history or the presence of cutaneous stigmata of AD such as perioral pallor, an extra"

He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

Periungual telangiectases are usually present, but periungual erythema is rare. In advanced cases, the extremities show contractures and calcinosis cutis. Facial involvement includes a smooth, unwrinkled brow, taut skin over the nose, shrinkage of tissue around the mouth, and perioral radial furrowing (Fig. 73-8). Matlike telangiectases are often present, particularly on the face and hands. Involved skin feels indurated, smooth, and bound to underlying structures; hyperand hypopigmentation are common as well. Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon (i.e., cold-induced blanching, cyanosis, and reactive hyperemia) is documented in almost all patients and can precede development of scleroderma by many years. Linear scleroderma is a limited form of disease that presents in a linear, bandlike distribution and tends to involve deep as well as superficial layers of skin. The combination of"

In the top photograph, large erythematous plaques covered with scales and erosions are visible over the upper trunk. The lower panel shows a section through the skin of the same patient. Note the psoriasis-like hyperplasia of the epidermis. Neutrophils are also present in the epidermis. In the dermis, a perivascular infiltrate is evident. Although not discernible at this magnification, the infiltrate contains both mononuclear cells and neutrophils. Source: Sprecher, E., et al.: Clin. Exp. Dermatol. 2004, 29:513\u2013517."

            "content": "A thorough physical examination entails close attention to the rash, with an assessment and precise definition of its salient features. First, it is critical to determine what type of lesions make up the eruption. Macules are flat lesions defined by an area of changed color (i.e., a blanchable erythema). Papules are raised, solid lesions <5 mm in diameter; plaques are lesions >5 mm in diameter with a flat, plateau-like surface; and nodules are lesions >5 mm in diameter with a more rounded configuration. Wheals (urticaria, hives) are papules or plaques that are pale pink and may appear annular (ringlike) as they enlarge; classic (nonvasculitic) wheals are transient, lasting only 24 h in any defined area. Vesicles (<5 mm) and bullae (>5 mm) are circumscribed, elevated lesions containing fluid. Pustules are raised lesions containing purulent exudate; vesicular processes such as varicella or herpes simplex may evolve to pustules. Nonpalpable purpura is a flat lesion that is due to"

Primary lesions in this disorder consist of papules, papulovesicles, or urticarial plaques. Because pruritus is prominent, patients may present with excoriations and crusted papules but no observable primary lesions. Patients sometimes report that their pruritus has a distinctive burning or stinging component; the onset of such local symptoms reliably heralds the development of distinct clinical lesions 12\u201324 h later. Almost all DH patients have associated, usually subclinical, gluten-sensitive enteropathy (Chap. 349), and >90% express the HLA-B8/DRw3 and HLA-DQw2 haplotypes. DH may present at any age, including in childhood; onset in the second to fourth decades is most common. The disease is typically chronic."

Rash is present in only 13% of patients at presentation for medical care (usually ~4 days after onset of fever), appearing an average of 2 days later in half of the remaining patients and never appearing in the others. The initial macular rash is often detected by careful inspection of the axilla or the inner surface of the arm. Subsequently, the rash becomes maculopapular, involving the trunk more often than the extremities; it is seldom petechial and rarely involves the face, palms, or soles. A rash is detected in only 20% of patients with darkly pigmented skin."
