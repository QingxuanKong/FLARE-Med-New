She does not have difficulties swallowing, dyspnea, or changes in voice. Examination shows a 3-cm, hard swelling on the left side of her neck that moves with swallowing. There is no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Thyroid functions tests are within the reference range.

The overall incidence of this tumor is declining in the United States, probably due to iodine supplementation and improved histologic classification. Women have a higher incidence of follicular cancer, with a female-to-male ratio of 3:1, and a mean age at presentation of 50 years old. Follicular cancers usually present as solitary thyroid nodules, occasion-ally with a history of rapid size increase, and long-standing goi-ter. Pain is uncommon, unless hemorrhage into the nodule has occurred. Unlike papillary cancers, cervical lymphadenopathy is uncommon at initial presentation (about 5%),"

For patients in whom thyroid cancer is suspected or demonstrated in an intrathoracic gland, attempts should be made to avoid rupture of the thyroid capsule. When sternotomy is indicated, the sternum usually should be divided to the level of the third intercostal space and then laterally on one side at the space between the third and fourth ribs (Fig. 38-23).Central and Lateral Neck Dissection for Nodal Metastases Central compartment (medial to the carotid sheath) lymph nodes frequently are involved in patients with papillary, medullary, and H\u00fcrthle cell carcinomas and should be removed at the time of thyroidectomy, preserving the RLNs and parathyroid glands. Central neck dissection is particularly important in patients with medullary and H\u00fcrthle cell carcinoma because of the high fre-quency of microscopic tumor spread and because these"

Most diagnoses require more tissue than such aspiration can provide, and it often delays a definitive diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration should be reserved for thyroid nodules and for confirmation of relapse in patients whose primary diagnosis is known. If the primary physician is uncertain about whether to proceed to biopsy, consultation with a hematologist or medical oncologist should be helpful. In primary care practices, <5% of lymphadenopathy patients will require a biopsy. That percentage will be considerably larger in referral practices, i.e., hematology, oncology, or ENT."

If the duct retains its connection with the pharynx, infection may occur, and the resulting abscess will necessitate incision and drainage, occasionally resulting in a salivary fis-tula. Submental lymphadenopathy and midline dermoid cysts can be confused with a thyroglossal duct cyst. Rarely, midline ectopic thyroid tissue masquerades as a thyroglossal duct cyst and may represent the patient\u2019s only thyroid tissue. Therefore, if there is any question regarding the diagnosis or if the thyroid gland cannot be palpated in its normal anatomic position, it is advisable to obtain a nuclear scan to confirm the presence of a normal thyroid gland. Although rarely the case in children, in adults the thyroglossal duct may contain thyroid tissue that can undergo malignant degeneration. The presence of malignancy in a thyroglossal cyst should be suspected when the cyst grows rapidly or"

            "content": "Focal thyroiditis is present in 20\u201340% of euthyroid autopsy cases and is associated with serologic evidence of autoimmunity, particularly the presence of TPO antibodies. The most common clinically apparent cause of chronic thyroiditis is Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, an autoimmune disorder that often presents as a firm or hard goiter of variable size (see above). Riedel\u2019s thyroiditis is a rare disorder that typically occurs in middle-aged women. It presents with an insidious, painless goiter with local symptoms due to compression of the esophagus, trachea, neck veins, or recurrent laryngeal nerves. Dense fibrosis disrupts normal gland architecture and can extend outside the thyroid capsule. Despite these extensive histologic changes, thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The goiter is hard, nontender, often asymmetric, and fixed, leading to suspicion of a malignancy. Diagnosis requires open biopsy as FNA biopsy is usually inadequate. Treatment is directed to surgical relief of compressive"

These lymph nodes can be classified into seven levels as depicted in Fig. 38-6. The central compartment includes nodes located in the area between the two carotid sheaths, whereas nodes lateral to the vessels are present in the lateral compartment. Thyroid can-cers may metastasize to any of these regions, although metas-tases to submaxillary nodes (level I) are rare (<1%). There also can be \u201cskip\u201d metastases to nodes in the lateral ipsilateral neck without central neck nodes.Thyroid HistologyMicroscopically, the thyroid is divided into lobules that contain 20 to 40 follicles (Fig. 38-7). There are about 3 \u00d7 106 follicles in the adult male thyroid gland. The follicles are spherical and average 30 \u03bcm in diameter. Each follicle is lined by cuboidal epithelial cells and contains a central store of colloid secreted from the epithelial cells under the influence of the"
