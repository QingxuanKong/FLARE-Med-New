His body was discovered 7 hours later by a group of campers who promptly called the police. On arrival, the police found his body to be cold and stiff. Which of the following processes is responsible for the rigidity observed?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Activation of muscle contraction by neurotoxins",
        "B": "Effect of low temperature on muscle proteins",
        "C": "Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling",
        "D": "Depletion of intracellular calcium"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the effects of a coral snake bite and the physiological changes that occur in the body after death. Coral snake venom is a neurotoxin that can cause respiratory failure, but it does not directly cause muscle rigidity. Muscle rigidity after death is a common finding in corpses, and it is not directly related to the venom from the coral snake. The cold and stiff body temperature of the deceased suggests that the body has been dead for some time. The primary cause of muscle rigidity in a deceased person is the process of rigor mortis, which is the temporary stiffening of the muscles after death. Rigor mortis is caused by the depletion of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is a molecule that provides energy for muscle contraction. When a person dies, the cells stop producing ATP, and the muscles lock into a stiff position. This process typically begins within 2-4 hours after death and can last for 2-3 days. Therefore, the rigidity observed in the body is a result of rigor mortis, not the effect of the coral snake venom.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

            "content": "A 19-year-old college freshman began drinking alcohol at 8:30 pm during a hazing event at his new fraternity. Between 8:30 and approximately midnight, he and several other pledges consumed beer and a bottle of whiskey, and then he consumed most of a bottle of rum at the urging of upperclassmen. The young man complained of feeling nau-seated, lay down on a couch, and began to lose conscious-ness. Two upperclassmen carried him to a bedroom, placed him on his stomach, and positioned a trash can nearby. Approximately 10 minutes later, the freshman was found unconscious and covered with vomit. There was a delay in treatment because the upperclassmen called the college police instead of calling 911. After the call was transferred to 911, emergency medical technicians responded quickly and discovered that the young man was not breathing and that he had choked on his vomit. He was rushed to the hospital, where he remained in a coma for 2 days before ultimately being pronounced dead. The"

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

            "content": "Rigidity usually involves both flexor and extensor muscle groups, but it tends to be more prominent in muscles that maintain a flexed posture, that is, in the flexor muscles of trunk and limbs. It appears to be somewhat greater in the large muscle groups, but this may be merely a matter of muscle mass. Certainly the small muscles of the face and tongue and even those of the larynx are often affected by rigidity. Concordant with the physical examination, in the electromyographic tracing, motor-unit activity is more continuous in rigidity than in spasticity, persisting even after apparent relaxation."

            "content": "The initial manifestation of HAPE may be a reduction in exercise tolerance greater than that expected at the given altitude. Although a dry, persistent cough may presage HAPE and may be followed by the production of blood-tinged sputum, cough in the mountains is almost universal and the mechanism is poorly understood. Tachypnea and tachycardia, even at rest, are important markers as illness progresses. Crackles may be heard on auscultation but are not diagnostic. HAPE may be accompanied by signs of HACE. Patchy or localized opacities (Fig. 476e-2) or streaky interstitial edema may be noted on chest radiography. In the past, HAPE was mistaken for pneumonia due to the cold or for heart failure due to hypoxia and exertion. Kerley B lines or a bat-wing appearance are not seen on radiography. Electrocardiography may reveal right ventricular strain or even hypertrophy. Hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis are consistently present unless the patient is taking acetazolamide, in which case"
