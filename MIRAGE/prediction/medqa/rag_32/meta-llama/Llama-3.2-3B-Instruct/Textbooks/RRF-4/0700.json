    "question": "A 76-year-old woman visits a physician for a general medical examination. She is asymptomatic. Six months prior, she had a cerebral stroke with left hemiparesis, from which she has almost completely recovered with physiotherapy. She has a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation (AF). She has no significant ischemic, valvular, or structural heart disease. She takes metoprolol, amlodipine, warfarin, and atorvastatin. Blood pressure is 125/70 mm Hg, pulse is 75/min with an irregular rhythm. Respirations are 13/min. She has a minor limp and weakness in her left arm and leg. Heart exam shows no abnormalities other than irregular beats. To assess adherence and therapeutic efficacy in this patient, which of the following studies should be ordered?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To assess adherence and therapeutic efficacy in a patient with atrial fibrillation, we need to consider the goals of therapy and the most relevant monitoring options. Atrial fibrillation is a significant risk factor for thromboembolic events, and anticoagulation with warfarin is indicated in this patient. The international normalized ratio (INR) is a critical parameter to monitor warfarin therapy, as it reflects the patient's response to anticoagulation and helps prevent thromboembolic events. An INR between 2-3 indicates adequate anticoagulation. Echocardiogram may be useful to assess cardiac structure and function, but it is not directly related to monitoring warfarin therapy. Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is a test used to monitor heparin therapy, not warfarin. Serum drug levels may be used to monitor other medications, but not warfarin, as it is a metabolized drug with variable bioavailability. Therefore, the most appropriate study to assess adherence and therapeutic efficacy in this patient is the international normalized ratio (INR).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

            "content": "The patient has a low ejection fraction with systolic heart failure, probably secondary to hypertension. His heart fail-ure must be treated first, followed by careful control of the hypertension. He was initially treated with a diuretic (furo-semide, 40 mg twice daily). On this therapy, he was less short of breath on exertion and could also lie flat without dyspnea. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhib-itor was added (enalapril, 20 mg twice daily), and over the next few weeks, he continued to feel better. Because of continued shortness of breath on exercise, digoxin at 0.25 mg/d was added with a further modest improvement in exercise tolerance. The blood pressure stabilized at 150/90 mm Hg, and the patient will be educated regarding the relation between his hypertension and heart failure and the need for better blood pressure control. Cautious addition of a \u03b2 blocker (metoprolol) will be considered. Blood lipids, which are currently in the normal range, will be monitored."

Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist is warranted for all patients with AF who have rheumatic mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valves for whom the newer anticoagulants have not been tested. Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (warfarin) or the newer oral anticoagulants is warranted for patients who have had more than 48 h of AF and are undergoing cardioversion, for patients who have a prior history of stroke, or for patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of \u22652, but it may be considered in patients with a risk score of 1. The approach to patients with paroxysmal AF is the same as for persistent AF. It is recognized that many patients who appear to have infrequent AF episodes often have asymptomatic episodes that put them at risk. Absence of AF during periodic monitoring is not sufficient to"

She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV.

Recommendations for infective endocarditis prophylaxis are similar to those for other valve lesions and are restricted to patients at high risk for complications from infection, including patients with a history of endocarditis. In symptomatic patients, some improvement usually occurs with restriction of sodium intake and small doses of oral diuretics. Beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil or diltiazem), and digitalis glycosides are useful in slowing the ventricular rate of patients with AF. Warfarin therapy targeted to an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2\u20133 should be administered indefinitely to patients with MS who have AF or a history of thromboembolism. The routine use of warfarin in patients in sinus rhythm with LA enlargement (maximal dimension"
