    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To formulate the null hypothesis for the study, we need to consider the relationship between diabetes and the risk of open-angle glaucoma. The null hypothesis is a statement of no effect or no difference. In this case, we want to determine if having diabetes increases the risk of developing open-angle glaucoma. The correct statement of the null hypothesis should reflect this relationship. Options A and C suggest that diabetes has no effect on the risk of open-angle glaucoma, which is the opposite of what we would expect if diabetes is indeed associated with an increased risk. Option D is unrelated to the relationship between diabetes and open-angle glaucoma. Therefore, the correct answer must be B, which states that diabetes is not associated with an increased prevalence of open-angle glaucoma. However, this is not entirely accurate as the study aims to investigate if having diabetes increases the risk of open-angle glaucoma. A more accurate null hypothesis would be that there is no significant difference in the risk of open-angle glaucoma between patients with diabetes and those without diabetes. This is reflected in option A, which states that the future risk of open-angle glaucoma is the same in patients with and those without diabetes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Screening of patients for glaucoma by noting the cup-to-disc ratio on ophthalmoscopy and by measuring intraocular pressure is vital. Glaucoma is treated with topical adrenergic agonists, cholinergic agonists, beta blockers, and prostaglandin analogues.

Many physicians are reluctant to dilate patients routinely for fundus examination because they fear precipitating an angle-closure glaucoma. The risk is actually remote and more than outweighed by the potential benefit to patients of discovering a hidden fundus lesion visible only through a fully dilated pupil.

Intraocular pressure is easily measured as part of the routine ophthalmologic examination. Two major types of glaucoma are recognized: open-angle and closed-angle (also called narrow-angle). The closed-angle form is associated with a shallow anterior chamber, in which a dilated iris can occlude the outflow drainage pathway at the angle between the cornea and the ciliary body (see Figure 6\u20139). This form is associated with acute and painful increases of pressure, which must be controlled on an emergency basis with drugs or prevented by surgical removal of part of the iris (iridectomy).

Observation of progressive cupping and detection of an arcuate scotoma or a nasal step on computerized visual field testing is sufficient to establish the diagnosis of glaucoma. Optical coherence tomography reveals corresponding loss of fibers along the arcuate pathways in the nerve fiber layer."

A 2-hour OGTT greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL (fasting sample, 60-, and 120-minute samples) after a 75-g load of glucose. A 2-hour OGTT should not be performed if the first two criteria are present. Diagnostic criterion for impaired glucose intolerance (IGT) is a fasting glucose greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL but less than 126 mg/dL (36). A 2-hour OGTT should be performed under the following conditions: 1. A 10-hour fast should precede morning testing. 2. The patient should sit throughout the procedure. Assessment of Glycemic Control 3. No smoking is permitted during the test interval. 4. Caffeinated beverages should not be consumed. 5. More than 150 g of carbohydrates should be ingested for 3 days before the test. 6. No drugs should be taken before the test."

As a result of the increased intraocular pressure, retinal nerve fibers undergo atrophy and shrink in size. Note a pale optic disc in the center of the image with a less pronounced rim due to atrophy of nerve fibers. Enlargement of the optic nerve cup (central area of the optic disc) is also visible and a characteristic finding for glaucoma. Compare this image to a normal retina in Fig. 24.14. (Courtesy of Dr. Renzo A. Zaldivar.) \u0081 The meridional (or longitudinal) portion consists of the outer muscle fibers that pass posteriorly into the stroma of the choroid. These fibers function chiefly in stretching the choroid. It also may help open the iridocorneal angle and facilitate drainage of the aqueous humor."

The gravity of this problem is highlighted by the finding that individuals with DM are 25 times more likely to become legally blind than individuals without DM. Severe vision loss is primarily the result of progressive diabetic retinopathy and clinically significant macular edema. Diabetic retinopathy is classified into two stages: nonproliferative and proliferative. Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy usually appears late in the first decade or early in the second decade of the disease and is marked by retinal vascular microaneurysms, blot hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots (Fig. 419-2). Mild nonproliferative retinopathy may progress to more extensive disease, characterized by changes in venous vessel caliber, intraretinal microvascular"
