On questioning by the paramedics, he reported severe chest pain and mild dyspnea. On arrival, he is confused and unable to provide a history. His pulse is 93/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 91/65 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. He is able to move his extremities in response to commands. He opens his eyes spontaneously. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Examination shows multiple bruises over the trunk and extremities. There is a 3-cm (1.2-in) wound at the left fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. There is jugular venous distention. Decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance on percussion are noted on the left. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the given question: The patient is a 23-year-old man who has been involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision. He presents with severe chest pain, mild dyspnea, confusion, and a 3-cm wound at the left fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line, along with signs of respiratory distress (jugular venous distention, decreased breath sounds, and hyperresonance on percussion on the left side). The patient is hemodynamically unstable, as indicated by his low blood pressure (91/65 mmHg) and low oxygen saturation (88% on room air). The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a tension pneumothorax, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention. The presence of decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance on percussion on the left side, along with jugular venous distention, are classic signs of a tension pneumothorax. This condition occurs when air enters the pleural space and cannot escape, causing the lung to collapse and the mediastinum to shift away from the affected side, leading to increased intrathoracic pressure and compression of the heart and major blood vessels. Given the patient's unstable condition, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform needle decompression to relieve the tension in the pleural space. This procedure involves inserting a large-bore needle into the second intercostal space at the midclavicular line on the affected side to allow air to escape and restore normal intrathoracic pressure. The other options are not the most appropriate next steps in management: A. CT scan of the chest: While a CT scan may be useful in evaluating the extent of the patient's injuries, it is not the immediate priority in a patient who is hemodynamically unstable and showing signs of tension pneumothorax. B. Bronchoscopy: Bronchoscopy may be useful in evaluating the airway, but it is not the primary treatment for tension pneumothorax. C. Emergency thoracotomy: Emergency thoracotomy is a surgical procedure that is typically reserved for patients who are not responding to initial resuscitative efforts or who require surgical intervention for other life-threatening injuries.

            "content": "If the physician arrives at the scene of an accident and finds an unconscious patient, a rapid examination should be made before the patient is moved. First it must be determined whether the patient is breathing and has a clear airway and obtainable pulse and blood pressure, and whether there is hemorrhage from a scalp laceration or injured viscera. Severe head injuries that arrest respiration are soon followed by cessation of cardiac function. Injuries of this magnitude are often fatal; if resuscitative measures do not restore and sustain cardiopulmonary function within 4 to 5 min, the brain is usually irreparably damaged. Bleeding from the scalp can usually be controlled by a pressure bandage unless an artery is divided; then a suture becomes necessary. Resuscitative measures (artificial respiration and cardiac compression) should be continued until they are taken over by ambulance personnel. Oxygen should then be administered."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

Domestic violence is also common, affecting between 10% and 30% of pregnant women and resulting in fetal mortality of 5%.Pregnancy results in physiologic changes that may impact postinjury evaluation (Table 7-13). Heart rate increases by 10 to 15 beats per minute during the first trimester and remains elevated until delivery. Blood pressure diminishes during the first two trimesters due to a decrease in systemic vascular resis-tance and rises again slightly during the third trimester (mean values: first = 105/60, second = 102/55, third = 108/67). Intra-vascular volume is increased by up to 8 L, which results in a relative anemia but also a relative hypervolemia. Consequently, a pregnant woman may lose 35% of her blood volume before exhibiting signs of shock."

Circulation can be assessed via observation (heart rate, skin color, mental status) and palpation (pulse quality, capillary refill, skin temperature) and restored (via two large peripheral intravenous lines, when possible) while control of bleeding is accomplished through the use of direct pressure. Assessment for disabilities (D),including neurologic status, includes examination of pupil size and reactivity, a brief mental status assessment (AVPU\u2014alert; responds to voice; responds to pain; unresponsive), and examination of extremity movement to assess for spinal cord injury. The Glasgow Coma Scale can direct decisions regarding the initiation of cerebral resuscitation in patients with suspected closed head injuries (Table 42-1). E, which stands for exposure,requires a full assessment of the patient by completely disrobing the child for a detailed examination of the entire body. The examiner should ensure a neutral thermal environment to prevent hypothermia."

Unfortunately, a complication of a vertical incision in the midclavicular line is division of the segmental nerve supply to the rectus abdominis muscle. This produces muscle atrophy and asymmetrical proportions of the anterior abdominal wall. A 45-year-old man had mild epigastric pain, and a diagnosis of esophageal reflux was made. He was given appropriate medication, which worked well. However, at the time of the initial consultation, the family practitioner requested a chest radiograph, which demonstrated a prominent hump on the left side of the diaphragm and old rib fractures. The patient was recalled for further questioning."

For lay responders, the pulse check is no longer recommended because it is unreliable. As soon as a cardiac arrest is suspected, confirmed, or even considered to be impending, calling an emergency rescue system (e.g., 911) is the immediate priority. With the development of AEDs that are easily used by nonconventional emergency responders, an additional layer for response has evolved (see below)."

A chest radiograph demonstrated translucent notches along the inferior border of ribs III to VI (eFig. 3.119). He was referred to a cardiologist and a diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta was made. The rib notching was caused by dilated collateral intercostal arteries. Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. This narrowing can markedly reduce blood flow to the lower body. Many of the vessels above the narrowing therefore enlarge due to the increased pressure so that blood can reach the aorta below the level of the narrowing. Commonly, the internal thoracic, superior epigastric, and musculophrenic arteries enlarge anteriorly. These arteries supply the anterior intercostal arteries, which anastomose with the posterior intercostal arteries that allow blood to flow retrogradely into the aorta. Enlargement of the intertcostal vessels results in notching of the ribs."
