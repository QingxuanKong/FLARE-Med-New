    "question": "A 51-year-old Caucasian woman presents to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She had a Colles' fracture 2 years ago. The rest of her past medical history is unremarkable. She has a sedentary lifestyle. She has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. She drinks alcohol moderately. Her mother had a fracture of the wrist when she was in her late 60s. The physical examination shows no abnormal findings. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA scan) shows a T-score of -3.2 standard deviations (SDs) in the hip. The patient is educated regarding her risk of falls. Exercise regimen and smoking cessation assistance are provided. Appropriate diet is indicated, as well as supplements with calcium and vitamin D. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy?",

The patient is a postmenopausal woman with a sedentary lifestyle, smoking history, and a family history of osteoporosis. The patient has not been treated for osteoporosis, and the goal is to initiate pharmacotherapy to reduce the risk of future fractures. The patient's T-score is more than 2.5 standard deviations below the mean, indicating severe osteoporosis. The most appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy is to initiate a bisphosphonate, which is the first-line treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with a T-score of -3.2 or more in the hip. The options include alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate, and zoledronate. Among these options, alendronate is a commonly used and effective bisphosphonate for osteoporosis treatment. \", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

            "content": "The epidemiology of fractures follows the trend for loss of bone density, with exponential increases in both hip and vertebral fractures with age. Fractures of the distal radius have a somewhat different epidemiology, increasing in frequency before age 50 and plateauing by age 60, with only a modest age-related increase thereafter. In contrast, incidence rates for hip fractures double every 5 years after age 70 (Fig. 425-1). This distinct epidemiology may be related to the way the elderly fall as they age, with fewer falls on an outstretched hand and more falls directly on the hip. About 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the United States, most of which require hospital admission and surgical intervention. The probability that a 50-year-old white individual will have a hip fracture during his or her lifetime is 14% for women and 5% for men; the risk for African Americans is lower (about one-half those rates), and the risk for Asians is roughly equal to that for whites.

A T-score below \u20132.5 in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip has been defined as a diagnosis of osteoporosis. As noted above, because more than 50% of fractures occur in individuals with low bone mass rather than BMD osteoporosis, attempts are ongoing to redefine the disease as a fracture risk rather than a specific BMD. Consistent with this concept, fractures of the spine and hip that occur in the absence of major trauma would be considered to be sufficient to diagnose osteoporosis, regardless of BMD. Fractures of other sites, such as pelvis, proximal humerus, and wrist, would be tantamount to an osteoporosis diagnosis in the presence of low BMD. CT can also be used to measure the spine"

She describes herself as \u201cchronically miserable and worried all the time.\u201d Her medical history is notable for chronic neck pain from a motor vehicle accident for which she is being treated with tramadol and meperidine. In addition, she is on hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol for hypertension. The patient has a history of one depressive episode after a divorce that was treated successfully with fluoxetine. Medical workup including complete blood cell count, thyroid func-tion tests, and a chemistry panel reveals no abnormalities. She is started on fluoxetine for a presumed major depressive episode and referred for cognitive behavioral psychotherapy. What CYP450 and pharmacodynamic interactions might be associated with fluoxetine use in this patient? Which class of antidepressants would be contraindicated in this patient? A 47-year-old woman"

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

Other symptoms are hip pain, either unilateral or bilateral, and diiculty in weight bearing until the woman is nearly immobilized (Maliha, 2012). In more than half of women, no apparent reason for osteopenia is found. Some known causes include heparin (unfractionated only), prolonged bed rest, and corticosteroid therapy (Cunningham, 2005; Galambosi, 2016). In a few cases, overt hyperparathyroidism or thyrotoxicosis eventually develops. Treatment is problematic and includes calcium and vitamin D supplementation and standard pain management. Shown in Figure 58-5 is a hip radiograph from a woman FIGURE 58-5 Anteroposterior plain hip radiograph of a 25-yearold woman at 26 weeks' gestation. She complained of left hip and knee pain and progressive weakness. Transient osteoporosis of the left femur responded over 3 months to physical therapy combined with vitamin 0 and calcium supplementation."
