    "question": "A 45-year-old man comes to his primary-care doctor with his wife for a 4-week history of constipation. The patient reports that his bowel habits have changed from every day to every 3 or 4 days. He also now has to strain to pass stool. On further questioning, his wife has also noticed that he has seemed fatigued, with little interest in going on their usual afternoon walks. Medical history is notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both managed medically. He was last seen for follow-up of these conditions 1 month ago. Physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the cellular target of the medicine that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with constipation, which is a common complaint in clinical practice. The patient's symptoms include changes in bowel habits (decreased frequency, 3-4 days vs. daily), straining to pass stool, and fatigue. The patient's medical history is notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both managed medically. The physical examination is unremarkable. The patient's symptoms are consistent with pseudocholinergic syndrome, also known as cholinergic crisis or cholinergic excess. This condition is often caused by an overactive cholinergic system, which can be due to various factors such as medication side effects, overuse of certain medications, or certain medical conditions. The most likely medication responsible for this patient's symptoms is an anticholinergic medication, which blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter in the cholinergic system. The cellular target of the medicine that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms is the Na+/K+/2Cl- transporters in the membranes of epithelial cells in the ascending loop of Henle. This is because anticholinergic medications, such as antispasmodics, can affect the Na+/K+/2Cl- transporters, leading to an increase in chloride secretion and a decrease in sodium and potassium secretion, resulting in pseudocholinergic syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

These include the duration of symptoms, the change in symptoms over time, the age and sex of the patient, the referral status of the patient, prior diagnostic studies, a family history of colorectal malignancy, and the degree of psychosocial dysfunction. Thus, a younger individual with mild symptoms requires a minimal diagnostic evaluation, while an older person or an individual with rapidly progressive symptoms should undergo a more thorough exclusion of organic disease. Most patients should have a complete blood count and sigmoidoscopic examination; in addition, stool specimens should be examined for ova and parasites in those who have diarrhea.

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

In the vast majority of cases (probably >90%), there is no underlying cause (e.g., cancer, depression, or hypothyroidism), and constipation responds to ample hydration, exercise, and supplementation of dietary fiber (15\u201325 g/d). A good diet and medication history and attention to psychosocial issues are key. Physical examination and, particularly, a rectal examination should exclude fecal impaction and most of the important diseases that present with constipation and possibly indicate features suggesting an evacuation disorder (e.g., high anal sphincter tone, failure of perineal descent, or paradoxical puborectalis contraction during straining to"

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

A 50-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with severe lower back pain that had started several days ago. In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."
