    "question": "A 60-year-old woman presents to the outpatient clinic complaining of severe vulvar itching that has been gradually worsening for the past year. She mentions that she has tried over-the-counter lubricants, but lubricants do not seem to provide substantial relief. Her medical history is remarkable for diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. Menopause occurred at 52 years of age. She has been sexually active with her husband until recently and reports severe pain during vaginal intercourse. The physical examination reveals dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions in the vulvar area with atrophy of the labia minora. The clitoris appears retracted. The perianal skin appears pale and wrinkled. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient presents with severe vulvar itching that has been worsening over the past year, severe pain during vaginal intercourse, and dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions in the vulvar area. These symptoms have been present since menopause, which occurred at 52 years of age. The physical examination reveals atrophy of the labia minora, retraction of the clitoris, and pale and wrinkled perianal skin. Considering these findings, we can rule out option A, squamous cell hyperplasia, as it is not typically associated with severe itching and atrophy of the labia minora. Option C, squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva, is also unlikely, as it would not typically present with atrophy of the labia minora and perianal skin changes. Option D, lichen planus, can cause vulvar lesions, but it is typically associated with purplish, polygonal, flat-topped papules, not white plaque-like lesions. This leaves us with option B, lichen sclerosus, which is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can cause white, scaly, or plaque-like lesions, atrophy of the labia minora, and perianal skin changes. It is also more common in postmenopausal women. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with lichen sclerosus, making this the most likely diagnosis.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",

The discharge can vary from watery to homogeneously thick. Vaginal soreness, dyspareunia, vulvar burning, and irritation may be present. External dysuria (\u201csplash\u201d dysuria) may occur when micturition leads to exposure of the in\ufb02amed vulvar and vestibular epithelium to urine. Examination reveals erythema and edema of the labia and vulvar skin. Discrete pustulopapular peripheral lesions may be present. The vagina may be erythematous with an adherent, whitish discharge. The cervix appears normal. 2. The pH of the vagina in patients with VVC is usually normal (<4.5). 3. Fungal elements, either budding yeast forms or mycelia, appear in as many as 80% of cases. The results of saline preparation of the vaginal secretions usually are normal, although there may be a slight increase in the number of in\ufb02ammatory cells in severe cases. 4."

            "content": "A careful inspection of the vulva should be part of every gynecologic examination. On physical examination, vulvar carcinoma is usually raised and may be \ufb02eshy, ulcerated, plaquelike or warty in appearance. It may be pigmented, red or white, and tender or painless. The lesion may be clinically indistinct, especially in the presence of VIN or vulvar dystrophies (12). Any lesion of the vulva warrants a biopsy. Most squamous carcinomas of the vulva occur on the labia majora and minora (60%), but the clitoris (15%) and perineum (10%) may be primary sites. Approximately 10% of the cases are too extensive to determine a site of origin, and about 5% of the cases are multifocal."

Lichen sclerosus can occur at any age, although it is most common among postmenopausal women and prepubertal girls (Fig. 14.4). The symptoms are pruritus, dyspareunia, and burning. Lichen sclerosus characteristically is associated with decreased subcutaneous fat to the extent that the vulva is atrophic, with small or absent labia minora, obliteration of the anatomic landmarks, thin labia majora, and sometimes phimosis of the prepuce. The surface is pale with a shiny, crinkled pattern (described as having characteristics like \u201ccigarette paper\u201d), often with fissures and excoriation. The lesion tends to be symmetric and often extends to the perineal and perianal areas. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy. Invasive cancer is associated with lichen sclerosus, although the significance of this association is unclear in terms of causation (289)."

The epithelium of the hymen and vestibule become thin; there is a shift in vaginal cellular maturation in response to estrogen deprivation, with resultant thinning. Although these changes lead to minimal symptoms in most women, external dysuria, pruritus, tenderness, dyspareunia, and bleeding can result from fissuring and excoriations. Because of the risk of VIN and malignancy, suspicious lesions require vulvar biopsy. Vulvar Dermatoses Several vulvar conditions occur most commonly in postmenopausal women. Symptoms are primarily itching and vulvar soreness, in addition to dyspareunia."

            "content": "If intercourse is perceived as a necessary component of sexual activity with a partner, some older women will lose motivation and interest as a result of discomfort and dyspareunia associated with lack of estrogen. Although the increase in vaginal congestion in response to visual sexual stimulation is similar in women with and without estrogen, baseline vaginal blood \ufb02ow is lower in estrogen-deficient women (23). Thus, the increase in lubrication may be insufficient. There may be loss of elasticity and thinning of the vaginal epithelium, which becomes vulnerable to damage from intercourse. Estrogen depletion predisposes women to vulvar vaginitis and urinary tract infections, both of which contribute to dyspareunia and reduce sexual self-image. Women who remain sexually active, alone or with a partner, may have less vulvar and vaginal atrophy than sexually inactive women but may still be symptomatic (47)."

Women undergoing menopause, either naturally or secondary to surgical removal of the ovaries, may develop in\ufb02ammatory vaginitis, which may be accompanied by an increased, purulent vaginal discharge. In addition, they may have dyspareunia and postcoital bleeding resulting from atrophy of the vaginal and vulvar epithelium. Examination reveals atrophy of the external genitalia, along with a loss of the vaginal rugae. The vaginal mucosa may be somewhat friable in areas. Microscopy of the vaginal secretions shows a predominance of parabasal epithelial cells and an increased number of leukocytes. Atrophic vaginitis is treated with topical estrogen vaginal cream. Use of 1 g of conjugated estrogen cream intravaginally each day for 1 to 2 weeks generally provides relief. Maintenance estrogen therapy, either topical or systemic, should be considered to prevent recurrence of this disorder."

Symptoms include an external dysuria, pruritus, tenderness, dyspareunia, and bleeding from fissuring or ulcerations. In addition to the clinical findings of a shiny, \ufb02at, thin-appearing vaginal mucosa without rugae, microscopic examination of vaginal secretions reveals an increased number of white blood cells. Treatment with local or systemic estrogens effectively manages the symptoms and restores normal pH levels with ongoing therapy (274,275). Systemic absorption does occur with topical estrogen therapy, and rates of absorption differ depending on the degree of atrophy. Topical emollients may be helpful if estrogens are not desired or are contraindicated. Vaginal lubricants are universally useful in minimizing symptoms of dyspareunia for postmenopausal women (275). 1."

Vulvodynia is the term used to describe unexplained vulvar pain, sexual dysfunction, and the resultant psychological disability (240,241).

The history should include a review of symptoms, general medical history, review of past surgery, and current medications. The woman\u2019s most troubling symptoms must be ascertained\u2014how often she leaks urine, how much urine she leaks, what provokes urine loss, what improves or worsens the problem, and what treatment (if any) she had in the past. It is essential to keep the patient\u2019s chief symptom at the forefront to avoid inappropriate management. Consider, for example, a woman whose chief concern is that once a month, while leading a business seminar, she has a sudden, overwhelming urge to void followed by complete bladder emptying. She finds this leakage devastating and is considering quitting her job because of her acute embarrassment. On occasion, she leaks a few drops of urine during exercise, but this minor leakage does not bother her. During the evaluation, urodynamics reveal minimal stress"

Thus, the diagnosis of vaginismus is provisional until a very careful introital and vaginal examination can be done. This is not possible until the woman learns to be able to abduct her thighs, open the labia with her fingers or permit the examiner to do so, and to tolerate introital touch. The therapy for vaginismus must begin before the diagnosis is confirmed: 1. Encourage the couple to engage in sexual activities that exclude any attempt at intercourse. They may need to have \u201cdates\u201d and deliberately provide sexual contexts. 2."

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin.

In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min).

            "content": "In postmenarchal individuals, vulvar symptoms are most often related to a primary vaginitis and a secondary vulvitis. The mere presence of vaginal discharge can lead to vulvar irritative symptoms, or candidal vulvitis may be present (Fig. 14.17). The causes of vaginitis and cervicitis are covered in Chapter 18. Adult women describe vulvar symptoms using a variety of terms (itching, pain, discharge, discomfort, burning, external dysuria, soreness, pain with intercourse or sexual activity). Burning with urination from noninfectious causes may be difficult to distinguish from a urinary tract infection, although some women can distinguish pain when the urine hits the vulvar area (an external dysuria) from burning pain (often suprapubic in location) during urination. Itching is a very common vulvar symptom. A variety of vulvar conditions and lesions can present with pruritus. As in adolescents, vulvovaginal symptoms may be caused by STDs, nonsexually transmitted vaginitis, or UTIs. The"

Other visible external causes of bleeding in this age group include urethral prolapse, condylomas, lichen sclerosus, or molluscum contagiosum. Urethral prolapse can present acutely with a tender mass that may be friable or bleed slightly; it is most common in African American girls and may be confused with a vaginal mass (Fig. 14.2). The classic presentation is a mass symmetrically surrounding the urethra. This condition can be managed medically with the topical application of estrogens (7). The presence of condyloma should prompt questioning about abuse, although it was suggested that condyloma that appears during the first 2 to 3 years of life may be acquired perinatally from maternal infection with human papillomavirus (Fig. 14.3) (8,9). Excoriation and subepithelial hemorrhage (\u201cblood blisters\u201d) into the skin can cause external bleeding in the presence"

In many instances, women with genito\u2014pelvic pain/pene- tration disorder will also be diagnosed with another medical condition (e.g., lichen scle\u2014 rosus, endometriosis, pelvic in\ufb02ammatory disease, vulvovaginal atrophy). In some cases, treating the medical condition may alleviate the genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder. Much of the time, this is not the case. There are no reliable tools or diagnostic methods to allow clinicians to know whether the medical condition or genito\u2014pelvic pain/penetration disorder is primary. Often, the associated medical conditions are difficult to diagnose and treat. For example, the increased incidence of postmenopausal pain during intercourse may sometimes be attributable to vaginal dryness or vulvovaginal atrophy associated with declining estrogen levels. The relationship, however, between vulvovaginal atrophy/ dry- ness, estrogen, and pain is not well understood."
