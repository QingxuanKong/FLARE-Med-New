Situated deep in the center of the abdomen, the pancreas is surrounded by numerous important structures and major blood vessels. Seemingly minor trauma to the pan-creas can result in the release of pancreatic enzymes and cause life-threatening pancreatitis. Therefore, knowledge of the rela-tionships of the pancreas to surrounding structures is critically important for all surgeons to ensure that pancreatic injury is avoided during abdominal surgery.Gross AnatomyThe pancreas is a retroperitoneal organ that lies in an oblique position, sloping upward from the C-loop of the duodenum to the splenic hilum (Fig. 33-1).

            "content": "face of clinical and radiologic preoperative indications of pancreatic cancer, a negative biopsy should not preclude resection. In patients who are not candidates for resec-tion because of metastatic disease, biopsy for a tissue diagnosis becomes important because these patients may be candidates for palliative chemotherapy trials. It is especially important to make an aggressive attempt at tissue diagnosis before surgery in patients whose clinical presentation and imaging studies are more suggestive of alternative diagnoses such as pancreatic lym-phoma or pancreatic islet cell tumors. These patients might avoid surgery altogether in the case of lymphoma or warrant an aggres-sive approach in the case of islet cell carcinoma.Pancreaticoduodenectomy can be performed through a midline incision from xiphoid to umbilicus or through a bilat-eral subcostal incision. The initial portion of the procedure is an assessment of resectability. The liver and visceral and parietal peritoneal surfaces"

The spleen is mobilized by dividing ligamentous attachments, usually beginning with the splenocolic ligament (Fig. 34-6). In patients with signifi-cant splenomegaly, once lesser sac access has been achieved through either the gastrosplenic or gastrohepatic attachments, ligating the splenic artery in continuity along the superior bor-der of the pancreas may be preferable. This maneuver may serve several purposes: allowing safer manipulation of the Figure 34-6.

Without positive pressure, it is necessary to place a double-lumen endotracheal tube so that the ipsilateral lung can be deflated when the opera-tion starts. By collapsing the ipsilateral lung, working space within the thorax is obtained. Because insufflation is unneces-sary in thoracoscopic surgery, it can be beneficial to use stan-dard instruments via extended port sites in conjunction with thoracoscopic instruments. This approach is particularly useful when performing advanced procedures such as thoracoscopic anatomic pulmonary resection.Extracavitary Minimally Invasive SurgeryMany MIS procedures create working spaces in extrathoracic and extraperitoneal locations. Laparoscopic inguinal her-nia repair usually is performed in the anterior extraperitoneal Retzius space.33,34 Laparoscopic nephrectomy often is per-formed with retroperitoneal laparoscopy. Endoscopic retro-peritoneal approaches to pancreatic necrosectomy have seen some limited use.35"
