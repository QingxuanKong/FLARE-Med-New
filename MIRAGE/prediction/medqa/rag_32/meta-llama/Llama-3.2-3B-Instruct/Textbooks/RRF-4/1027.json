Expert opinion now generally favors an Hb transfusion trigger of 70 g/L in stable critically ill children, which is the same as the recommendation for adult patients (see Chapter 7). A higher threshold should be considered if the child has symptomatic anemia or impaired cardiorespiratory function.A useful guideline for estimating blood volume for the newborn infant is approximately 80 mL/kg of body weight. When packed red blood cells are required, the transfusion requirement is usually administered in 10 mL/kg increments, which is roughly equivalent to a 500-mL transfusion for a 70-kg adult. The following formula may be used to determine the vol-ume (ml) of PRBC to be transfused:(Target hematocrit\u2014Current Hematocrit) \u00d7 weight (kg) \u00d7 80/65 (65 represents the estimated hematocrit of a unit of PRBC)As a general rule, blood is recommended for replacement of"

The level of antithrombotic therapy should be moni-tored every 6 hours using the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), with the goal range of 1.5 to 2.5 times control values. This should correspond with plasma heparin anti-Xa activity levels of 0.3 to 0.7 IU/mL.Initial anticoagulation with UFH may also be administered SC, although this route is less commonly used. Adjusted-dose therapeutic SC UFH is initiated with 17,500 units, followed by 250 units/kg twice daily, and dosing is adjusted to an aPTT goal range similar to that for IV UFH. Fixed-dose unmonitored SC UFH is started with a bolus of 333 units/kg, followed by 250 units/kg twice daily.30Hemorrhage is the primary complication of UFH therapy.

Patients with mismatched segmental perfusion defects have a pulmonary embolus. Patients with equivocal ventilation-perfusion findings should be evaluated as described above for deep venous thrombosis in their legs. If deep venous thrombosis is detected, they should be anticoagulated. If deep venous thrombosis is not detected, they should be considered for a pulmonary angiogram."

After an initial bolus injection of 80\u2013100 units/kg, a continuous infusion of about 15\u201322 units/kg per hour is required to maintain the anti-Xa activity in the range of 0.3\u20130.7 units/mL. Low-dose prophylaxis is achieved with subcutaneous administration of heparin, 5000 units every 8\u201312 hours. Because of the danger of hematoma formation at the injection site, heparin must never be administered intramuscularly. Prophylactic enoxaparin is given subcutaneously in a dosage of 30 mg twice daily or 40 mg once daily. Full-dose enoxaparin therapy is 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours. This corresponds to a therapeutic anti-factor Xa level of 0.5\u20131 unit/mL. Selected patients may be treated with enoxaparin 1.5 mg/kg once a day, with a target anti-Xa level of 1.5 units/mL."

            "content": "Diffuse cerebral fat embolism is related to severe bone trauma. As a rule, the emboli are minute and widely dispersed, giving rise first to pulmonary symptoms and then to multiple dermal (anterior axillary fold and elsewhere) and cerebral petechial hemorrhages. Accordingly, the clinical picture is more of an encephalopathy and not strictly focal as it is in a stroke, although in some instances there may be focal features. Cerebral air embolism is a rare complication of abortion, scuba diving, or cranial, cervical, or thoracic operations involving large venous structures or venous catheter insertion; it was formerly encountered as a complication of pneumothorax therapy. Clinically, cerebral air embolism may be difficult to separate from the deficits following hypotension or hypoxia with which it frequently coexists. Hyperbaric treatment may be effective if instituted early."
