    "predict": "Based on the provided documents, I'll analyze the case step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 6-month-old boy with difficulty breathing, bluish discoloration of the lips, crackles over both lung fields, and enlargement of the tonsils and cervical lymph nodes. These symptoms suggest a severe respiratory infection. 2. **Laboratory Findings**: The patient has decreased serum IgA, IgE, and IgG titers, which indicates an immunodeficiency. The methenamine silver staining of bronchial lavage fluid shows disc-shaped cysts, which is a characteristic finding in certain types of infections. 3. **Immunodeficiency**: The combination of decreased Ig titers and the presence of disc-shaped cysts in the bronchial lavage fluid suggests an immunodeficiency affecting the B-cell compartment. 4. **B-Cell Deficiency**: The presence of disc-shaped cysts, which are characteristic of Churg-Strauss syndrome, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a B-cell maturation defect rather than a T-cell deficiency. 5. **Churg-Strauss Syndrome**: This condition is a type of vasculitis associated with asthma, eosinophilia, and the presence of disc-shaped cysts in the bronchial lavage fluid. It is caused by a defect in the CD16 (Fc\u03b3RIIIA) receptor, which is involved in the regulation of IgG-mediated responses. Given these points, the underlying cause of the patient's condition is most likely a defect in **B-cell maturation**, specifically a problem with the CD16 (Fc\u03b3RIIIA) receptor.

In a few children, pneumonia may persist longer than 1 month or may be recurrent. In such cases, the possibility of underlying disease must be investigated further, such as with tuberculin skin test, sweat chloride determination for cystic fibrosis, serum immunoglobulin and IgG subclass determinations, bronchoscopy to identify anatomic abnormalities or foreign body, and barium swallow for gastroesophageal reflux. Severe adenovirus pneumonia may result in bronchiolitis obliterans, a subacute inflammatory process in which the small airways are replaced by scar tissue, resulting in a reduction in lung volume and lung compliance. Unilateral hyper-lucent lung, or Swyer-James syndrome, is a focal sequela of severe necrotizing pneumonia in which all or part of a lung has increased translucency radiographically; it has been linked to adenovirus type 21."

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Patients with pulmonary cryptococcal disease present with fever, cough, dyspnea, and, in some cases, hemoptysis. A focal or diffuse interstitial infiltrate is seen on chest x-ray in >90% of patients. In addition, one may see lobar disease, cavitary disease, pleural effusions, and hilar or mediastinal adenopathy. More than half of patients are fungemic, and 90% of patients have concomitant CNS infection. Coccidioides immitis is a mold that is endemic in the southwest United States. It can cause a reactivation pulmonary syndrome in patients with HIV infection. Most patients with this condition will have CD4+ T cell counts <250/\u03bcL. Patients present with fever, weight loss, cough, and extensive, diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates on chest x-ray. One may also see nodules, cavities, pleural effusions, and hilar adenopathy. While serologic testing is of value in the immunocompetent host, serologies are"

            "content": "Available @ StudentConsult.com Infant boys are only rarely symptomatic in early infancy. At about 2 to 3 years of age, boys develop an awkward gait and an inability to run properly. Some have an antecedent history of mild slowness in attaining motor milestones or poor head control during infancy. Examination shows firm calf hypertrophy and mild to moderate proximal leg weakness with a hyperlordotic, waddling gait. The child typically arises from a lying position on the floor by using his arms to climb up his legs and body (Gower sign). Arm weakness is evident by age 6 years, and most boys are wheelchair dependent by age 12 years. Other manifestations include cardiomyopathy, scoliosis, respiratory decline, and, in some boys, cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. Many boys with Duchenne live into adulthood. Most die in their 20s or early 30s, usually as a result of progressive respiratory decline or cardiac dysfunction."

Frontal chest radiograph shows a diffuse pattern of increased interstitial markings, including Kerley lines. The heart is normal, and there are no focal infiltrates. Cold agglutinins were markedly elevated, and the patient responded to erythromycin. This radiographic pattern of reticulonodular interstitial disease is observed in 25% to 30% of patients with pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. (From Baltimore RS: Pneumonia.

This patient had a history of several bilateral pneumothoraces and had required bilateral pleurodesis in 1990. CT scan then demonstrated multiple bullae, and sputum cultures grew A. fumigatus. The patient had initially weakly and later strongly positive serum Aspergillus antibody tests (precipitins). This scan (2003) shows a mixture of thickand thin-walled cavities in both lungs (each marked with C), with a probable fungal ball (black arrow) protruding into the large cavity on the patient's right side (R). There is also considerable pleural thickening bilaterally."

After admission a bronchoscopy was carried out and sputum was aspirated from the left upper lobe bronchus. This was cultured in the laboratory and also viewed under the microscope and tuberculous bacilli (TB) were identified. A 68-year-old man came to his family physician complaining of discomfort when swallowing (dysphagia). The physician examined the patient and noted since his last visit he had lost approximately 18 lb over 6 months. Routine blood tests revealed the patient was anemic and he was referred to the gastroenterology unit. A diagnosis of esophageal cancer was made and the patient underwent a resection, which involved a chest and abdominal incision. After 4 years the patient remains well though still subject to follow-up."

The onset of streptococcal pharyngitis is often rapid and associated with prominent sore throat and moderate to high fever. Headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are frequent. In a typical, florid case, the pharynx is distinctly red. The tonsils are enlarged and covered with a yellow, blood-tinged exudate. There may be petechiae or doughnut-shapedlesions on the soft palate and posterior pharynx. The uvula may be red, stippled, and swollen. Anterior cervical lymph nodes are enlarged and tender to touch. Many children, however, present with only mild pharyngeal erythema without tonsillar exudate or cervical lymphadenitis. Conjunctivitis, cough, coryza, hoarseness, or ulcerations suggest a viral etiology. The diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis cannot be made on clinical features alone."

It is characterized by lymphadenopathy, fever, anemia, malaise, hepatosplenomegaly, and weakness. It is frequently associated with autoimmune diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis. Its most distinctive symptom is palatal edema, resulting from involvement of nodes in Waldeyer\u2019s ring, and this may progress to produce respiratory compromise. The diagnosis depends on the demonstration of an anomalous serum M component (often <20 g/L [<2 g/dL]) that reacts with anti-IgG but not anti\u2013light chain reagents. The M component is typically present in both serum and urine. Most of the paraproteins have been of the \u03b31 subclass, but other subclasses have been seen. The patients may have thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia, and nondiagnostic bone marrow that may show increased numbers of lymphocytes or plasma cells that do not stain for light chain. Patients usually have a rapid downhill course and die of"
