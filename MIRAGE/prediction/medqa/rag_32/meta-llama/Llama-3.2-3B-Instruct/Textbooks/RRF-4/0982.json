He reports that he worked in a naval shipyard for 10 years during his twenties. A CT scan of his chest shows diffuse thickening of the pleura and a diagnosis of mesothelioma is made.

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and answer in JSON format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to understand the relationship between mesothelioma and the given options. Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that affects the pleura, which is the lining surrounding the lungs. The patient's CT scan shows diffuse thickening of the pleura, which is consistent with mesothelioma. Now, let's analyze each option in relation to mesothelioma: Option A: Pneumothorax - While pneumothorax can occur in patients with pleural disease, it is not a direct complication of mesothelioma. However, patients with mesothelioma may develop pleural effusions, which can lead to pneumothorax. Option B: Pleural effusion - This is a common complication of mesothelioma. Pleural effusions occur when fluid accumulates in the pleural space, which can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath and chest pain. Option C: Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) - SIRS is a non-specific condition that can occur in response to various types of infections or inflammation. While mesothelioma can cause systemic symptoms, SIRS is not a direct complication of the disease. Option D: Bronchioalveolar carcinoma - This is a type of lung cancer, but it is not directly related to mesothelioma. Mesothelioma and bronchioalveolar carcinoma are two distinct types of lung cancers with different causes and risk factors. Based on the above analysis, the most likely complication to also be present in this patient with mesothelioma is pleural effusion. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" } ``` The final answer is B.

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Tachypnea and increased work of 1737 breathing result frequently in respiratory fatigue and ultimately in respiratory failure. Laboratory values are generally nonspecific and are primarily indicative of underlying clinical disorders. The chest radio-graph usually reveals alveolar and interstitial opacities involving at least three-quarters of the lung fields (Fig. 322-2). While characteristic for ARDS, these radiographic findings are not specific and can be indistinguishable from cardiogenic pulmonary edema (Chap. 326). Unlike the latter, however, the chest x-ray in ARDS rarely shows cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, or pulmonary vascular redistribution. Chest CT in ARDS reveals extensive heterogeneity of lung involvement (Fig. 322-4)."

Rosenthal, MD A 29-year-old Peruvian man presents with the incidental finding of a 10 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8-cm liver cyst on an abdominal com-puted tomography (CT) scan. The patient had noted 2 days of abdominal pain and fever, and his clinical evaluation and CT scan were consistent with appendicitis. His clinical find-ings resolved after laparoscopic appendectomy. The patient immigrated to the USA 10 years ago from a rural area of Peru where his family trades in sheepskins. His father and sister have undergone resection of abdominal masses, but details of their diagnoses are unavailable. What is your differential diagnosis? What are your diagnostic and therapeutic plans?"

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."
