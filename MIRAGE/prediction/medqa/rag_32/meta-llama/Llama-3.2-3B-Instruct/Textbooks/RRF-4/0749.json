The patient complains of pain in his jaw that is worse when he chews. He has a past medical history of insomnia and is currently taking alprazolam. His temperature is 98.2\u00b0F (36.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 157/98 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

These symptoms, combined with a past medical history of insomnia and current use of alprazolam, suggest a possible diagnosis of temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis), a condition that can cause headaches, jaw pain, and scalp tenderness, especially in older adults. The patient's symptoms are not improving with the current treatment, so a more definitive diagnostic test is needed. A CT head may not be the best initial choice as it may not detect the inflammation of the temporal arteries. IV steroids are often used to treat temporal arteritis, but they should be preceded by a definitive diagnosis. A lumbar puncture may not be appropriate as it can worsen the condition. Ibuprofen may provide some relief but is not a substitute for a definitive diagnosis and treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

All of our patients have been older than 55 years of age, most of them older than age 65. From a state of normal health, the patient develops an increasingly intense throbbing or nonthrobbing headache, often with superimposed sharp, stabbing pains. In a few patients the headache has had an almost explosive onset. The pain is usually unilateral, sometimes bilateral, and often localized to the site of the affected arteries in the scalp. The pain persists to some degree throughout the day and is particularly severe at night. It lasts for many months if untreated. The superficial temporal and other scalp arteries are frequently thickened and tender and without pulsation. Jaw claudication and ischemic nodules on the scalp, with ulceration of the overlying skin, have been described in severe cases."

Migraine often occurs several hours or a day following a period of intense activity and stress (\u201cweekend,\u201d or \u201cletdown\u201d migraine).

Pain usually appears gradually over a few hours before peak intensity is reached; occasionally, it is explosive in onset. The quality of pain is only seldom throbbing; it is almost invariably described as dull and boring, with superimposed episodic stabbing pains similar to the sharp pains that appear in migraine. Most patients can recognize that the origin of their head pain is superficial, external to the skull, rather than originating deep within the cranium (the pain site for migraineurs). Scalp tenderness is present, often to a marked degree; brushing the hair or resting the head on a pillow may be impossible because of pain."

In the case of headache, a detailed history following these lines will determine the diagnosis more often than will the physical examination or imaging. Nevertheless, a few aspects of the examination are worth emphasizing. For example, auscultation of the skull may rarely disclose a bruit (with large arteriovenous malformations); palpation may disclose the tender, hardened or elevated arteries of temporal arteritis; sensitive areas overlying a cranial metastasis or an inflamed paranasal sinus may be apparent; or there may be a tender occipital nerve. Examination of neck flexion may reveal meningitis; however, apart from such special instances, examination of the head itself, although necessary, seldom discloses the diagnosis."

            "content": "A patient may complain of very severe, transient cranial pain on coughing, sneezing, laughing heartily, lifting heavy objects including weight lifting, stooping, and straining at stool. Pain is usually felt in the front of the head, sometimes occipitally, and may be unilateral or bilateral. As a rule, it follows the initiating action within a second or two and lasts a few seconds to a few minutes. The pain is often described as having a bursting quality and may be of such severity as to cause the patient to cradle his head in his hands, thereby simulating the headache of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage."

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

Scalp tenderness is present, often to a marked degree; brushing the hair or resting the head on a pillow may be impossible because of pain.

            "content": "Headaches frequently follow a seizure, having been recorded in half of one large series of epileptic patients analyzed by Schon and Blau but the pain was infrequently severe. In migraineurs, the postseizure headache may reproduce a typical migraine attack. Experienced physicians are aware of many other conditions in which headache may be a principal symptom. These include fevers of any cause, carbon monoxide exposure, chronic lung disease with hypercapnia (headaches often nocturnal or early morning), sleep apnea, hypothyroidism, thrombocythemia, Cushing disease, withdrawal from corticosteroid medication or alcohol, mountain (altitude) sickness, exposure to nitrates, cyanotic heart disease, occasionally in adrenal insufficiency, and acute anemia with hemoglobin well below 10 g. No attempt is made here to discuss the symptomatic treatment of headache that may accompany these many medical conditions. Obviously, the guiding principle is to address the underlying disease."

Case 4: Hypoglycemia, Hyperketonemia, and Liver Dysfunction Patient Presentation: AK, a 59-year-old male with slurred speech, ataxia (loss of skeletal muscle coordination), and abdominal pain, was dropped off at the Emergency Department (ED). Focused History: AK is known to the ED staff from previous visits. He has a 6year history of chronic, excessive alcohol consumption. He is not known to take illicit drugs. At this ED visit, AK reports that he has been drinking heavily in the past day or so. He cannot recall having eaten anything in that time. There is evidence of recent vomiting, but no blood is apparent."
