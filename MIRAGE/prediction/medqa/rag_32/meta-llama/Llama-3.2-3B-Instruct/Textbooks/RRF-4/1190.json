    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the question: The patient has \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency, which makes him more susceptible to lung damage due to the unopposed action of neutrophil elastase. The warning from his physician suggests that continued cigarette smoking may worsen his condition. Cigarette smoking is known to increase the release of proteases, including neutrophil elastase, which can cause damage to the alveolar walls. The question asks for the factor released by both neutrophils and alveolar macrophages that is responsible for the patient's condition. Let's examine the options: A. Major Basic Protein: This is a protein released by neutrophils that has antimicrobial properties, but it's not directly related to the damage caused by unopposed elastase activity. B. Mucus: Mucus is a protective substance produced by goblet cells, but it's not a factor released by neutrophils and alveolar macrophages that causes damage. C. Surfactant: Surfactant is a substance that reduces surface tension in the lungs, but it's not related to the damage caused by elastase. D. Elastase: This is the correct answer. Neutrophil elastase is a protease released by neutrophils that breaks down elastin, a critical component of the alveolar walls. In the presence of \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency, elastase can cause unopposed damage to the alveolar walls, leading to emphysema. Both neutrophils and alveolar macrophages can release elastase, which contributes to the patient's condition.

About 1% of all patients with emphysema have this defect. \u03b11-anti-trypsin, normally present in serum, tissue fluids, and macrophages, is a major inhibitor of proteases (particularly elastase) secreted by neutrophils during inflammation. \u03b11-anti-trypsin is encoded by a gene in the proteinase inhibitor (Pi) locus on chromosome 14. The Pi locus is polymorphic, and approximately 0.012% of the U.S. population is homozygous for the Z allele, a genotype that is associated with markedly decreased serum levels of \u03b11-anti-trypsin.

It has been proposed that inflammatory cells in the small airways release proteases and other mediators, such as reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines, that damage the larger-airway walls. Furthermore, the ongoing inflammatory process in the smaller airways results in airflow obstruction. It is thought that antiproteases, such as \u03b11 antitrypsin, play an important role in neutralizing the damaging effects of neutrophil elastase and in enhancing bacterial killing.

            "content": "Fig. 13.2 ). As early as 30 minutes after an acute insult, there is increased synthesis of interleukin 8 (IL-8), a potent neutrophil chemotactic and activating agent, by pulmonary macrophages. Release of IL-8 and other factors, such as IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), leads to endothelial activation and sequestration and activation of neutrophils in pulmonary capillaries. Neutrophils are thought to have an important role in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Histologic examination of lungs early in the disease process shows increased numbers of neutrophils within the vascular space, the interstitium, and the alveoli. Activated neutrophils release a variety of products (e.g., reactive oxygen species, proteases) that damage the alveolar epithelium and endothelium. The assault on the endothelium and epithelium causes vascular leakiness and loss of surfactant that render the alveolar unit unable to expand. Of note, the destructive forces unleashed by neutrophils can be counteracted by an"

They are initiated by autophosphorylation of select tyrosine residues in their receptors. C. They are mediated by binding to adrenergic receptors, which are a class of nuclear receptors. D. They result in the activation of glycogen and triacylglycerol synthesis. Q3. NE bound to certain receptors causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. Why might NE be used clinically in the treatment of septic shock? Case 5: Sun Sensitivity Patient Presentation: AZ is a 6-year-old boy who is being evaluated for freckle-like areas of hyperpigmentation on his face, neck, forearms, and lower legs. Focused History: AZ\u2019s father reports that the boy has always been quite sensitive to the sun. His skin turns red (erythema) and his eyes hurt (photophobia) if he is exposed to the sun for any period of time."

Goblet cells not only increase in number but in extent through the bronchial tree. Bronchi also undergo squamous metaplasia, predisposing to carcinogenesis and disrupting mucociliary clearance. Although not as prominent as in asthma, patients may have smooth-muscle hypertrophy and bronchial hyperreactivity leading to airflow limitation. Neutrophil influx has been associ-1701 ated with purulent sputum of upper respiratory tract infections. Independent of its proteolytic activity, neutrophil elastase is among the most potent secretagogues identified."

            "content": "Emphysema is classified into distinct pathologic types, the most important being centriacinar and panacinar. Centriacinar emphysema, the type most frequently associated with cigarette smoking, is characterized by enlarged air spaces found (initially) in association with respiratory bronchioles. Centriacinar emphysema is usually most prominent in the upper lobes and superior segments of lower lobes and is often quite focal. Panacinar emphysema refers to abnormally large air spaces evenly distributed within and across acinar units. Panacinar emphysema is usually observed in patients with \u03b11AT deficiency, which has a predilection for the lower lobes. Persistent reduction in forced expiratory flow rates is the most typical finding in COPD. Increases in the residual volume and the residual volume/total lung capacity ratio, nonuniform distribution of ventilation, and ventilation-perfusion mismatching also occur."

Familial lung fibrosis is characterized by several patterns of interstitial pneumonia, including nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, and UIP. Older age, male sex, and a history of cigarette smoking have been identified as risk factors for familial lung fibro-1709 sis. Family associations (with an autosomal dominant pattern) have been identified in tuberous sclerosis and neurofibromatosis. Familial clustering has been identified increasingly in sarcoidosis. The genes responsible for several rare ILDs have been identified, i.e., alveolar microlithiasis, Gaucher disease, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, and Niemann-Pick disease, along with the genes for surfactant homeostasis in pulmonary alveolar"
