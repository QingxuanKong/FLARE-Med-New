    "question": "A 27-year-old male presents to the psychiatrist requesting help with his compulsions as they are interfering with his life. He explains that he has this fear that something terrible will happen to his house if he does not check every appliance, outlet, window and door lock, faucet, and light fixture before he leaves. He states that he must check everything 7 times in a specific order and if he goes out of order he must start from the beginning and perform it all over. He has recently been fired from his job because he is always late and lost his fiancee as she could not deal with his habits anymore. The physician explained that cognitive-behavioral therapy may be of assistance and also prescribed clomipramine. Which of the following is the mechanism of reaction of clomipramine?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which is characterized by unwanted and intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). The patient's fear of something terrible happening to his house if he does not check every appliance, outlet, window and door lock, faucet, and light fixture before he leaves is an example of an obsession. The specific order in which he checks these items is an example of a compulsion. The patient's behavior is interfering with his life, causing him to be late for work and lose his fiancee. The physician's suggestion of cognitive-behavioral therapy and clomipramine is a common treatment approach for OCD. Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that is specifically used to treat OCD. The mechanism of action of clomipramine is to block the reuptake of serotonin, which is a neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation and obsessive-compulsive behaviors. By blocking the reuptake of serotonin, clomipramine increases the levels of serotonin in the synaptic cleft, which can help reduce the symptoms of OCD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

Examples are repeated checking of the gas jets or the locks on doors, adjusting articles of clothing, repeated hand washing, using a clean handkerchief to wipe objects that have been touched by others, tasting foods in specific ways, and touching or arranging objects in a particular sequence. The most common of these obsessions and compulsions center around contamination concerns that lead to repeated hand washing or bathing. Other obsessions and compulsions can be identified as clusters of thoughts that derive from the above-mentioned concern about harm to oneself or to others and consequent checking on others. Less common clusters involve excessive focus on symmetry, precision, and ordering, and on saving and hoarding."

The correct conclusion can usually be reached by keeping these illnesses in mind as one elicits the history from patient and family. Difficulty arises when symptoms of the psychiatric illness are so inconspicuous as not to be appreciated; one comes then to suspect the diagnosis only by having eliminated the common medical causes. Repeated observation may bear out the existence of an anxiety state or gloomy mood. Reassurance in combination with a therapeutic trial of antidepressant drugs may suppress symptoms of which the patient was barely aware, thus clarifying the diagnosis. The best that can be done is to assist the patient in adjusting to the adverse circumstances that have brought him under medical surveillance."

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian"

The patient\u2019s temperature was normal. He explained that the episode had occurred following a birthday party at which he had participated in an ice cream\u2013eating contest. The patient reported prior episodes of a similar nature following ingestion of a significant amount of dairy products. This clinical picture is most probably due to a deficiency in the activity of: A. isomaltase. B. lactase. C. pancreatic \u03b1-amylase. D. salivary \u03b1-amylase. E. sucrase. Correct answer = B. The physical symptoms suggest a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for carbohydrate degradation. The symptoms observed following the ingestion of dairy products suggest that the patient is deficient in lactase as a result of the age-dependent reduction in expression of the enzyme."

To perform these tasks in the absence of the tool or utensil is always more demanding because the patient must mentally formulate a plan of action rather than engage in a habitual motor sequence. The patient may fail to carry out a commanded or suggested activity (e.g., to take a pen out of his pocket), yet a few minutes later he may perform the same motor sequence automatically."
