    "question": "A 67-year-old man with peripheral neuropathy comes to the physician for a follow-up examination after the results of serum protein electrophoresis showed monoclonal gammopathy. A complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells. Further analysis shows that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. Which of the following best describes this class of immune cells?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the context of the scenario provided. The patient has peripheral neuropathy and monoclonal gammopathy, and a bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells. The key piece of information is that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. This suggests that the immune system is trying to evade the immune response. The proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that can lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. Based on this information, we can evaluate the options provided. Option A, bone marrow-derived macrophages, do not play a direct role in preventing the proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells by downregulating class I MHC molecules. Option B, CD4+ T lymphocytes, are a type of T cell that plays a central role in the immune response, but they do not directly prevent the proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells by downregulating class I MHC molecules. Option D, band neutrophils, are a type of white blood cell that is involved in the innate immune response, but they do not play a role in preventing the proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells by downregulating class I MHC molecules. Option C, natural killer (NK) cells, are a type of lymphocyte that can recognize and lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. NK cells are also known to regulate the proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells by downregulating class I MHC molecules, which prevents the recognition and destruction of these cells by the immune system. This is a key mechanism to prevent autoimmunity and cancer. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Natural killer cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

It should be emphasized that routine serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) fails to detect the majority of these paraproteins; immunoelectrophoresis (IEP) or the more sensitive immunofixation testing is required. The bone marrow aspirate shows a normal or only mildly increased proportion of plasma cells, which are the source of the paraprotein and the plasma cells are not morphologically atypical as they are in myeloma. Insofar as myeloma becomes manifest in perhaps one-quarter of patients many years after the gammopathy has been recognized, the condition is termed monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), although the older term benign monoclonal gammopathy is less cumbersome."

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is applied to patients without signs or symptoms who have small to moderately large M components in their blood. MGUS is very common in older adults and has a low but constant rate of transformation to a symptomatic monoclonal gammopathy, most often multiple myeloma. Primary or immunocyte-associated amyloidosis results from a monoclonal proliferation of plasma cells secreting light chains that are deposited as amyloid.

A more direct relationship was established by the finding of antiperipheral nerve antibodies in some patients who had such a protein in their blood. This category of polyneuropathy is associated with a monoclonal or sometimes polyclonal excess of immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM, or IgA, rarely others, mainly with a kappa light chain components; see Kyle and Dyck). These cases are far more common than those caused by a malignant plasma cell disorder.

X-ray will show multiple punched out lytic lesions. Bone scans may be cold in about 30% of cases. The SPEP, UPEP, and bone marrow biopsy are helpful in diagnosis. Histology will show atypical plasma cells with eccentric nuclei, its appearance resembles a \u201csignet ring (Fig. 43-49).\u201d Plasmacytoma is a solitary tumor with a negative bone marrow biopsy, usually treated with radiation to the lesion. Myeloma is treated with bisphosphonates, chemo-therapy, stem cell transplantation, and radiation therapy.

Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate are required to establish the diagnosis. Marrow shows abnormal plasma cells, classically with Dutcher bodies (PASIgM deposits around the nucleus). Serum and urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation are also used. Excess immunoglobulin is removed with plasmapheresis; underlying lymphoma is treated with chemotherapy. A generic term referring to extracellular deposition of protein fibrils. There are many different kinds of amyloidosis, involving different types of deposited fibrils with varying etiologies (see Table 2.7-9). Classically a disease of the elderly."

            "content": "The polyneuropathy associated with monoclonal gammopathy affects mainly, but not exclusively, males in the sixth and seventh decades of life. The onset is insidious over weeks and months or more, with numbness and paresthesias of the feet and then of the hands, followed by a relatively symmetrical weakness and slight wasting of these muscles. In some patients, sensory signs predominate. The tendon reflexes, eventually lost or diminished, may be preserved in the early phases of the illness. The course is usually slowly progressive, sometimes static after a year or so, and rarely remitting and relapsing. The CSF typically shows an elevation of the protein in the range of 50 to 100 mg/dL, and this is not due to passive diffusion of the excess paraprotein into the CSF."

Patients with monoclonal gammopathy should also be referred to a hematologist for consideration of a bone marrow biopsy. An oral glucose tolerance test is indicated in patients with painful sensory neuropathies even if FBS and HbA1c are normal, 2677 as the test is abnormal in about one-third of such patients. In addition to the above tests, patients with a mononeuropathy multiplex pattern of involvement should have a vasculitis workup, including antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), cryoglobulins, hepatitis serology, Western blot for Lyme disease, HIV, and occasionally a cytomegalovirus (CMV) titer."

Purpura, primarily of the lower extremities, and hemorrhagic infarcts of the fingers, toes, and ears are seen in these patients. Exacerbations of disease activity can follow cold exposure or an increase in serum viscosity. Biopsy specimens show precipitates of the cryoglobulin within dermal vessels. Similar deposits have been found in the lung, brain, and renal glomeruli. Patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura can also have hemorrhagic infarcts as a result of intravascular thromboses. Additional signs include microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and fluctuating neurologic abnormalities, especially headaches and confusion."
