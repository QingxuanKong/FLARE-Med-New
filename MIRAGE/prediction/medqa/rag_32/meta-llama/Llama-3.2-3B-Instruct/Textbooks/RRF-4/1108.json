    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the long-term post-surgery outcome in the patient with a repaired calcaneus, we need to consider the anatomy and function of the calcaneus bone and its role in foot movement. The calcaneus bone plays a crucial role in foot movement, particularly in plantarflexion (pointing the foot downwards) and inversion (turning the foot inward). The patient underwent surgery with 11 screws to repair the calcaneus fracture. The repair is likely to be stable, but the long-term outcome depends on the quality of the repair, the patient's overall health, and the presence of any complications. The patient's ability to plantarflex his foot is likely to be affected by the repair, as the calcaneus plays a key role in this movement. The other options are less likely to be affected by the repair. Inversion and eversion are movements that do not primarily involve the calcaneus bone, and dorsiflexion (lifting the foot upwards) is also less likely to be affected by the repair. Therefore, the most likely long-term post-surgery outcome is that the patient will have pain while plantarflexing his foot.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"} The final answer is A.",

The Bohler angle, which is normally between 20\u00b0 and 40\u00b0, would be reduced or even flattened. CT scans are useful to better visualize the fracture pattern.

In cases where there significant anterolisthesis (subaxial cervical jumped or perched facets), reduction of the fracture may be important for both decompression and stabili-zation. However, in some cases, reduction of the fracture may not be sufficient for decompression, and further decompressive surgery may still be needed.50Several controversial topics require consideration here. First, the timing of surgery has been a controversial topic. In the past, it has been suggested that patients with incomplete injury, or a deteriorating exam warrant emergent decompres-sion, whereas patients with complete injuries can undergo sur-gery in a nonemergent manner. It is important to appreciate the risks of taking a medically unstable patient to surgery, such as a polytrauma patient with hemorrhagic shock or a complete spinal cord injury patient in neurogenic shock.

He denied drug or laxative abuse and was on no medications. Past medical history was unremarkable, with no history of neuromuscular disease. Family history was notable for a sister with thyroid disease. Physical examination was notable only for reduced deep tendon reflexes.

The majority of fractures can heal well with immobilization, which stabilizes the fracture while new bone forms at the fracture site. Methods of immobilization can vary and depend on the fracture being treated. The most common tool used in orthopedics to treat fractures is immobilization with a splint, cast, or braces, and their proper application is important to successfully treat the injury without causing additional problems. A successful splint contains adequate padding on the underlying skin, particularly over bony prominences, to prevent pressure or burns that can be caused by plaster. Splints, which are not circumferential, are preferred for acute injuries because they allow room for swell-ing that inevitably occurs after a fracture. The splint may later be changed to a cast as the"

A Salter-Harris type V fracture is a crushing injury to the physis. Type III and type IV involve the joint.Treatment of growth plate fracture requires anatomic reduction of the fragments, closed or open. If internal fixation is used, avoid placing the hardware across the growth plate to minimize the chance of injury and premature growth plate clo-sure. When hardware needs to be placed across the physis, it should be limited to smooth K-wires. The most common com-plication is a physeal arrest resulting in leg length discrepancy (LLD) and/or angular deformity. Complete arrest will lead to LLD. Partial arrest will result in angulation in the area of the bar, bridge, and fusion. If less than 50% of the physis is involved and the patient has two years of growth remaining, the bar is usually resected with interposition of fat"

In a hyperflexion injury, the supe-rior facet can \u201cjump\u201d over the inferior facet of the level above if the joint capsule is torn. Hyperflexion/rotation can cause a unilateral jumped facet, whereas hyperflexion/distraction leads to bilateral jumped facets. Patients with unilateral injury usually are neurologically intact. Those with bilateral injury, however, typically suffer from spinal cord damage, since the anteropos-terior diameter of the spinal canal is compromised by bilateral injury, leading to spinal cord compression (Fig. 42-11).Thoracolumbar The thoracic spine is stabilized significantly by the rib cage. The lumbar spine has comparatively large vertebrae. Thus, the"

All injuries should be evaluated for nearby wounds (open) that may introduce bacteria into the fracture site or joint space.Once the initial force on the fracture ceases, the tendons passing beyond the fracture site provide the principal deforming force. Their force is directed proximally and, to a lesser extent, volarly. Based on this, the stability of a fracture can be deter-mined by the orientation of the fracture with respect to the shaft of the bone. Transverse fractures are typically stable. Oblique fractures typically shorten. Spiral fractures typically rotate as they shorten and thus require surgical treatment.Fractures of the tuft of the distal phalanx are common. Catching of a finger in a closing door is a common causative mechanism. These fractures are often nondisplaced and do not require treatment beyond protection of the distal phalanx from additional trauma while the fracture heals.Displaced transverse fractures of the phalanges can usu-ally be reduced"

However, the long-term study suggested that the stability was not indefinite as calcium levels tended to rise in years 13 to 15. In addition, the study also demonstrated that bone density mea-surements remained stable for 8 to 10 years, but cortical bone density worsened after year 10. More concerning was the fact that 60% of patients lost >10% of their BMD over the 15-year observation period. Furthermore, whether patients met the 2002 guidelines for surgery did not appear to predict the risk of pro-gressive disease, with 40% of patients undergoing follow-up eventually needing surgery. Although there are no randomized trials, registry data also suggest that fracture risk is increased for PHPT up to 10 years prior to diagnosis and treatment.Medical options for treating PHPT and its complications include"
