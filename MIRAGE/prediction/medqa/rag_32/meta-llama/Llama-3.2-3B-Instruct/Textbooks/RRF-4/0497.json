At the clinic, her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse is 72/min, respirations are 15/min, and the temperature is 36.5\u2103 (97.7\u2109). On physical examination, illumination of the left eye results in bilateral pupillary constriction while illumination of the right eye results in a mild bilateral pupillary dilation. Fundoscopic examination shows optic disk swelling in the right eye. The color vision test shows decreased perception in the right eye. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Specific additional history should be obtained regarding which of the following?",

The key clinical findings are the relative afferent pupillary defect (MARCUS GUNN PUPIL DEFECT) and optic disk swelling, which are indicative of optic neuritis. The relative afferent pupillary defect is a sign of impaired vision in the affected eye, while the optic disk swelling is a sign of inflammation of the optic nerve. To determine the underlying cause of these symptoms, it is essential to obtain additional history, particularly regarding the patient's sexual history, as optic neuritis can be associated with multiple sclerosis, which can be triggered by certain infections, including those acquired through high-risk sexual behavior. Therefore, the specific additional history that should be obtained is regarding high-risk sexual behavior.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

            "content": "Philip J. Rosenthal, MD A 5-year-old American girl presents with a 1-week history of intermittent chills, fever, and sweats. She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

A 22-year-old woman presents to her college medical clinic complaining of a 2-week history of vaginal discharge. She denies any fever or abdominal pain but does report vaginal bleeding after sexual intercourse. When questioned about her sexual activity, she reports having vaginal intercourse, at times unprotected, with two men in the last 6 months.

The small branch of the middle meningeal artery was ligated and the patient spent a few days in the intensive care unit. Fortunately the patient made an uneventful recovery. A 35-year-old man was involved in a fight and sustained a punch to the right orbit. He came to the emergency department with double vision. The double vision was only in one plane. Examination of the orbits revealed that when the patient was asked to look upward the right eye was unable to move superiorly when adducted. There was some limitation in general eye movement. Assessment of the lateral rectus muscle (abducent nerve [VI]), superior oblique muscle (trochlear nerve [IV]), and the rest of the eye muscles (oculomotor nerve [III]) was otherwise unremarkable. The patient underwent a CT scan."

He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

Evaluation of the head includes examination for injuries to the scalp, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, facial bones, and intracra-nial structures. Palpation of the head is done to identify scalp lacerations, which should be evaluated for depth, and pres-ence of associated depressed or open skull fractures. The eye examination includes not only pupillary size and reactivity, but also examination for visual acuity and for hemorrhage within the globe. Ocular entrapment, caused by orbital fractures with impingement of the ocular muscles, is evident when the patient cannot move his or her eyes through an entire range of motion. It is important to perform the eye examination early because significant orbital swelling may prevent later evaluation. A lat-eral canthotomy may be needed to relieve periorbital pressure. The tympanic membrane is examined to identify hemotym-panum, otorrhea, or rupture, which"

On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction.
