    "question": "A 43-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia, currently controlled with medication, comes in for an appointment with his internist. He is concerned about abnormal discharge from both nipples over the past 3 months. The fluid is white, and he wonders if it could be milk. On further review of systems, he endorses a diminished sexual drive. The physician suspects that one of the patient's medications may be the culprit for these symptoms. Which of the following medications is NOT likely to be the cause?",

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing abnormal discharge from both nipples, which is a symptom of galactorrhea, and a diminished sexual drive. This combination of symptoms, in the context of a history of schizophrenia, suggests a possible side effect of antipsychotic medication. The question asks which medication is NOT likely to be the cause of these symptoms. We need to evaluate the potential side effects of each medication option. Haloperidol and fluphenazine are first-generation antipsychotics that can cause hyperprolactinemia, which can lead to galactorrhea and sexual dysfunction. Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that can actually treat hyperprolactinemia, so it is unlikely to be the cause of these symptoms. Risperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic that can also cause hyperprolactinemia, but it is less likely to cause significant side effects compared to first-generation antipsychotics. Therefore, the medication that is NOT likely to be the cause of these symptoms is bromocriptine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

For this reason, a primary care provider is often ideally suited to initiate the evaluation. However, a significant percentage of men experience ED and remain undiagnosed unless specifically questioned about this issue. By far the two most common reasons for underreporting of ED are patient embarrassment and perceptions of physicians\u2019 inattention to the disease.

            "content": "A 19-year-old college sophomore began to show paranoid traits. She became convinced that her roommate was listening in on her phone conversations and planning to alter her essays. She became reclusive and spent most of her time locked in her room. After much difficulty, her teachers convinced her to be seen by the student health service. It was believed she was beginning to show signs of schizophrenia and she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where she was started on antipsychotic medications. While in the hospital, she had a generalized seizure which prompted her transfer to our service. Her spinal fluid analysis showed 10 lymphocytes per mL3. She was found to have an anti-NMDA receptor antibody, which prompted an ultrasound examination of the pelvis. The left ovary was thought to show a benign cyst. Because of the neurological syndrome, the ovarian cyst was resected and revealed a microscopic ovarian teratoma. The neuropsychiatric syndrome resolved. She has since graduated and"

            "content": "The mental examination of the patient with hysteria demonstrates a lack of precision in relating the details of the illness. Questions regarding the chief complaint usually elicit a narration of a series of incidents or problems, many of which prove to have little or no relevance to the question. Memory defects (amnesic gaps) are apparent while the history is being taken; the patient appears to have forgotten important segments of the history, some of which he had clearly described in the past and are part of the medical record. The description of symptoms is dramatic and not in accord with the facts as elicited from other members of the family. Often, a rather casual demeanor is manifest, the patient insisting that everything in her life is quite normal and controlled, when, in fact, her medical record is checkered with instances of dramatic and unexplained illness. This calm attitude toward a turbulent illness and seemingly disabling physical signs is so common that it has been"

One of our patients, functioning normally in every other way, carried the unshakable idea that people were sneaking into her house at night when she was away and rearranging the furniture. She functioned extremely well through her eighties but had a schizophrenic sister. Also, several physicians under our care have woven extensive delusional ideas around tenuous scientific theories; these ideas have applied to personal life events as well as physical and psychologic symptoms and in some cases have resulted in bizarre regimens of self-medication. Rarely, a patient comes to the hospital for some other medical reason and it is found that he or she has been living quietly in the community, preoccupied with a bizarre delusional system yet appearing neither depressed nor schizophrenic. Certainly one often sees delusions in depressed patients who decompensate as their depression deepens."

The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy. One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC). He undergoes surgical resection and is found to have high-risk stage III CRC with five positive lymph nodes. After surgery, he feels entirely well with no symptoms. Of note, he has no other illnesses. What is this patient\u2019s overall prognosis? Based on his prognosis, what"
