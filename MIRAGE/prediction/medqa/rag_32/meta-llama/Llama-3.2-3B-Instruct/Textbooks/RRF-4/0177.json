The patient was a professional athlete who retired at age 50. He also notes morning stiffness in his joints that lasts approx. 50 minutes. He denies joint swelling, color changes in his digits, dryness of mucous membranes, and constitutional symptoms such as fever and chills. On physical exam, the physician notes several non-tender nodules on the left 1st, 3rd, and 4th distal interphalangeal joints. There is also tenderness with palpation at the base of both thumbs.

The patient's history as a professional athlete and age of retirement at 50 also support this diagnosis. The absence of joint swelling, color changes in digits, dryness of mucous membranes, and constitutional symptoms such as fever and chills also help to rule out other conditions like gout and fibromyalgia. The presence of bilateral knee enlargement and crepitus on passive range of motion further supports the diagnosis of RA. Ankylosing spondylitis is less likely given the lack of spinal involvement and the presence of peripheral joint involvement. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The presenting symptoms of RA typically result from inflammation of the joints, tendons, and bursae. Patients often complain of early morning joint stiffness lasting more than 1 h that eases with physical activity. The earliest involved joints are typically the small joints of the hands and feet. The initial pattern of joint involvement may be monoarticular, oligoarticular (\u22644 joints), or polyarticular (>5 joints), usually in a symmetric distribution.

The locale and level of pain elicited by palpation or movement should be quantified. One standard would be to count the number of tender joints on palpation of 28 easily examined joints (proximal interphalangeals, metacarpophalangeals, wrists, elbows, shoulders, and knees). Similarly, the number of swollen joints (0\u201328) can be counted and recorded. Careful examination should distinguish between true articular swelling (caused by bony hypertrophy, synovial effusion or proliferation) and nonarticular (or periarticular) involvement, which usually extends beyond the normal joint margins. Synovial effusion can be distinguished from synovial hypertrophy or bony hypertrophy by palpation or specific maneuvers.

Inflammatory arthritis is likely if there is prolonged morning stiffness and many other joints are affected. Bursitis occurs commonly around knees and hips. A physical examination should focus on whether tenderness is over the joint line (at the junction of the two bones around which the joint is articulating) or is outside of it. Anserine bursitis, medial and distal to the knee, is an extremely common cause of chronic knee pain that may respond to a glucocorticoid injection. Prominent nocturnal pain in the absence of end-stage OA merits a distinct workup. For hip pain, OA can be detected by loss of internal rotation on passive movement, and pain isolated to an area lateral to the hip joint usually reflects the presence of trochanteric bursitis. No blood tests are routinely indicated for workup of patients with OA unless symptoms and signs suggest inflammatory arthritis."

Several articular features distinguish PsA from other joint disorders;such hallmark featuresinclude dactylitis and enthesitis.Dactylitis occurs in >30%; enthesitis and tenosynovitis are also common and are probably present in most patients, although often not appreciated on physical examination. Shortening of digits because of underlying osteolysis is particularly characteristic of PsA (Fig. 384-3), and there is a much greater tendency than in RA for both fibrous and bony ankylosis of small joints. Rapid ankylosis of one or more proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints early in the course of disease is not uncommon. Back and neck pain and stiffness are also common in PsA."

Pain, aggravated by movement, is accompanied by swelling and tenderness. Extraarticular manifestations include rheumatoid nodules, vasculitis, and pleuropulmonary symptoms. Other complaints are fatigue, anorexia, and depression. he American College of Rheumatology criteria for rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis are shown in Table 59-7. A score of 6 or greater ulills the requirements for definitive diagnosis."

These patterns frequently coexist, and the pattern that persists chronically often differs from thatofthe initialpresentation. A simpler scheme in recent use contains three patterns: oligoarthritis, polyarthritis, and axial arthritis."

These joints are also often affected in the other patterns of PsA. Approximately 30% of patients have asymmetric oligoarthritis. This pattern commonly involves a knee or another large joint with a few small joints in the fingers or toes, often with dactylitis. Symmetric polyarthritis occurs in about 40% of PsA patients at presentation. It may be indistinguishable from RA in terms of the joints involved, but other features characteristic of PsA are usually also present. Almost any peripheral joint can be involved. Axial arthropathy without peripheral involvement is found in about 5% of PsA patients. It may be clinically indistinguishable from idiopathic AS, although more neck involvement and less thoracolumbar spinal involvement are characteristic,andnail changesarenot found inidiopathic AS.Asmall percentage of PsA patients have arthritis"

Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

The patient or family will describe an acute onset of pain in the groin/hip, anterior thigh, or knee. Irritation of the obturator nerve can cause referred pain in the thigh and knee when the pathology is at the hip. Patients with transient synovitis are often afebrile, walk with a painful limp, and have normal to minimally elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate compared with bacterial diseases of the hip (Table 199-1). Table 197-3 lists the differential diagnosis of a limping child. Anteroposterior and frog-leg radiographs of the hip are usually normal. Ultrasonography may reveal a joint effusion. It is mandatory to rule out septic arthritis in the presence of effusion with a joint aspiration and cell count."
