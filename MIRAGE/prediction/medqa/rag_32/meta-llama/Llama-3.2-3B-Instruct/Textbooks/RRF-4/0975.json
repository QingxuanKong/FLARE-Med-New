    "question": "A 28-year-old man reports to his physician that he is having second thoughts about his long-term compatibility with his wife ever since they relocated to a new city. He admits that he has noticed himself flirting with some of the female co-workers at his new workplace. When he goes on a dinner date with his wife after work one evening, he accuses her of giving their waiter flirtatious looks and asks her whether she has been cheating on him or trying to spend time with other men.

The man is having second thoughts about his long-term compatibility with his wife and has noticed himself flirting with female co-workers. He accuses his wife of giving flirtatious looks to the waiter on a dinner date, which suggests that he is attributing his own behavior to his wife. This indicates that he is not taking responsibility for his own actions and is instead blaming his wife for his own behavior. This behavior is a classic example of the psychological defense mechanism known as projection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Minor slights arouse major hostility, and the hostile feelings persist for a long time. Because they are constantly vigilant to the harmful intentions of others, they very often feel that their way. They are quick to counterattack and react with anger to perceived insults (Criterion A6). Individuals with this disorder may be pathologically jealous, often suspecting that their spouse or sexual partner is unfaithful without any adequate justification (Criterion A7). They may gather trivial and circumstantial \"evidence\u201d to support their jealous beliefs. They want to maintain complete control of intimate relationships to avoid being betrayed and may constantly question and challenge the whereabouts, actions, intentions, and fi- delity of their spouse or partner."

For example, an individual with this disor- der may misinterpret an honest mistake by a store clerk as a deliberate attempt to short- change, or view a casual humorous remark by a co-worker as a serious character attack. Compliments are often misinterpreted (e.g., a compliment on a new acquisition is mis- interpreted as a criticism for selfishness; a compliment on an accomplishment is misinter- preted as an attempt to coerce more and better performance). They may view an offer of help as a criticism that they are not doing well enough on their own."

His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"
