The patient states that she has noticed a pink tinge to her urine as well. Of note, she has not had any fevers, but endorses several months of fatigue and constipation. The patient was previously healthy except for mild untreated hypertension. On exam, her temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/84 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 12/min. On further workup, the patient is found to have calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis with hypercalciuria. Blood studies demonstrate increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) and hypercalcemia. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely cause of the patient's condition, we need to analyze the provided documents and identify the key points that are relevant to the patient's presentation. The patient presents with left flank pain radiating to the abdomen and groin, which is a common symptom of nephrolithiasis, particularly calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. The patient also reports a pink tinge to her urine, which is consistent with the presence of blood in the urine. The patient has a history of fatigue and constipation, which are non-specific symptoms that can be associated with various conditions, including hyperparathyroidism. The patient's blood studies demonstrate hypercalciuria, increased parathyroid hormone (PTH), and hypercalcemia. These laboratory findings are consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism, which is characterized by an overproduction of PTH, leading to hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. However, we need to consider the possibility of secondary hyperparathyroidism, which can also cause hypercalciuria and hypercalcemia, particularly in the context of chronic kidney disease or renal insufficiency. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is a less likely possibility, as it typically occurs in patients with chronic kidney disease, and the patient's kidney function is not mentioned to be impaired. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism is not a likely possibility, as it is a rare genetic disorder that affects the PTH receptor, leading to hypocalcemia, not hypercalcemia. Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory findings, and medical history, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is primary hyperparathyroidism, which is consistent with the presence of hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia, and increased PTH levels. The answer is A. Primary hyperparathyroidism.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"A\"",

The elevation of circulating hormone usually leads to hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. There is great variation in the manifestations. Patients may present with multiple signs and symptoms, including recurrent nephrolithiasis, peptic ulcers, mental changes, and, less frequently, extensive bone resorption. However, with greater awareness of the disease and wider use of multiphasic screening tests, including measurements of blood calcium, the diagnosis is frequently made in patients who have no symptoms and minimal, if any, signs of the disease other than hypercalcemia and elevated levels of PTH. The manifestations may be subtle, and the disease may have a benign course for many years or a lifetime. This milder form of the disease is usually termed asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism. Rarely,"

Patients may have asymptomatic hypercalcemia or vague symptoms associated with hypercalcemia (e.g., polyuria, polydipsia, constipation, malaise, or dyspepsia). Nephrolithiasis and osteitis fibrosa cystica (less commonly) may also occur. Biochemical investigations reveal hypercalcemia, usually in association with elevated circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) (Table 408-3). The hypercalcemia is usually mild, and severe hypercalcemia or parathyroid cancer is a rare occurrence. Additional differences in the primary hyperparathyroidism of patients with MEN 1, as opposed to those without MEN 1, include an earlier age at onset (20\u201325 years vs 55 years) and an equal male-to-female ratio (1:1 vs 1:3).

While the term hypercalciuria is often used, there is no widely accepted cutoff that distinguishes between normal and abnormal urine calcium excretion. In fact, the relation between urine calcium and stone risk appears to be continuous; thus the use of an arbitrary threshold should be avoided. Levels of urine calcium excretion are higher in individuals with a history of nephrolithiasis; however, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Greater gastrointestinal calcium absorption is one important contributor, and greater bone turnover (with a resultant reduction in bone mineral density) may be another. Primary renal calcium loss, with lower serum calcium concentrations and elevated serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) (and a normal 25-hydroxy vitamin D level), is rare."

If the stone lodges in the upper part of the ureter, pain may radiate anteriorly; if the stone is in the lower part of the ureter, pain can radiate to the ipsilateral testicle in men or the ipsilateral labium in women.

Reductions in both glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow can occur, both in acute and in prolonged hypercalcemia. Eventually, uncontrolled hypercalcemia leads to severe tubulointerstitial damage and overt renal failure. Abdominal x-rays may demonstrate nephrocalcinosis as well as nephrolithiasis, the latter due to the hypercalciuria that often accompanies hypercalcemia. Treatment consists of reducing the serum calcium concentration toward normal and correcting the primary abnormality of calcium metabolism (Chap. 424). Renal dysfunction of acute hypercalcemia may be completely reversible. Gradual progressive renal insufficiency related to chronic hypercalcemia, however, may not improve even with correction of the calcium disorder."

The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

The PTH level should be measured if indicated by high-normal or elevated serum and urine calcium concentrations. Often, 25-hydroxy vitamin D is measured in concert with PTH to investigate the possible role of secondarily elevated PTH levels in the setting of vitamin D insufficiency. The urinalysis, including examination of the sediment, can provide useful information. In individuals with asymptomatic residual renal stones, red and white blood cells are frequently present in urine. If there is concern about the possibility of an infection, a urine culture should be performed. The sediment may also reveal crystals (Fig. 342-1), which may help identify the stone type and also provide prognostic information, as crystalluria is a strong risk factor for new stone formation."

A general evaluation that includes complete blood count, serum and 24-h urine calcium, renal and hepatic function tests, and a 25(OH)D level is useful for identifying selected secondary causes of low bone mass, particularly for women with fractures or very low Z-scores. An elevated serum calcium level suggests hyperparathyroidism or malignancy, whereas a reduced serum calcium level may reflect malnutrition and osteomalacia. In the presence of hypercalcemia, a serum PTH level differentiates between hyperparathyroidism (PTH\u2191) and malignancy (PTH\u2193), and a high PTHrP level can help document the presence of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (Chap. 424). A low urine calcium (<50 mg/24 h) suggests osteomalacia, malnutrition, or malabsorption; a high urine calcium (>300 mg/24 h) is indicative of hypercalciuria and must be investigated further. Hypercalciuria occurs primarily in three situations: (1)"

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

            "content": "Once true hypercalcemia is established, the second most important laboratory test in the diagnostic evaluation is a PTH level using a two-site assay for the intact hormone. Increases in PTH are often accompanied by hypophosphatemia. In addition, serum creatinine should be measured to assess renal function; hypercalcemia may impair renal function, and renal clearance of PTH may be altered depending on the fragments detected by the assay. If the PTH level is increased (or \u201cinappropriately normal\u201d) in the setting of elevated calcium and low phosphorus, the diagnosis is almost always primary hyperparathyroidism. Because individuals with FHH may also present with mildly elevated PTH levels and hypercalcemia, this diagnosis should be considered and excluded because parathyroid surgery is ineffective in this condition. A calcium/creatinine clearance ratio (calculated as urine calcium/ serum calcium divided by urine creatinine/serum creatinine) of <0.01 is suggestive of FHH, particularly when"

There is a variable relation from one patient to the next between the severity of hypercalcemia and the symptoms. Generally, symptoms are more common at calcium levels >2.9\u20133.0 mmol/L (11.6\u201312.0 mg/dL), but some patients, even at this level, are asymptomatic. When the calcium level is >3.2 mmol/L (12.8 mg/dL), calcification in kidneys, skin, vessels, lungs, heart, and stomach occurs and renal insufficiency may develop, particularly if blood phosphate levels are normal or elevated due to impaired renal excretion. Severe hypercalcemia, usually defined as \u22653.7\u20134.5 mmol/L (14.8\u201318.0 mg/dL), can be a medical emergency; coma and cardiac arrest can occur."
