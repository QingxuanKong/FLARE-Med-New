This condition is likely xeroderma pigmentosum, a rare genetic disorder caused by a defect in nucleotide excision repair (NER) of DNA. The symptoms of sunburns and eye irritation are consistent with this diagnosis. Nucleotide excision repair is a crucial DNA repair mechanism that corrects damage caused by UV radiation, and its deficiency leads to increased sensitivity to sunlight and skin cancer. The other options are not directly related to the symptoms presented by the patient. Non-homologous end joining, homologous recombination, and mismatch repair are all involved in different DNA repair pathways and are not directly implicated in this patient's condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

It is also called cradle cap because of the thick, greasy and waxy, yellow-white scaling and crusting of the scalp (Fig. 192-1). It is usually prominent on the vertex of the scalp, but it may be diffuse. Greasy, scaly, erythematous, nonpruritic patches and plaques may extend to the face and posterior auricular folds, sometimes involving the entire body. Diaper and intertriginous areas can have sharply demarcated, shiny, erythematous patches with yellow, greasy, or waxy-appearing scale. Hypopigmentation may persist after the inflammation has faded. The eruption is usually asymptomatic, which helps differentiate it from infantile atopic dermatitis, which is pruritic."

Although most of these lesions are found in the lumbosacral area (Mongolian spot), they also occur at other sites such as the buttocks, flank, extremities, or, rarely, the face (Fig. 193-1). Single or multiple, poorly demarcated, gray-blue patches up to 10 cm in size may be present.

Anatomic areas that are naturally protected from direct sunlight, such as the hairy scalp, the upper eyelids, the retroauricular areas, and the infranasal and submental regions, may be spared, whereas exposed areas show characteristic features of the pathologic process. These anatomic localization patterns are often helpful, but not infallible, in making the diagnosis. For example, airborne contact sensitizers that are blown onto the skin may produce dermatitis that can be difficult to distinguish from photosensitivity despite the fact that such material may trigger skin reactivity in areas shielded from direct sunlight."

Secondary infection of the cutaneous lesions can lead to disfigurement of the face and hands. Porphyrins are deposited in teeth and in bones.

For reasons that are only partially understood, melanomas are among the most rapidly increasing human malignancies (Chap. 105). Epidemiologic studies indicate that indoor tanning is a risk factor for melanoma, which may contribute to the increasing incidence of melanoma formation. Furthermore, epidemiologic studies suggest that life in a sunny climate from birth or early childhood may increase the risk of melanoma development. In general, risk does not correlate with cumulative sun exposure but may be related to the duration and extent of exposure in childhood.

Dyes and makeup may be used to color the skin, or the skin may be chemically bleached to produce a uniformly white color. A very common skin tumor, appearing in almost all patients after age 40. The etiology is unknown. When many seborrheic keratoses erupt suddenly, they may be part of a paraneoplastic syndrome due to tumor production of epidermal growth factors. Lesions have no malignant potential but may be a cosmetic problem. Present as exophytic, waxy brown papules and plaques with prominent follicle openings (see Figure 2.2-15). Lesions often appear in great numbers and have a \u201cstuck-on\u201d appearance. Lesions may become irritated either spontaneously or by external trauma, \u201cSeborrheic keratoses, or especially in the groin, breast, or axillae. Irritated lesions are smoother and SKs, look StucK on.\u201d redder."

Children: Dry, scaly, pruritic, excoriated patches in the \ufb02 exural areas and neck. Adults: Lichenification and dry, fissured skin, often limited to the hands. FIGURE 2.2-2. Atopic dermatitis.

This typically benign rash rarely appears after f ve days of age and is usually gone in 7\u201314 days; treatment is typically observation.
