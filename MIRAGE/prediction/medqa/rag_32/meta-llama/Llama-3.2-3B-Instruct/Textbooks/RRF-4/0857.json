    "question": "A 71-year-old woman comes to the physician for evaluation of a pigmented lesion on her left foot. She has had decreased appetite and a 6-kg (13-lb) weight loss in the past 2 months. Physical examination shows that on the left medial ankle there is a 2-cm reddish-black nodule with a verrucous surface. A full-thickness excisional biopsy of the lesion shows S100-protein-positive epithelioid cells. A subsequent CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis shows metastases to the liver; a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma is made. Chemotherapy with aldesleukin is initiated. Which of the following is the mechanism of action for this drug?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been diagnosed with metastatic melanoma and has been initiated on chemotherapy with aldesleukin. To determine the mechanism of action of aldesleukin, we need to understand its pharmacological class and how it works. Aldesleukin, also known as interleukin-2 (IL-2), is a recombinant form of human IL-2. IL-2 is a type of cytokine that plays a crucial role in the body's natural response to microbial infection and in the immune response to cancer.\\n\\nIL-2 works by stimulating the proliferation of T cells, which are a type of white blood cell that plays a central role in the immune response. Specifically, IL-2 stimulates the growth and differentiation of T cells, which then help to activate other immune cells, such as natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells, to attack and kill cancer cells.\\n\\nGiven this understanding of IL-2's mechanism of action, we can evaluate the answer choices.\\n\\nChoice A, stimulating release of acute-phase reactants, is incorrect because while acute-phase reactants are involved in the immune response, they are not the primary mechanism of action of IL-2.\\n\\nChoice B, stimulating antigen-processing cells, is also incorrect because while antigen-processing cells are involved in the immune response, IL-2 primarily stimulates T cell proliferation and activation rather than directly stimulating antigen-processing cells.\\n\\nChoice C, activating natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells, is correct because IL-2 stimulates the growth and differentiation of T cells, which then activate natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells to attack and kill cancer cells.\\n\\nChoice D, supporting growth of bone marrow stem cells, is incorrect because IL-2 is not primarily involved in supporting the growth of bone marrow stem cells.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

A 44-year-old woman had been recently diagnosed with melanoma on the toe and underwent a series of investigations. Melanoma (properly called malignant melanoma) can be an aggressive form of skin cancer that spreads to lymph nodes and multiple other organs throughout the body. The malignant potential is dependent upon its cellular configuration and also the depth of its penetration through the skin. The patient developed malignant melanoma in the foot, which spread to the lymph nodes of the groin. The inguinal lymph nodes were resected; however, it was noted on follow-up imaging that the patient had developed two metastatic lesions within the right lobe of the liver. Surgeons and physicians considered the possibility of removing these lesions. A CT scan was performed that demonstrated the lesions within segments V and VI of the liver (Fig. 4.186)."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

In the region of the head and neck of the pancreas are complex anatomical structures, which may be involved with a malignant process. The CT scan confirmed a mass in the region of the head of the pancreas, which invaded the descending part of the duodenum. The mass extended into the neck of the pancreas and had blocked the distal part of the bile duct and the pancreatic duct. Posteriorly the mass had directly invaded the portal venous confluence of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins, producing a series of gastric, splenic, and small bowel varices. This patient underwent palliative chemotherapy, but died 7 months later. A 44-year-old woman had been recently diagnosed with melanoma on the toe and underwent a series of investigations."

They are primar-ily lytic and produce pain locally; thus, any new and localized skeletal symptoms must be evaluated radiographically. Liver metastases and adrenal metastases are typically asymptomatic and usually discovered by routine CT scan. Adrenal metastasis may lead to adrenal hypofunction. Skin and soft tissue metas-tases occur in 8% of patients dying of lung cancer and gener-ally present as painless subcutaneous or intramuscular masses. Occasionally, tumor erodes through overlying skin; excision may then be necessary for both mental and physical palliation.Nonspecific Cancer-Related Symptoms.

One must always entertain the possibility that a single new lesion is a primary lung cancer. The probability of a new primary cancer vs. metastasis in patients presenting with solitary lesions depends on the type of initial neoplasm. The highest likelihood of a new primary lung cancer is in patients with a history of uterine (74%), bladder (89%), lung (92%), and head and neck (94%) carcinomas.Surgical resection of pulmonary metastases has a role in properly selected patients.30 The best data regarding outcomes of resection of pulmonary metastases come"

Melanoma of the mucous membranes most commonly presents in the oral cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, paranasal sinus, anus, rectum, and female genitalia. Patients with this presenta-tion have a worse prognosis (10% 5-year survival) than patients with cutaneous melanomas."

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min).

The best predictor of metastatic risk is the lesion\u2019s Breslow thickness. The Clark level, which defines melanomas on the basis of the layer of skin to which a melanoma has invaded, does not add significant prognostic information and has minimal influence on treatment decisions. The anatomic site of the primary is also prognostic; favorable sites are the forearm and leg (excluding the feet), and unfavorable sites include the scalp, hands, feet, and mucous membranes. In general, women with stage I or II disease have better survival than men, perhaps in part because of earlier diagnosis; women frequently have melanomas on the lower leg, where self-recognition is more likely and the prognosis is better. The effect of age is not straightforward. Older individuals, especially men over 60, have worse prognoses, a finding that has been explained in part by a"
