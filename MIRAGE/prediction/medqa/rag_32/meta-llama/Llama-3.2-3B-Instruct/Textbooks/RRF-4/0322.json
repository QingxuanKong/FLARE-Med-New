Approximately 6 months ago, she started noticing that he was walking more slowly than usual. He has fallen more than 6 times in the past month, and she is worried that he will sustain a serious injury if he does not stop falling. The patient is a retired banking executive and was active as a triathlete until the age of 60. He does not smoke and drinks 2-3 alcoholic beverages per day. His family history is notable for normal pressure hydrocephalus in his mother and Alzheimer dementia in his father. His temperature is 97.8\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 131/81 mmHg, pulse is 68/min, and respirations are 19/min. On exam, his movements appear slowed and forced. He shuffles his feet when he walks. Tone is increased in his upper and lower extremities bilaterally. This patient's condition is most strongly associated with which of the following histologic findings on brain autopsy?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's analyze the provided clinical scenario step by step. 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 62-year-old man who has been experiencing frequent falls (more than 6 times in the past month) and has been walking more slowly than usual for approximately 6 months. He has a history of being an active triathlete until the age of 60, indicating a high level of physical fitness. His family history is notable for normal pressure hydrocephalus in his mother and Alzheimer's dementia in his father. 2. **Physical Examination Findings**: The patient's movements appear slowed and forced, and he shuffles his feet when he walks. Tone is increased in his upper and lower extremities bilaterally. 3. **Differential Diagnosis**: Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the differential diagnosis for falls in an elderly patient with a history of normal pressure hydrocephalus and Alzheimer's dementia includes normal pressure hydrocephalus, Parkinson's disease, and other parkinsonian syndromes. 4. **Histologic Findings**: The question asks which histologic finding is most strongly associated with the patient's condition. Let's evaluate the options: - A. Accumulations of beta-pleated sheets are associated with Alzheimer's disease. - B. Atrophy of the caudate nucleus is associated with Huntington's disease. - C. Intracellular inclusions of alpha-synuclein are associated with Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. - D. Intracellular inclusions of hyperphosphorylated tau are associated with tauopathies, including normal pressure hydrocephalus. 5. **Analysis**: Given the patient's symptoms and family history, normal pressure hydrocephalus is a strong consideration. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is characterized by the triad of gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence. The histologic hallmark of normal pressure hydrocephalus is the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein within the brain, leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. 6. **Conclusion**: Based on the patient's symptoms and family history, the histologic finding most strongly associated with his condition is the accumulation of intracellular inclusions of hyperphosphorylated tau. Here is the answer in the requested format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and family history, particularly the presence of normal pressure hydrocephalus and Alzheimer's dementia, suggest that the histologic finding most strongly associated with his condition is the accumulation of intracellular inclusions of hyperphosphorylated tau.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

If maternal uncles are affected by the disease and are still walking, the diagnosis is relatively easy. Mentation is usually normal and cardiac involvement is far less frequent than in Duchenne dystrophy, but there are cases that present with a cardiomyopathy and we have been made aware of 2 brothers who had cardiac transplantation before the disease was detected.

            "content": "A 65-year-old man is referred to you from his primary care physician (PCP) for evaluation and management of pos-sible osteoporosis. He saw his PCP for evaluation of low back pain. X-rays of the spine showed some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine plus several wedge deformities in the thoracic spine. The patient is a long-time smoker (up to two packs per day) and has two to four glasses of wine with dinner, more on the weekends. He has chronic bronchitis, presumably from smoking, and has been treated on numerous occasions with oral prednisone for exacerba-tions of bronchitis. He is currently on 10 mg/d prednisone. Examination shows kyphosis of the thoracic spine, with some tenderness to fist percussion over the thoracic spine. The dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measure-ment of the lumbar spine is \u201cwithin the normal limits,\u201d but the radiologist noted that the reading may be misleading because of degenerative changes. The hip measurement shows a T score (number of standard"

            "content": "In all patients back pain requires careful assessment not only of the vertebral column but also of the chest and abdomen in order not to miss other important anatomical structures that may produce signs and symptoms radiating to the back. A 50-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with severe lower back pain that had started several days ago. In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."

            "content": "In the late encephalopathic forms of the metabolic and mitochondrial diseases, the diagnosis is usually made only after symptoms have been present for months or years, the disease having been mistaken for some other condition, particularly depression or a degenerative dementia. Even a manifest psychosis may have occurred in relation to some of these disorders, but such occurrences are admittedly rare. For example, one of our patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy, a 30-year-old man, began failing in college years and was later unsuccessful in holding a job because of carelessness and mistakes in his work and indifference to criticism, irritability, and stubbornness (clearly traceable to a mild dementia). Only when Babinski signs and loss of tendon reflexes in the legs were detected was the correct diagnosis entertained for the first time. By then he had been ill for nearly 10 years. Bosch and Hart described a patient with the onset of dementia at 62 years of age and drew attention"

            "content": "voluntary function is seriously impaired. Speech may be marred, much as it is in chorea. Close examination may also reveal an alteration in muscle tone and a slight degree of cerebellar ataxia. At this time, or even before the onset of myoclonus and seizures, the patient may experience visual hallucinations or exhibit irritability, odd traits of character, uninhibited or impulsive behavior, and, ultimately, progressive failure in all cognitive functions. Deafness has been an early sign in a few cases. Rigidity or hypotonia, impaired tendon reflexes, acrocyanosis, and rarely corticospinal tract signs are late findings. Finally, the patient becomes cachectic and bedfast and succumbs to intercurrent infection. Most do not survive beyond their twenty-fifth birthday. Nonetheless there are isolated reports of Lafora-body disease in which symptoms began as late as age 40 years, with death as late as age 50 years. These late cases may constitute a separate genetic type."

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

            "content": "Quite often, one encounters an elderly patient with only the instability and freezing components of the parkinsonian gait disorder, so-called lower-half parkinsonism. Usually, this is not a manifestation of idiopathic Parkinson disease although a few patients are responsive to l-dopa for a brief period. It may be an early manifestation of progressive supranuclear palsy, a basal ganglionic degeneration, normal pressure hydrocephalus, or widespread and frontal subcortical vascular damage as discussed further on, but it also occurs as a virtually isolated phenomenon that progresses independently of other movement disorders or of dementia. The basis is then probably a particular isolated frontal lobe degeneration (see further on). Within a few years, as pointed out by Factor and colleagues in their two papers, the patient is usually reduced to a chair-bound state."
