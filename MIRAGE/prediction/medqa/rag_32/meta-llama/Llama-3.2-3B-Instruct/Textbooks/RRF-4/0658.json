To test this hypothesis, they reviewed a database of women who were known to be BRCA-mutation positive and divided the group into those with breast cancer and those without breast cancer. They used data in the registry and surveys about peoples\u2019 surgical history to compare the proportion of each population that had undergone a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Based on this data, they reported that women undergoing the procedure had a lower chance of developing breast cancer later in life with an odds ratio of 0.46.

Women with a BRCA2 mutation also are at slightly increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Likewise women with mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes associated with Lynch syndrome, type 2 (MSH2, MLH1, MLH6, PMS1, PMS2) may have a risk of ovarian cancer as high as 1% per year in their forties and fifties. Finally, a small group of women with familial ovarian cancer may have mutations in other BRCA-associated genes such as RAD51, CHK2, and others. Screening studies in this select population suggest that current screening techniques, including serial evaluation of the CA-125 tumor marker and ultrasound, are insufficient at detecting early-stage and curable disease, so women with these germline mutations are advised to undergo prophylactic removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes typically after completing childbearing and ideally"

These recommendations are by expert opinion only, and it is unknown whether these interventions are cost-effective or will impact mortality from endometrial or ovarian cancer in patients with Lynch II syndrome. An attractive alternative to early detection is prophylactic surgery after completion of childbearing (54,55). In 2006 a multi-institutional, matched case-control study found that prophylactic hysterectomy withbilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is an effective primary prevention strategy in women with Lynch II syndrome (51).

One could consider this in women at average risk for these tumors when they undergo hysterectomy for benign disease. It is unknown whether this would substantially decrease the risk of developing these malignancies. Although salpingo-oophorectomy can be accomplished by laparoscopy or laparotomy in virtually 100% of cases, the success rate for vaginal hysterectomy ranges from 65% to 95% for experienced vaginal surgeons (32,33)."

Currently, there are many types of data that can predict disease incidence in an asymptomatic individual. Genomic data have received the most attention to date, at least in part because mutations in high-penetrance genes have clear implications for preventive care (Chap. 84). Women with mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2, the two major breast cancer susceptibility genes identified to date, have a markedly increased risk (5to 20-fold) of breast and ovarian cancer. Screening and prevention recommendations include prophylactic oophorectomy and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both of which are considered to incur too much harm for women at average cancer risk. Some women opt for prophylactic mastectomy to dramatically reduce their breast cancer"
