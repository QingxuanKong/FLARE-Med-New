As soon as the infant is clear of the vagina, a congenital malformation of the abdomen is observed. The infant is removed from the delivery room for further evaluation. Visual inspection shows loops of intestine protruding out of his abdomen on the right side. His APGAR scores are 7 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. His heart rate is 125/min, and his respirations are 45/min. All reflexes appear normal. There are no other visible defects. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The heart rate is elevated at 125/min, and the respirations are 45/min, which may indicate respiratory distress. The presence of intestinal loops outside the abdomen suggests a possible intestinal obstruction or malformation.

The other options are not the most appropriate next steps in this scenario. Wrapping the intestines in a sterile bowel bag (A) may not address the underlying cause of the condition, starting IV fluids (C) may not be sufficient to manage the potential shock or respiratory distress, and transferring the newborn to the NICU (B) may not provide the necessary surgical expertise and intervention in a timely manner.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Symptoms such as headache, altered vision, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, bleeding, vaginal luid leakage, and dysuria are sought. Mter 20 weeks' gestation, uterine examination measures size from the symphysis to the fundus. In late pregnancy, vaginal examination often provides valuable information that includes conirmation of the presenting part and its station, clinical estimation of pelvic capacity and configuration, amnionic luid volume adequacy, and cervical consistency, efacement, and dilatation (Chap. 22, p. 435)."

His initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed inferior ST-segment elevations with lateral ST-segment depressions. He was referred emergently to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for primary PCI. VIDEO 297e-17 The right coronary artery (RCA) is totally occluded with filling defects in the vessel after contrast injection, indicating thrombus is present in the vessel.

            "content": "As long as interval fetal growth and fetal surveillance test results are normal, pregnancy is allowed to continue until fetal lung maturity is reached (see Fig. 44-9). Reassessment of fetal growth is typically made no sooner than 3 to 4 weeks. Weekly assessment of umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry and amnionic fluid volume is combined with periodic nons tress testing, although the optimal frequency has not been determined. As mentioned, we hospitalize these women in our High-Risk Pregnancy Unit and monitor their fetuses daily. If interval growth, amnionic luid volume, and umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry are normal, then the mother is discharged home and seen intermittently for outpatient surveillance."

            "content": "In rare cases in which neonatal death has occurred or is certain due to associated anomalies, vaginal delivery may be reasonable, but the head or abdomen must be reduced in size for delivery. Removal of luid by cephalocentesis or paracentesis with sonographic guidance can be performed intrapartum. As described on page 523, cleidotomy can shorten the bisacromial diameter. For hydrocephalic fetuses that are breech, cephalocentesis can be accomplished suprapubically when the aftercoming head enters the pelvis. Currently, these practices are more germane in developing countries. \u2022 Delivery of the Placenta hird-stage labor begins immediately after fetal birth and ends with placental delivery. Goals include delivery of an intact placenta and avoidance of uterine inversion or postpartum hemorrhage. The latter two are grave intrapartum complications and constitute emergencies, as described in Chapter 41 (p. 755)."

Review of the past history and growth chart demonstrates normal birth weight and birth length, but a progressive decrease in height per-centiles relative to age-matched normal ranges starting at 6 months of age, and orthostasis with febrile illnesses. Physical examination demonstrates short stature and mild generalized obesity. Genital examination reveals descended but small testes and a phallic length of \u20132 SD. Laboratory evaluations demonstrate growth hormone (GH) deficiency and a delayed bone age of 18 months. The patient is started on replacement with recombinant human GH at a dose of 40 mcg/kg per day subcutaneously. After 1 year of treatment, his height velocity has increased from 5 cm/y to 11 cm/y.

            "content": "Polyhydramnios may be acute and associated with premature labor, maternal discomfort, and respiratory compromise. More often, polyhydramnios is chronic and is associated with diabetes, immune or nonimmune hydrops fetalis, multiple gestation, trisomy 18 or 21, and major congenital anomalies. Anencephaly, hydrocephaly, and meningomyelocele are associated with reduced fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid. Esophageal and duodenal atresia as well as cleft palate interfere with swallowing and gastrointestinal fluid dynamics. Additional causes of polyhydramnios include Werdnig-Hoffmann and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes, conjoined twins, chylothorax, cystic adenomatoid lung malformation, diaphragmatic hernia, gastroschisis, sacral teratoma, placental chorioangioma, and myotonic dystrophy. Hydrops fetalis may be a result of Rh or other blood group incompatibilities and anemia caused by intrauterine hemolysis of fetal erythrocytes by maternal IgG-sensitized antibodies crossing the placenta."

The pregnancy record is promptly reviewed to identiY complications. Problems identiied or anticipated during prenatal care should be displayed prominently in the pregnancy record. Most often, unless there has been bleeding in excess of bloody show, a cervical examination is performed. he gloved index and second ingers are introduced into the vagina while avoiding the anal region. During prenatal care, the woman is instructed to be aware of luid leakage from the vagina and to report such an event promptly. Rupture of the membranes is signiicant for three reasons. First, if the presenting part is not ixed in the pelvis, the umbilical cord can prolapse and be compressed. Second, labor is likely to begin soon if the pregnancy is at or near term."
