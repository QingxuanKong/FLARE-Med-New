    "question": "A 47-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer who is undergoing chemotherapy comes to the physician for a follow-up exam. She reports extreme fatigue since beginning her chemotherapy regimen. Her pulse is 98/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg. Her hemoglobin is 10.4 g/dL, leukocyte count is 800/mm3 with 5% monocytes, and platelet count is 50,000/mm3. The patient is started on a new medication. One week later, serum studies show a hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 2,000/mm3 with 2% monocytes, and a platelet count of 56,000/mm3. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?",

    "predict": "After analyzing the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, here's my step-by-step thinking: 1. The patient is a 47-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy, which can cause various side effects, including anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. 2. The patient reports extreme fatigue, which is a common symptom of anemia. 3. The patient's initial laboratory results show a low hemoglobin level (10.4 g/dL), which is consistent with anemia. 4. After starting a new medication, the patient's hemoglobin level increases to 10.6 g/dL, indicating an improvement in anemia. 5. However, the patient's leukocyte count decreases from 800/mm3 to 2,000/mm3, which is a significant reduction in white blood cell count. 6. The patient's platelet count decreases from 50,000/mm3 to 56,000/mm3, which is a mild reduction in platelet count. 7. The new medication likely caused the decrease in leukocyte count, which is a common side effect of certain medications used in chemotherapy. 8. Considering the options provided, the most likely cause of the decrease in leukocyte count is Filgrastim (C), a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) that stimulates the production of white blood cells, including neutrophils.

The patient had noted progressive weakness over several days, to the point that he was unable to rise from bed. Past medical history was notable for small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, liver, and adrenals. The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation.

            "content": "Platelets may be deficient in both number and function. The normal peripheral blood count is 150,000 to 400,000 per mm3, and the normal lifespan of a platelet is approximately 10 days. Although there is no clear-cut correlation between the degree of thrombocytopenia and the presence or amount of bleeding, several generalizations can be made. If the platelet count is higher than 100,000/mm3 and the platelets are functioning normally, there is little chance of excessive bleeding during surgical procedures. Patients with a platelet count higher than 75,000/mm3 almost always have normal bleeding times, and a platelet count higher than 50,000/mm3 is probably adequate. A platelet count lower than 20,000/mm3 often will be associated with severe and spontaneous bleeding. Platelet counts higher than 1,000,000/mm3 are often, paradoxically, associated with bleeding."

Localized pain or palpable abnormality in a previously radiated field should prompt radiographic evaluation. Screening tests, when available and validated, should be used on a routine and regular basis (e.g., mammography and Pap smear), particularly in patients receiving radiation to specific organs. Annual mammography should start no later than 10 years after breast radiation. Patients receiving radiation fields encompassing thyroid tissue should have regular thyroid exams and TSH testing.

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

The blood neutrophil count must be \u22651000/\u03bcL and the platelet count \u2265100,000/\u03bcL. Hemoglobin concentration is not considered in determining CR. Circulating blasts should be absent. Although rare blasts may be detected in the blood during marrow regeneration, they should disappear on successive studies. The bone marrow should contain <5% blasts, and Auer rods should be absent. Extramedullary leukemia should not be present. Patients who achieve CR after one induction cycle have longer CR durations than those requiring multiple cycles. CLINICAL PRESENTATION Symptoms Patients with AML most often present with nonspecific symptoms that begin gradually or abruptly and are the consequence of anemia, leukocytosis, leukopenia or leukocyte dysfunction, or thrombocytopenia.

A blood smear will show the characteristic features of extramedullary hematopoiesis: teardrop-shaped red cells, nucleated red cells, myelocytes, and promyelocytes; myeloblasts may also be present (Fig. 131-1). Anemia, usually mild initially, is the rule, whereas the leukocyte and platelet counts are either normal or increased, but either can be depressed. Mild hepatomegaly may accompany the splenomegaly but is unusual in the absence of splenic enlargement; isolated lymphadenopathy should suggest another diagnosis.

Summarizing 14 articles and encompassing nearly 4,600 patients, the conclusions note a decrease in all-cause mortality with more liberal transfusion of platelets and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (235). A task force for the American Society of Anesthesiologists recommended critical values for replacement in patients with massive transfusion and microvascular bleeding (193): 1. Platelet transfusion usually is indicated for counts less than 50,000/mm3 (with intermediate platelet counts, i.e., 50,000/mm3 to 100,000/mm3, the transfusion of platelet concentrates should be based on the risk of more significant bleeding). 2. Fresh frozen plasma therapy is indicated if the prothrombin or activated partial thromboplastin time values exceed 1.5 times the normal value. 3."

The overall health of the patient and whether he or she is receiving drug treatment will influence the differential diagnosis. A healthy young adult with thrombocytopenia will have a much more limited differential diagnosis than an ill hospitalized patient who is receiving multiple medications. Except in unusual inherited disorders, decreased platelet production usually results from bone marrow disorders that also affect red blood cell (RBC) and/or white blood cell (WBC) production. Because myelodysplasia can present with isolated thrombocytopenia, the bone marrow should be examined in patients presenting with isolated thrombocytopenia who are older than 60 years of age.

Cyclic oscillations of counts are noted in 25% of patients without treatment. Biochemical abnormalities include a low leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score and high levels of vitamin B12, uric acid, lactic dehydrogenase, and lysozyme. The presence of unexplained and sustained leukocytosis, with or without splenomegaly, should lead to a marrow examination and cytogenetic analysis."
