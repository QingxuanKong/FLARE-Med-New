The symptoms described in the newborn, such as high-pitched crying, poor feeding, rhinorrhea, and low-grade fever, along with hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response, are indicative of neonatal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonism. This condition is often associated with maternal use of nicotine, which can cross the placenta and affect the newborn. Among the options provided, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist is the most likely cause of these symptoms. Mu receptor agonists are not typically associated with these symptoms. Monoamine reuptake antagonists and thyroperoxidase inhibitors are also not directly linked to these symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, which is consistent with maternal nicotine use during pregnancy. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

For these, initial steps of warming the newborn can be done on the mother's chest or abdomen. Direct skin-to-skin contact with the mother and drying and covering the newborn with a warm blanket will help maintain euthermia (36.5 to 37.5\u00b0C). A vigorously crying newborn does not require routine oral suctioning (Carrasco, 1997; Gungor, 2006). Instead, bulb suctioning to remove secretions is best reserved for those who cannot clear secretions on their own due to apnea or copious secretions. Additional routine care steps include drying, gentle stimulation by rubbing the newborn's back, and continued observation during the transition period."

Also present at birth is the placing reaction, wherein the foot or hand, brought passively into contact with the edge of a table, is lifted automatically and placed on the flat surface. These neonatal automatisms depend essentially on the functioning of the spinal cord, brainstem, and possibly diencephalon and pallidum. The Apgar score, a universally used but somewhat imprecise index of the well-being of the newly born infant, is in reality a numerical rating of the adequacy of brainstem-spinal mechanisms (breathing, pulse, color of skin, tone, and responsivity) (Table 27-3)."

Such associations are diicult to mea sure with reliability given that both asphyxial injury and low Apgar scores are infrequent outcomes. For example, according to United States birth certiicate records for 2010, only 1.8 percent of newborns had a 5-minute score below 7 (Martin, 2012). Similarly, in a population-based study of more than 1 million term newborns in Sweden between 1988 and 1997, the incidence of 5-minute Apgar scores of \ufffd3 approximated 2 per 1000 (Thorngren-Jerneck, 2001)."

One review of trials encompassing more than 3200 high-risk and low-risk pregnancies compared outcomes according to which deinition was used (Nabhan, 2008). Rates of cesarean delivery, neonatal intensive care unit admission, umbilical artery pH <7.1, or Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes did not difer between groups. Using AFI criteria, however, twice as many pregnancies were diagnosed with oligohydramnios. In this group, there was a doubling of the labor induction rate and a 50-percent increase in the cesarean delivery rate for fetal distress. Kehl and colleagues (2016) performed a prospective trial with more than 1000 term pregnancies in which women with oligohydramnios, deined either by an AFI < 5 em or a single deepest pocket <2 em, were randomized to labor induction or expectant care. Signiicantly more pregnancies were"

With a living viable-aged fetus, and with vaginal delivery not imminent, emergency cesarean delivery is chosen by most. In some women, fetal compromise will be evident as shown in Figure 41-19. When evaluating fetal status, sonographic conirmation of fetal heart activity may be necessary because sometimes an electrode applied directly to a dead fetus will provide misleading information by recording the maternal heart rate. If the fetus has died or if it is not considered suiciently mature to live outside the uterus, then FIGURE 41-19 Placental abruption with fetal compromise.

Most low Apgar scores are caused by difficulty in establishing adequate ventilation and not by primary cardiac pathology. In addition to an Apgar score of 0 to 3, most infants with asphyxia severe enough to cause neurologic injury also manifest fetal acidosis (pH <7); seizures, coma, or hypotonia; and multiorgan dysfunction. Low Apgar scores may be caused by fetal hypoxia or other factors listed in Table 58-7. Most infants with low Apgar scores respond to assisted ventilation by face mask or by endotracheal intubation and usually do not need emergency medication."
