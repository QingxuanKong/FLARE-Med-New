The patient\u2019s parents say he was doing well until a few weeks ago at which time he started to complain of daily abdominal cramps and occasional muscle pains. His mother also noticed that he has been less active than usual. The parents deny any complaints of headaches or convulsions. The family lives together in a house built in 1950. The patient\u2019s temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg, pulse is 100/min and respirations are 20/min. Abdominal exam shows mild diffuse tenderness to palpation and normal bowel sounds. The patient\u2019s height, weight, and head circumference are normal. Laboratory results are as follows:\nHemoglobin 7 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV) 72\nLead level (capillary blood) 15 mcg/dL\nLead level (venous blood) 60 mcg/dL\nFindings on a peripheral blood smear are shown in the image.

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: ``` { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of abdominal cramps, muscle pains, and decreased activity, which are suggestive of lead poisoning. The laboratory results show elevated lead levels in both capillary and venous blood, and the peripheral blood smear is consistent with the diagnosis of lead poisoning. The patient's age and symptoms are also consistent with acute lead poisoning in a child. The goal of treatment is to remove the lead from the body as quickly and safely as possible. The treatment options listed are all chelating agents, which work by binding to lead and helping to remove it from the body. However, the choice of chelating agent depends on the severity of the poisoning and the patient's age and medical history. In children, EDTA (calcium disodium edetate) is often used as a first-line treatment for acute lead poisoning, as it is effective and has a rapid onset of action. However, in this case, the patient's lead levels are relatively low, and the patient is a young child, so a less aggressive treatment may be appropriate. Trientine and penicillamine are also chelating agents, but they may have more side effects and are not typically used as first-line treatment for acute lead poisoning in children. Succimer (DMSA) is also a chelating agent, but it is typically used for chronic lead exposure and is not typically used for acute poisoning. Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, EDTA (calcium disodium edetate) is the best treatment option for this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" } ``` The final answer is B. Calcium disodium edetate (EDTA).",

After admission a bronchoscopy was carried out and sputum was aspirated from the left upper lobe bronchus. This was cultured in the laboratory and also viewed under the microscope and tuberculous bacilli (TB) were identified. A 68-year-old man came to his family physician complaining of discomfort when swallowing (dysphagia). The physician examined the patient and noted since his last visit he had lost approximately 18 lb over 6 months. Routine blood tests revealed the patient was anemic and he was referred to the gastroenterology unit. A diagnosis of esophageal cancer was made and the patient underwent a resection, which involved a chest and abdominal incision. After 4 years the patient remains well though still subject to follow-up."

Chest pain is more common in adults, and abdominal pain is more common in children. Paroxysms of severe, knifelike pain usually last 15\u201330 min and are associated with diaphoresis and tachypnea. Fever peaks within an hour after the onset of paroxysms and subsides when pain resolves. The involved muscles are tender to palpation, and a pleural rub may be detected. The white blood cell count and chest x-ray results are usually normal. Most cases are due to coxsackievirus B and occur during epidemics. Symptoms resolve in a few days, and recurrences are rare. Treatment includes the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or the application of heat to the affected muscles."

            "content": "It is particularly important to exclude other causes of fever, notably infection. It is appropriate to obtain blood and urine culturesand to perform a chest x-ray. In the acute phase, inflammatory parameters are elevated, including white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and the ESR, which can be profoundlyelevated (often >80 mm/hr). Platelet counts may be inappropriately low or normal. A lumbar puncture, if performed toexclude infection, may reveal pleocytosis. Tests of hepatobiliary function may be abnormal. Greatly elevated platelet countsdevelop during the subacute phase. The development of coronary artery aneurysms is monitored by performing two-dimensional echocardiograms, usually during the acute phase, at 2 to3 weeks, and again at 6 to 8 weeks. More frequent echocardiograms and, potentially, coronary angiography are indicated forpatients who develop coronary artery abnormalities."

Physical examination demonstrates short stature and mild generalized obesity. Genital examination reveals descended but small testes and a phallic length of \u20132 SD.

Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating.

Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse.

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."
