    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with dyspnea and palpitations, and the heart rhythm is irregularly irregular. After initial treatment with IV digoxin, the patient's heart rate drops to 85/min and remains irregular. This suggests that digoxin is increasing the heart rate, which is an effect of digoxin. The correct explanation for this effect is that digoxin increases ventricular contractility, which in turn increases the heart rate. This is a well-known effect of digoxin, and it is often referred to as the 'inotropic effect'. This effect is a result of digoxin's action on the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, which leads to an increase in intracellular calcium levels and an increase in contractility. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Increased ventricular contractility.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

His heart fail-ure must be treated first, followed by careful control of the hypertension. He was initially treated with a diuretic (furo-semide, 40 mg twice daily). On this therapy, he was less short of breath on exertion and could also lie flat without dyspnea. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhib-itor was added (enalapril, 20 mg twice daily), and over the next few weeks, he continued to feel better. Because of continued shortness of breath on exercise, digoxin at 0.25 mg/d was added with a further modest improvement in exercise tolerance. The blood pressure stabilized at 150/90 mm Hg, and the patient will be educated regarding the relation between his hypertension and heart failure and the need for better blood pressure control. Cautious addition of a \u03b2 blocker (metoprolol) will be considered. Blood lipids, which are currently in the normal range, will be monitored."

On the other hand, slowing of heart rate with ivabradine (an If blocker, see Chapter 12) may be of benefit. Digoxin is indicated in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation. It is usually given only when diuretics and ACE inhibitors have failed to control symptoms. Only about 50% of patients with normal sinus rhythm (usually those with documented systolic dysfunction) will have relief of heart failure from digitalis. If the decision is made to use a cardiac glycoside, digoxin is the one chosen in most cases (and the only one available in the USA). When symptoms are mild, slow loading (digitalization) with 0.125\u20130.25 mg/d is safer and just as effective as the rapid method (0.5\u20130.75 mg every 8 hours for three doses, followed by 0.125\u20130.25 mg/d)."

Measurement of plasma digoxin levels is useful in patients who appear unusually resistant or sensitive; a level of 1 ng/mL or less is appropriate; higher levels may be required in patients with atrial fibrillation. Because it has a moderate but persistent positive inotropic effect, digitalis can, in theory, reverse all the signs and symptoms of heart failure. Although the net effect of the drug on mortality is mixed, it reduces hospitalization and deaths from progressive heart failure at the expense of an increase in sudden death. It is important to note that the mortality rate is reduced in patients with serum digoxin concentrations of less than 0.9 ng/mL but increased in those with digoxin levels greater than 1.5 ng/mL.

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

The patient is afebrile and normotensive but anxious, tachycardic, and markedly tachy-pneic. Auscultation of the chest reveals diffuse wheezes. The physician provisionally makes the diagnosis of bronchial asthma and administers epinephrine by intramuscular injec-tion, improving the patient\u2019s breathing over several minutes. A normal chest X-ray is subsequently obtained, and the medical history is remarkable only for mild hypertension that is being treated with propranolol. The physician instructs the patient to discontinue use of propranolol, and changes the patient\u2019s antihypertensive medication to verapamil. Why is the physician correct to discontinue propranolol? Why is verapamil a better choice for managing hypertension in this patient? What alternative treatment change might the physi-cian consider?"

He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

Contemporary evidence suggests that rate control is more important than rhythm con-trol for atrial fibrillation.84,85 The first-line treatment includes \u03b2-blockade and/or calcium channel blockade. \u03b2-Blockade must be used judiciously because hypotension, as well as withdrawal from \u03b2-blockade with rebound hypertension, is possible. Cal-cium channel blockers are an option if \u03b2-blockers are not toler-ated by the patient, but caution must be exercised in those with a history of congestive heart failure. Although digoxin is still a standby medication, it has limitations due to the need for opti-mal dosing levels. Cardioversion may be required if patients become hemodynamically unstable and the rhythm cannot be controlled.Ventricular arrhythmias and other tachyarrhythmias may occur in surgical patients as well. Similar to atrial rhythm prob-lems, these are best controlled with"
