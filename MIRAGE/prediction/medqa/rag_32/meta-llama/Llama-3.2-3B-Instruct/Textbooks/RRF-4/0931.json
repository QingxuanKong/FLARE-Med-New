A tuberculin skin test shows an induration of 14 mm. An x-ray of the chest is normal. Treatment with an antimycobacterial drug is initiated. Two months later, he has numbness and burning over both feet and an unsteady gait.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with numbness and burning sensations over both feet and an unsteady gait, along with decreased sensation to light touch extending from the soles of the feet to the mid-shin bilaterally. These symptoms suggest a peripheral neuropathy. Given the patient's history of tuberculin skin test induration of 14 mm, which is considered positive, and the initiation of treatment with an antimycobacterial drug, the most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms is related to the treatment itself. Isoniazid (INH), a first-line antitubercular medication, is known to cause peripheral neuropathy as a side effect, particularly in patients with a deficiency of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). The symptoms described are consistent with isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, the correct answer is related to the accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is a toxic metabolite of isoniazid that can cause neurological damage if not adequately counteracted by vitamin B6 supplementation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Diabetes can lead to vascular disease of large and medium arteries, narrowing the lumen and reducing blood supply to the extremities, thereby impairing healing. In addition, diabetes can also affect blood supply to nerves, which leads to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy results in reduced sensation, and therefore minor injuries can often go unnoticed. This patient has developed an ulcer on his heel, which is a pressure point and likely to be under repeated strain. The nurse examined the ulcer and found that the ulcer was looking infected with pus at the base of the ulcer and asked for a specialist orthopedic opinion, who requested an x-ray and an MRI.

            "content": "CSPN is a diagnosis of exclusion, established after a careful medical, family, and social history; neurologic examination; and directed laboratory testing. Despite extensive evaluation, the cause of polyneuropathy in as many as 50% of all patients is idiopathic. CSPN should be considered a distinct diagnostic subset of peripheral neuropathy. The onset of CSPN is predominantly in the sixth and seventh decades. Patients complain of distal numbness, tingling, and often burning pain that invariably begins in the feet and may eventually involve the fingers and hands. Patients exhibit a distal sensory loss to pinprick, touch, and vibration in the toes and feet, and occasionally in the fingers. It is uncommon to see significant proprioception deficits, even though patients may complain of gait unsteadiness. However, tandem gait may be abnormal in a minority of cases. Neither subjective nor objective evidence of weakness is a prominent feature. Most patients have evidence of both largeand"

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

Its etiology is unknown, but it has been hypothesized to represent a reaction to a viral infection with human herpesvirus (HHV) 6 or 7 because it tends to occur in mini-epidemics among young adults. \u25a0The initial lesion is a herald patch that is several centimeters in diameter and erythematous with a peripheral scale. Days to weeks later, a 2\u00b0 exanthem appears, presenting with multiple tiny, symmetric papules with a fine \u201ccigarette paper\u201d scale (see Figure 2.2-14). Papules are arranged along skin lines, giving a classic \u201cChristmas tree pattern\u201d on the patient\u2019s back. Patients are generally asymptomatic, although the disease may be more extensive, pruritic, and chronic among African-Americans. Diagnosed by clinical impression and confirmed by KOH exam to rule out fungus (the herald patch may be mistaken for tinea corporis). The differential also includes 2\u00b0 syphilis (RPR should be ordered), guttate psoriasis, and drug eruptions."

Cough is prominent, developing in 70% of patients. Myalgias are usually severe. A rash begins on the upper trunk, usually on the fifth day, and then becomes generalized, involving the entire body except the face, palms, and soles. Initially, this rash is macular; without treatment, it becomes maculopapular, petechial, and confluent. The rash often goes undetected in black skin; 60% of African patients have spotless epidemic typhus. Photophobia, with considerable conjunctival injection and eye pain, is common. The tongue may be dry, brown, and furred. Confusion and coma are common. Skin necrosis and gangrene of the digits as well as interstitial pneumonia may occur in severe cases. Untreated disease is fatal in 7\u201340% of cases, with outcome depending primarily on the condition of the host. Patients"
