    "question": "An unresponsive 92-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance and is quickly followed by his grand-daughter. Approx. 1 month ago, he had a radical prostatectomy, pelvic radiation, and several rounds of chemotherapy for aggressive prostate cancer in Nicaragua and was discharged from the hospital with a suprapelvic catheter and a plan for more chemotherapy. He was coming to the United States to spend time with some extended family. According to the grand-daughter his mental status was altered upon arrival and his health began to decline. She is not aware of his past medical status or medications. At the hospital, his blood pressure is 98/60 mm Hg, the pulse id 110/min, the respiratory rate is 21/min, and the temperature is 35.6\u00b0C (96.1\u00b0F). On physical exam, the patient appears cachectic, drowsy, and only responds to questions by nodding his head. His heart rate is tachycardic with a regular rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The cystotomy incision for his suprapelvic catheter is red and swollen. The patient admitted to the hospital and stabilized and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The catheter tube produces no urine over 24 hours and only thick green-white puss can be expressed. The treatment team concludes this patient has urinary tract obstruction. What is the best method to evaluate urinary tract obstruction in this patient?",

The patient has a history of prostate cancer treatment, including radical prostatectomy, pelvic radiation, and chemotherapy. This suggests that the obstruction is likely due to a urinary retention complication. The best method to evaluate urinary tract obstruction in this patient would be an abdominal-pelvic CT scan, which can help identify the location and severity of the obstruction, as well as any potential complications such as a urethral or bladder injury. A renal biopsy may not be necessary in this case, as the obstruction is likely due to a mechanical issue rather than a functional problem with the kidneys. Ultrasound may not provide enough detail to evaluate the obstruction, and blood analysis may not be directly relevant to diagnosing urinary tract obstruction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The origin of the pain relates to ureteral distention. A series of peristaltic waves along the ureter transport urine along the length of the ureter from the kidney to the bladder. As the ureteric stone obstructs the kidney, the ureter becomes distended, resulting in an exacerbation of the pain.

Sepsis necessitates prompt urologic intervention. Drainage may be achieved by nephrostomy, ureterostomy, or ureteral, urethral, or suprapubic catheterization. Prolonged antibiotic treatment may be necessary. Chronic or recurrent infections in a 1874 poorly functioning obstructed kidney may necessitate nephrectomy. When infection is not present, surgery is often delayed until acid-base, fluid, and electrolyte status is restored. Nevertheless, the site of obstruction should be ascertained as soon as feasible. Elective relief of obstruction is usually recommended in patients with urinary retention, recurrent urinary tract infections, persistent pain, or progressive loss of renal function. Benign prostatic hypertrophy may be treated medically with \u03b1-adrenergic blockers and 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors. Functional obstruction secondary to neurogenic"
