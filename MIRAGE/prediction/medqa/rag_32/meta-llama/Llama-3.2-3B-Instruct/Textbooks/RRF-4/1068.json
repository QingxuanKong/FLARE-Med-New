He reports a slow and steady weight gain of 6 pounds over the past 6 months, despite attempts to control his diet and increase his level of exercise. His medications include pravastatin, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. On exam, his vital signs are stable. He is obese (BMI 32), and his waist circumference is 43 inches. His physician is concerned about an abnormal fasting blood glucose and dyslipidemia. On further work-up with oral glucose tolerance test, the patient is diagnosed with diabetes.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results to determine the most likely form of diabetes. The patient is a 63-year-old man who presents with a slow and steady weight gain of 6 pounds over the past 6 months, despite attempts to control his diet and increase his level of exercise. He is also diagnosed with diabetes after an oral glucose tolerance test. Based on these symptoms and the patient's age, the most likely form of diabetes is Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, often associated with obesity, physical inactivity, and an unhealthy diet. The patient's obesity (BMI 32) and waist circumference (43 inches) also support this diagnosis. The patient's age and weight gain also make it less likely that he has Type 1 diabetes, which is typically diagnosed in younger people and is often associated with autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells. The oral glucose tolerance test confirms the diagnosis of diabetes, which further supports the diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes. The other options are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and diagnosis. Strong HLA class II gene makeup is associated with Type 1 diabetes, pancreatic islet cell amyloid deposition and leukocyte infiltration are not typical of diabetes, and auto-antibodies against pancreatic islet cell antigens are also associated with Type 1 diabetes. Therefore, the correct answer is Type 2 diabetes, which is associated with a strong HLA class II gene makeup, which is not a direct association but is a general indication of a strong immune response which can be seen in Type 2 diabetes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The treatment goals are to reduce his blood urate levels to <6.0 mg/dl and prevent additional attacks. He was advised to lose weight because being overweight or obese is a risk factor for gout.

The prevention of heart disease, especially of CAD, is one of the most important tasks of primary care health givers as well as cardiologists. Prevention begins with risk assessment, followed by attention to lifestyle, such as achieving optimal weight, physical activity, and smoking cessation, and then aggressive treatment of all abnormal risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (Chap. 417). After a complete diagnosis has been established in patients with known heart disease, a number of management options are usually available.

He is then switched to celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily, and on this regimen his joint symptoms and heartburn resolve. Two years later, he returns with increased joint symptoms. His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor. With the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, he is started on a regimen"

Because of the additive cardiovascular risk of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, lipid abnormalities should be assessed aggressively and treated as part of comprehensive diabetes care (Chap. 418). The most common pattern of dyslipidemia is hypertriglyceridemia and reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. DM itself does not increase levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but the small dense LDL particles found in type 2 DM are more atherogenic because they are more easily glycated and susceptible to oxidation."

A treatment strategy depends on the pattern of lipoprotein abnormalities. Initial therapy for all forms of dyslipidemia should include dietary changes, as well as the same lifestyle modifications recommended in the nondiabetic population (smoking cessation, blood pressure control, weight loss, increased physical activity). The dietary recommendations for individuals with DM include increased monounsaturated fat and carbohydrates and reduced saturated fats and cholesterol (Chap. 421). According to guidelines of the ADA, the target lipid values in diabetic individuals (age >40 years) without CVD should be as follows: LDL <2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL); HDL >1 mmol/L (40 mg/ dL) in men and >13 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) in women; and triglycerides <1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dL).

Cardiovascular risk factors in this man include family history of early coro-nary disease and elevated cholesterol. Evidence of end-organ impact includes left ventricular enlargement on electro-cardiogram. The strong family history suggests that this patient has essential hypertension. However, the patient should undergo the usual screening tests including renal func-tion, thyroid function, and serum electrolyte measurements. An echocardiogram should also be considered to determine whether the patient has left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to valvular or other structural heart disease as opposed to hypertension. Initial management in this patient can be behavioral, including dietary changes and aerobic exercise. However, most patients like this will require medication. Thiazide diuretics in low doses are inexpensive, have"

Chlorpropamide has a prolonged half-life, particularly in older adults, and should be avoided because it is associated with a high risk of hypoglycemia. Metformin should be used with caution and only in patients free of severe renal insufficiency. Renal insufficiency should be assessed by a calculated glomerular filtration rate or, in very old patients who have reduced muscle mass, by a direct measure of creatinine clearance from a 24-h urine collection. Lifestyle changes in diet and exercise and a little weight loss can prevent or delay diabetes in high-risk individuals and are substantially more effective than metformin treatment. The risk of type 2 diabetes decreased by 58% in a study of diet and exercise, and this effect was similar at all ages and in all ethnic groups. The risk reduction with standard care plus metformin was 31%."

Patients who drink alcohol should be encouraged to decrease or preferably eliminate their intake. Patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia often benefit from a formal dietary consultation with a dietician intimately familiar with counseling patients on the dietary management of high TGs. Dietary fat intake should be restricted to reduce the formation of chylomicrons in the intestine. The excessive intake of simple carbohydrates should be discouraged because insulin drives TG production in the liver. Aerobic exercise and even increase in regular physical activity can have a positive effect in reducing TG levels and should be strongly encouraged. For patients who are overweight, weight loss can help to reduce TG levels. In extreme cases, bariatric surgery has been shown to not only produce effective weight loss but also substantially"
