Physical examination shows erosion of the enamel on the lingual surface of the incisors and carious molars. He has frontal bossing.

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 16-month-old boy who has not begun to walk, has erosion of the enamel on the lingual surface of the incisors and carious molars, frontal bossing, widened wrists, bowed legs, and beading of the ribs. These symptoms are indicative of a skeletal dysplasia. The patient's growth parameters, such as being at the 20th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 50th percentile for head circumference, suggest that the patient is not growing at a normal rate. The patient's symptoms, such as erosion of the enamel on the lingual surface of the incisors and carious molars, frontal bossing, widened wrists, bowed legs, and beading of the ribs, are characteristic of a specific type of skeletal dysplasia. The options provided can be evaluated as follows: A. Deficiency of cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase: This is associated with scurvy, which does not match the patient's symptoms. B. Defect in type I collagen: This is associated with osteogenesis imperfecta, which is characterized by blue sclerae, hearing loss, and bone fragility, but not the specific symptoms described in the case. C. Impaired growth plate mineralization: This is associated with conditions such as rickets or osteomalacia, which do not match the patient's symptoms. D. Mutation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3: This is associated with achondroplasia, a form of short-limbed dwarfism that is characterized by frontal bossing, widened wrists, bowed legs, and beading of the ribs, among other symptoms. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is a mutation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, which is associated with achondroplasia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Although some growth variants can be difficult to distinguish from FTT, growth velocity and height-for-weight determinations can be useful in distinguishing the cause. In children with FTT, malnutrition initially results in wasting (deficiency in weight gain). Stunting (deficiency in linear growth) generally occurs after months of malnutrition, and head circumference is spared except with chronic, severe malnutrition.

A caliper-likedevice, such as an infantometer, or the movable plates on an infant scale are used so that the exact distance between the two calipers or plates can be determined. Marking the position of the head and feet of an infant lying on a sheet of paper on the examining table leads to inaccuracies and may miss true disorders of growth or create false concerns about a disorder of growth in a normal child. Accurate measurements of height (standing), or length (lying down), and weight should be plotted on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts for the timely diagnosis of growth disorders ( http:// www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/"

Limbsthat are too short for the head and trunk imply the presence ofa short-limbed bone dysplasia, such as achondroplasia. A trunkand head that are too short for the extremities suggest a disorderaffecting the vertebrae, such as spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. Available @ StudentConsult.com Abnormal Head Size, Shape, and Fontanels Careful examination of the head and face is crucial for the diagnosis of many congenital malformation syndromes. Head shape should be carefully assessed; if the head is not normal in size and shape (normocephalic), it may be long and thin (dolichocephalic), short and wide (brachycephalic), or asymmetric or lopsided (plagiocephalic)."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

Centers of ossiication have appeared in most fetal bones, and the fingers and toes have become diferentiated. Skin and nails develop, and scattered rudiments of hair appear. he external genitalia are beginning to show deinitive signs of male or female gender. he fetus begins to make spontaneous movements. Fetal growth slows at this time. The crown-rump length is 12 cm, and the fetal weight approximates 150 g (Hadlock, 1991). Practically speaing, the sonographic crown-rump length is not measured beyond 13 weeks, which corresponds to approximately 8.4 cm. Instead, biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length are measured. Fetal weight in the second and third trimesters is estimated from a combination of these measurements (Chap. 10, p. 184)."
