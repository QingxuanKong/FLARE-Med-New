    "question": "A 37-year-old-woman presents to her primary care physician requesting a new form of birth control. She has been utilizing oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for the past 8 years, but asks to switch to an intrauterine device (IUD). Her vital signs are: blood pressure 118/78 mm Hg, pulse 73/min and respiratory rate 16/min. She is afebrile. Physical examination is within normal limits. Which of the following past medical history statements would make copper IUD placement contraindicated in this patient?",

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to evaluate the potential risks associated with copper IUD placement in a woman with a specific medical history. The copper IUD is a type of long-acting reversible contraceptive that is inserted into the uterus and works by releasing copper ions that are toxic to sperm. However, it may pose certain risks to women with certain medical conditions. We need to review the options and identify the condition that would make copper IUD placement contraindicated in this patient. The options are: A. A history of stroke or venous thromboembolism, B. Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), C. Past medical history of breast cancer, and D. Known liver neoplasm. We should consider the potential risks associated with each condition and determine which one would make copper IUD placement contraindicated. Copper IUDs are generally contraindicated in women with active pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) due to the risk of further complications. Active PID increases the risk of adhesions, tubo-ovarian abscess, and infertility. On the other hand, a history of stroke or venous thromboembolism may increase the risk of blood clots, but this is not a contraindication for copper IUD placement. Past medical history of breast cancer is not a contraindication for copper IUD placement. Known liver neoplasm may increase the risk of bleeding complications, but this is not a contraindication for copper IUD placement. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"} The final answer is B.",

The IUD usually is inserted during menses to be sure the patient is not pregnant, but it can be inserted at any time in the cycle if pregnancy can be excluded (95). The copper-T380A IUD can be inserted within 5 days of unprotected intercourse for 100% effective emergency contraception. There are limited data on effective treatment of pain during IUD insertion. One randomized nonblinded study suggested a benefit with 2% lidocaine gel applied to the cervical canal 5 minutes before insertion. Other techniques such as paracervical block were not evaluated. Premedication with oral prostaglandin inhibitors such as ibuprofen is strongly advised, although evidence of its benefit with modern IUDs is limited (96)."

She is diagnosed with premature ovarian failure, and estrogen and pro-gesterone replacement therapy is recommended. A dual-energy absorptiometry scan (DEXA) reveals a bone density t-score of <2.5 SD, ie, frank osteoporosis. How should the ovarian hormones she lacks be replaced? What extra mea-sures should she take for her osteoporosis while receiving treatment? \u25a0 THE OVARY (ESTROGENS, PROGESTINS, OTHER OVARIAN HORMONES, ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES, INHIBITORS & ANTAGONISTS, & OVULATIONINDUCING AGENTS)"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"
