The pH is below the normal range (7.35-7.45), indicating acidosis. The pCO2 is above the normal range (35-45 mmHg), indicating respiratory acidosis. The HCO3 is above the normal range (21-26 mEq/L), indicating a metabolic alkalosis. The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and the presence of a mixed acid-base disorder suggest a respiratory cause for the acidosis. The patient's age and medical history do not suggest a primary respiratory disease, making a pulmonary embolus a more likely cause. A panic attack would not typically cause a mixed acid-base disorder with respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis. Mechanical ventilation would likely result in a different pattern of acid-base disturbances. Chronic obstructive bronchitis would not typically cause a significant respiratory acidosis. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a pulmonary embolus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

A venous blood gas was drawn soon after his presentation; venous and arterial blood gases demonstrate a high level of agreement in hemodynamically stable patients, allowing for the interpretation of acid-base disorders with venous blood gas results. In response to his metabolic alkalosis, the Pco2 should have increased by 0.75 mmHg for each 1-meq/L increase in bicarbonate; the expected Pco2 should have been ~55 mmHg. Given the Pco2 of 62 mmHg, he had an additional respiratory acidosis, likely caused by respiratory muscle weakness from his acute hypokalemia and subacute hypercortisolism."

In the acute phase, respiratory alkalosis is not associated with increased renal HCO3 excretion, but within hours net acid excretion is reduced. In general, the HCO3 concentration falls by 2.0 mmol/L for each 10-mmHg decrease in Paco2. Chronic hypocapnia reduces the serum [HCO3 -] by 4.0 mmol/L for each 10-mmHg decrease in Paco2. It is unusual to observe a plasma HCO3 <12 mmol/L as a result of a pure respiratory alkalosis. When a diagnosis of respiratory alkalosis is made, its cause should be investigated. The diagnosis of hyperventilation syndrome is made by exclusion.

            "content": "A 65-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe central chest pain that radiated to the neck and predominantly to the left arm. He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

            "content": "Treatment of hypoxemia requires knowledge of normal values. In term infants, the arterial Pao2 level is 55 to 60 mm Hg at 30 minutes of life, 75 mm Hg at 4 hours, and 90 mm Hg at 24 hours. Preterm infants have lower values. Paco2 levels should be 35 to 40 mm Hg, and the pH should be 7.35 to 7.40. It is imperative that arterial blood gas analysis be performed in all infants with significant respiratory distress, whether or not cyanosis is perceived. Cyanosis becomes evident when there is 5 g of unsaturated hemoglobin; anemia may interfere with the perception of cyanosis. Jaundice also may interfere with the appearance of cyanosis. Capillary blood gas determinations are useful in determining blood pH and the Paco2 level but may result in falsely low blood Pao2 readings. Serial blood gas levels may be monitored by an indwelling arterial catheter placed in a peripheral artery or through the umbilical artery. Another method for monitoring blood gas levels is to combine capillary blood gas"

            "content": "Chronic respiratory alkalosis is the most common acid-base disturbance in critically ill patients and, when severe, portends a poor prognosis. Many cardiopulmonary disorders manifest respiratory alkalosis 324 in their early to intermediate stages, and the finding of normocapnia and hypoxemia in a patient with hyperventilation may herald the onset of rapid respiratory failure and should prompt an assessment to determine if the patient is becoming fatigued. Respiratory alkalosis is common during mechanical ventilation. The hyperventilation syndrome may be disabling. Paresthesia; circumoral numbness; chest wall tightness or pain; dizziness; inability to take an adequate breath; and, rarely, tetany may be sufficiently stressful to perpetuate the disorder. Arterial blood-gas analysis demonstrates an acute or chronic respiratory alkalosis, often with hypocapnia in the range of 15\u201330 mmHg and no hypoxemia. CNS diseases or injury can produce several patterns of hyperventilation and sustained"

Cheyne-Stokes respiration is caused by an increased sensitivity of the respiratory center to arterial PCO2. There is an apneic phase, during which arterial PO2 falls and arterial PCO2 rises. These changes in the arterial blood gas content stimulate the respiratory center, resulting in hyperventilation and hypocapnia, followed by recurrence of apnea. Cheyne-Stokes respirations may be perceived by the patient or the patient\u2019s family as severe dyspnea or as a transient cessation of breathing. acutE pulmonary EdEma See Chap. 326"

Primary Cardiology, 2nd ed. Philadelphia, WB Saunders, 2003.) Patients with exertional dyspnea should be asked to walk under observation in order to reproduce the symptoms. The patient should be examined during and at the end of exercise for new findings that were not present at rest and for changes in oxygen saturation."
