He had 2 myocardial infarctions at the age of 66 and 69 years and suffers from chronic heart failure. At the time of presentation, his vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg, heart rate 108/min, respiratory rate 29/min, and temperature 35.5\u00b0C (95.9\u00b0F). On physical examination, the patient sits upright. He is lethargic and cyanotic. Lung auscultation reveals widespread bilateral fine rales. Cardiac examination is significant for S3, accentuation of the pulmonic component of S2, and a systolic murmur heard best at the apex of the heart. Soon after hospitalization, the patient develops ventricular fibrillation and dies despite adequate resuscitation measures. Which microscopic finding would you expect to see in this patient on autopsy?",

The patient's vital signs, including hypotension, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypothermia, further support this diagnosis. The physical examination findings of S3, accentuation of the pulmonic component of S2, and a systolic murmur heard best at the apex of the heart are also consistent with CHF. The patient's sudden deterioration and development of ventricular fibrillation leading to death suggests a severe and acute exacerbation of CHF. Given the patient's history of heart failure and previous myocardial infarctions, it is likely that the patient had coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction, which contributed to the development of CHF. The microscopic finding of brownish inclusions in the pulmonary macrophages on H&E staining is consistent with pulmonary congestion and edema, which is a hallmark of CHF. This finding would be expected to be present in the lungs of a patient with CHF.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, neurologic, or pulmonary disease help focus the differential diagnosis, as do findings relevant to the jugular venous pressure and waveforms, the arterial pulses, other heart sounds, the lungs, the abdomen, the skin, and the extremities. In many instances, laboratory studies, an ECG, and/or a chest x-ray may have been obtained earlier and may contain valuable information. A patient with suspected infective endocarditis, for example, may have a murmur in the setting of fever, chills, anorexia, fatigue, dyspnea, splenomegaly, petechiae, and positive blood cultures. A new systolic murmur in a patient with a marked fall in blood pressure after a recent MI suggests myocardial rupture.

Dyspnea is the most common presenting symptom, but this complaint is far from specific for the diagnosis of PH. PH symptoms are insidious and overlap considerably with many common conditions, including asthma and other lung disease and cardiac disease. The symptoms of PH are often nonspecific and variable. Most patients will present with dyspnea and/or fatigue, whereas edema, chest pain, presyncope, and frank syncope are less common and associated with more advanced disease. On examination, there may be evidence of right ventricular failure with elevated jugular venous pressure, lower extremity edema, and ascites.

The opening snap (OS) of the mitral valve is most readily audible in expiration at, or just medial to, the cardiac apex. This sound generally follows the sound of aortic valve closure (A2) by 0.05\u20130.12 s. The time interval between A2 and OS varies inversely with the severity of the MS. The OS is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, diastolic murmur, heard best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral recumbent position (see Fig. 267-5); it is accentuated by mild exercise (e.g., a few rapid sit-ups) carried out just before auscultation.

Standing decreases venous return; the heart becomes smaller; C moves closer to the first heart sound (S1), and the mitral regurgitant murmur has an earlier onset. With prompt squatting, venous return and afterload increase; the heart becomes larger; C moves toward S2; and the duration of the murmur shortens.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

The evidence base that links the findings from the history and physi-cal examination to the presence, severity, and prognosis of cardiovas-cular disease has been established most rigorously for coronary artery disease, heart failure, and valvular heart disease. For example, obser-vations regarding heart rate, blood pressure, signs of pulmonary congestion, and the presence of mitral regurgitation (MR) contribute importantly to bedside risk assessment in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Observations from the physical examination in this set-ting can inform clinical decision making before the results of cardiac biomarkers testing are known. The prognosis of patients with systolic heart failure can be predicted on the basis of the jugular venous pressure (JVP) and the presence or absence of a third heart sound (S3). Accurate characterization of cardiac murmurs provides important insight into the natural history of many valvular and congenital heart lesions. Finally, the"

Inquire about a history of COPD, interstitial lung disease, heart disease, sickle cell anemia, emphysema, and pulmonary emboli. Exam reveals a loud, palpable S2 (often split), a systolic ejection murmur, an S4, or a parasternal heave. CXR shows enlargement of central pulmonary arteries. ECG demonstrates RVH.

            "content": "The history is essential for assessing the likelihood of underlying cardiac disease as well as for identification of one of the conditions associated with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. The physical examination in cardiogenic pulmonary edema is notable for evidence of increased intracardiac pressures (S3 gallop, elevated jugular venous pulse, peripheral edema) and rales and/or wheezes on auscultation of the chest. In contrast, the physical examination in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is dominated by the findings of the precipitating condition; pulmonary findings may be relatively normal in the early stages. The chest radiograph in cardiogenic pulmonary edema typically shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette, vascular redistribution, interstitial thickening, and perihilar alveolar infiltrates; pleural effusions are common. In noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, heart size is normal, alveolar infiltrates are distributed more uniformly throughout the lungs, and pleural effusions are uncommon."

            "content": "Mid-Diastolic Murmurs (Figs. 51e-1G and 51e-1H) Mid-diastolic murmurs result from obstruction and/or augmented flow at the level of the mitral or tricuspid valve. Rheumatic fever is the most common cause of MS (Fig. 51e-6). In younger patients with pliable valves, S1 is loud and the murmur begins after an opening snap, which is a high-pitched sound that occurs shortly after S2. The interval between the pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) and the opening snap is inversely related to the magnitude of the left atrial\u2013left ventricular pressure gradient. The murmur of MS is low-pitched and thus is best heard with the bell of the stethoscope. It is loudest at the left ventricular apex and often is appreciated only when the patient is turned in the left lateral decubitus position. It is usually of grade 1 or 2 intensity but may be absent when the cardiac output is severely reduced despite significant obstruction. The intensity of the murmur increases during maneuvers that"

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"
