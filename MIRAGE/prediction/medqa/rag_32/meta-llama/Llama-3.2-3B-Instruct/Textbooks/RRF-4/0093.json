    "question": "A 54-year-old woman with a past medical history of mental retardation, hypertension, and diabetes presents to the emergency department with a change in her behavior. Her caretakers state that the patient\u2019s gait suddenly became ataxic, and she became less responsive than her normal non-verbal baseline. Her temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/68 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an unremarkable HEENT exam with normal facial features and no signs of airway compromise. Neurological exam is remarkable for new onset spasticity. The patient has 3+ reflexes and a positive Babinski sign. Musculoskeletal exam is only notable for symmetric swelling and deformities of the patient\u2019s hands bilaterally. Additionally, there is a \"clunk\" when posterior force is applied to the head while anterior force is applied to the cervical spine. Which of the following is the most likely risk factor that predisposed this patient to this condition?",

The physical exam reveals new onset spasticity, 3+ reflexes, and a positive Babinski sign, which are indicative of upper motor neuron lesions. The 'clunk' sign, also known as the Dugas test, is a classic finding in patients with syringomyelia, a condition characterized by the formation of a fluid-filled cavity within the spinal cord. This condition can occur in patients with various underlying conditions, including cerebral palsy, which is a risk factor for syringomyelia. The other options, diabetes mellitus, Down syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis, are not directly related to the development of syringomyelia. Therefore, the most likely risk factor that predisposed this patient to this condition is cerebral palsy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"} The final answer is A.",

The legs are usually more affected than the arms, and facial diparesis is present in 50% of affected individuals. The lower cranial nerves are also frequently involved, causing bulbar weakness with difficulty handling secretions and maintaining an airway; the diagnosis in these patients may initially be mistaken for brainstem ischemia. Pain in the neck, shoulder, back, or diffusely over the spine is also common in the early stages of GBS, occurring in ~50% of patients.

She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula.

            "content": "In outline, the clinical syndrome of aseptic meningitis consists of fever, headache, signs of meningeal irritation, and a predominantly lymphocytic pleocytosis in the spinal fluid with normal glucose. Usually the onset is acute and the temperature is elevated, from 38 to 40\u00b0C (100.4 to 104\u00b0F). Headache that is more severe than that associated with other febrile states is the most frequent symptom. A variable but usually mild degree of lethargy, irritability, and drowsiness may occur. Photophobia and pain on movement of the eyes are common additional complaints. Stiffness of the neck and spine on forward bending attests to the presence of meningeal irritation (meningismus), but at first it may be so slight as to pass unnoticed. When there are accompanying neurologic signs, they too tend to be mild or fleeting: paresthesia in an extremity, or wavering Babinski signs."

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated.

Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"
