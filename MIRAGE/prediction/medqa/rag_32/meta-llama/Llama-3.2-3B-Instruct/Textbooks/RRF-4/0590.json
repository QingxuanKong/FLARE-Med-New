The spleen is palpated 5 cm below the costal margin. Her leukocyte count is 12,000/mm3 and platelet count is 217,000/mm3. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the given information step by step. The patient is a 69-year-old woman with nontender cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen). Her leukocyte count is slightly elevated at 12,000/mm3, and her platelet count is normal at 217,000/mm3. Given these findings, we need to consider the possible causes of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in a 69-year-old woman. The most common causes of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly in this age group include infections, autoimmune disorders, and hematological malignancies. The patient's age and the presence of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly suggest that a hematological malignancy should be considered. The most common hematological malignancies in this age group are lymphoma and myelodysplastic syndromes. Let's evaluate the options: A. Ringed sideroblasts: These are characteristic of myelodysplastic syndromes, but they are not the most likely finding in this case. B. Teardrop cells: These are characteristic of myelofibrosis, a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm. Given the patient's splenomegaly, this is a plausible diagnosis. C. Smudge cells: These are characteristic of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but the patient's lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are more suggestive of a different diagnosis. D. Hypergammaglobulinemia: This is a finding in some autoimmune disorders, but it is not directly related to the patient's lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Based on the patient's age, symptoms, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is myelofibrosis, which would be supported by the presence of teardrop cells in the blood smear. Therefore, the answer is B. Teardrop cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

However, in contrast to its companion MPN, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss are common presenting complaints. A blood smear will show the characteristic features of extramedullary hematopoiesis: teardrop-shaped red cells, nucleated red cells, myelocytes, and promyelocytes; myeloblasts may also be present (Fig. 131-1). Anemia, usually mild initially, is the rule, whereas the leukocyte and platelet counts are either normal or increased, but either can be depressed. Mild hepatomegaly may accompany the splenomegaly but is unusual in the absence of splenic enlargement; isolated lymphadenopathy should suggest another diagnosis.

A pendulous breast can be palpated by placing one hand between the breast and the chest wall and gently palpating the breast between both examining hands.

Although there is no clear-cut correlation between the degree of thrombocytopenia and the presence or amount of bleeding, several generalizations can be made. If the platelet count is higher than 100,000/mm3 and the platelets are functioning normally, there is little chance of excessive bleeding during surgical procedures. Patients with a platelet count higher than 75,000/mm3 almost always have normal bleeding times, and a platelet count higher than 50,000/mm3 is probably adequate. A platelet count lower than 20,000/mm3 often will be associated with severe and spontaneous bleeding. Platelet counts higher than 1,000,000/mm3 are often, paradoxically, associated with bleeding."

            "content": "Blood from the lower limbs and the pelvis may drain via a series of collateral vessels, some of which include the superficial inferior epigastric veins, which run in the superficial fascia. These anastomose with the superior, superficial, and deep epigastric venous systems to drain into the internal thoracic veins, which in turn drain into the brachiocephalic veins and the superior vena cava. After the initial inferior vena cava thrombosis, the veins of the anterior abdominal wall and other collateral pathways hypertrophy to accommodate the increase in blood flow. A 52-year-old woman visited her family physician with complaints of increasing lethargy and vomiting. The physician examined her and noted that compared to previous visits she had lost significant weight. She was also jaundiced, and on examination of the abdomen a well-defined 10-cm rounded mass was palpable below the liver edge in the right upper quadrant (Fig. 4.185)."

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

            "content": "Palpation can be accomplished by bimanual palpation, ballotment, and palpation from above (Middleton maneuver). For bimanual palpation, which is at least as reliable as the other techniques, the patient is supine with flexed knees. The examiner\u2019s left hand is placed on the lower rib cage and pulls the skin toward the costal margin, allowing the fingertips of the right hand to feel the tip of the spleen as it descends while the patient inspires slowly, smoothly, and deeply. Palpation is begun with the right hand in the left lower quadrant with gradual movement toward the left costal margin, thereby identifying the lower edge of a massively enlarged spleen. When the spleen tip is felt, the finding is recorded as centimeters below the left costal margin at some arbitrary point, i.e., 10\u201315 cm, from the midpoint of the umbilicus or the xiphisternal junction. This allows other examiners to compare findings or the initial examiner to determine changes in size over time. Bimanual palpation"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

            "content": "Clinically, ET is most often identified incidentally when a platelet count is obtained during the course of a routine medical evaluation. Occasionally, review of previous blood counts will reveal that an elevated platelet count was present but overlooked for many years. No symptoms or signs are specific for ET, but these patients can have hemorrhagic and thrombotic tendencies expressed as easy bruising for the former and microvascular occlusive events for the latter such as erythromelalgia, ocular migraine, or a TIA. Physical examination is generally unremarkable except occasionally for mild splenomegaly. Splenomegaly is indicative of another MPN, in particular PV, PMF, or CML."

The physician must eventually decide whether the lymphadenopathy is a normal finding or one that requires further study, up to and including biopsy. Soft, flat, submandibular nodes (<1 cm) are often palpable in healthy children and young adults; healthy adults may have palpable inguinal nodes of up to 2 cm, which are considered normal. Further evaluation of these normal nodes is not warranted. In contrast, if the physician believes the node(s) to be abnormal, then pursuit of a more precise diagnosis is needed.

One study from a family practice clinic evaluated 249 younger patients with \u201cenlarged lymph nodes, not infected\u201d or \u201clymphadenitis.\u201d No laboratory studies were obtained in 51%. When studies were performed, the most common were a complete blood count (CBC) (33%), throat culture (16%), chest x-ray (12%), or monospot test (10%). Only eight patients (3%) had a node biopsy, and half of those were normal or reactive. The CBC can provide useful data for the diagnosis of acute or chronic leukemias, EBV or CMV mononucleosis, lymphoma with a leukemic component, pyogenic infections, or immune cytopenias in illnesses such as SLE. Serologic studies may demonstrate antibodies specific to components of EBV, CMV, HIV, and other viruses; Toxoplasma gondii; Brucella; and so on. If SLE is suspected, antinuclear and anti-DNA antibody studies"
