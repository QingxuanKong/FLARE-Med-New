    "question": "A 12-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department 3 hours after the sudden onset of colicky abdominal pain and vomiting. The patient also manifests symptoms of redness and swelling of the face and lips without pruritus. Her symptoms began following a tooth extraction earlier in the morning. She had a similar episode of facial swelling after a bicycle accident 1 year ago, which resolved within 48 hours without treatment. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a nontender facial edema, erythema of the oral mucosa, and an enlarged tongue. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation over the lower quadrants. An abdominal ultrasound shows segmental thickening of the intestinal wall. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",

The patient has a history of a similar episode of facial swelling after a bicycle accident, which resolved without treatment. The abdominal ultrasound shows segmental thickening of the intestinal wall. The symptoms of facial swelling and redness, along with the abdominal findings, suggest a condition that involves the release of histamine or other mediators from mast cells. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a mast cell activation disorder, which is often triggered by tissue injury, infection, or surgery. The segmental thickening of the intestinal wall on ultrasound is also consistent with a mastocytosis, a condition characterized by the accumulation of mast cells in various tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract. The patient's history of a similar episode after a bicycle accident and the resolution without treatment suggest a condition that is triggered by physical trauma. Mast cell activation and mastocytosis are often associated with mast cell disorders, such as mastocytosis or mast cell activation syndrome. The symptoms of facial swelling and abdominal pain, along with the abdominal ultrasound findings, suggest that the most likely cause of this patient's condition is mastocytosis or mast cell activation syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Pulmonary abnormalities raise concern for aspiration of vomitus. Abdominal auscultation may reveal absent bowel sounds with ileus. High-pitched rushes suggest bowel obstruction, whereas a succussion splash upon abrupt lateral movement of the patient is found with gastroparesis or pyloric obstruction. Tenderness or involuntary guarding raises suspicion of inflammation, whereas fecal blood suggests mucosal injury from ulcer, ischemia, or tumor. Neurologic disease presents with papilledema, visual field loss, or focal neural abnormalities. Neoplasm is suggested by palpation of masses or adenopathy."

The examination should begin with a careful external inspection for abdominal distention, bruising or discoloration, abnormal veins, jaundice, surgical scars, and ostomies. Abnormalities of intensity and pitch of bowel sounds can occur with bowel obstruction. When palpating for tenderness, the examiner should note location, facial expression, guarding, and rebound tenderness. Palpation can also detect enlargement of the liver or spleen as well as feces and masses. If detected, organomegaly should be measured (with a tape measure), noting abnormal firmness or contour.

The secretion of parathyroid hormone rapidly decreased over the next 24 hours, resulting in increased excitability of peripheral nerves, manifest by carpopedal spasm and orofacial tingling. Muscle spasms can also be elicited by tapping the facial nerve [VII] as it emerges from the parotid gland to produce twitching of the facial muscles (Chvostek\u2019s sign).

The symptoms and signs of appendicitis can be similar to those of PID, but the nausea and emesis are often more prominent with appendicitis. The first symptom of appendicitis is typically diffuse abdominal pain, periumbilical pain, followed by anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Within a matter of hours, the pain generally shifts to the right lower quadrant. Fever, chills, emesis, and obstipation (no \ufb02atus or stool per rectum) may ensue. However, this classic symptom pattern is often absent. Atypical abdominal pain can occur when the appendix is retrocecal or entirely within the true pelvis (which occurs in 15% of the population).

Affected fish typically have a sharply metallic or peppery taste; however, they may be normal in appearance, color, and flavor. Not all persons who eat a contaminated fish necessarily become ill, perhaps because of uneven distribution of decay within the fish. Symptoms develop within 15\u201390 min of ingestion. Most cases are mild, with tingling of lips and mouth, mild abdominal discomfort, and nausea. The more severe and commonly described presentation includes flushing (sharply demarcated; exacerbated by ultraviolet exposure; particularly pronounced on the face, neck, and upper trunk), a sensation of warmth without elevated core temperature, conjunctival hyperemia, pruritus, urticaria, and angioneurotic edema. This syndrome may progress to bronchospasm, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, epigastric pain, abdominal cramps, dysphagia, headache, thirst, pharyngitis, gingival burning, palpitations,"

The tingling or burning sensation later changes to numbness. Other symptoms rapidly develop and include light-headedness, disequilibrium, incoordination, weakness, hyperreflexia, incoherence, dysarthria, sialorrhea, dysphagia, thirst, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, nystagmus, dysmetria, headache, diaphoresis, loss of vision, chest pain, and tachycardia. Flaccid paralysis and respiratory insufficiency may follow 2\u201312 h after ingestion. In the absence of hypoxia, the victim often remains alert but paralyzed. Up to 12% of patients die."

Diverticulitis is less likely to lead to perforation and peritonitis than is appendicitis. Fever, chills, and constipation typically are present, but anorexia and vomiting are uncommon. Bowel sounds are hypoactive and are substantially decreased with peritonitis related to a ruptured diverticular abscess. Abdominal examination reveals distention with left lower quadrant tenderness on direct palpation and localized rebound tenderness. Abdominal and bimanual rectovaginal examinations may reveal a poorly mobile, doughy in\ufb02ammatory mass in the left lower quadrant. Leukocytosis and fever are common. Stool guaiac may be positive as a result of in\ufb02ammation of the colon or microperforation."

Approximately 60\u201370% of patients report having experienced prior attacks that resolved spontaneously. As the episode progresses, however, the pain of acute cholecystitis becomes more generalized in the right upper abdomen. As with biliary colic, the pain of cholecystitis may radiate to the interscapular area, right scapula, or shoulder. Peritoneal signs of inflammation such as increased pain with jarring or on deep respiration may be apparent. The patient is anorectic and often nauseated. Vomiting is relatively common and may produce symptoms and signs of vascular and extracellular volume depletion. Jaundice is unusual early in the course of acute cholecystitis but may occur when edematous inflammatory changes involve the bile ducts and surrounding lymph nodes."

The onset of fever is followed by conjunctival erythema; mucosal changes, including dry, cracked lips and a strawberry tongue; cervical lymphadenopathy; and swelling of the hands and feet (Fig. 88-1). Conjunctivitis is bilateral, bulbar, and nonsuppurative. Cervical lymphadenopathy is found in 70% of children and should be greater than 1.5 cm in diameter for the purposes of diagnosis. A rash, which can vary in appearance, occurs in 80% of children with KD and may be particularly accentuated in the inguinal area and on the chest. Extreme irritability is prominent, especially in infants. Abdominal pain and hydrops of the gallbladder, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, sterile pyuria, and arthritis, particularly of medium-sized to large joints, may occur. Carditis in the acute phase may be manifested by tachycardia, shortness of breath, or overt congestive"
