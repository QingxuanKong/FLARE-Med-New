Hospice care is a type of palliative care that is specifically designed for patients who have a terminal illness and are not expected to survive for six months or more. The patient in this scenario has been diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma, which is a terminal illness. The patient has refused life-extending treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery, but requests palliative care without significant healthcare costs. To confirm the patient's eligibility for hospice care, we need to determine the patient's life expectancy without treatment. This can be done by discussing the patient's medical history, reviewing their test results, and assessing their overall health status. If the patient's life expectancy is indeed six months or less, the patient would qualify for hospice care. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to determine the patient's life expectancy without treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

At this ED visit, AK reports that he has been drinking heavily in the past day or so. He cannot recall having eaten anything in that time. There is evidence of recent vomiting, but no blood is apparent."

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

            "content": "The clinical presentation in adults is usually insidious and progressive. Epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, peripheral edema, and weight loss are signs and symptoms in patients with MD. Occult GI bleeding may occur, but overt bleeding is unusual and, when present, is due to superficial mucosal erosions. In fact, bleeding is more often seen in one of the common mimics of MD, gastric polyposis. Twenty to 100% of patients (depending on time of presentation) develop a protein-losing gastropathy due to hypersecretion of gastric mucus accompanied by hypoalbuminemia and edema. Gastric acid secretion is usually reduced or absent because of the decreased parietal cells. Large gastric folds are readily detectable by either radiographic (barium meal) or endoscopic methods. Endoscopy with deep mucosal biopsy, preferably full thickness with a snare technique, is required to establish the diagnosis and exclude other entities that may present similarly. A nondiagnostic biopsy may lead to"

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

Initial treatment is nasogastric suction, IV hydration and electrolyte repletion, and acid suppression. The diagnosis is confirmed by endoscopy. Most patients admitted to the hospital nowadays with obstructing ulcer disease require intervention, either balloon dilation or operation. Cancer must be ruled out because most patients who present with the symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction will have a pancreatic, gastric, or duodenal malignancy.Medical Treatment of Peptic Ulcer DiseasePPIs are the mainstay of medical therapy for PUD, but high-dose H2RAs and sucralfate are also quite effective. Patients hospitalized for ulcer complications should receive high-dose intravenous PPI and, when discharged, should be considered for lifelong PPIs unless the definitive cause is eliminated or a definitive operation"

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma occurs most often with long-standing tobacco or ethanol intake. Other risks include prior caustic ingestion, achalasia, and the hereditary disorder tylosis. Esophageal adenocarcinoma usually complicates prolonged acid reflux. Eight to 20% of GERD patients exhibit esophageal intestinal metaplasia, termed Barrett\u2019s metaplasia, a condition that predisposes to esophageal adenocarcinoma (Chap. 109). Gastric malignancies include adenocarcinoma, which is prevalent in certain Asian societies, and lymphoma."
