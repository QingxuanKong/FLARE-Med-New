    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with weakness. He states that it started yesterday and has been progressively worsening. Initially, he noticed blurry vision and some trouble speaking and swallowing but thought he was just coming down with a cold. He then noticed weakness of his facial muscles and shortness of breath. The patient works as a farmer and harvests and cans his own foods. He has had diarrhea recently and a cough prior to these symptoms of weakness. His temperature is 97.9\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 144/94 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a man who seems unable to smile with dysarthric speech. He takes shallow and weak breaths on pulmonary exam. The patient demonstrates 3/5 strength with diminished reflexes in his upper extremities. The patient is subsequently intubated. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with progressive weakness, including blurry vision, trouble speaking and swallowing, facial muscle weakness, and shortness of breath. These symptoms suggest a neuromuscular disorder. The patient's recent history of diarrhea and cough may be related to a gastrointestinal or respiratory infection. The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, including dysarthric speech, diminished reflexes, and 3/5 strength in the upper extremities, suggest a condition that affects the neuromuscular junction. The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with myasthenia gravis (MG), an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction and leads to fluctuating muscle weakness. The best treatment for MG is immunosuppression to reduce the immune system's attack on the acetylcholine receptor, which is the target of the autoantibodies. The most commonly used treatment is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasma exchange, but among the options provided, plasmapheresis is a procedure that can also be used to remove the autoantibodies from the blood and reduce the immune system's attack on the acetylcholine receptor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

After admission a bronchoscopy was carried out and sputum was aspirated from the left upper lobe bronchus. This was cultured in the laboratory and also viewed under the microscope and tuberculous bacilli (TB) were identified. A 68-year-old man came to his family physician complaining of discomfort when swallowing (dysphagia). The physician examined the patient and noted since his last visit he had lost approximately 18 lb over 6 months. Routine blood tests revealed the patient was anemic and he was referred to the gastroenterology unit. A diagnosis of esophageal cancer was made and the patient underwent a resection, which involved a chest and abdominal incision. After 4 years the patient remains well though still subject to follow-up."

As halothane or a similar inhalational anesthesia is induced, or succinylcholine is given for muscular relaxation, the jaw muscles unexpectedly become tense rather than relaxed and soon rigidity extends to all of the muscles. Thereafter, the body temperature rises to 42\u00e7C or 43\u00e7C and there is tachypnea and tachycardia. Blood pH may fall to 7 or below. There may be gross myoglobinuria and serum CK reaches extraordinarily high levels. Circulatory collapse and death may ensue in approximately 10 percent of cases, or the patient may survive with gradual recovery. In some cases there is the same sequence of events (increased temperature and acidosis) without muscular spasm. In cases of early death, the muscle may appear normal by light microscopy.

Typically symptoms start with numbness or paresthesia in the hands and feet, then a heavy, weak feeling in the legs. Weakness ascends to involve the arms, trunk, and bulbar muscles (tongue, pharynx, larynx). Deep tendon reflexes are absent even when strength is relatively preserved. Objective signs of sensory loss are usually minor compared with the dramatic weakness. Bulbar and respiratory insufficiency may progress rapidly. Dysfunction of autonomic nerves can lead to blood pressure changes, tachycardia and other arrhythmias, urinary retention or incontinence, or stool retention. This polyneuropathy can be difficult to distinguish from an acute spinal cord syndrome. Preservation of bowel and bladder function, loss of arm reflexes, absence of a sensory level, and lack of spinal tenderness point toward Guillain-Barr\u00e9"

Paresthesias and slight numbness in the toes and fingers are the earliest symptoms; only infrequently are they absent throughout the illness. The major clinical manifestation is weakness that evolves more or less symmetrically over a period of several days to a week or two, or somewhat longer. The proximal as well as distal muscles of the limbs are involved, usually the lower extremities before the upper (thus the older term Landry ascending paralysis); the trunk, intercostal, neck, and cranial muscles may be affected later. Weakness progresses in approximately 5 percent of patients to total motor paralysis with respiratory failure within a few days. In severe cases, the ocular motor nerves are paralyzed and even the pupils may be unreactive."

Weakness typically evolves over hours to a few days and is frequently accompanied by tingling dysesthesias in the extremities. The legs are usually more affected than the arms, and facial diparesis is present in 50% of affected individuals. The lower cranial nerves are also frequently involved, causing bulbar weakness with difficulty handling secretions and maintaining an airway; the diagnosis in these patients may initially be mistaken for brainstem ischemia. Pain in the neck, shoulder, back, or diffusely over the spine is also common in the early stages of GBS, occurring in ~50% of patients.

Bulbar paralysis may lead to dysphagia, difficulty in handling secretions, or dysphonia. Respiratory insufficiency due to aspiration, involvement of the respiratory center in the medulla, or paralysis of the phrenic or intercostal nerves may develop, and severe medullary involvement may lead to circulatory collapse.

Once the diaphragm fails, movements of the chest wall and abdomen become paradoxical (the abdomen moves inward during inspiration) or there may be shallow excursions of the chest, alternating with paradoxical movements as discussed in Chap. 25 where the characteristics of neuromuscular respiratory failure are described. In an emergency, after clearing of the airway, such a patient can be supported briefly by a tight-fitting face mask and manual bag (Ambu) breathing. The chest wall will be very compliant as a result of muscular weakness."

Asking the patient to count aloud on 1 maximal breath can help detect diaphragmatic weakness (counting to 20 equates with a vital capacity of approximately 2 L). Paradoxical inward movement of the abdomen with inspiration is another sign of diaphragm weakness.

He is rushed to a nearby level 1 trauma center where he is found to have multiple facial fractures, a severe, unstable cervical spine injury, and significant left eye trauma. Further examination of his left eye reveals rupture of his globe. The ophthalmolo-gist requests emergency surgery to repair and save his eye. Because the patient has suffered a recent trauma, you decide to perform a rapid sequence intubation in preparation for the surgical procedure. What muscle relaxant would you use to facilitate tracheal intubation? What is the proper dose for your chosen muscle relaxant? After intravenous infusion of your chosen muscle relaxant, you are unable to adequately visualize the patient\u2019s larynx and vocal cords and cannot successfully pass an endotracheal tube. You switch to mask ventilation but are barely able to mask ventilate the patient, and you become worried"

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

A 50-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with severe lower back pain that had started several days ago. In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."

            "content": "A 45-year-old man came to his physician complaining of pain and weakness in his right shoulder. The pain began after a fall on his outstretched hand approximately 6 months previously. The patient recalled having some minor shoulder tenderness but no other specific symptoms. He was otherwise fit and well. On examination of the shoulder, there was marked wasting of the muscles in the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae. The patient found initiation of abduction difficult and there was a weakness of lateral rotation of the humerus. The wasted muscles were the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The cause of the muscle wasting was disuse. Muscle atrophy (wasting) occurs through a variety of disorders. Disuse atrophy is one of the most common causes. Examples of disuse atrophy include the loss of muscle bulk after fracture immobilization in a plaster cast. The opposite effect can also be demonstrated\u2014when muscles are overused they become bulkier (hypertrophy)."

The patient had noted progressive weakness over several days, to the point that he was unable to rise from bed. Past medical history was notable for small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, liver, and adrenals. The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced. Blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, increasing to 160/98 mmHg after 1 L of saline, with a JVP at 8 cm. There was generalized muscle weakness.
