    "question": "A 60-year-old female presents to her gynecologist with vaginal bleeding. She underwent menopause ten years prior. She has a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. On physical examination, her uterus is uniformly enlarged. Ultrasound reveals a thickened endometrial stripe and tissue biopsy reveals neoplastic endometrial cells. A workup for metastatic disease is negative and the gynecologist recommends a laparoscopic hysterectomy. During the procedure, the surgeon ligates multiple vessels in order to remove the entire uterus. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient develops left-sided flank pain and oliguria. Serum creatinine is found to be 1.4 mg/dl whereas it was 1.0 mg/dl prior to the operation. Renal ultrasound is normal. Urinalysis is notable for hematuria.

The patient underwent a laparoscopic hysterectomy due to a diagnosis of endometrial cancer. During the procedure, the surgeon ligated multiple vessels to remove the entire uterus. The patient developed left-sided flank pain and oliguria after the surgery, with an increase in serum creatinine levels and hematuria. We need to identify which vessel was likely ligated and caused this complication.\\n\\nThe patient's symptoms suggest renal impairment, which is consistent with a postoperative hemorrhage leading to acute kidney injury (AKI). The ligated vessel is likely to be the cause of this complication.\\n\\nThe options provided are all blood vessels that can be ligated during a hysterectomy. However, the location of the flank pain and oliguria suggests that the affected kidney is on the left side. This information can help us narrow down the options.\\n\\nThe superior vesical artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery that supplies blood to the bladder and the lower part of the uterus. It is located on the right side and is less likely to be the cause of the left-sided flank pain and oliguria.\\n\\nThe ovarian artery is a branch of the abdominal aorta that supplies blood to the ovaries. While it is possible that the ovarian artery could be ligated during a hysterectomy, it is less likely to cause left-sided flank pain and oliguria.\\n\\nThe artery of Sampson is a small artery that supplies blood to the uterus and is not typically ligated during a hysterectomy.\\n\\nThe uterine artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery that supplies blood to the uterus. It is a common vessel to be ligated during a hysterectomy, and its ligation can cause significant bleeding. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a postoperative hemorrhage, and the uterine artery is a likely candidate for the ligated vessel.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely ligated vessel that contributed to this patient's condition is the uterine artery.\\n\\nAnswer: D\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

In the presence of very large fibroids, renal ultrasound or computed tomography urogram can be considered to rule out significant hydronephrosis. For a symptomatic woman who desires future fertility and her primary symptom is abnormal bleeding, baseline hemoglobin measurement should be considered because accommodation to anemia can occur. If indicated, further evaluation of the endometrium with endometrial biopsy can be performed. Evaluation of the uterine cavity with saline-infusion sonography, hysteroscopy, or MRI can help determine the appropriate treatment options. If the cavity is deformed, myomectomy (hysteroscopic or abdominal) should be considered."

Most women recognize the importance of this symptom and seek medical consultation within 3 months. Some women experience pelvic pressure or discomfort indicative of uterine enlargement or extrauterine disease spread. Bleeding may not have occurred because of cervical stenosis, especially in older patients, and may be associated with hematometra or pyometra, causing a purulent vaginal discharge.

This syndrome results from residual ovarian cortical tissue that is left in situ after a difficult dissection in an attempt to perform an oophorectomy. This tissue can become encased in adhesions and result in painful cysts. Often, the patient had multiple pelvic operations with the uterus and adnexa removed sequentially. Laparoscopic oophorectomy, combined with a difficult dissection, is a strong risk factor. Residual ovary syndrome is uncommon considering the number of women undergoing hysterectomy with ovarian preservation. Theoretically, after a hysterectomy with one or both ovaries intentionally left in situ, adhesions develop and encase the ovaries, then cyclical expansion of the ovaries can result in pain and, in some cases, a tender persistent mass."

She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

            "content": "Vaginal Bleeding Vaginal bleeding is the most common symptom causing patients to Mole seek treatment for complete molar pregnancy. It had been reported to occur in 97% of cases, whereas currently it is reported to occur in 84% of patients. Molar tissues may separate from the decidua and disrupt maternal vessels, and large volumes of retained blood may distend the endometrial cavity. Because vaginal bleeding may be considerable and prolonged, one-half of these patients had anemia (hemoglobin <10 g/100 mL). Anemia is present in only 5% of patients. Excessive Uterine Size Excessive uterine enlargement relative to gestational age is one of the classic signs of a complete mole, although it was present in only about half of patients."

A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative."

            "content": "Acute Hemorrhage Occasionally, a large lesion can produce life-threatening hemorrhage. A biopsy of the lesion should be performed to verify neoplasia, and a vaginal pack soaked in Monsel\u2019s solution (ferric subsulfate) should be packed tightly against the cervix. After proper evaluation, external radiation therapy can be started with the expectation that control of bleeding may require 8 to 10 daily treatments at 180 to 200 cGy per day. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be used to reduce the incidence of infection. If the patient becomes febrile, the pack should be removed. Rapid replacement of the pack may be necessary, and a fresh pack should be immediately available. This approach to management of hemorrhage in patients previously untreated is preferable to exploration and vascular ligation. Vascular embolization under \ufb02uoroscopic control may be required in severe cases, and this procedure may obviate a laparotomy. However, vascular occlusion ultimately may lead to decreased blood"

            "content": "Other Studies Endometrial sampling with an endometrial biopsy or hysteroscopy is mandatory when both pelvic mass and abnormal bleeding are present. An endometrial lesion\u2014carcinoma or hyperplasia\u2014may coexist with a benign mass such as a leiomyoma. In Figure 14.23 Transvaginal pelvic ultrasound demonstrating multiple uterine leiomyomas. a woman with leiomyomas, abnormal bleeding cannot be assumed to be caused solely by the fibroids. Clinicians differ in recommendations about the need for endometrial biopsy when the diagnosis is leiomyomas with regular menses. If urinary symptoms are prominent, studies of the urinary tract may be necessary, including urodynamic testing, if incontinence or symptoms of pelvic pressure are present. Cystoscopy may be necessary or appropriate to rule out intrinsic bladder lesions."

Neither the patient nor the family physician had any concerns about the pregnancy. However, the patient did complain of unilateral swelling of her left leg, which had gradually increased over the previous 2 days. Furthermore, the evening before her visit she developed some sharp chest pain, which was exacerbated by deep breaths. The family physician ordered a duplex ultrasound scan of the left leg venous system. Ultrasound scanning of the vascular tree can demonstrate flow and occlusion of arteries and veins."
