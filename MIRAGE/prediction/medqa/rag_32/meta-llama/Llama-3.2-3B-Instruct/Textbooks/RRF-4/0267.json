    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to understand the inheritance pattern of hemophilia A. Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder, which means that the mutated gene responsible for the disease is located on the X chromosome. The disease affects mostly males, as they have only one X chromosome. Females can be carriers of the disease, but they are usually asymptomatic unless they are homozygous for the mutated gene. Given that the 34-year-old male has hemophilia A and his wife has three unaffected daughters, we can deduce the following: 1. The male is homozygous for the mutated gene, as he has the disease. 2. The female is heterozygous for the mutated gene, as she has three unaffected daughters. 3. Each daughter can be either homozygous or heterozygous for the mutated gene. 4. The probability that a daughter is a carrier (heterozygous) is 100%, as all daughters have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene from the mother. However, we need to consider the probability that the second daughter is a carrier. Since each daughter has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene from the mother, the probability that the second daughter is a carrier is also 50%.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Family history of the disease is absent in ~30% of cases, and in these cases, 80% of the mothers are carriers of the de novo mutated allele. More than 500 different mutations have been identified in the F8 or F9 genes of patients with hemophilia A or B, respectively. One of the most common hemophilia A mutations results from an inversion of the intron 22 sequence, and it is present in 40% of cases of severe hemophilia A. Advances in molecular diagnosis now permit precise identification of mutations, allowing accurate diagnosis of women carriers of the hemophilia gene in affected families."

A son inherits the Y chromosome from his father and one maternal X chromosome. Thus, the characteristic features of X-linked inheritance are (1) the absence of father-to-son transmission, and (2) the fact that all daughters of an affected male are obligate carriers of the mutant allele (Fig. 82-13C). The risk of developing disease due to a mutant X-chromosomal gene differs in the two sexes. Because males have only one X chromosome, they are hemizygous for the mutant allele; thus, they are more likely to develop the mutant phenotype, regardless of whether the mutation is dominant or recessive. A female may be either heterozygous or homozygous for the mutant allele, which may be dominant or recessive. The terms X-linked dominant or X-linked recessive are therefore only applicable to expression of the mutant"

De novo germline mutations occur more frequently during later cell divisions in gametogenesis, which explains why siblings are rarely affected. As noted before, new germline mutations occur more frequently in fathers of advanced age. For example, the average age of fathers with new germline mutations that cause Marfan\u2019s syndrome is ~37 years, whereas fathers who transmit the disease by inheritance have an average age of ~30 years."

Most X-linked diseases are recessive. Common examples include color blindness, hemophilia A and B, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. Males with an X-linked recessive gene are usually afected by the disease it causes, because they lack a second X chromosome to express the normal dominant gene. A male with an X-linked disease cannot have afected sons because they cannot receive his X chromosome.

Indeed, even with higher levels, carriers are reported to be at increased risk for bleeding complications (Olsson, 2014).

They frequently involve enzymes in metabolic pathways, receptors, or proteins in signaling cascades. In an autosomal recessive disease, the affected individual, who can be of either sex, is a homozygote or compound heterozygote for a single-gene defect. With a few important exceptions, autosomal recessive diseases are rare and often occur in the context of parental consanguinity. The relatively high frequency of certain recessive disorders such as sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and thalassemia, is partially explained by a selective biologic advantage for the heterozygous state (see below). Although heterozygous carriers of a defective allele are usually clinically normal, they may display subtle differences in phenotype that only become apparent with more precise testing or in the context of certain environmental influences. In sickle the offspring of"

If a single copy of a gene bearing a mutation is sufficient to cause disease and that gene is not on one of the sex chromosomes, that condition is inherited in an AD fashion (Table 47-1). In AD disorders, an affected parent has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each child (Fig. 47-2; Table 47-2). Possessing one working gene and one nonworking gene is termed heterozygous. If both copies are the same, they are referred to as homozygous."

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

Hemophilia A, which accounts for 80% of all hemophilia, results from deficiency of FVIII, whereas deficiency of FIX results in hemophilia B. Each deficiency is characterized by decreased and delayed ability to clot and/or formation of abnormally friable (easily disrupted) clots. This can be manifested, for example, by bleeding into the joints (Fig. 35.10). The extent of the factor deficiency determines the severity of the disease. Current treatment for hemophilia is factor replacement therapy using FVIII or FIX obtained from pooled human blood or from recombinant DNA technology. However, antibodies to the factors can develop. Gene therapy is a goal. Because the genes for both proteins are on the X chromosome, hemophilia is an X-linked disorder. [Note: Deficiency of FXI results in a bleeding disorder that sometimes is referred to as hemophilia C.] with hemophilia."
