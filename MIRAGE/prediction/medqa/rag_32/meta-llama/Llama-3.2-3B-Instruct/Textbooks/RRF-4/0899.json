    "question": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother after she found him somnolent at home next to multiple open pill bottles. The boy had seemingly opened several different pill bottles that were in a cabinet in his parent\u2019s bathroom. The mother has brought the empty bottles to the emergency room, and they include aspirin, metoprolol, acetaminophen, levothyroxine, and lorazepam. The boy has no past medical history and takes no medications. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/65 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 28/min. On exam, the boy is lethargic but responsive. He appears to be grasping at his ears and swaying from side-to-side when attempting to ambulate. He vomited once in the emergency room. Which of the following arterial blood gas readings is most likely to be found in this patient?",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To approach this question, we need to consider the potential effects of the various medications listed on the arterial blood gas (ABG) values. The patient has ingested multiple medications, including aspirin, metoprolol, acetaminophen, levothyroxine, and lorazepam. The primary concern is the potential for acidosis and respiratory depression due to the ingestion of these medications. Aspirin can cause respiratory acidosis due to its effect on the respiratory center in the brain. Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, can also cause respiratory depression. Acetaminophen overdose can lead to metabolic acidosis. Levothyroxine, a thyroid hormone, can cause respiratory alkalosis. Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, can cause respiratory depression. Considering these effects, the most likely ABG reading in this patient would be acidotic, with a low PCO2 (indicating hypoventilation) and a low HCO3- (indicating metabolic acidosis). The correct answer is A. pH 7.29, PCO2 47 mmHg, and HCO3- 22 mEq/L. This profile is consistent with respiratory acidosis and metabolic acidosis. Here is the answer in the required format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has ingested multiple medications, including aspirin, metoprolol, acetaminophen, levothyroxine, and lorazepam.

            "content": "A 65-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe central chest pain that radiated to the neck and predominantly to the left arm. He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

Chronic low-level exposure may cause \ufb02 ulike symptoms with generalized myalgias, nausea, and headaches. Ask about symptoms in others living in the same house. Suspect smoke inhalation in the presence of singed nose hairs, facial burns, hoarseness, wheezing, or carbonaceous sputum. Check an ABG and serum carboxyhemoglobin level (normal is < 5% in nonsmokers and < 10% in smokers). Check an ECG in the elderly and in patients with a history of cardiac disease."
