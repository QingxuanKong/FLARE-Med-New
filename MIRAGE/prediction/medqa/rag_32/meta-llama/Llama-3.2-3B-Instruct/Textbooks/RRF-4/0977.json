The patient is a 77-year-old man with brown, greasy appearing lesions on his forehead that he can't seem to peel off. This information suggests a skin condition that is benign and possibly benign growth. Seborrheic keratosis (B) is a common benign skin growth that is often brown or black and can be greasy in appearance. It is also common in older adults. Melanoma (A) is a type of skin cancer that can appear as a new mole or change in an existing mole, but it is typically not greasy in appearance. Acanthosis nigricans (C) is a skin condition characterized by dark, velvety skin patches, typically in the folds and creases of the body, and is not typically found on the forehead. Erythema nodosum (D) is a type of skin inflammation that can cause painful, red nodules on the skin, but it is not typically described as greasy in appearance. Based on the description of the lesions, seborrheic keratosis is the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

It is advantageous because no special instrumentation is necessary and because the skin can be biopsied with little morbidity. However, the casual observer can be misled by a variety of stimuli and overlook important, subtle signs of skin or systemic disease. For instance, the sometimes minor differences in color and shape that distinguish a melanoma (Fig. 70-1) from a benign nevomelanocytic nevus (Fig. 70-2) can be difficult to recognize. A variety of descriptive terms have been developed that characterize cutaneous lesions (Tables 70-1, 70-2, and Tables 70-3; Fig. 70-3), thereby aiding in their interpretation and in the formulation of a differential diagnosis (Table 70-4). For example, the finding of scaling"

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

The initial lesions often appear on the genitalia, where they are ulcerated. \u25a0Although most cases resolve spontaneously over 6\u201318 months, those with oral involvement have a more chronic course. Dx: Histology reveals a \u201clichenoid pattern\u201d\u2014i.e., a band of T lymphocytes at the epidermal-dermal junction with damage to the basal layer. Tx: Mild cases can be treated with topical corticosteroids. For severe disease, systemic corticosteroids may be used. Tretinoin gel may be helpful on oral mucosa."

The patient\u2019s temperature was normal. He explained that the episode had occurred following a birthday party at which he had participated in an ice cream\u2013eating contest. The patient reported prior episodes of a similar nature following ingestion of a significant amount of dairy products. This clinical picture is most probably due to a deficiency in the activity of: A. isomaltase. B. lactase. C. pancreatic \u03b1-amylase. D. salivary \u03b1-amylase. E. sucrase. Correct answer = B. The physical symptoms suggest a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for carbohydrate degradation. The symptoms observed following the ingestion of dairy products suggest that the patient is deficient in lactase as a result of the age-dependent reduction in expression of the enzyme."

However, read the question and the choices carefully before looking at the illustration, because the history will help you identify the pathologic process. Flip through an illustrated pathology textbook, color atlases, and appropriate Web sites in order to look at the pictures in the days before the exam. Pay attention to potential clues such as age, sex, ethnicity, occupation, recent activities and exposures, and specialized lab tests."
