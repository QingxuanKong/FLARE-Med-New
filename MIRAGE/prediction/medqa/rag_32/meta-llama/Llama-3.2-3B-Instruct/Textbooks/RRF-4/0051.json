    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the underlying etiology of the patient's hypertension, we need to analyze the laboratory values and medical history provided. The patient has a history of hypertension, which is not new, and has not changed his medication regimen recently. The current blood pressure is 174/111 mmHg, which is significantly elevated. The laboratory values show a normal serum sodium level, slightly low potassium level (3.3 mEq/L), and a normal bicarbonate level. The BUN is slightly elevated, but the glucose level is within the normal range. Given these values, we need to consider the potential causes of hypertension in this patient.\\n\\nThe patient's history of hypertension and the lack of recent changes to his medication regimen suggest that the hypertension may be related to a non-adrenal cause. The slightly low potassium level could be related to renal function or other factors. The normal bicarbonate level and BUN level suggest that the patient does not have significant metabolic acidosis or renal impairment. \\n\\nConsidering the options provided, impaired kidney perfusion is a plausible cause of hypertension in this patient. The elevated BUN level could be related to decreased renal perfusion, which can lead to hypertension. This is a common cause of secondary hypertension, especially in patients with pre-existing hypertension. The patient's medical history of hypertension and the lack of recent changes to his medication regimen support this possibility.\\n\\nThe other options are less likely. Aldosterone excess (A) would typically present with hypokalemia, which is not present in this patient. A catecholamine-secreting mass (B) would typically present with symptoms of excess catecholamines, such as tachycardia, sweating, and hypertension, which are not present in this patient. Cortisol excess (C) would typically present with Cushing's syndrome, which is not suspected in this patient.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension is impaired kidney perfusion.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"D\"}}",

His physician initially prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic commonly used to treat hyper-tension. His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic. Because the patient had elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, hydrochlorothiazide was replaced with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril lowered his blood pressure to almost normotensive levels. However, after several weeks on enalapril, the patient returned complaining of a persistent cough. In addition, some signs of angioedema were detected. How does enalapril lower blood pressure? Why does it occasionally cause coughing and angioedema?

            "content": "A 66-year-old obese Caucasian man presented to an academic Diabetes Center for advice regarding his diabetes treatment. His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."

Most notable are the marked hyperglycemia (plasma glucose may be >55.5 mmol/L [1000 mg/dL]), hyperosmolality (>350 mosmol/L), and prerenal azotemia. The measured serum sodium may be normal or slightly low despite the marked hyperglycemia. The corrected serum sodium is usually increased (add 1.6 meq to measured sodium for each 5.6-mmol/L [100-mg/dL] rise in the serum glucose). In contrast to DKA, acidosis and ketonemia are absent or mild. A small anion-gap metabolic acidosis may be present secondary to increased lactic acid. Moderate ketonuria, if present, is secondary to starvation."

            "content": "History and physical examination provide little information about the diagnosis. The age at the time of diagnosis is generally the third through fifth decade. Hypertension is usually mild to moderate but occasionally may be severe; primary aldosteronism should be considered in all patients with refractory hypertension. Hypertension in these patients may be associated with glucose intolerance. Most patients are asymptomatic; however, infrequently, polyuria, polydipsia, paresthesias, or muscle weakness may be present as a consequence of hypokalemic alkalosis. Although aldosterone is a salt-retaining hormone, patients with primary aldosteronism rarely have edema. Renal dysfunction and cardiovascular disease are strikingly increased in patients with primary aldosteronism compared to those with primary hypertension."

            "content": "Diagnostic Evaluation A careful history will usually determine the etiologic cause of hypovolemia. Symptoms of hypovolemia are nonspecific and include fatigue, weakness, thirst, and postural dizziness; more severe symptoms and signs include oliguria, cyanosis, abdominal and chest pain, and confusion or obtundation. Associated electrolyte disorders may cause additional symptoms, for example, muscle weakness in patients with hypokalemia. On examination, diminished skin turgor and dry oral mucous membranes are less than ideal markers of a decreased ECFV in adult patients; more reliable signs of hypovolemia include a decreased jugular venous pressure (JVP), orthostatic tachycardia (an increase of >15\u201320 beats/min upon standing), and orthostatic hypotension (a >10\u201320 mmHg drop in blood pressure on standing). More severe fluid loss leads to hypovolemic shock, with hypotension, tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction, and peripheral hypoperfusion; these patients may exhibit peripheral"

            "content": "The term resistant hypertension refers to patients with blood pressures persistently >140/90 mmHg despite taking three or more antihypertensive agents, including a diuretic. Resistant or difficultto-control hypertension is more common in patients >60 years than in younger patients. Resistant hypertension may be related to \u201cpseudoresistance\u201d (high office blood pressures and lower home blood pressures), nonadherence to therapy, identifiable causes of hypertension (including obesity and excessive alcohol intake), and the use of any of a number of nonprescription and prescription drugs (Table 298-3). Rarely, in older patients, pseudohypertension may be related to the inability to measure blood pressure accurately in severely sclerotic arteries. This condition is suggested if the radial pulse remains palpable despite occlusion of the brachial artery by the cuff (Osler maneuver). The actual blood pressure can be determined by direct intra-arterial measurement. Evaluation of patients with"
