    "question": "Three days after admission to the intensive care unit for septic shock and bacteremia from a urinary tract infection, a 34-year-old woman has persistent hypotension. Her blood cultures are positive for Escherichia coli, for which she has been receiving appropriate antibiotics since admission. She has no history of any serious illness. She does not use illicit drugs. Current medications include norepinephrine, ceftriaxone, and acetaminophen. She appears well. Her temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), heart rate is 96/min, and blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. Examination of the back shows costovertebral tenderness bilaterally. Examination of the thyroid gland shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:\n  Hospital day 1 Hospital day 3\nLeukocyte count 18,500/mm3 10,300/mm3\nHemoglobin 14.1 mg/dL 13.4 mg/dL\nSerum\nCreatinine 1.4 mg/dL 0.9 mg/dL\nFasting glucose 95 mg/dL 100 mg/dL\nTSH   1.8 \u00b5U/mL\nT3, free   0.1 ng/dL\nT4, free   0.9 ng/dL\nRepeat blood cultures are negative.

She has persistent hypotension, and her blood cultures are positive for Escherichia coli. She appears well, but her laboratory studies show a decrease in leukocyte count and hemoglobin, which may indicate a side effect of the antibiotics or a complication of the infection. The TSH and free T3 and T4 levels are within normal limits, which makes it unlikely that the hypotension is related to thyroid dysfunction. The chest X-ray shows no abnormalities, which makes it unlikely that the hypotension is related to a pulmonary cause. The most likely cause of the hypotension in this patient is a side effect of the antibiotics or a complication of the infection. The patient should be closely monitored for signs of sepsis or organ dysfunction, and the underlying illness should be treated appropriately. The patient should also be considered for discontinuation of the current antibiotics and initiation of new antibiotics if necessary. The patient should also be considered for fluid resuscitation and other supportive measures to manage hypotension. The patient should be closely monitored for signs of thyroid dysfunction, as the TSH and free T3 and T4 levels were reported as 1.8 \\u00b5U/mL, 0.1 ng/dL, and 0.9 ng/dL, respectively, which is slightly elevated. However, this is not the most likely cause of the hypotension in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

These signs can support the diagnosis of IHD and are important in assessing the degree of cardiac damage.

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

Clinically, S. aureus sepsis presents in a manner similar to that documented for sepsis due to other bacteria.
