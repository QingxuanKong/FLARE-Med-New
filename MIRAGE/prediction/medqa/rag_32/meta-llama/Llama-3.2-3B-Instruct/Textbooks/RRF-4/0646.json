She has no complaints and her past medical history is notable for diabetes and hypertension. During this visit, the patient undergoes screening procedures per guidelines including a mammogram. On the screening mammogram a spiculated, irregular mass is found on the left breast. Further diagnostic mammography and biopsy reveal ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. Which of the following is the most important factor in determining this patient\u2019s prognosis?",

Ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer, accounting for about 70-80\\% of cases. The prognosis of breast cancer is generally determined by several factors, including tumor grade, tumor stage, and lymph node involvement. However, among the options provided, tumor grade and age are the most relevant factors in determining the prognosis. Tumor grade refers to the appearance of the tumor cells under a microscope, with higher grades indicating more aggressive tumors. Age is also an important factor, as younger patients tend to have more aggressive tumors and poorer prognosis. Location of the tumor on the breast is not a significant factor in determining prognosis. Therefore, the correct answer is either A (Tumor grade) or C (Age).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Diagnostic mammography is aimed at evaluating the rest of the breast before biopsy is performed or occasionally is part of the triple-test strategy to exclude immediate biopsy. Subtle abnormalities that are first detected by screening mammography should be evaluated carefully by compression or magnified views. These abnormalities include clustered microcalcifications, densities (especially if spiculated), and new or enlarging architectural distortion. For some nonpalpable lesions, ultrasound may be helpful either to identify cysts or to guide biopsy. If there is no palpable lesion and detailed mammographic studies are unequivocally benign, the patient should have routine follow-up appropriate to the patient\u2019s age. It cannot be stressed too strongly that in the presence of a breast lump a negative mammogram does not rule out cancer."

For other tests such as Pap smears, a false-positive result occurs because the test identifies a wide range of potentially premalignant states, only a small percentage of which would ever progress to an invasive cancer.

The sensitivity of mammography is 75%, with a specificity of 92.3% depending on the patient\u2019s age; breast density; use of hormone therapy; and the size, location, and mammographic appearance of the tumor (49). Mammography is less sensitive in young women with dense breast tissue than in older women, who tend to have fatty breasts, in which mammography can detect at least 90% of malignancies (50).

A meta-analysis of eight large randomized trials showed a 15% relative reduction in mortality (relative risk 0.85; 95% confidence interval 0.75\u20130.96) from mammography screening for women age 39\u201349 years after 11\u201320 years of follow-up. This is equivalent to a number needed to invite to screening of 1904 over 10 years to prevent one breast cancer death. At the same time, nearly half of women age 40\u201349 years screened annually will have false-positive mammograms necessitating further evaluation, often including biopsy. Estimates of overdiagnosis range from 10 to 40% of diagnosed invasive cancers. In the United States, widespread screening over the last several decades has not been accompanied by a reduction in incidence of metastatic breast cancer despite a large increase in early-stage disease, suggesting a substantial amount of overdiagnosis at the population level."

Low risk women (less than 15% lifetime risk) are not recommended to undergo additional MRI screening."

            "content": "A number of trials have suggested that annual or biennial screening with mammography or mammography plus clinical breast examination in normal-risk women older than age 50 years decreases breast cancer mortality. Each trial has been criticized for design flaws. In most trials, breast cancer mortality rate is decreased by 15\u201330%. Experts disagree on whether average-risk women age 40\u201349 years should receive regular screening (Table 100-3). The U.K. Age Trial, the only randomized trial of breast cancer screening to specifically evaluate the impact of mammography in women age 40\u201349 years, found no statistically significant difference in breast cancer mortality for screened women versus controls after about 11 years of follow-up (relative risk 0.83; 95% confidence interval 0.66\u20131.04); however, <70% of women received screening in the intervention arm, potentially diluting the observed effect.

If the breast is large, a pillow or towel may be placed beneath the scapula to elevate the side being examined; otherwise, the breast tends to fall to the side, making palpation of the lateral hemisphere more difficult. The major features to be identified on palpation of the breast are temperature, texture and thickness of skin, generalized or focal tenderness, nodularity, density, asymmetry, dominant masses, and nipple discharge. Most premenopausal patients have normally nodular breast parenchyma. The nodularity is diffuse but predominantly in the upper outer quadrants, where there is more breast tissue. These benign parenchymal nodules are small, similar in size, and indistinct. By comparison, breast cancer usually occurs in the form of a nontender, firm mass with irregular margins. A cancerous mass feels distinctly"
