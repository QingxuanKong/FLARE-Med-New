    "question": "A 78-year-old woman presents to the office for an annual health check-up with her family physician accompanied by her daughter. She has no complaints during this visit but her daughter states that she is having difficulty locating objects such as the television remote, car keys, and her purse. Her medical history is significant for Alzheimer\u2019s dementia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis and centrilobular emphysema. The patient takes memantine, atorvastatin, metformin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, aspirin, albuterol, and ipratropium. The patient\u2019s vitals are within normal limits today. Physical exam reveals an elderly female in no acute distress, oriented to person, place and year, but not to month or day of the week. She has a 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border along with an S3 gallop. There are mild crackles at the lung bases. The remainder of the exam is normal. A previous urine culture reports growth of > 100,000 CFU of Enterobacter. Urinalysis findings are offered below:\nLeukocyte esterase  positive\nWBCs 50-100 cell/HPF\nNitrites positive\nRBCs 2 cell/HPF\nEpithelial cells 2 cell/HPF\nUrine pH 5.7\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate next step?",

    "predict": "To solve this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms, medical history, and laboratory results to determine the most appropriate next step in management. Step 1: Analyze the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient is an elderly woman with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis, and centrilobular emphysema. She presents with no complaints during the annual health check-up, but her daughter reports difficulty locating objects, suggesting possible cognitive impairment. Step 2: Review the patient's medication list. The patient takes memantine, atorvastatin, metformin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, aspirin, albuterol, and ipratropium. These medications are not directly relevant to the current symptoms. Step 3: Examine the physical exam findings. The patient is oriented to person, place, and year but not to month or day of the week, indicating possible cognitive impairment. The presence of a 3/6 holosystolic murmur and S3 gallop suggests heart failure. Mild crackles at the lung bases may indicate pulmonary congestion. Step 4: Review the laboratory results. The urine culture reports growth of > 100,000 CFU of Enterobacter, leukocyte esterase positive, WBCs 50-100 cell/HPF, nitrites positive, RBCs 2 cell/HPF, and epithelial cells 2 cell/HPF. The urine pH is 5.7. Step 5: Determine the most appropriate next step. Based on the presence of a urinary tract infection (UTI) indicated by the positive urine culture and clinical symptoms, the most appropriate next step is to initiate empiric antibiotic therapy. Step 6: Choose the most effective antibiotic for UTI. Given the patient's age, medical history, and laboratory results, a broad-spectrum antibiotic is necessary to cover common UTI pathogens. The options are: A. TMP-SMX (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) B. Nitrofurantoin C. Levofloxacin Considering the patient's age and medical history, TMP-SMX is a suitable choice for empiric treatment of UTI in older adults. The final answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory results indicative of a urinary tract infection. Given her age and medical history, a broad-spectrum antibiotic such as TMP-SMX is an appropriate choice for empiric treatment of UTI in older adults.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

A group of laboratory values can conveniently be obtained with a single specimen at relatively low cost. Screening tests are most informative when they are directed toward common diseases or disorders and when their results indicate whether other useful\u2014but often costly\u2014tests or interventions are needed. On the one hand, biochemical measurements, together with simple laboratory determinations such as blood count, urinalysis, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, often provide a major clue to the presence of a pathologic process. On the other hand, the physician must learn to evaluate occasional screening-test abnormalities that do not necessarily connote significant disease. An in-depth workup after the report of an isolated laboratory abnormality in a person who is otherwise well is almost invariably wasteful and unproductive. Because so many tests are performed"

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a"

            "content": "Management If outpatient management is appropriate, the patient should be instructed to limit her activity, to weigh herself daily, and to monitor her \ufb02uid intake (at least 1 L per day of mostly electrolyte-balanced \ufb02uid) and output. Daily follow-up by telephone or visit is important and the patient should be reassessed if she notes worsening of the symptoms or if her weight gain increases to more than 2 lb per day. Indications for hospitalization include an inability to tolerate oral hydration, hemodynamic instability, respiratory compromise, tense ascites, hemoconcentration, leukocytosis, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, abnormal renal or liver function, and decreased oxygen saturation. Fluid intake and urine output need to be carefully measured, and admission to an intensive care setting can be considered if the patient has hyperkalemia, renal failure, respiratory failure, or thromboembolic disease. Although intravenous \ufb02uids may worsen ascities, they are essential to correct"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

Examination of her oral cavity reveals atrophic glossitis, in which the tongue appears deep red in color and abnormally smooth and shiny due to atro-phy of the lingual papillae.

Skin pallor, cyanosis, and jaundice can be appreciated readily and provide additional clues. A chronically ill-appearing emaciated patient may suggest the presence of long-standing heart failure or another systemic disorder, such as a malignancy. Various genetic syndromes, often with cardiovascular involvement, can also be recognized easily, such as trisomy 21, Marfan\u2019s syndrome, and Holt-Oram syndrome. Height and weight should be measured routinely, and both body mass index and body surface area should be calculated. Knowledge of the waist circumference and the waist-to-hip ratio can be used to predict long-term cardiovascular risk. Mental status, level of alertness, and mood should be assessed continuously during the interview and examination."

Cobalamin deficiency affects the nervous system, so patients lacking that vitamin may develop a demyelinating disorder and may present with symptoms of motor, sensory, autonomic, and/or neuropsychiatric dysfunction, known as subacute combined degeneration of the cord. Peripheral smear shows RBCs with an elevated MCV. Hypersegmented (> 5) granulocytes can also be seen. Bone marrow sample reveals giant neutrophils and hypersegmented mature granulocytes. The Schilling test (ingestion of radiolabeled cobalamin both with and without added intrinsic factor) is classic for measuring absorption of cobalamin but is rarely performed. Serum vitamin levels are poorly diagnostic of deficiencies and are thus used with adjunctive tests, including methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine levels: B12 def ciency: Elevated MMA and homocysteine."

Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."

Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months.
