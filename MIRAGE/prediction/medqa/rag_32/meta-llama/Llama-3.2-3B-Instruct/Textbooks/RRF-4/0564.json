    "question": "A 35-year-old man visits your office for his annual health checkup. He was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder 6 months ago, which is being treated with citalopram. He comments that his symptoms have improved since initiating the prescribed therapy; however, in the past 2 months, he has been unable to have sexual intercourse due to weak tumescence and low libido. His blood pressure is 122/74 mm Hg, heart rate is 75/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. Physical examination reveals regular heart and lung sounds. What is the appropriate step in the management of this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Lowering citalopram dose",
        "B": "Addition of bupropion",
        "C": "Switch to fluoxetine",
        "D": "Switch to selegiline"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of generalized anxiety disorder and is currently taking citalopram, which is an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) commonly used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. The patient is experiencing sexual dysfunction, specifically weak tumescence and low libido, which is a common side effect of SSRIs. This side effect is due to the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, which can lead to decreased libido and erectile dysfunction. Given this information, the appropriate step in management would be to try to minimize the side effects of citalopram on sexual function. One way to do this is to try a different SSRI with a lower risk of sexual side effects, or to add a medication that can help alleviate sexual dysfunction. Bupropion is an SSRI that is less likely to cause sexual side effects and can be added to citalopram to help manage sexual dysfunction. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Addition of bupropion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination?

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Rosenthal, MD A 29-year-old Peruvian man presents with the incidental finding of a 10 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8-cm liver cyst on an abdominal com-puted tomography (CT) scan. The patient had noted 2 days of abdominal pain and fever, and his clinical evaluation and CT scan were consistent with appendicitis. His clinical find-ings resolved after laparoscopic appendectomy. The patient immigrated to the USA 10 years ago from a rural area of Peru where his family trades in sheepskins. His father and sister have undergone resection of abdominal masses, but details of their diagnoses are unavailable. What is your differential diagnosis? What are your diagnostic and therapeutic plans?"

His physician initially prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic commonly used to treat hyper-tension. His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic. Because the patient had elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, hydrochlorothiazide was replaced with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril lowered his blood pressure to almost normotensive levels. However, after several weeks on enalapril, the patient returned complaining of a persistent cough. In addition, some signs of angioedema were detected. How does enalapril lower blood pressure? Why does it occasionally cause coughing and angioedema? What other drugs could be used to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and decrease blood pressure,"

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

Additional symptoms of chest pain, headaches, and gastrointestinal upset are common. It must be distinguished from appropriate sinus tachycardia and from focal atrial tachycardia, as discussed above. Misdiagnosis of physiologic sinus tachycardia with an anxiety disorder is common. Therapy is often ineffective or poorly tolerated. Careful titration of beta blockers and/ or calcium channel blockers may reduce symptoms. Clonidine and 1477 serotonin reuptake inhibitors have also been used. Ivabradine, a drug that blocks the If current causing sinus node depolarization, is promising but is not approved for use in the United States. Catheter ablation of the sinus node has been used, but long-term control of symptoms is usually poor, and it often leaves young individuals with a permanent pacemaker."

            "content": "Differential Diagnosis A diagnosis of panic disorder is made after a medical etiology for the panic attacks has been ruled out. A variety of cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, and neurologic conditions can present with anxiety as the chief complaint. Patients with true panic disorder will often focus on one specific feature to the exclusion of others. For example, 20% of patients who present with syncope as a primary medical complaint have a primary diagnosis of a mood, anxiety, or substance abuse disorder, the most common being panic disorder. The differential diagnosis of panic disorder is complicated by a high rate of comorbidity with other psychiatric conditions, especially alcohol and benzodiazepine abuse, which patients initially use in an attempt at self-medication. Some 75% of panic disorder patients will also satisfy criteria for major depression at some point in their illness."
