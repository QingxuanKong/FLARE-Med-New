    "question": "A 21-year-old old college student is brought to the emergency department by his roommates because he has been \"acting strangely.\" Over the last 7 months, he has claimed to hear voices telling him that he must prepare for the end of the world. He used to be a straight A student but started failing exams recently due to his erratic behavior. Furthermore, there are periods of time where he does not sleep for several days and redecorates the entire apartment. During those times he spends huge amounts of money on online shopping. These periods usually last for about 2 weeks and happen every other month. On physical exam, he appears unkept and irritated. He seems to respond to invisible stimuli, and he jumps from topic to topic without clear focus. Which of the following is most consistent with this patient's presentation?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Brief psychotic disorder",
        "B": "Schizoaffective disorder",
        "C": "Schizophreniform disorder",
        "D": "Schizotypal personality disorder"

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key elements of the patient's presentation and analyze them in relation to the provided options.\\n\\nThe patient is a 21-year-old college student who has been experiencing auditory hallucinations (hearing voices telling him to prepare for the end of the world) and has been exhibiting erratic behavior, including failing exams, not sleeping for several days, and redecorating the apartment. He also spends large amounts of money on online shopping during these episodes.\\n\\nThe patient's symptoms have been recurring every other month for the past 7 months, and he appears unkept and irritated on examination.\\n\\nLet's evaluate each option in light of these details:\\n\\nA. Brief psychotic disorder: This condition is characterized by the sudden onset of psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions, lasting for at least 1 day but less than 1 month. While the patient is experiencing hallucinations, the duration of his symptoms (7 months) exceeds the typical duration for brief psychotic disorder.\\n\\nB. Schizoaffective disorder: This condition involves a combination of psychotic symptoms (such as hallucinations or delusions) and a major depressive or manic episode. However, the patient's symptoms do not appear to be closely tied to a depressive or manic episode, and the duration of his psychotic symptoms is too long to be consistent with schizoaffective disorder.\\n\\nC. Schizophreniform disorder: This condition is similar to schizophrenia but lasts for less than 6 months. The patient's symptoms have been recurring every other month for 7 months, which is longer than the typical duration for schizophrenia.\\n\\nD. Schizotypal personality disorder: This is a personality disorder characterized by a pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by acute discomfort with, and reduced capacity for, close relationships as well as by cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentricities of behavior. While the patient exhibits some eccentric behavior, such as redecorating the apartment, his primary symptoms are psychotic in nature (hallucinations and disorganized thinking) rather than a pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits.\\n\\nConsidering these factors, the patient's presentation is most consistent with schizophrenia, specifically schizophrenia with a duration of more than 6 months, which would be classified as schizophrenia (not explicitly listed as an option). However, the closest match from the provided options is C. Schizophreniform disorder, as it is the only option that could encompass the duration of the patient's symptoms.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is C. Schizophreniform disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

Two upperclassmen carried him to a bedroom, placed him on his stomach, and positioned a trash can nearby. Approximately 10 minutes later, the freshman was found unconscious and covered with vomit. There was a delay in treatment because the upperclassmen called the college police instead of calling 911. After the call was transferred to 911, emergency medical technicians responded quickly and discovered that the young man was not breathing and that he had choked on his vomit.

Breathing may be quiet or stertorous. This state persists for several minutes, after which the patient opens his eyes, begins to look about, and appears bewildered and is confused and may be quite agitated. The patient may speak and later not remember anything that has been said and undisturbed becomes drowsy and falls asleep, sometimes for several hours, then often awakens with a pulsatile headache. When fully recovered, such a patient has no memory of any part of the spell but knows that something has happened because of the strange surroundings (in ambulance or hospital), the obvious concern of those around him, and often, a sore, bitten tongue and aching muscles from the violent movements. The convulsive contractions, if violent enough, may crush a vertebral body or result in a serious injury; a fracture, periorbital hemorrhages,"

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a"

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."

At the time of surgery, the initial dissection mobilized the kidney on its vascular pedicle; however, a large portion of tumor became detached in the inferior vena cava. The tumor embolus passed through the right atrium and right ventricle and occluded the pulmonary artery. This could not be cleared at the time of surgery, and the patient succumbed. A 65-year-old businessman came to the emergency department with severe lower abdominal pain that was predominantly central and left sided. He had pain radiating into the left loin, and he also noticed he was passing gas and fecal debris as he urinated. A CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis was performed (eFig. 4.191)."

Following a sleepless night with significant dyspnea, the patient develops nausea and vomiting and collapses. He presents to the emergency department in cardiac arrest and is unable to be resuscitated. His autopsy shows a posterior wall myocardial infarction and a fresh thrombus in an atherosclerotic right coronary artery. What went wrong? The clinician had decided, based on the patient\u2019s appearance, even before starting the history, that the patient\u2019s complaints were not serious. Therefore, he felt confident that he could perform an abbreviated and focused examination by using the URI assessment protocol rather than considering the broader range of possibilities and performing appropriate tests to confirm or refute his initial hypotheses. In particular, by concentrating on the URI, the clinician failed to elicit the full dyspnea history, which would have"
