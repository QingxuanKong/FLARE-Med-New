    "question": "A previously healthy 4-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents because she has not stopped crying for the past 5 hours. Her parents report that she has not eaten anything during this period and that they were unable to calm her down. She has not had any trauma. She was born at term via vaginal delivery and her delivery was uncomplicated. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a reddened and swollen 2nd toe of the left foot. A photograph of the left foot is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The key points are:\\n\\n- The girl has not stopped crying for the past 5 hours.\\n- She has not eaten anything during this period.\\n- The 2nd toe of the left foot is reddened and swollen.\\n- The delivery was uncomplicated.\\n- Vital signs are within normal limits.\\n\\nGiven these findings, we can rule out some options:\\n\\n- Raynaud phenomenon (A) is a condition that affects blood flow to fingers and toes in response to cold or stress, but it does not cause prolonged crying and swelling of a toe.\\n- Ingrown toenail (B) can cause pain and swelling, but it does not typically cause prolonged crying.\\n- Hair tourniquet syndrome (C) is a rare condition that occurs when a hair gets tangled in a baby's clothing and cuts off blood flow to the toe, causing pain, swelling, and potentially gangrene. However, it is not the most likely diagnosis given the lack of trauma and the duration of the symptoms.\\n\\nThe most likely diagnosis is Herpetic whitlow (D), which is an infection of the toe caused by the herpes simplex virus. It is a common cause of neonatal herpes and can cause pain, swelling, and blistering of the skin. The fact that the girl has not eaten anything for 5 hours and is crying persistently suggests a possible infection. The reddened and swollen toe is also consistent with a viral infection.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Herpetic whitlow.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Occasionally, a woman may not employ her expulsive forces to good advantage and coaching is desirable. Her legs should be half-flexed so that she can push with them against the mattress. When the next uterine contraction begins, she is instructed to exert downward pressure as though she were straining at stool. A woman is not encouraged to push beyond the completion of each contraction. Instead, she and her fetus are allowed to rest and recover. During this period of actively bearing down, the fetal heart rate auscultated during the contraction is likely to be slow but should recover to normal range before the next expulsive efort.

            "content": "This patient had no symptoms attributable to the pelvic kidney and she was discharged. A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative."

            "content": "Following its delivery, the fetal head falls posteriorly, bringing the face almost into contact with the maternal anus. he occiput promptly turns toward one of the maternal thighs, and the head assumes a transverse position. This external rotation indicates that the bisacromial diameter, which is the distance between the shoulders, has rotated into the anteroposterior diameter of the pelvis. Most often, the shoulders appear at the vulva just after external rotation and are born spontaneously. If delayed, extraction aids controlled delivery. The sides of the head are grasped with two hands, and genle downward traction is applied until the anterior shoulder appears under the pubic arch (Fig. 27-4). Next, by an upward movement, the posterior shoulder is delivered. During delivery, abrupt or powerful force is avoided to avert fetal brachial plexus injury."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

            "content": "A 69-year-old retired teacher presents with a 1-month history of palpitations, intermittent shortness of breath, and fatigue. She has a history of hypertension. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Case 3: Hyperglycemia and Hyperketonemia Patient Presentation: MW, a 40-year-old woman, was brought to the hospital in a disoriented, confused state by her husband. Focused History: As noted on her medical alert bracelet, MW has had type 1 diabetes (T1D) for the last 24 years. Her husband reports that this is her first medical emergency in 2 years. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): MW displayed signs of dehydration (such as dry mucous membranes and skin, poor skin turgor, and low blood pressure) and acidosis (such as deep, rapid breathing [Kussmaul respiration]). Her breath had a faintly fruity odor. Her temperature was normal."
