            "content": "The likelihood that TLS will occur in patients with Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma is related to the tumor burden and renal function. Hyperuricemia and high serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH >1500 U/L), both of which correlate with total tumor burden, also correlate with the risk of TLS. In patients at risk for TLS, pretreatment evaluations should include a complete blood count, serum chemistry evaluation, and urine analysis. High leukocyte and platelet counts may artificially elevate potassium levels (\u201cpseudohyperkalemia\u201d) due to lysis of these cells after the blood is drawn. In these cases, plasma potassium instead of serum potassium should be followed. In pseudohyperkalemia, no electrocardiographic abnormalities are present. In patients with abnormal baseline renal function, the kidneys and retroperitoneal area should be evaluated by sonography and/or CT to rule out obstructive uropathy. Urine output should be watched closely."

            "content": "clinical features AIHA is a serious condition; without appropriate treatment, it may have a mortality of approximately 10%. The onset is often abrupt and can be dramatic. The hemoglobin level can drop, within days, to as low as 4 g/dL; the massive red cell removal will produce jaundice; and sometimes the spleen is enlarged. When this triad is present, the suspicion of AIHA must be high. When hemolysis is (in part) intravascular, the telltale sign will be hemoglobinuria, which the patient may report or about which we must enquire or test for. The diagnostic test for AIHA is the direct antiglobulin test developed in 1945 by R. R. A. Coombs and known since by this name. The beauty of this test is that it detects directly the pathogenetic mediator of the disease, i.e., the presence of antibody on the red cells themselves. When the test is positive, it clinches the diagnosis; when it is negative, the diagnosis is unlikely. However, the sensitivity of the Coombs test varies depending on the"

A low serum C3implies a lesion other than MCNS, and a renal biopsy isindicated before trial of steroid therapy. Microscopic hematuria may be present in up to 25% of cases of MCNS butdoes not predict response to steroids. Additional laboratorytests, including electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine,total protein, and serum albumin level, are performed basedon history and physical examination features. Renal ultrasound is often useful. Biopsy is performed when MCNS isnot suspected. Transient proteinuria can be seen after vigorous exercise, fever, dehydration, seizures, and adrenergic agonist therapy. Proteinuria usually is mild (UPr/Cr<1), glomerular in origin, and always resolves within a few days. It does not indicate renal disease."

In children, boys are affected more commonly than girls; in adolescents, the gender ratio is approximately equal. The incidence of NHL increases with age. It is more common in whites than in African Americans and in males than in females. NHL has been described in association with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency states and after organ or stem cell transplantation. Burkitt lymphoma commonly is divided into two forms: a sporadic form commonly seen in North America and an endemic form commonly seen in Africa, which has a strong association to EBV.

However, complaints that might lead to the diagnosis include fatigue, frequent infections, and new lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis of typical B-cell CLL should be considered in a patient presenting with an autoimmune hemolytic anemia or autoimmune thrombocytopenia. B-cell CLL has also been associated with red cell aplasia. When this disorder presents as lymphoma, the most common abnormality is asymptomatic lymphadenopathy, with or without splenomegaly. The staging systems predict prognosis in patients with typical B-cell CLL (Table 134-7). The evaluation of a new patient with typical B-cell CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma will include many of the studies (Table 134-11) that are used in patients with other non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas. In addition, particular attention needs to be given to detecting immune abnormalities such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia,"
