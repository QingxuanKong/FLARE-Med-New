    "question": "A 27-year-old G3P1010 makes an appointment with her gynecologist for evaluation of profuse bleeding, which began two days ago. She is 13 weeks pregnant based on the date of her last menstrual period. She is dizzy and weak, and is unable to move around the house and perform her daily tasks. Initially, she had only light spotting, but later on in the day the bleeding increased. Thus far, she has used six sanitary pads. The blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, the temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), the pulse is 125/min, and the respiratory rate is 14/min. A saline infusion is started, and blood and urine specimens are sent for analysis. On pelvic examination, the vagina contains blood and the cervical os is open. She also complains of cervical motion and adnexal tenderness on examination. An ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestational sac low in the uterine cavity. No fetal movement or cardiac activity are observed. She is advised to rest for a couple of hours, after which the scan is repeated. Slight downward migration of the gestational sac is observed with no change in the fetal status. Which of the following is the next step in management?",

            "content": "Threatened Abortion Threatened abortion is defined as vaginal bleeding before 20 weeks of gestation. It occurs in at least 20% of all pregnancies (15). The distinction from missed or inevitable abortion requires ultrasound documentation of an intrauterine embryo or fetus with cardiac activity. The bleeding is usually light and may be associated with mild lower abdominal or cramping pain. The differential diagnosis in these patients includes consideration of possible cervical polyps, vaginitis, cervical carcinoma, gestational trophoblastic disease, ectopic pregnancy, trauma, and foreign body. On physical examination, the abdomen usually is not tender, and the cervix is closed. Bleeding can be seen coming from the os, and usually there is no cervical motion or adnexal tenderness."

Frequently, the findings before rupture and hemorrhage are nonspecific, and vital signs are normal. The abdomen may be nontender or mildly tender, with or without rebound. The uterus may be slightly enlarged, with findings similar to a normal pregnancy (103,104). Cervical motion tenderness may or may not be present. An adnexal mass may be palpable in up to 50% of cases, but the mass varies markedly in size, consistency, and tenderness. A palpable mass may be the corpus luteum and not the ectopic pregnancy. With rupture and intra-abdominal hemorrhage, the patient develops tachycardia followed by hypotension. Bowel sounds are decreased or absent. The abdomen is distended, with marked tenderness and rebound tenderness. Cervical motion tenderness is present. Frequently, the findings of the pelvic examination are inadequate because of pain and guarding."

In the first and early second trimesters, the symptoms may be the same as with tubal ectopic gestation; in advanced abdominal pregnancy, the clinical presentation is more variable. The patient may report painful fetal movement, fetal movements high in the abdomen, or sudden cessation of movements. Physical examination may disclose persistent abnormal fetal positioning, abdominal tenderness, a displaced uterine cervix, easy palpation of fetal parts, and palpation of the uterus separate from the gestation. The diagnosis may be suspected when there are no uterine contractions after oxytocin infusion. Other diagnostic aids include abdominal radiography, abdominal ultrasonography, CT, and MRI (261\u2013263)."

Diagnosis of partial molar pregnancies can be more difficult because an embryo or fetus with visible heart motion is usually present, and the hydropic changes in the placenta, uterine enlargement, and elevations of \u03b2-hCG are not usually as dramatic. Although an embryo or fetus is present, it rarely grows normally with normal anatomy, and repeated ultrasound examinations usually make the diagnosis. Amniocentesis will also make the diagnosis by demonstration of triploidy."

The senior physician realized that a potential cause of the abdominal pain was a pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). The patient was rushed for an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed no fetus or sac in the uterus. She was also noted to have a positive pregnancy test. The patient underwent surgery and was found to have a ruptured fallopian tube caused by an ectopic pregnancy. Whenever a patient has apparent pelvic pain, it is important to consider the gender-related anatomical differences. Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age."

The pain is similar to labor, with suprapubic cramping, and may be accompanied by lumbosacral backache, pain radiating down the anterior thigh, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and rarely syncopal episodes. The pain of dysmenorrhea is colicky in nature and, unlike abdominal pain that is caused by chemical or infectious peritonitis, is relieved by abdominal massage, counter-pressure, or movement of the body. On examination, the vital signs are normal. The suprapubic region may be tender to palpation. Bowel sounds are normal, and there is no upper abdominal tenderness and no abdominal rebound tenderness. Bimanual examination at the time of the dysmenorrheic episode often reveals uterine tenderness; severe pain does not occur with movement of the cervix or palpation of the adnexal structures. The pelvic organs are normal in primary dysmenorrhea."

Typically, the yolk sac is visible by 5.5 weeks and with a mean gestational-sac diameter of 10 mm. Thus, the diagnosis of an IUP should be made cautiously if the yolk sac is not yet seen (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 20 16h). For management of threatened abortion, observation is the norm. Acetaminophen-based analgesia will help relieve discomfort from cramping. Bed rest is often recommended but does not improve outcomes. The hematocrit and blood type is determined. If anemia or hypovolemia is signiicant, then pregnancy evacuation is generally indicated. In cases in which there is a live fetus, some instead may choose transfusion and further observation."

A complete blood count, maternal blood type, and Rh determination should be obtained; Rh-negative patients should receive RhoGAM. If the patient is febrile, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy should be administered. Management of Spontaneous Abortion"

            "content": "Inevitable Abortion With an inevitable abortion, the volume of bleeding is often greater than with other types of abortion, and the cervical os is open and effaced, but no tissue has passed. Most patients have crampy lower abdominal pain, and some have cervical motion or adnexal tenderness. When it is certain that the pregnancy is not viable because the cervical os is dilated or excessive bleeding is present, the patient should be offered medical or surgical management. Blood type and Rh determination and a complete blood count should be obtained if there is any concern about the amount of bleeding. Rh0(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM) should be given if the patient\u2019s blood is Rh negative (22). It is acceptable to give a dose of 50 \u03bcg until 12 completed weeks; if this dose is not available, the standard 300 \u03bcg dose may be given."

            "content": "Serial hCG levels are usually required when the results of the initial ultrasonography examination are indeterminate (i.e., when there is no evidence of an intrauterine gestation or extrauterine cardiac activity consistent with an ectopic pregnancy). When the hCG level is less than 2,000, doubling time helps to predict viable intrauterine gestation (normal rise) versus nonviability (subnormal rise). With normally rising levels, a second ultrasonography examination is performed when the level is expected (by extrapolation) to reach 2,000 mIU/mL. Abnormally rising levels (less than 2,000 mIU/mL and less than 50% rise over 48 hours) indicate a nonviable pregnancy. The location (i.e., intrauterine versus. extrauterine) must be determined surgically, either by laparoscopy or dilation and curettage. Indeterminate ultrasonography results and an hCG level of less than 2,000 mIU/mL is diagnostic of nonviable gestation, either ectopic pregnancy or a complete abortion. Rapidly falling hCG levels"

She became convinced that her roommate was listening in on her phone conversations and planning to alter her essays. She became reclusive and spent most of her time locked in her room. After much difficulty, her teachers convinced her to be seen by the student health service. It was believed she was beginning to show signs of schizophrenia and she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where she was started on antipsychotic medications. While in the hospital, she had a generalized seizure which prompted her transfer to our service. Her spinal fluid analysis showed 10 lymphocytes per mL3. She was found to have an anti-NMDA receptor antibody, which prompted an ultrasound examination of the pelvis. The left ovary was thought to show a benign cyst. Because of the neurological syndrome, the ovarian cyst was resected and revealed a microscopic ovarian teratoma. The neuropsychiatric syndrome resolved. She has since graduated and"

Pelvic ultrasound imaging of complete moles shows absence of fetal parts, an enlarged echo-bright, hydropic placenta in an enlarged uterus, and enlarged multicystic ovaries. If the diagnosis is uncertain at the initial examination and the pregnancy is desired, then a serum \u03b2-hCG level should be obtained and the examination repeated in a week. If no embryo is seen within 7\u201310 days and the serum \u03b2-hCG is elevated, 124e-5 then this is a nonviable pregnancy that should be evacuated.

With tubal rupture, lower abdominal and pelvic pain is usually severe and frequently described as sharp, stabbing, or tearing. Abdominal palpation elicits tenderness. Bimanual pelvic examination, especially cervical motion, causes exquisite pain. The posterior vaginal fornix may bulge from blood in the rectouterine cul-de-sac, or a tender, boggy mass may be felt beside the uterus. The uterus can also be slightly enlarged due to hormonal stimulation. Symptoms of diaphragmatic irritation, characterized by neck or shoulder pain, especially on inspiration, develop in perhaps half of women with sizable hemoperitoneum."

Maternal blood pressure and weight and their extent of change are examined. Symptoms such as headache, altered vision, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, bleeding, vaginal luid leakage, and dysuria are sought. Mter 20 weeks' gestation, uterine examination measures size from the symphysis to the fundus. In late pregnancy, vaginal examination often provides valuable information that includes conirmation of the presenting part and its station, clinical estimation of pelvic capacity and configuration, amnionic luid volume adequacy, and cervical consistency, efacement, and dilatation (Chap. 22, p. 435)."
