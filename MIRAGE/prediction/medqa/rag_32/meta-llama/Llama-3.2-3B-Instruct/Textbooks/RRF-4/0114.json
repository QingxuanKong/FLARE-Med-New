    "question": "A 41-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of muscle cramping, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. He says that these symptoms came on rapidly but does not recall anything that may have triggered the episode. He has never experienced these symptoms before. His past medical history is significant for obesity, sleep apnea, and type 2 diabetes that is well controlled on metformin. He also has gastroesophageal reflux disease for which he occasionally takes antacids. On presentation he is found to have fast, shallow breathing and abdominal pain that is poorly localized. Basic labs as well as an arterial blood gas are obtained and the results are shown below:\n\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nCl-: 106 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 11 mEq/L\npH: 7.25\npCO2: 22 mmHg\n\nWhich of the following is the most likely cause of the changes seen in this patient's labs?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with muscle cramping, decreased appetite, and diarrhea, which came on rapidly. The patient has a history of obesity, sleep apnea, and type 2 diabetes, and is taking metformin. The lab results show a low HCO3- level, low pH, and low pCO2. These findings are consistent with a metabolic acidosis. The patient's symptoms of muscle cramping and diarrhea could be related to the metabolic acidosis, as acidosis can cause muscle cramping and gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient's history of sleep apnea is also relevant, as sleep apnea can lead to metabolic acidosis due to hypoxia and reabsorption of bicarbonate in the kidneys. The patient's low pCO2 level could also be related to the metabolic acidosis, as the kidneys try to compensate for the acidosis by increasing ventilation. The patient's low HCO3- level is consistent with the metabolic acidosis, and the low pH confirms this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms and lab results are consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is a complication of diabetes that occurs when the body produces high levels of ketones. DKA is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment. The patient's history of type 2 diabetes and the presence of metabolic acidosis and ketones make DKA a likely diagnosis. The patient's symptoms of diarrhea and muscle cramping are consistent with DKA, as these symptoms are common in this condition. The patient's low HCO3- level and low pH are consistent with DKA, and the patient's low pCO2 level could be related to the metabolic acidosis. The patient's history of sleep apnea is also relevant, as sleep apnea can lead to metabolic acidosis due to hypoxia and reabsorption of bicarbonate in the kidneys. The patient's low pCO2 level could also be related to the metabolic acidosis, as the kidneys try to compensate for the acidosis by increasing ventilation.

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

Past medical history included schizophrenia, for which he required institutional care; treatment had included neuroleptics and intermittent lithium, the latter restarted 6 months before admission. The patient was treated with antibiotics and intubated for several days, with the development of polyuria (3\u20135 L/d), hypernatremia, and acute renal insufficiency; the peak plasma Na+ concentration was 156 meq/L, and peak creatinine was 2.6 mg/dL. Urine osmolality was measured once and reported as 157 mOsm/kg, with a coincident plasma osmolality of 318 mOsm/kg. Lithium was stopped on admission to the ICU. On physical examination, the patient was alert, extubated, and thirsty. Weight was 97.5 kg. Urine output for the previous 24 h had been 3.4 L, with an IV intake of 2 L/d of D5W."

The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy. One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC).

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

            "content": "Similarly, normal values for [HCO3 -], Paco2, and pH do not ensure the absence of an acid-base disturbance. For instance, an alcoholic who has been vomiting may develop a metabolic alkalosis with a pH of 7.55, Paco2 of 47 mmHg, [HCO3 -] of 40 mmol/L, [Na+] of 135, [Cl-] of 80, and [K+] of 2.8. If such a patient were then to develop a superimposed alcoholic ketoacidosis with a \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate concentration of 15 mM, arterial pH would fall to 7.40, [HCO3 -] to 25 mmol/L, and the Paco2 to 40 mmHg. Although these blood gases are normal, the AG is elevated at 30 mmol/L, indicating a mixed metabolic alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. A mixture of high-gap acidosis and metabolic alkalosis is recognized easily by comparing the differences (\u2206 values) in the normal to prevailing patient values. In this example, the \u2206HCO3 is 0 (25 25 mmol/L), but the \u2206AG is 20 (30 \u2013 10 mmol/L). Therefore, 20 mmol/L is unaccounted for in the \u2206/\u2206 value (\u2206AG to \u2206HCO3 -)."
