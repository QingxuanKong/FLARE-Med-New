    "question": "A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 40 weeks of gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. The patient has attended many prenatal appointments and followed her physician's advice about screening for diseases, laboratory testing, diet, and exercise. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. She has no history of a serious illness. Her first child was delivered via normal vaginal delivery. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Cervical examination shows 100% effacement and 10 cm dilation. A cardiotocograph is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is at 40 weeks of gestation and is in active labor, with 100% effacement and 10 cm dilation. The cardiotocograph is not explicitly described, but given the context, it is likely showing some abnormality that warrants further management. The patient has a low-risk pregnancy with no history of complications or serious illnesses. The first step in management should prioritize the well-being of both the mother and the fetus. Given the patient is already in active labor, the most appropriate initial step is to reassess the situation and consider the options for a safe and effective delivery method. Induced vaginal delivery may be considered if the labor is progressing slowly or if there are concerns about the fetal well-being, but it is not the first step. Amnioinfusion is a procedure that may be considered if there is concern about fetal distress or if the fetal heart rate is abnormal, but it is not typically the initial step in management. Repositioning may be considered to help manage discomfort or promote fetal movement, but it is not a definitive step in managing the situation. Therefore, reassurance and further assessment of the cardiotocograph are necessary before proceeding with any further management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

            "content": "\u2022 Summary of Normal Labor Labor is characterized by brevity and considerable biological variation. Active labor can be reliably diagnosed when cervical dilation is :3 cm in the presence of uterine contractions. Once this cervical dilation threshold is reached, normal progression to delivery can be expected, depending on parity, in the ensuing 4 to 6 hours. Anticipated progress during a 1-to 3-hour second stage is monitored to ensure fetal safety. Finally, most women in spontaneous labor, regardless of parity, if left unaided, will deliver within approximately 10 hours after admission for spontaneous labor. Insuicient uterine activity is a common and correctable cause of abnormal labor progress. Thereore, when the length of otherwise normal labor exceeds the expected norm, interventions other than cesarean delivery-or example, oxytocin administration-must be irst considere."

            "content": "If a pregnancy has been confirmed, but fetal cardiac activity cannot be documented by approximately 6 to 7 weeks of gestation (by sure menstrual or ultrasonographic dating), intervention is recommended to expedite pregnancy termination and to obtain tissue for karyotype analysis. First trimester screening with maternal chemistries and fetal nuchal lucency measurement or chorionic villus sampling are recommended for obstetrical indications. Maternal serum can also be obtained for assessment at 16 to 18 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis may be recommended to assess the fetal karyotype after the pregnancy has progressed past the time of prior losses."

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Strong contractions are associ-ated with true labor and should prompt consideration of delivery and resuscitation of the neonate. Focused prenatal history-taking should elicit a history of pregnancy-induced hypertension, ges-tational diabetes, congenital heart disease, preterm labor, or placental abnormalities. Asking the patient when the baby first moved and if she is currently experiencing movement of the fetus is important. Determining fetal age is key for consider-ations of viability. Gestational age may be estimated by noting fundal height, with the fundus approximating the umbilicus at 20 weeks and the costal margin at 40 weeks. Discrepancy in dates and size may be due to uterine rupture or hemorrhage.Initial evaluation for abdominopelvic trauma in pregnant patients should proceed in the standard manner. Ultrasound (FAST)"

            "content": "Because uterine contractions are not afected by spinal cord lesions, labor is usually easy-even precipitous, and comparatively painless. If the lesion is below T12' uterine contractions are felt normally. For lesions above T 2, the risk of out-of 1rhospital delivery is substantial and can be minimized by teaching women to palpate for uterine contractions. This is especially important because up to 20 percent of women deliver preterm (Westgren, 1993). Some recommend tocodynamometry and weekly cervical examinations beginning at 28 to 30 weeks. Another reasonable option that we frequently employ at Park land Hospital is elective hospitalization after 36 to 37 weeks' gestation (Hughes, 1991)."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

With accurate dating, a small, irregular intrauterine sac without a fetal pole on transvaginal ultrasound is diagnostic of an abnormal pregnancy. Maternal Rh type should be determined and RhoGAM given if the type is Rh . It has been estimated that 50% of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended. Some 25% of all pregnancies end in elective abortion. Options for elective abortion depend on GA and patient preferences (see Table 2.11-7).

            "content": "In most cases, bearing down is reflexive and spontaneous during second-stage labor. Occasionally, a woman may not employ her expulsive forces to good advantage and coaching is desirable. Her legs should be half-flexed so that she can push with them against the mattress. When the next uterine contraction begins, she is instructed to exert downward pressure as though she were straining at stool. A woman is not encouraged to push beyond the completion of each contraction. Instead, she and her fetus are allowed to rest and recover. During this period of actively bearing down, the fetal heart rate auscultated during the contraction is likely to be slow but should recover to normal range before the next expulsive efort. Fetal and obstetrical outcomes appear to be unafected whether pushing is coached or uncoached during second-stage labor (Bloom, 2006; Tuuli, 2012). Bloom and colleagues (2006) studied efects of actively coaching expulsive eforts in women without epidural analgesia. hey"
