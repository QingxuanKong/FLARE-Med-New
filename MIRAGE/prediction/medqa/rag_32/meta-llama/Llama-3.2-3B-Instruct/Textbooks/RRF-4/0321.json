    "question": "A 55-year-old man recovering from knee replacement surgery complains of breathlessness in the postoperative ward. He has been confined to bed for the past 5 days and is under observation. He felt a sudden difficulty in breathing and called for the ward nurse. He says that he is unable to take deep breaths and has a sharp pain on the right side of his chest with each inspiration. His temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), the pulse is 111/min, the respirations are 31/min, and the blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. He experiences pain in his right calf on dorsiflexion. There are no other prominent findings on physical examination. His chest X-ray does not show anything significant. The ECG reveals sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the best course of management at this time?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 55-year-old man recovering from knee replacement surgery, which is a major orthopedic surgery that can lead to venous thromboembolism (VTE). The patient presents with sudden difficulty breathing, sharp pain on the right side of his chest with each inspiration, and pain in his right calf on dorsiflexion. These symptoms are classic for pulmonary embolism (PE), a type of VTE. The patient's chest X-ray is normal, but the ECG reveals sinus tachycardia, which is a common finding in PE. Given the clinical presentation and recent surgery, the patient is at high risk for VTE. The best course of management is to consider an inferior vena cava filter, which is a mechanical device placed in the inferior vena cava to prevent PE. However, the question asks for the best initial step, which is to perform a lower extremity Doppler to evaluate for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a precursor to PE. The Doppler will help confirm the presence of DVT and guide further management, including anticoagulation therapy if necessary.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" } ``` The reasoning behind this choice is as follows: * The patient's symptoms of sudden difficulty breathing, sharp pain on the right side of his chest with each inspiration, and pain in his right calf on dorsiflexion are classic for pulmonary embolism (PE). * The patient's recent knee replacement surgery increases his risk for VTE, including PE. * A chest X-ray is normal, but the ECG reveals sinus tachycardia, which is a common finding in PE. * An inferior vena cava filter is a mechanical device placed in the inferior vena cava to prevent PE, but it is not the initial step in management. * A lower extremity Doppler is the best initial step to evaluate for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a precursor to PE. * The Doppler will help confirm the presence of DVT and guide further management, including anticoagulation therapy if necessary.",

The most common location for an embolus to lodge in the leg is at the common femoral bifurcation. Typically, a patient will complain of foot and calf pain. Pulses are absent, and there may be diminution of sensation. Inability to move the affected muscle group is a sign of very severe ischemia and necessitates urgent revascularization. During evaluation of the affected extremity, it is important to compare findings with the contralateral limb. Clinical evaluation is extremely important in determining the etiology and location of the obstruction. One of the most important pieces of information to obtain is whether the patient has had prior vascular procedures or if there is a history of lower extremity claudication. Either of these features suggests"

He is then switched to celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily, and on this regimen his joint symptoms and heartburn resolve. Two years later, he returns with increased joint symptoms. His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor. With the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, he is started on a regimen"

A 33-year-old man was playing cricket for his local Sunday team. As the new bowler pitched the ball short, it bounced higher than he anticipated and hit him on the side of his head. He immediately fell to the ground unconscious, but after about 30 seconds he was helped to his feet and felt otherwise well. It was noted he had some bruising around his temple. He decided not to continue playing and went to watch the match from the side. Over the next hour he became extremely sleepy and was eventually unrousable. He was rushed to hospital. When he was admitted to hospital, the patient\u2019s breathing was shallow and irregular and it was necessary to intubate him. A skull radiograph demonstrated a fracture in the region of the pterion. No other abnormality was demonstrated other than minor soft tissue bruising over the left temporal fossa. A CT scan was performed."

The mass in the patient\u2019s pelvis compressed this nerve, producing his sensory and motor dysfunction. During surgery, the mass was found to be a benign nerve tumor and was excised. This patient had no long-standing neurological deficit. A 65-year-old man was examined by a surgical intern because he had a history of buttock pain and impotence. On examination he had a reduced peripheral pulse on the left foot compared to the right. On direct questioning, the patient revealed that he experienced severe left-sided buttock pain after walking 100 yards. After a short period of rest, he could walk another 100 yards before the same symptoms recurred. He also noticed that over the past year he was unable to obtain an erection. He smoked heavily and was on no other drugs or treatment."

He presents to the emergency department in cardiac arrest and is unable to be resuscitated.

The clinician had decided, based on the patient\u2019s appearance, even before starting the history, that the patient\u2019s complaints were not serious. Therefore, he felt confident that he could perform an abbreviated and focused examination by using the URI assessment protocol rather than considering the broader range of possibilities and performing appropriate tests to confirm or refute his initial hypotheses. In particular, by concentrating on the URI, the clinician failed to elicit the full dyspnea history, which would have"

Patients must be coached to refrain from breath holding or a Valsalva-like maneuver during the procedure. The abdominojugular reflex is useful in predicting a pulmonary artery wedge pressure in excess of 15 mmHg in patients with heart failure. Although the JVP estimates right ventricular filling pressure, it has a predictable relationship with the pulmonary artery wedge pressure. In a large study of patients with advanced heart failure, the presence of a right atrial pressure >10 mmHg (as predicted on bedside examination) had a positive value of 88% for the prediction of a pulmonary artery wedge pressure of >22 mmHg. In addition, an elevated JVP has prognostic significance in patients with both symptomatic heart failure and asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The presence of an elevated JVP is associated with a higher risk of subsequent hospitalization for heart failure, death"
