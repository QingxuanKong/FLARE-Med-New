She is currently at 18 weeks gestation and admits to having poor control of her type 1 diabetes before becoming pregnant. Her family history is non-contributory. The physical examination shows a pregnant woman with a fundal height of 20 cm (7.9 in). An abdominal ultrasound is ordered.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient is a 33-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes, who is currently at 18 weeks gestation and has poor control of her diabetes. She is also 7.9 inches tall for her gestational age, as indicated by the fundal height of 20 cm. This suggests that the fetus is growing at a slower rate than expected for her gestational age. This could be a sign of fetal growth restriction (FGR) or other congenital abnormalities. The patient's poor control of her diabetes could also increase the risk of congenital malformations. Considering the options provided, we need to think about which congenital abnormalities are associated with FGR or poor fetal growth. Sacral agenesis and spina bifida are both associated with FGR, but they are not the most common causes. Ventricular septal defect is a heart defect that can be associated with FGR, but it is not the most likely cause in this case. Amelia, also known as ommphalocele, is a type of congenital defect where the intestines or other organs protrude through the navel. It is often associated with FGR and poor fetal growth. Therefore, the most likely congenital abnormality shown on the ultrasound is amelia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Pregnancy is a \u201cdiabetogenic\u201d state in which the prevailing hormonal milieu favors a state of insulin resistance. In some euglycemic pregnant women this can give rise to gestational diabetes. Women with pregestational diabetes (where hyperglycemia is already present in the periconception period) have an increased risk for stillbirth and congenital malformations in the fetus (Chapter 7). Therefore, tight glycemic control is needed early in pregnancy to prevent congenital defects, and through the later trimesters of pregnancy to prevent fetal overgrowth (macrosomia). The latter occurs because maternal hyperglycemia can induce compensatory secretion of insulin-like growth factors in the fetus. Most pregnant women who develop gestational diabetes require insulin for glycemic control. Gestational diabetes typically resolves following delivery; however, there is an elevated"

It is typically reserved for women with pregestational diabetes because of the greater stillbirth risk. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017a) endorses fetal surveillance in women with gestational diabetes and poor glycemic control. At Parkland Hospital, women with gestational diabetes are routinely instructed to perform daily fetal kick counts in the third trimester (Chap. 17, p. 332). Insulin-treated women are ofered inpatient admission after 34 weeks' gestation, and antepartum monitoring is performed three times each week."

The senior physician realized that a potential cause of the abdominal pain was a pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). The patient was rushed for an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed no fetus or sac in the uterus. She was also noted to have a positive pregnancy test. The patient underwent surgery and was found to have a ruptured fallopian tube caused by an ectopic pregnancy. Whenever a patient has apparent pelvic pain, it is important to consider the gender-related anatomical differences. Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age."

Fetal macrosomia is associated with an increased risk of maternal and fetal birth trauma, including permanent newborn Erb\u2019s palsy. Pregnant women with diabetes have an increased risk of developing preeclampsia, and those with vascular disease are at greater risk for developing intrauterine growth restriction, which is associated with an increased risk of fetal and neonatal death. Excellent pregnancy outcomes in patients with diabetic nephropathy and proliferative retinopathy have been reported with aggressive glucose control and intensive maternal and fetal surveillance."
