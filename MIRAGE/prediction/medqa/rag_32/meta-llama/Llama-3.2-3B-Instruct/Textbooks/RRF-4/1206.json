    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the carrier status of the 35-year-old woman for the disease affecting her brother, we need to understand the genetic basis of the disease. The disease is described as phenylketonuria (PKU), which is an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that the disease is caused by a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene responsible for the disease, and the woman can be a carrier of the mutation without expressing the disease herself. Given that the woman's brother has mild developmental delay, pale complexion, and has to limit his dietary intake of phenylalanine, it is likely that he is a carrier of the disease-causing mutation. Since the disease is autosomal recessive, the woman can be either a carrier or not a carrier. The probability of the woman being a carrier can be calculated as follows: the brother's genotype is likely to be heterozygous (carrying one normal allele and one mutated allele), so the probability that the woman is a carrier is 50% (50% chance of inheriting the mutated allele from her father and 50% chance of inheriting the normal allele from her mother).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

In this example, the proband, a 36-year-old woman (IV-1), has a strong history of breast and ovarian cancer on the paternal side of her family. The early age of onset and the co-occurrence of breast and ovarian cancer in this family suggest the possibility of an inherited mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. It is unclear however, without genetic testing, whether her father harbors such a mutation and transmitted it to her. After appropriate genetic counseling of the pro-band and her family, the most informative and cost-effective approach to DNA analysis in this family is to test the cancer-affected 42-year-old living cousin for the presence of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. If a mutation is found, then it is possible to test for this particular alteration in other family members, if they so desire. In the example shown, if the proband\u2019s father has a BRCA1 mutation, there is a 50:50 probability that the"

Between 75% and 90% of children born to such women are mentally retarded and microcephalic, and 15% have congenital heart disease, even though the infants themselves are heterozygotes. This syndrome, termed maternal PKU, results from the teratogenic effects of phenylalanine or its metabolites that cross the placenta and affect specific fetal organs during development.

African mericans are more likely to have this genetic variation, which explains the lower sensitivity of screening in this group. he American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (20 17b) recommends that prior to screening for SMA, providers counsel about its potential spectrum of severity, carrier frequency, and its detection rate. Posttest counseling should include the residual risk after a negative screening result, which difers according to the patient's ethnicity and also according to the number of SMNI copies detected. Most unafected individuals have two copies, but a small percentage has three copies and is at even lower risk. If the patient or her partner has a family history of SMA, or if carrier screening is positive, genetic counseling is recommended."

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

            "content": "To prevent intellectual disability, diagnosis and initiation of dietary treatment of classic phenylketonuria must occur before the child is 2 weeks of age. For this reason, most newborns in North America, Australia, and Europe are screened by determinations of blood phenylalanine levels. Abnormal values are confirmed using quantitative analysis of plasma amino acids. Dietary phenylalanine restriction is usually instituted if blood phenylalanine levels are >360 \u03bcmol/L (6 mg/dL). Treatment consists of a special diet low in phenylalanine and supplemented with tyrosine, since tyrosine becomes an essential amino acid in phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. With therapy, plasma phenylalanine concentrations should be maintained between 120 and 360 \u03bcmol/L (2 and 6 mg/dL). Dietary restriction should be continued and monitored indefinitely. Some patients with milder forms of phenylketonuria (phenylalanine <1200 \u03bcm at presentation) show increased tolerance to dietary proteins and improved"

Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

The pervasive nature of the role of genetics in medicine makes it important for physicians and other health care professionals to become more informed about genetics and to provide advice and counseling in conjunction with trained genetic counselors (Chap. 84). The application of screening and prevention strategies will therefore require intensive patient and physician education, changes in health care financing, and legislation to protect patient\u2019s rights.
