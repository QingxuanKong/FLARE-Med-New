    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the cause of the patient's symptoms, let's analyze the given information step by step. The patient is a 44-year-old obese African-American male with a history of poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus. He has experienced similar episodes of fatigue and dark urine since birth, which resolved spontaneously. He recently started glipizide one week ago, and prior to the current episode, he felt well without any upper respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient predominantly eats fast food, although he tried a new Lebanese restaurant about a month ago. Given these details, we need to consider the potential causes of his symptoms: \\n\\nFirst, let's rule out bacterial infection (A). The patient's symptoms of fatigue and dark urine have been present since birth and resolved spontaneously, making a bacterial infection less likely. \\n\\nSecond, let's consider food (B). The patient recently tried a new Lebanese restaurant, which could be a potential trigger for his symptoms. However, the patient's symptoms have been present since birth, and a foodborne illness would not be a likely explanation. \\n\\nThird, let's examine the medication (C). The patient started glipizide one week ago, and it's possible that the medication could be causing his symptoms. Glipizide is a sulfonylurea, which can cause hypoglycemia as a side effect. The patient's dark urine and fatigue are consistent with hypoglycemia. \\n\\nFinally, let's consider idiopathic (D). Given the patient's history of poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus and the recent initiation of glipizide, it's unlikely that the patient's symptoms are idiopathic.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is the medication, specifically glipizide, which is causing hypoglycemia.\\n\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

With progressive lowering of blood glucose, the clinical picture is one of hunger, trembling, flushed facies, sweating, confusion, and, finally, after many minutes, seizures and coma. The diagnosis depends largely on the history, the documentation of reduced blood glucose during an attack, and reproduction of the patient\u2019s spontaneous attacks by an injection of insulin or hypoglycemia-inducing drugs (or ingestion of a high-carbohydrate meal in the case of reactive hypoglycemia). Fasting hypoglycemia suggests the presence of an insulin-secreting tumor (insulinoma). Acute hemorrhage, usually within the gastrointestinal tract, is a cause of weakness, faintness, or even unconsciousness when the patient stands suddenly. The cause (gastric or duodenal ulcer is the most common) may remain inevident until the passage of black stools."

Case 3: Blood on the Toothbrush Patient Presentation: LT is an 84-year-old man whose gums have been bleeding for several months. Focused History: LT is a widower and lives alone in a suburban community on the East Coast. He no longer drives. His two children live on the West Coast and come east infrequently. Since the death of his wife 11 months ago, he has been isolated and finds it hard to get out of the house. His appetite has changed, and he is content with cereal, coffee, and packaged snacks. Chewing is difficult."

He has hypertension, and during the last 8 years, he has been adequately managed with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH\u2019s problem? What information would you gather to confirm your diagnosis? What treatment steps would you initiate?"

We also have observed states of protracted coma, as well as relatively pure Korsakoff amnesia. However, one should not be hasty in prognosis, for we have observed slow improvement to continue for 1 to 2 years. Recurrent hypoglycemia from an islet cell tumor may masquerade for some time as an episodic confusional psychosis or convulsive illness; diagnosis then awaits the demonstration of low blood glucose or hyperinsulinism in association with the neurologic symptoms. We saw a man in the emergency department whose main complaint was episodic inability to dial a touchtone telephone and a mild mental fogginess; he was found to have an insulinoma."

The patient\u2019s temperature was normal. He explained that the episode had occurred following a birthday party at which he had participated in an ice cream\u2013eating contest. The patient reported prior episodes of a similar nature following ingestion of a significant amount of dairy products. This clinical picture is most probably due to a deficiency in the activity of: A. isomaltase. B. lactase. C. pancreatic \u03b1-amylase. D. salivary \u03b1-amylase. E. sucrase. Correct answer = B. The physical symptoms suggest a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for carbohydrate degradation. The symptoms observed following the ingestion of dairy products suggest that the patient is deficient in lactase as a result of the age-dependent reduction in expression of the enzyme."

Side effects of intensive treatment include an increased frequency of serious hypoglycemia, weight gain, increased economic costs, and greater demands on the patient. In the DCCT, quality of life was very similar in 2417 the intensive and standard therapy groups. The most serious complication of therapy for DM is hypoglycemia, and its treatment with oral glucose or glucagon injection is discussed in Chap. 420. Severe, recurrent hypoglycemia warrants examination of treatment regimen and glycemic goal for the individual patient. Weight gain occurs with most (insulin, insulin secretagogues, thiazolidinediones) but not all (metformin, \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-IV inhibitors) therapies. The weight gain is partially due to the anabolic effects of insulin and the reduction in glucosuria. As a result of recent controversies"

However, folate has no effect on the neurologic damage caused by B12 deficiency. Over time, then, the neurologic effects can become severe and irreversible. Thus, folate can mask a deficiency of B12 and prevent treatment until the neuropathy is apparent. III. Focused Cases Case 1: Microcytic Anemia Patient Presentation: ME is a 24-year-old man who is being evaluated as a follow-up to a preplacement medical evaluation he had prior to starting his new job. Focused History: ME has no significant medical issues. His family history is unremarkable, but he knows little of the health status of those family members who remain in Greece. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination was normal. Routine analysis of his blood included the following results:"

Following a sleepless night with significant dyspnea, the patient develops nausea and vomiting and collapses. He presents to the emergency department in cardiac arrest and is unable to be resuscitated. His autopsy shows a posterior wall myocardial infarction and a fresh thrombus in an atherosclerotic right coronary artery. What went wrong? The clinician had decided, based on the patient\u2019s appearance, even before starting the history, that the patient\u2019s complaints were not serious. Therefore, he felt confident that he could perform an abbreviated and focused examination by using the URI assessment protocol rather than considering the broader range of possibilities and performing appropriate tests to confirm or refute his initial hypotheses. In particular, by concentrating on the URI, the clinician failed to elicit the full dyspnea history, which would have"

Focused History: This was IR\u2019s first occurrence of severe joint pain. In the ED, he was given an anti-inflammatory medication. Fluid aspirated from the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb was negative for organisms but positive for needle-shaped monosodium urate (MSU) crystals (see image at right). The inflammatory symptoms have since resolved. IR reports he is in good health otherwise, with no significant past medical history. His body mass index (BMI) is 31. No tophi (deposits of MSU crystals under the skin) were detected in the physical examination."
