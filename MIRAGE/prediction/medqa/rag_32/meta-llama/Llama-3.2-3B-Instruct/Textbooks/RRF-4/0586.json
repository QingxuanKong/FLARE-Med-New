    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the type of cell from which the intrasellar mass is most likely derived, we need to consider the symptoms and the location of the mass. The patient has frequent headaches, blurry vision, and difficulties achieving an erection, which are symptoms that can be associated with pituitary dysfunction. The temporal visual field deficit bilaterally is a classic symptom of a bitemporal hemianopia, which is often caused by compression of the optic chiasm by a mass in the sellar region. Given these symptoms, the mass is likely to be a pituitary adenoma. Pituitary adenomas can arise from several types of cells in the pituitary gland, including thyrotrophs, lactotrophs, somatotrophs, and gonadotrophs. However, the symptoms and location of the mass suggest that the adenoma is likely to be a lactotrophoma, which is a tumor of the lactotroph cells that produce prolactin. Prolactinomas are the most common type of functioning pituitary adenoma and can cause symptoms such as headaches, blurry vision, and difficulties achieving an erection due to prolactin excess. Therefore, the mass is most likely derived from lactotrophs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

In 85 percent of cases, it appears before the age of 15 years (average 3.5 years), and it is twice as frequent in girls as in boys (Cogan). The initial symptoms are dimness of vision with constricted fields, followed by bilateral field defects of homonymous, heteronymous, and sometimes bitemporal type and progressing to blindness and optic atrophy with or without papilledema. Ocular proptosis from the orbital mass is the other main feature. Hypothalamic signs (adiposity, polyuria, somnolence, and genital atrophy) occur occasionally as a result of proximal tumor extension. CT, MRI, and ultrasonography will usually reveal the tumor, and radiographs will show an enlargement of the optic foramen (greater than 7.0 mm).

Ophthalmologic Evaluation Because optic tracts may be contiguous to an expanding pituitary mass, reproducible visual field assessment using perimetry techniques should be performed on all patients with sellar mass lesions that impinge the optic chiasm (Chap. 39). Bitemporal hemianopia, often more pronounced superiorly, is observed classically. It occurs because nasal ganglion cell fibers, which cross in the optic chiasm, are especially vulnerable to compression of the ventral optic chiasm. Occasionally, homonymous hemianopia occurs from postchiasmal compression or monocular temporal field loss from prechiasmal compression. Invasion of the cavernous sinus can produce diplopia from ocular motor nerve palsy. Early diagnosis reduces the risk of optic atrophy, vision loss, or eye misalignment."

The lesions all appear to be of similar age, but we cannot account for several cases we have seen in which serial MRIs show new lesions accumulating over 2 or 3 weeks, as already noted. Moreover, as pointed out by Honkaniemi and colleagues, there may be a delay of several days between the clinical manifestations and the first appearance of changes in the MRI, a situation to which we can attest. Whether a single lesion on MRI can be considered compatible with ADEM is unclear."

            "content": "Rarely, MS takes a rapidly progressive and highly malignant form; Marburg\u2019s name has been attached to this variant. A combination of cerebral, brainstem, and spinal manifestations evolves over a few weeks, rendering the patient stuporous, comatose, or decerebrate with prominent cranial nerve and corticospinal abnormalities. Death may end the illness within a few weeks to months without any remission having occurred, or there may be partial recovery, as noted below. At autopsy the lesions are of macroscopic dimensions, in essence very large acute plaques of MS. The only difference from the usual form of MS is that many plaques are of the same age and the confluence of many perivenous zones of demyelination is more obvious. Two of our most striking examples of this rapidly fatal form were in a 6-year-old girl and a 16-year-old boy, both of whom died within 5 weeks of the onset of symptoms. Another was a 30-year-old man who lived 2 months. In none of them had there been a preceding"

            "content": "Also known as pseudotumor cerebri, this disorder is typified by increased intracranial pressure without hydrocephalus. The cause is unknown, but it may result from overproduction or under absorption of cerebrospinal luid (CSF). Symptoms include headache in at least 90 percent of cases, visual disturbances such as loss of a visual field or central visual acuity in 70 percent, and commonly occurring papilledema that may be sight-threatening (Evans, 2000; Heaney, 2010). Other complaints are stif neck, back pain, pulsatile tinnitus, and cranial nerve palsies. he syndrome is oten found in young women and is prevalent in those who are obese, who recently gained weight, or both (Fraser, 201r1). Along with symptoms, other criteria for diagnosis include elevated intracranial pressurer> 25 em H20, normal CSF composition, normal cranial CT or MR imaging indings, papilledema, and no evidence for systemic disease. If papilledema is not present, other criteria are required (Friedman, 2013)."

            "content": "Diagnosis of pituitary adenoma This is virtually certain when a chiasmal syndrome is combined with an endocrine syndrome of either hypopituitary or hyperpituitary type. Laboratory data that are confirmatory of an endocrine disorder, as described above, and sometimes a ballooned sella turcica on plain films of the skull are occasionally found. Patients who are suspected of having a pituitary adenoma should be examined by MRI with gadolinium; this procedure will visualize pituitary adenomas as small as 3 mm in diameter and show the relationship of the tumor to the optic chiasm (Fig. 30-21). This also provides the means of following the tumor\u2019s response to therapy. It should be kept in mind that pituitary tissue normally enhances on CT and MRI, revealing small tumors as relatively hypoenhancing nodules."

            "content": "Pituitary apoplexy This syndrome, described originally by Brougham and colleagues, occurs as a result of infarction of an adenoma that has outgrown its blood supply. It is characterized by the acute onset of severe headache that may be retro-orbital, frontal, bitemporal, or generalized ophthalmoplegia; bilateral visual loss; and in severe cases, drowsiness or coma, with either subarachnoid hemorrhage or pleocytosis and elevated protein in the CSF. The CT or MRI shows infarction of tumor, often with hemorrhage in and above an enlarged sella. Pituitary apoplexy may threaten life unless the acute addisonian state is treated by hydrocortisone. Blindness is the other dreaded complication. If there is no improvement after 24 to 48 h, or if vision is markedly affected, transsphenoidal decompression of the sella is indicated. Factors that may precipitate the necrosis or hemorrhage of a pituitary tumor are anticoagulation, pituitary function testing, radiation, bromocriptine treatment, and"
