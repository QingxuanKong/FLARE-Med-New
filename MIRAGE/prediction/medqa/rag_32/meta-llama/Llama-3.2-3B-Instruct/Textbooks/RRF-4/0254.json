    "question": "A 62-year-old man presents to the physician because of incomplete healing of a chest wound. He recently had a triple coronary artery bypass graft 3 weeks ago. His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the past 25 years. Clinical examination shows the presence of wound dehiscence in the lower 3rd of the sternal region. The wound surface shows the presence of dead necrotic tissue with pus. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax shows a small fluid collection with fat stranding in the perisurgical soft tissues. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of the patient?",

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a chest wound that has not healed, with evidence of wound dehiscence, dead necrotic tissue, and pus. The patient has a history of recent cardiac surgery, which increases the risk of complications such as infection and poor wound healing. The CT scan shows a small fluid collection with fat stranding in the perisurgical soft tissues, indicating an infection. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step in management is to address the infection and promote wound healing. Surgical debridement is the most effective method to remove dead tissue, clean the wound, and promote healing. Negative pressure wound management may also be considered, but it is not the first line of treatment in this case. Sternal wiring and sternal fixation are not appropriate options as they do not address the underlying infection and may not provide adequate support to the sternum. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Surgical debridement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

The standard has been that anterior truncal gunshot wounds between the fourth intercostal space and the pubic symphysis whose trajectory as determined by radiograph or wound location indicates perito-neal penetration should undergo laparotomy (Fig. 7-25). How-ever, there has been increased use of CT scanning to facilitate nonoperative management of abdominal GSWs.47 The exception is penetrating trauma isolated to the right upper quadrant; in hemodynamically stable patients with trajectory confined to the liver by CT scan, nonoperative observation may be reasonable.48 In obese patients, if the gunshot wound is thought to be tangen-tial through the subcutaneous tissues, CT scan can delineate the track and exclude peritoneal violation. Laparoscopy is another option to assess peritoneal penetration for tangential wounds it should not be done in unstable patients.

The abdomen is a diagnostic black box. Fortunately, with few exceptions, it is not necessary to determine in the ED which intra-abdominal organs are injured, only whether an explor-atory laparotomy is necessary. However, physical examina-tion of the abdomen can be unreliable in making this determination, and drugs, alcohol, and head and spinal cord injuries can complicate the clinical evaluation. The presence of abdominal rigidity and hemodynamic compromise is an undisputed indication 7Figure 7-22. Location of the hematoma within the mediastinal"

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases.

Inspection of the wound is most useful in detecting sub-tle edema around the suture or staple line, manifested as a waxy appearance of the skin, which characterizes the early phase of infection. If a wound infection is suspected, several stitches or staples around the most suspicious area should be removed with insertion of a cotton-tipped applicator into the subcutane-ous area to open a small segment of the incision. This causes minimal if any discomfort to the patient. Presence of pus man-dates further opening of the subcutaneous and skin layers to the full extent of the infected pocket. Samples should be taken for aerobic and anaerobic cultures, with very few patients requir-ing antibiotic therapy. Patients who are immunosuppressed (diabetics and"

In the scenario of tan-gential high energy GSWs, however, it is possible to sustain a transmitted intraperitoneal hollow visceral injury due to a blast insult. Gunshot wounds to the back or flank are more difficult to evaluate because of the retroperitoneal location of the injured abdominal organs. Triple-contrast CT scan can delineate the trajectory of the bullet and identify peritoneal violation or retro-peritoneal entry, and associated injuries.In contrast to gunshot wounds, stab wounds that penetrate the peritoneal cavity are less likely to injure intra-abdominal organs. Anterior abdominal stab wounds (from costal margin to inguinal ligament and bilateral midaxillary lines) should be explored under local anesthesia in the ED to determine if the fascia has been violated. Injuries that do not penetrate the peri-toneal cavity do not require further evaluation, and the"
