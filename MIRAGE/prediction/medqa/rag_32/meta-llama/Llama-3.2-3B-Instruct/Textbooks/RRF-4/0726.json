    "question": "A 56-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of fever, chills, nausea, and flank pain. She has multiple sclerosis and a chronic indwelling bladder catheter for neurogenic bladder dysfunction. One week ago, she was discharged from the hospital after treatment for a multiple sclerosis flare. Her temperature is 39.3\u00b0C (102.8\u00b0C). Physical examination shows marked tenderness in the right costovertebral area. Urine cultures grow a non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-positive, gram-negative rod. The causal organism of this patient's current condition most likely produces which of the following substances?",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break down the key information provided: 1. **Patient Profile**: A 56-year-old woman with multiple sclerosis and a chronic indwelling bladder catheter. 2. **Symptoms**: Fever, chills, nausea, and flank pain for 2 days. 3. **Physical Examination Findings**: Marked tenderness in the right costovertebral area. 4. **Laboratory Findings**: Urine cultures grow a non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-positive, gram-negative rod. Given these details, we need to consider the likely cause of the patient's condition, which is a urinary tract infection (UTI) complicated by pyelonephritis, likely due to her indwelling catheter. The key detail here is the organism's characteristics: - **Non-lactose fermenting**: This suggests that the organism does not ferment lactose, which can help narrow down the possibilities. - **Oxidase-positive**: This is a characteristic of certain bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but it's not exclusive to this organism. - **Gram-negative rod**: This points towards a variety of bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, and others. Considering the patient's indwelling catheter and the presence of pyelonephritis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a likely candidate. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is known for causing infections in individuals with indwelling catheters, especially in those with compromised immune systems or in healthcare settings. **Answer Choice Analysis**: - **A. Lipoteichoic acid**: This is a component of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria, which does not match our gram-negative rod. - **B. K capsule**: While capsules are found in many bacteria, this option is too vague and doesn't directly correlate with the given characteristics. - **C. Toxin B**: This is associated with Clostridioides difficile (C. diff), which doesn't fit the gram-negative rod description. - **D. Pyoverdine**: This is a siderophore produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a gram-negative rod and fits the description given. **Conclusion**: Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results, the most likely causal organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therefore, the substance it most likely produces, which is associated with this organism, is pyoverdine. **Answer**: D. Pyoverdine",

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

Unexplained fever, worsening of spasticity, or deterioration in neurologic function should prompt a search for infection, thrombophlebitis, or an intraabdominal pathology. The loss of normal thermoregulation and inability to maintain normal body temperature can produce recurrent fever (quadriplegic fever), although most episodes of fever are due to infection of the urinary tract, lung, skin, or bone."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

Pain may be referred to the groin or leg, particularly with extension of infection. The diagnosis of perinephric abscess, like that of splenic abscess, is frequently delayed, and the mortality rate in some series is appreciable, although lower than in the past. Perinephric or renal abscess should be most seriously considered when a patient presents with symptoms and signs of pyelonephritis and remains febrile after 4 or 5 days of treatment. Moreover, when a urine culture yields a polymicrobial flora, when a patient is known to have renal stones, or when fever and pyuria coexist with a sterile urine culture, these diagnoses should be entertained."

            "content": "While there is little question that a febrile illness such as urinary infection can exaggerate or unmask existing symptoms from MS, there is debate about whether a new relapse can be triggered by possible precipitating factors such as infection or trauma. The incidence of respiratory, urinary, or gastrointestinal viral infections that precede the onset or exacerbations of the disease varies greatly in different series, from 5 to 50 percent; however, in our view, none of these has been convincingly related to an increased risk of new attacks of MS. We have had experience with 2 patients who regularly had acute exacerbations of MS following each outbreak of labial genital herpes. The swine influenza vaccine, which was given to 45 million persons in the United States in late 1976, caused a slight increase in the incidence of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 disease but not of MS (Kurland et al), and more recent surveys of immunization programs, such as the one by Confavreux and colleagues (2001), have"

Salmonella and Shigella can be selected on MacConkey agar as non-lactose-fermenting (colorless) colonies or can be grown on Salmonella-Shigella agar or in selenite enrichment broth, both of which inhibit most organisms except these pathogens. Evaluation of nosocomial diarrhea should initially focus on C. difficile; stool culture for other pathogens in this setting has an extremely low yield and is not cost-effective. Toxins A and B produced by pathogenic strains of C. difficile can be detected by rapid enzyme immunoassays, latex agglutination tests, or PCR (Chap. 161). Isolation of C. jejuni requires inoculation of fresh stool onto selective growth medium and incubation at 42\u00b0C in a microaerophilic atmosphere. In many laboratories in the United States, E. coli O157:H7 is among the most common pathogens isolated from visibly"
