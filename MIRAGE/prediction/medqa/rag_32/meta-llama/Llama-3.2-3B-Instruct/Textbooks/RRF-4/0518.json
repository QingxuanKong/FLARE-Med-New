    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results to determine the most likely diagnosis. The patient is a 35-year-old primigravid woman at 12 weeks' gestation with a fever, persistent headache, nausea, abdominal discomfort, gum bleeding, and a positive test for occult blood in her stool. She also has thrombocytopenia (platelet count 18,000/mm^3), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and a positive Coomb's test is negative. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a disorder of hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells). The presence of thrombocytopenia and elevated LDH levels, along with the absence of a positive Coomb's test, points towards an immune-mediated hemolytic anemia rather than an autoimmune hemolytic anemia. HELP syndrome is a complication of preeclampsia, which is not indicated in this patient's presentation. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is also a possibility, but the patient's lack of a history of diarrhea and the presence of thrombocytopenia and elevated LDH levels make it less likely. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal failure, and neurological symptoms, which is not the primary presentation in this case. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are most consistent with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which is characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia, often with a positive Coomb's test, and is a common cause of bleeding in pregnant women. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice?

Many patients are asymptomatic at presentation, and the disease is usually detected by the discovery of splenic enlargement and/or abnormal blood counts during a routine examination. However, in contrast to its companion MPN, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss are common presenting complaints. A blood smear will show the characteristic features of extramedullary hematopoiesis: teardrop-shaped red cells, nucleated red cells, myelocytes, and promyelocytes; myeloblasts may also be present (Fig. 131-1). Anemia, usually mild initially, is the rule, whereas the leukocyte and platelet counts are either normal or increased, but either can be depressed. Mild hepatomegaly may accompany the splenomegaly but is unusual in the absence of splenic enlargement; isolated lymphadenopathy should suggest another diagnosis. Both serum lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase levels can be elevated. The LAP score can be low, normal, or high. Marrow is"

The physiologic stability of the patient may be abnormal with acute blood loss and acute hemolysis, manifesting as tachycardia, blood pressure changes, and, most ominously, an altered state of consciousness. The presence of jaundice suggests hemolysis. Petechiae and purpura indicate a coagulopathy. Hepatosplenomegaly and adenopathy suggest infiltrative disorders. Growth failure or poor weight gain suggests an anemia of chronic disease. An essential element of the physical examination is the investigation of the stool for the presence of occult blood."

Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"
