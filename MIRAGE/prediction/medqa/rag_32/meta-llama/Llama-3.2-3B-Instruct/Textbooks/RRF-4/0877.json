In this case, the value 32 breaths per minute appears three times, which is more than any other value. **Step 4: Select the correct answer** Based on the analysis, the correct answer is: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The respiratory rates of the 7 patients with COPD show that the value 32 breaths per minute appears most frequently, indicating that the mode of these respiratory rates is 32 breaths per minute.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"} ``` The final answer is B.",

There is a marked fall in spirometric values and PEF. Arterial blood gases on air show hypoxemia, and PCO2 is usually low due to hyperventilation.

In this mode, an inspiratory cycle is initiated either by the patient\u2019s inspiratory effort or, if none is detected within a specified time window, by a timer signal within the ventilator. Every breath delivered, whether patientor timer-triggered, consists of the operator-specified tidal volume. Ventilatory rate is determined either by the patient or by the operator-specified backup rate, whichever is of higher frequency. ACMV is commonly used for initiation of mechanical ventilation because it ensures a backup minute ventilation in the absence of an intact respiratory drive and allows for synchronization of the ventilator cycle with the patient\u2019s inspiratory effort."

The partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood Pao2 usually remains near normal until the FEV1 is decreased to ~50% of predicted, and even much lower FEV1 values can be associated with a normal Pao2, at least at rest. An elevation of arterial level of carbon dioxide (Paco2) is not expected until the FEV1 is <25% of predicted and even then may not occur. Pulmonary hypertension severe enough to cause cor pulmonale and right ventricular failure due to COPD typically occurs in individuals who have marked decreases in FEV1 (<25% of predicted) and chronic hypoxemia (Pao2 <55 mmHg); however, recent evidence suggests that some patients will develop significant pulmonary hypertension independent of COPD severity (Chap. 304)."

Patients with acute bronchoconstriction also report a sense of tightness, which can exist even when lung function is still within the normal range. These patients are commonly tachypneic; this condition leads to hyperinflation and reduced respiratory system compliance and also limits tidal volume.

            "content": "Exacerbations are a prominent feature of the natural history of COPD. Exacerbations are episodes of increased dyspnea and cough and change in the amount and character of sputum. They may or may not be accompanied by other signs of illness, including fever, myalgias, and sore throat. Self-reported health-related quality of life correlates with frequency of exacerbations more closely than it does with the degree of airflow obstruction. Economic analyses have shown that >70% of COPD-related health care expenditures go to emergency department visits and hospital care; this translates to >$10 billion annually in the United States. The frequency of exacerbations increases as airflow obstruction increases; patients with moderate to severe airflow obstruction (GOLD stage III or IV; Table 314-1) on average have one to three episodes per year. However, some individuals with very severe airflow obstruction do not have frequent exacerbations; the history of prior exacerbations is a strong"

Specifically, as lung volume and elastic recoil decrease, the equal pressure point moves toward the alveolus in normal individuals. In individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the equal pressure point at any lung volume is closer to the alveolus. Expiratory flow limitation occurs at the equal pressure point. 5. Energy is expended during breathing to overcome the inherent mechanical properties of the lung. Respiratory muscle fatigue is the most common cause of respiratory failure. Individuals breathe at a respiratory rate to minimize work. For individuals with increased airway resistance, work is minimized by breathing at lower frequencies. For individuals with restrictive lung diseases, work is minimized by shallow breathing at high frequencies. 6."

            "content": "Airflow limitation, also known as airflow obstruction, is typically determined by spirometry, which involves forced expiratory maneuvers after the subject has inhaled to total lung capacity. Key parameters obtained from spirometry include the volume of air exhaled within the first second of the forced expiratory maneuver (FEV1) and the total volume of air exhaled during the entire spirometric maneuver (forced vital capacity [FVC]). Patients with airflow obstruction related to COPD have a chronically reduced ratio of FEV1/FVC. In contrast to asthma, the reduced FEV1 in COPD seldom shows large responses to inhaled bronchodilators, although improvements up to 15% are common. Asthma patients can also develop chronic (not fully reversible) airflow obstruction."
