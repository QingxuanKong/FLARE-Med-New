    "question": "A 66-year-old man presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. He endorses diffuse abdominal tenderness. His past medical history is notable for diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, dyslipidemia, depression, and morbid obesity. He also is currently being treated for an outbreak of genital herpes. His temperature is 99.0\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 184/102 mmHg, pulse is 89/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an obese man in no acute distress. A CT scan of the abdomen with contrast is performed and is unremarkable. The patient is admitted to the observation unit for monitoring of his pain. Notably, the patient's abdominal pain improves after an enema and multiple bowel movements. The patient's evening laboratory values are ordered and return as seen below.\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 141 mEq/L\nCl-: 99 mEq/L\nK+: 4.8 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 11 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 177 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 3.1 mg/dL\n\nWhich of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's laboratory derangements?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely etiology of the patient's laboratory derangements, let's analyze the provided information step by step.\\n\\nThe patient presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, and has a history of diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, dyslipidemia, depression, and morbid obesity. The patient's blood pressure is elevated at 184/102 mmHg, which could be related to his hypertension or another underlying condition.\\n\\nThe patient's abdominal pain improves after an enema and multiple bowel movements, which suggests that the pain may be related to constipation or a gastrointestinal issue.\\n\\nThe laboratory values show a low bicarbonate level (HCO3-: 11 mEq/L), which indicates metabolic acidosis. The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 3.1 mg/dL, indicating impaired kidney function, which could be related to his diabetic nephropathy.\\n\\nConsidering these findings, the most likely etiology of the patient's laboratory derangements is related to his constipation or gastrointestinal issue, which is likely caused by his morbid obesity. The elevated creatinine level and metabolic acidosis are secondary to his impaired kidney function.\\n\\nNow, let's evaluate the answer choices:\\nA. Acyclovir: This medication is used to treat viral infections, such as herpes, but it is not directly related to the patient's laboratory derangements.\\nB. Atorvastatin: This medication is used to lower cholesterol levels, but it is not directly related to the patient's laboratory derangements.\\nC. Metformin: This medication is used to treat type 2 diabetes, and it can cause lactic acidosis as a side effect, but the patient's metabolic acidosis is more likely related to his impaired kidney function.\\nD. Metoprolol: This medication is used to treat high blood pressure, and it is not directly related to the patient's laboratory derangements.\\n\\nThe correct answer is not among the options, but based on the analysis, the most likely etiology of the patient's laboratory derangements is his constipation or gastrointestinal issue, likely caused by his morbid obesity.\\nHowever, since the options do not include the correct answer, I will choose the closest related option, which is A. Acyclovir, as it is related to the patient's genital herpes treatment, which may be contributing to his constipation.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

The diagnosis is established by two of the following three criteria: (1) typical abdominal pain in the epigastrium that may radiate to the back, (2) threefold or greater elevation in serum lipase and/or amylase, and (3) confirmatory findings of acute pancreatitis on cross-sectional abdominal imaging. Patients also have associated nausea, emesis, fever, tachycardia, and abnormal findings on abdominal examination. Laboratory studies may reveal leukocytosis, hypocalcemia, and hyperglycemia. Although not required for diagnosis, markers of severity may include hemoconcentration (hematocrit >44%), admission azotemia (BUN >22 mg/dL), SIRS, and signs of organ failure (Table 371-3)."

Few clinical situations require greater judgment, because the most catastrophic of events may be forecast by the subtlest of symptoms and signs. In every instance, the clinician must distinguish those conditions 20 that require urgent intervention from those that do not and can best be managed nonoperatively. A meticulously executed, detailed history and physical examination are critically important for focusing the differential diagnosis, where necessary, and allowing the diagnostic evaluation to proceed expeditiously (Table 20-1).

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

It may be difficult to differentiate acute cholecystitis from acute pancreatitis, because an elevated serum amylase may be found in both disorders. Pain of biliary tract origin is more right sided or epigastric than periumbilical or left upper quadrant and can be more severe; ileus is usually absent. Ultrasound is helpful in establishing the diagnosis of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. Intestinal obstruction due to mechanical factors can be differentiated from pancreatitis by the history of crescendo-decrescendo pain, findings on abdominal examination, and CT of the abdomen showing changes"

Leukocytosis should never be the single deciding factor as to whether or not operation is indicated. A white blood cell count >20,000/\u03bcL may be observed with perforation of a viscus, but pancreatitis, acute cholecystitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and intestinal infarction may also be associated with marked leukocytosis. A normal white blood cell count is not rare in cases of perforation of abdominal viscera. The diagnosis of anemia may be more helpful than the white blood cell count, especially when combined with the history."
