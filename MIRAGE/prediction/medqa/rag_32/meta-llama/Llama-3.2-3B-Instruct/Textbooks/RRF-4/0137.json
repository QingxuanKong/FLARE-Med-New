    "question": "A 36-year-old woman comes to the clinic because of tearing and a foreign body sensation in her eyes bilaterally, which has gradually worsened over the last several weeks. She also notes having occasional palpitations, nervousness, sweating, and heat intolerance. Her past medical history is unremarkable. She reports a 20-pack-year smoking history and is currently a daily smoker. Physical examination shows an anxious, trembling woman. She has eyelid retraction bilaterally, with an inability to fully close her eyes. Her extraocular motility is limited on upgaze. There is no thyromegaly, and no thyroid nodules are noted. Laboratory studies reveal a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.1 \u03bcU/mL and total T4 of 42 \u03bcg/dL. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin is positive. CT scan of the orbits shows proptosis and marked enlargement of the extraocular muscle with sparing of the tendons. Which of the following would most likely transiently worsen this patient\u2019s eye symptoms?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of Graves' ophthalmopathy, which is a condition associated with Graves' disease. The key findings include eyelid retraction, limited upgaze, and proptosis with marked enlargement of the extraocular muscles, but sparing of the tendons. This pattern is consistent with Graves' ophthalmopathy. The laboratory studies reveal elevated thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin, which supports the diagnosis of Graves' disease. The CT scan of the orbits confirms the presence of proptosis and muscle enlargement. The question asks which of the options would most likely transiently worsen the patient's eye symptoms. To answer this, we need to consider the effects of each option on the patient's condition. Option A, external orbital radiation, is not typically used to treat Graves' ophthalmopathy and could potentially worsen the condition. Option B, selenium supplementation, is actually used to treat Graves' disease and may help alleviate symptoms of ophthalmopathy. Option C, systemic corticosteroids, can worsen Graves' ophthalmopathy by exacerbating inflammation and muscle swelling. Option D, treatment with radioactive iodine, can also worsen the condition by increasing thyroid hormone production and potentially leading to further inflammation. Based on this analysis, the most likely option to transiently worsen the patient's eye symptoms is C. Systemic corticosteroids. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Orbital inflammation and engorgement of the extra-ocular muscles, particularly the medial rectus and the inferior rectus, account for the protrusion of the globe. Corneal exposure, lid retraction, conjunctival injection, restriction of gaze, diplopia, and visual loss from optic nerve compression are cardinal symptoms. Graves\u2019 eye disease is a clinical diagnosis, but laboratory testing can be useful. The serum level of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins is often elevated. Orbital imaging usually reveals enlarged extraocular eye muscles, but not always. Graves\u2019 ophthalmopathy can be treated with oral prednisone (60 mg/d) for 1 month, followed by a taper over several months. Worsening of symptoms upon glucocorticoid withdrawal is common.

However, the enlarged extraocular muscles typical of the disease, and other subtle features, can be detected in almost all patients when investigated by ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) imaging of the orbits. Unilateral signs are found in up to 10% of patients. The earliest manifestations of ophthalmopathy are usually a sensation of grittiness, eye discomfort, and excess tearing. About one-third of patients have proptosis, best detected by visualization of the sclera between the lower border of the iris and the lower eyelid, with the eyes in the primary position. Proptosis can be measured using an exophthalmometer. In severe cases, proptosis may cause corneal exposure and damage, especially if the lids fail to close during sleep. Periorbital edema, scleral injection, and chemosis are also frequent. In 5\u201310% of patients, the muscle swelling is so severe that diplopia results, typically, but not"

            "content": "The idiopathic granulomatous painful condition of the cavernous sinus has been termed Tolosa-Hunt syndrome; a similar process affecting structures of the orbit is known as orbital pseudotumor. Orbital pseudotumor causes an inflammatory enlargement of the extraocular muscles, which often also encompasses the globe and other orbital contents (Fig. 13-8). It is often accompanied by injection of the conjunctiva and lid and slight proptosis. One or more muscles may be involved and there is a tendency to relapse and later to involve the opposite globe. Visual loss from compression of the optic nerve is a rare complication. Associations with connective tissue disease have been reported and IgG4-related sclerosis has increasingly been identified as a cause. Ultrasonography examination or CT scans of the orbit show enlargement of the orbital muscles including the tendons, as opposed to thyroid ophthalmopathy in which the muscles are enlarged but the muscle tendons are typically spared."

Unilateral or bilateral ptosis can be congenital, from dysgenesis of the levator palpebrae superioris, or from abnormal insertion of its aponeurosis into the eyelid. Acquired ptosis can develop so gradually that the patient is unaware of the problem. Inspection of old photographs is helpful in dating the onset. A history of prior trauma, eye surgery, contact lens use, diplopia, systemic symptoms (e.g., dysphagia or peripheral muscle weakness), or a family history of ptosis should be sought. Fluctuating ptosis that worsens late in the day is typical of myasthenia gravis. Examination should focus on evidence for proptosis, eyelid masses or deformities, inflammation, pupil inequality, or limitation of motility. The width of the palpebral fissures is measured in primary gaze to determine the degree of ptosis. The ptosis will be underestimated if the patient compensates by lifting the brow with the frontalis muscle."

Ophthalmopathy typically worsens over the initial 3\u20136 months, followed by a plateau phase over the next 12\u201318 months, with spontaneous improvement, particularly in the soft tissue changes. However, the course is more fulminant in up to 5% of patients, requiring intervention in the acute phase if there is optic nerve compression or corneal ulceration. Diplopia may appear late in the disease due to fibrosis of the extraocular muscles. Radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism worsens the eye disease in a small proportion of patients (especially smokers). Antithyroid drugs or surgery have no adverse effects on the clinical course of ophthalmopathy. Thyroid dermopathy, when it occurs, usually appears 1\u20132 years after the development of Graves\u2019 hyperthyroidism; it may improve spontaneously."

            "content": "One caution: with either drug, some patients deteriorate immediately, but briefly, as a result of an increase in pulmonary secretions. A positive test consists of visible (objective) improvement in muscle contractility, fusion of diplopia, or resolution of fatigable ptosis. Dynamometry and measurement of forced vital capacity serve as more objective markers of improvement, or lack of effect. The report of subjective improvement alone is not dependable and one must be distrustful of equivocal test results, which may occur with ocular palsies due to tumors, thyroid disease, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), progressive supranuclear palsy, or carotid aneurysms (pseudoocular myasthenia)."

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months.
