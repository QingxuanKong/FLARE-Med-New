The physical examination shows jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities.

The patient is at 30 weeks gestation with nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities. The laboratory findings show elevated total bilirubin and conjugated bilirubin levels, but normal liver enzymes (ALT and AST). The patient's previous pregnancy ended in stillbirth at 31 weeks, and her older sister had preeclampsia in both pregnancies. These factors suggest a possible diagnosis of HELLP syndrome, a subtype of preeclampsia characterized by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets. The risk factors for HELLP syndrome include a history of preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy, previous stillbirth, and a family history of preeclampsia. Given these factors, the correct answer is D.

Total alkaline phosphatase activity almost doubles, but much of the rise is attributable to heat-stable placental alkaline phosphatase isozymes.

The serum albumin concentration declines during pregnancy. By late pregnancy, albumin levels may be near 3.0 g/dL compared with approximately 4.3 g/dL in nonpregnant women (Mendenhall, 1970). Total body albumin levels rise, however, because of pregnancy-associated increased plasma volume. Serum globulin levels are also slightly higher."

At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula.

Examples are intrahepatic cholestasis and acute fatty liver, both discussed in the next sections. Also, hepatic dysfunction from hyperemesis gravidarum may involve the liver. Mild hyperbilirubinemia with elevated serum transaminase levels is seen in up to half of afected women requiring hospitalization. However, these levels seldom exceed 200 U/L (Table 55-1). Liver biopsy may show minimal fatty changes. Hyperemesis gravidarum is discussed in detail in Chapter 54 (p. 1043). Another in this first category is hepatocellular damage with preeclampsia-the HELLP syndrome-which is characterized by hemolysis, \ufffdlevated serum liver enzyme levels, and low 2latelet counts. hese changes are discussed in detail in Chapter 40 (p. 721)."
