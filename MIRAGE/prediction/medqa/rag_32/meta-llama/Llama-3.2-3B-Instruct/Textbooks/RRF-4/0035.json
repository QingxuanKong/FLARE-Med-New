His left knee was swollen a few weeks ago, but now with both joints affected, he has difficulty walking and feels frustrated. He also has back pain which makes it extremely difficult to move around and be active during the day. He says his pain significantly improves with rest. He also suffers from dandruff for which he uses special shampoos. Physical examination is notable for pitting of his nails. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The patient has a 16-year history of arthritis, which suggests a chronic condition. The recent onset of swelling and pain in both knees, as well as back pain, indicates a possible flare-up or progression of the underlying condition. The improvement of pain with rest is a characteristic feature of inflammatory arthritis. The patient also has pitting of his nails, which is a common finding in rheumatoid arthritis. Dandruff is a common comorbidity in rheumatoid arthritis. The patient's age and sex are also consistent with rheumatoid arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is more common in younger patients and often presents with skin lesions. Arthritis mutilans is a rare and severe form of psoriatic arthritis. Mixed connective tissue disease is a less likely diagnosis given the absence of characteristic features such as high levels of anti-U1-RNP antibodies and myositis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is rheumatoid arthritis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

            "content": "OA is the most common cause of chronic knee pain in persons over age 45, but the differential diagnosis is long. Inflammatory arthritis is likely if there is prolonged morning stiffness and many other joints are affected. Bursitis occurs commonly around knees and hips. A physical examination should focus on whether tenderness is over the joint line (at the junction of the two bones around which the joint is articulating) or is outside of it. Anserine bursitis, medial and distal to the knee, is an extremely common cause of chronic knee pain that may respond to a glucocorticoid injection. Prominent nocturnal pain in the absence of end-stage OA merits a distinct workup. For hip pain, OA can be detected by loss of internal rotation on passive movement, and pain isolated to an area lateral to the hip joint usually reflects the presence of trochanteric bursitis. No blood tests are routinely indicated for workup of patients with OA unless symptoms and signs suggest inflammatory arthritis."

The locale and level of pain elicited by palpation or movement should be quantified. One standard would be to count the number of tender joints on palpation of 28 easily examined joints (proximal interphalangeals, metacarpophalangeals, wrists, elbows, shoulders, and knees). Similarly, the number of swollen joints (0\u201328) can be counted and recorded. Careful examination should distinguish between true articular swelling (caused by bony hypertrophy, synovial effusion or proliferation) and nonarticular (or periarticular) involvement, which usually extends beyond the normal joint margins. Synovial effusion can be distinguished from synovial hypertrophy or bony hypertrophy by palpation or specific maneuvers.

The muscular soreness may be diffuse or asymmetrical, particularly in the proximal arms and shoulders. Every movement is reported as stiff and painful. The periarticular tissues and their muscular attachments are affected primarily and may be tender, but this is difficult to interpret, because tenderness in these regions may be found in healthy individuals.

Affects a limited number of joints (oligoarticular); hips, lower lumbar spine, knees, and the distal interphalangeal joints (DIP) and proximal interphalangeal joints (PIP) of fingers are common sites. E. Classic presentation is joint stiffness in the morning that worsens during the day. F. Pathologic features include 1. Disruption of the cartilage that lines the articular surface (Fig. 18.7); fragments of cartilage floating in the joint space are called 'joint mice.' 2. Eburnation of the subchondral bone 3. Osteophyte formation (reactive bony outgrowths); classically arises in the DIP (Heberden nodes) and PIP (Bouchard nodes) joints of the fingers III. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS A.

            "content": "David Robertson, MD, & Italo Biaggioni, MD* A 38-year-old man has been experiencing palpitations and headaches. He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

During his tumble he heard an audible \u201cclick.\u201d After recovering from his spill, he developed tremendous pain in his right knee. He was unable to carry on skiing for that day, and by the time he returned to his chalet, his knee was significantly swollen. He went immediately to see an orthopedic surgeon. The orthopedic surgeon carefully reviewed the mechanism of injury."
