Upon further questioning, it is found that although his sleeping hours are adequate, he does not feel refreshed in the morning. His wife complains that he snores loudly all night. After ruling out common medical disorders and possible drug abuse, he is advised an overnight polysomnogram that records 12 episodes of apnea and 30 episodes of hypopnea during a 7-hour sleep.

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the patient's condition, we need to analyze the information provided in the question. The patient presents with excessive daytime somnolence and easy fatigability, and his wife complains that he snores loudly all night. The overnight polysomnogram records 12 episodes of apnea and 30 episodes of hypopnea during a 7-hour sleep. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is calculated by dividing the number of episodes of apnea and hypopnea by the total sleep time. In this case, the AHI is 12 + 30 = 42 episodes per 7 hours, which is approximately 6 episodes per hour. This value is greater than 5, which is the threshold for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). Therefore, option A is a possible answer. However, we need to consider other options as well. Option B is incorrect because episodes of apnea and hypopnea are more likely to occur during deeper stages of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, not non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Option C is also incorrect because mouth opening during sleep does not relieve airway obstruction in patients with OSAHS. Option D is incorrect because gynoid obesity is not associated with apnea and hypopnea more frequently than android obesity. In fact, android obesity is more commonly associated with OSAHS. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), and the correct answer is option A: This patient's apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is more than 5.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The MSLT measures a patient\u2019s propensity to sleep under quiet conditions. The test is performed after an overnight polysomnogram to establish that the patient has had an adequate amount of good-quality nighttime sleep. The MSLT consists of five 20-min nap opportunities every 2 h across the day. The patient is instructed to try to fall asleep, and the major endpoints are the average latency to sleep and the occurrence of REM sleep during the naps. An average sleep latency across the naps of less than 8 min is considered objective evidence of excessive daytime sleepiness. REM sleep normally occurs only during the nighttime sleep episode, and the occurrence of REM sleep in two or more of the MSLT naps provides support for the diagnosis of narcolepsy."

OSAHS and CSA share some risk factors and physiological bases but also have unique features. Each disorder is associated with impaired ventilation during sleep and disruption of sleep, and each diagnosis requires careful elicitation of the patient\u2019s history, physical examination, and physiological testing. OSAHS, the more common disorder, causes daytime sleepiness, impairs daily function, and is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease in adults and to behavioral 1723 problems in children. CSA is less common and may occur in combination with obstructive sleep apnea, as a primary condition, or secondary to a medical condition or medication. CSA impairs overnight gas exchange and may result in symptoms of either insomnia or excessive sleepiness."

Across the five naps of the MSLT, most patients with narcolepsy will fall asleep in less than 8 min on average, and they will have episodes of REM sleep in at least two of the naps. Abnormal regulation of REM sleep is also manifested by the appearance of REM sleep within 15 min of sleep onset at night, which is rare in healthy individuals sleeping at their habitual bedtime. Stimulants should be stopped 1 week before the MSLT and antidepressants should be stopped 3 weeks prior, because these medications can affect the MSLT.

Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea must be differentiated from individuals with primary snoring (i.e., otherwise nography). Individuals with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea may additionally report nocturnal gasping and choking. The presence of sleepiness or other daytime symptoms not explained by other etiologies suggests the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea hypop\u2014 nea, but this differentiation requires polysomnography. Definitive differential diagnosis between hypersomnia, central sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoventilation, and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea also requires polysomnographic studies."

In adolescents, difficulties falling asleep at night are common, causing sleep deprivation. The MSLT result may be positive if conducted while the individual is sleep deprived or while his or her sleep is phase delayed. Sleep apnea syndromes. Sleep apneas are especially likely in the presence of obesity. Because obstructive sleep apnea is more frequent than narcolepsy, cataplexy may be over- looked (or absent), and the individual is assumed to have obstructive sleep apnea unre- sponsive to usual therapies. Major depressive disorder. Narcolepsy or hypersomnia may be associated or confused with depression. Cataplexy is not present in depression. The MSLT results are most often normal, and there is dissociation between subjective and objective sleepiness, as measured by the mean sleep latency during the MSLT."

He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

Patients with parenchymal lung or chest wall disease typically present with shortness of breath and diminished exercise tolerance. Episodes of increased dyspnea and sputum production are hallmarks of obstructive lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, whereas progressive dyspnea and cough are common in interstitial lung diseases. Excessive daytime somnolence, poor-quality sleep, and snoring are common among patients with sleep-disordered breathing.

Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea can be differentiated from narcolepsy by the absence of cataplexy, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis and by the presence of loud snoring, gasping during sleep, or observed apneas in sleep. Daytime sleep episodes in narcolepsy are characteristically shorter, more refreshing, and more often associated with dreaming. gen desaturation during nocturnal polysomnographic studies. Narcolepsy results in mul- tiple sleep-onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods during the MSLT. Narcolepsy, like obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, may be associated with obesity, and some individuals have concurrent narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea. A diagnosis of narco- lepsy does not exclude the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea, as the two con- ditions may co\u2014occur."
