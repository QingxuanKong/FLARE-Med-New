    "question": "A 68-year-old man from California presents for a routine checkup. He does not have any complaints. He says that he has tried to keep himself healthy and active by jogging and gardening since his retirement at age 50. He adds that he spends his mornings in the park and his afternoons in his garden. He has no significant medical history. The patient denies any smoking history and drinks alcohol occasionally. On physical examination, the following lesion is seen on his scalp (see image). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Psoriasis",
        "B": "Seborrheic keratosis",
        "C": "Actinic keratosis",
        "D": "Squamous cell carcinoma"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's consider the key points from the patient's history and physical examination. The patient is a 68-year-old man from California, which suggests a high risk for skin cancer due to sun exposure. He has a history of jogging and gardening, which also increases his risk for skin cancer. The patient denies any smoking history, but this is not uncommon in patients with skin cancer. He drinks alcohol occasionally, but this is not a significant risk factor for skin cancer. The physical examination revealed a lesion on his scalp, which is a critical finding. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Psoriasis - Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that can cause scaly, itchy patches on the skin, but it is not typically associated with a solitary lesion on the scalp. B. Seborrheic keratosis - Seborrheic keratoses are benign growths that are common in older adults, but they are typically flat and not typically found on the scalp. C. Actinic keratosis - Actinic keratosis is a precancerous lesion that is caused by chronic sun exposure, which fits the patient's history of jogging and gardening. It appears as a small, rough, scaly patch on the skin, often on the face, ears, or scalp. D. Squamous cell carcinoma - Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can occur on the scalp, but it is more common in individuals with a history of sun exposure, and it typically presents as a firm, non-healing ulcer or a firm, red nodule. Considering the patient's history and the physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is actinic keratosis (C). This diagnosis is consistent with the patient's history of chronic sun exposure and the appearance of a solitary lesion on the scalp.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

He immediately fell to the ground unconscious, but after about 30 seconds he was helped to his feet and felt otherwise well. It was noted he had some bruising around his temple. He decided not to continue playing and went to watch the match from the side. Over the next hour he became extremely sleepy and was eventually unrousable. He was rushed to hospital. When he was admitted to hospital, the patient\u2019s breathing was shallow and irregular and it was necessary to intubate him. A skull radiograph demonstrated a fracture in the region of the pterion.

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian"

Focused History: This was IR\u2019s first occurrence of severe joint pain. In the ED, he was given an anti-inflammatory medication. Fluid aspirated from the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb was negative for organisms but positive for needle-shaped monosodium urate (MSU) crystals (see image at right). The inflammatory symptoms have since resolved. IR reports he is in good health otherwise, with no significant past medical history. His body mass index (BMI) is 31. No tophi (deposits of MSU crystals under the skin) were detected in the physical examination."

He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?"

Following a sleepless night with significant dyspnea, the patient develops nausea and vomiting and collapses. He presents to the emergency department in cardiac arrest and is unable to be resuscitated. His autopsy shows a posterior wall myocardial infarction and a fresh thrombus in an atherosclerotic right coronary artery. What went wrong? The clinician had decided, based on the patient\u2019s appearance, even before starting the history, that the patient\u2019s complaints were not serious. Therefore, he felt confident that he could perform an abbreviated and focused examination by using the URI assessment protocol rather than considering the broader range of possibilities and performing appropriate tests to confirm or refute his initial hypotheses. In particular, by concentrating on the URI, the clinician failed to elicit the full dyspnea history, which would have"

Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

In certain individuals, alcohol, intense exercise (such as weight lifting), stooping, straining, coughing, and sexual intercourse are known to initiate a bursting (thunderclap) headache, lasting a few seconds to minutes. If a headache is made worse by sudden movement or by coughing or straining, an intracranial source is tentatively suggested. Migraine often occurs several hours or a day following a period of intense activity and stress (\u201cweekend,\u201d or \u201cletdown\u201d migraine). Some patients have discovered that their migraine is relieved momentarily by gentle compression of the carotid or superficial temporal artery on the painful side, and others report that the carotid near the angle of the jaw is tender during the headache. Pain that is noticed when the scalp is stroked in combing or fixing the hair"
