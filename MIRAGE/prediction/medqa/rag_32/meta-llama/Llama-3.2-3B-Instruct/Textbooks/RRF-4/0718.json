    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and the potential side effects of the medications listed. The patient presents with swelling of his legs (edema) for 2 months, which is a common side effect of certain medications used to treat hypertension. The patient was recently started on a new medication for hypertension. Let's review the potential side effects of the medications listed: A. Losartan: An angiotensin II receptor antagonist that is commonly used to treat hypertension. It is not typically associated with edema as a side effect. B. Spironolactone: A potassium-sparing diuretic that can cause edema as a side effect, especially in patients with heart failure or liver disease. C. Hydrochlorothiazide: A thiazide diuretic that is commonly used to treat hypertension and can cause edema as a side effect, especially in patients with heart failure or liver disease. D. Amlodipine: A calcium channel blocker that is commonly used to treat hypertension and is not typically associated with edema as a side effect. Given the patient's symptoms of swelling in both lower extremities and the recent start of a new medication for hypertension, the most likely cause is edema caused by a diuretic. Between options C and B, Hydrochlorothiazide (C) is more commonly associated with edema as a side effect, especially in patients with heart failure or liver disease. However, without further information about the patient's medical history, it is difficult to rule out Spironolactone (B) entirely. Nevertheless, considering the typical side effect profiles of these medications, the most likely answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

He was recently incarcerated near Bakersfield, California and returned to Oakland about 3 months ago. He is currently experiencing one month of severe headache and double vision. He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

Less common causes of facial edema include trichinosis, allergic reactions, and myxedema. Edema limited to one leg or to one or both arms is usually the result of venous and/or lymphatic obstruction. Unilateral paralysis reduces lymphatic and venous drainage on the affected side and may also be responsible for unilateral edema. In patients with obstruction of the superior vena cava, edema is confined to the face, neck, and upper extremities in which the venous pressure is elevated compared with that in the lower extremities.

His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor.

Patients with this condition present with nonspecific findings. Most patients are diagnosed after ure-teral obstruction. Patients may complain of dull or acute back or flank pain. Systemic complaints include anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, fever, and malaise. Decreased urinary out-put may ensue if the ureters become fibrotic. Because of renal artery impingement, patients are commonly hypertensive on exam. Other physical exam findings include lower extremity edema and diminished lower extremity pulses if the vessels of the lower extremities are compressed. New hydrocele or varico-cele can also be associated with fibrosis of the retroperitoneum. Laboratory analysis is also nonspecific. If there is renal obstruc-tion, patients may have elevated serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive pro-tein is elevated in most"

Physical examination demonstrates short stature and mild generalized obesity. Genital examination reveals descended but small testes and a phallic length of \u20132 SD. Laboratory evaluations demonstrate growth hormone (GH) deficiency and a delayed bone age of 18 months. The patient is started on replacement with recombinant human GH at a dose of 40 mcg/kg per day subcutaneously. After 1 year of treatment, his height velocity has increased from 5 cm/y to 11 cm/y.
