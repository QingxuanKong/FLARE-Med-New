    "question": "A 10-year-old African American girl with known sickle cell disease becomes acutely anemic in the setting of underlying infection. Her mother denies any previous history of blood clots in her past, but she says that her mother has also had to be treated for pulmonary embolism in the recent past. The patient\u2019s past medical history is significant for a few episodes of acute pain crisis and a need for splenectomy 3 years ago. The vital signs upon arrival include: temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 106/74 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min and regular, and respiratory rate 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding and fingernails are pale, but breath sounds remain clear. Oxygen saturation was initially 91% on room air and electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus tachycardia. A blood transfusion is initiated. Shortly after the transfusion has begun, the patient experiences fevers, chills, a burning sensation at the intravenous (IV) site, and sudden hypotension. What is the name of this reaction, and what is the best treatment?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Nonhemolytic febrile reaction; administer antihistamines",

        "D": "Hemolytic transfusion reaction; discontinue transfusion"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the symptoms and signs presented by the patient after the blood transfusion. The patient experiences fevers, chills, a burning sensation at the IV site, and sudden hypotension shortly after the transfusion begins. These symptoms are indicative of a severe reaction to the blood transfusion. The key symptoms here are the fevers, chills, and hypotension, which are not typical of a minor or nonhemolytic reaction. The burning sensation at the IV site may be a sign of an allergic reaction, but it is not the primary concern in this scenario. The patient's vital signs also show tachycardia, which can be a response to the reaction. The most likely diagnosis is a hemolytic transfusion reaction, which is a severe reaction to blood transfusion that can cause the destruction of red blood cells. This reaction can lead to anemia, jaundice, and in severe cases, organ failure. The patient's pale fingernails and bounding pulses also suggest anemia. The best treatment for a hemolytic transfusion reaction is to discontinue the transfusion and administer supportive care, which may include fluids, oxygen, and medications to manage symptoms. In severe cases, blood products that are less likely to trigger the reaction may be used. Antihistamines may be used to manage symptoms of an allergic reaction, but they are not the primary treatment for a hemolytic transfusion reaction. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Hemolytic transfusion reaction; discontinue transfusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The acute chest syndrome is a vasoocclusive crisis within the lungs with evidence of a new infiltrate on chest radiograph. It is often associated with infection and infarction. The patient may first complain of chest pain but within a few hours develops cough, increasing respiratory and heart rates, hypoxia, and progressive respiratory distress. Physical examination reveals areas of decreased breath sounds and dullness on chest percussion. Treatment involves early recognition and prevention of arterial hypoxemia. Oxygen, fluids, judicious use of analgesic medications, antibiotics, bronchodilators, and RBC transfusion (rarely exchange transfusion) are indicated in therapy for acute chest syndrome. Incentive spirometry may help reduce the incidence of acute chest crisis in patients presenting with pain in the chest or abdomen."

            "content": "The goals of the initial evaluation are to determine whether the transient loss of consciousness was due to syncope; to identify the cause; and to assess risk for future episodes and serious harm (Table 27-1). The initial evaluation should include a detailed history, thorough questioning of eyewitnesses, and a complete physical and neurologic examination. Blood pressure and heart rate should be measured in the supine position and after 3 min of standing to determine whether orthostatic hypotension is present. An ECG should be performed if there is suspicion of syncope due to an arrhythmia or underlying cardiac disease. Relevant electrocardiographic abnormalities include bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias, AV block, ischemia, old myocardial infarction, long QT syndrome, and bundle branch block. This initial assessment will lead to the identification of a cause of syncope in approximately 50% of patients and also allows stratification of patients at risk for cardiac mortality."

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

            "content": "Sickle cell disease is complicated by sudden, occasionally severe and life-threatening events caused by the acute intra-vascular sickling of the RBCs, with resultant pain or organ dysfunction (so-called crisis). In two different clinical situations, an acute, potentially life-threatening decline in the hemoglobin level may be superimposed on the chronic compensated anemia. Splenic sequestration crisis is a life-threatening, hyperacute drop in the hemoglobin level (blood volume) secondary to splenic pooling of the patient\u2019s RBCs and sickling within the spleen. The spleen is moderately to markedly enlarged, and the reticulocyte count is elevated. In an aplastic crisis, parvovirus B19 infects RBC precursors in the bone marrow and induces transient RBC aplasia with reticulocytopenia and a rapid worsening of anemia because of the very short life span of sickle RBCs. Simple transfusion therapy is indicated for sequestration and aplastic crises when the anemia is symptomatic."

Focused History: As noted on her medical alert bracelet, MW has had type 1 diabetes (T1D) for the last 24 years. Her husband reports that this is her first medical emergency in 2 years. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): MW displayed signs of dehydration (such as dry mucous membranes and skin, poor skin turgor, and low blood pressure) and acidosis (such as deep, rapid breathing [Kussmaul respiration]). Her breath had a faintly fruity odor. Her temperature was normal."

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

            "content": "The disposition of younger, previously healthy heat-exhaustion patients who have no major laboratory abnormalities may include hospital observation and discharge after IV rehydration. Older patients with comorbidities (including cardiovascular disease) or predisposing factors often require inpatient fluid and electrolyte replacement, monitoring, and reassessment. The clinical manifestations of heatstroke reflect a total loss of thermo-regulatory function. Typical vital-sign abnormalities include tachypnea, various tachycardias, hypotension, and a widened pulse pressure. Although there is no single specific diagnostic test, the historical and physical triad of exposure to a heat stress, CNS dysfunction, and a core temperature >40.5\u00b0C helps establish the preliminary diagnosis."

Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension.
