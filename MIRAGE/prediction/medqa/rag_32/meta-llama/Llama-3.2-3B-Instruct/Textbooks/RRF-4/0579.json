    "question": "A 59-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider complaining of diffuse bodily aches. She reports a 3-month history of gradually worsening pain in her shoulders and hips that is worse in her right hip. She has a history of hypertension and recurrent renal stones for which she takes lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. She was admitted to the hospital earlier in the year after falling in her front yard and sustaining a distal radius fracture and vertebral compression fracture. Her temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 145/85 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 20/min. On exam, she is well-appearing with mild tenderness to palpation in her shoulders and hips. She has mild pain with hip flexion and shoulder abduction. She has full range of motion in her bilateral upper and lower extremities. Serum findings are notable for the following:\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 141 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 4.8 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 22 mEq/L\nUrea nitrogen: 17 mg/dL\nGlucose: 110 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.12 mg/dL\nCa2+: 11.2 mg/dL\nPhosphate: 2.3 mg/dL\nMg2+: 1.9 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase: 120 U/L\n\nA radiograph of this patient\u2019s right hip would most likely reveal which of the following?",

She has a history of hypertension and recurrent renal stones, and she was recently admitted to the hospital after falling and sustaining a distal radius fracture and vertebral compression fracture.\\n\\nThe patient's serum findings show an elevated alkaline phosphatase level, which suggests bone involvement. The patient's calcium level is also slightly low, which can be seen in conditions that affect bone metabolism.\\n\\nGiven the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is osteomalacia, a condition characterized by softening of the bones due to impaired bone mineralization. This condition can be caused by vitamin D deficiency, which is common in individuals with renal impairment or malabsorption.\\n\\nRadiographically, osteomalacia is often characterized by a well-defined cystic lesion with peritrabecular fibrosis, which is a result of the replacement of normal bone tissue with fibrous tissue and cystic spaces.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely radiographic finding in the patient's right hip is a well-defined cystic lesion with peritrabecular fibrosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Focused History: Ten days ago, CR had her spleen removed following a bicycle accident in which she fractured her tibial eminence, necessitating immobilization of the right knee. She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."
