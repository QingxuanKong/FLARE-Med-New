    "question": "Six days after undergoing surgical repair of a hip fracture, a previously healthy 79-year-old woman is agitated and confused. She is unarousable during the day, but then is awake and impulsive during the night, requiring frequent reorientation. Her husband says that she usually drinks one to two glasses of wine weekly. Her only current medication is oxycodone for pain. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is distressed and oriented to person but not to place or time. Neurologic examination shows inattentiveness but no focal deficits. Urine dipstick is normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her current condition?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely cause of the patient's condition, let's analyze the given information: 1. The patient is a 79-year-old woman who underwent surgical repair of a hip fracture six days ago. 2. She is agitated and confused during the day, but then becomes awake and impulsive at night, requiring frequent reorientation. 3. Her vital signs are within normal limits. 4. She is distressed and oriented to person (can identify herself), but not to place (cannot identify her location) or time (cannot tell the day or date). 5. Neurologic examination shows inattentiveness, but no focal deficits. 6. Urine dipstick is normal. Considering these points, the patient's condition seems to be related to her recent surgery and medication, rather than a urinary tract infection or dementia. The fact that she becomes agitated and confused during the day and then becomes more alert at night is consistent with a condition that affects consciousness and awareness. The most likely cause of her condition is opioid intoxication. Opioids can cause confusion, agitation, and disorientation, especially in elderly patients. The patient's use of oxycodone for pain is a potential contributor to this condition. Opioids can also cause a phenomenon called \"opioid-induced delirium,\" which is characterized by fluctuating levels of consciousness and impaired cognitive function. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Opioid intoxication.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

Insulin E. pH Case 10: Calf Pain Patient Presentation: CR is a 19-year-old female who is being evaluated for pain and swelling in her right calf. Focused History: Ten days ago, CR had her spleen removed following a bicycle accident in which she fractured her tibial eminence, necessitating immobilization of the right knee. She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

From Fig. 40-1 it can also be appreciated that when there is only one sign of Wernicke disease, it is usually a confusional state. Several related types of disturbed mentation and consciousness are recognized. By far the most common disturbance is a global confusional state. The next following in frequency is memory loss discussed as follows. The patient is apathetic, inattentive, and indifferent to his surroundings. Spontaneous speech is minimal and many questions are left unanswered, or the patient may suspend conversation and drift off to sleep, although he can be aroused without difficulty. Such questions as are answered betray disorientation in time and place, misidentification of those around him, and an inability to grasp the immediate situation. Many of the patient\u2019s remarks may be irrational and lack consistency from one moment to another. If the"

When the patient is not fully awake, the examiner should describe the responses to the minimum stimulus necessary to elicit a reaction, ranging from verbal commands to a brief, painful stimulus such as a squeeze of the trapezius muscle. Responses that are directed toward the stimulus and signify some degree of intact cerebral function (e.g., opening the eyes and looking at the examiner or reaching to push away a painful stimulus) must be distinguished from reflex responses of a spinal origin (e.g., triple flexion response\u2014flexion at the ankle, knee, and hip in response to a painful stimulus to the foot). Orientation is tested by asking the person to state his or her name, location, and time (day of the week and date); time is usually the first to be affected in a variety of conditions."

This is the condition of the normal person when awake. In this state the individual is fully responsive to a thought or perception and indicates by his behavior and speech the same awareness of self and environment as that of the examiner. There is attention to, and interaction with, the immediate surroundings. This normal state may fluctuate during the day from one of keen alertness or deep concentration with a marked constriction of the field of attention to one of mild general inattentiveness, but even in the latter circumstances, the normal individual can be brought immediately to a state of full alertness and function."
