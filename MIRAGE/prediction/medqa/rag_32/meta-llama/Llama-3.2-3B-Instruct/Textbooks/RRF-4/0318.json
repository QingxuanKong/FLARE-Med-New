She is sexually active with one male partner and admits to having pain during intercourse. There is vague and diffuse tenderness to palpation in all four abdominal quadrants. No erythema or edema is noted on the right arm. The fecal occult test is negative. Past records show that this patient has been in the ER 7 times in the past year with similar symptoms.

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the question: Step 1: Analyze the patient's symptoms - The patient presents with right arm pain, limited range of motion, diarrhea, nausea, and vague and diffuse tenderness to palpation in all four abdominal quadrants. These symptoms are non-specific and can be associated with various conditions. Step 2: Consider the patient's past medical history - The patient has been to the ER 7 times in the past year with similar symptoms, which suggests a chronic condition. Step 3: Evaluate the patient's sexual activity - The patient is sexually active with one male partner and admits to having pain during intercourse. This could be relevant in considering conditions related to pelvic or gastrointestinal issues. Step 4: Assess the patient's physical examination findings - No erythema or edema is noted on the right arm, and the fecal occult test is negative. This suggests that the patient's symptoms may not be related to a gastrointestinal or musculoskeletal issue. Step 5: Consider the differential diagnoses - The patient's symptoms and past medical history suggest conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or somatization disorder. Step 6: Analyze the options - Option A, ulcerative colitis, is a type of IBD that primarily affects the colon, but it can cause abdominal pain and diarrhea. Option B, illness anxiety disorder, is a condition characterized by excessive worry about having a serious illness, but it doesn't typically cause physical symptoms like diarrhea and nausea. Option C, somatization disorder, is a condition characterized by multiple, recurring physical symptoms without a clear medical cause, but it's less likely given the patient's specific symptoms. Option D, somatoform pain disorder, is a condition characterized by chronic pain without a clear medical cause, but it's also less likely given the patient's specific symptoms. Step 7: Make a decision - Based on the patient's symptoms, past medical history, and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is option A, ulcerative colitis. The patient's chronic symptoms, diarrhea, and nausea are consistent with IBS, and the patient's past medical history and physical examination findings support this diagnosis. Here is the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with right arm pain, limited range of motion, diarrhea, nausea, and vague and diffuse tenderness to palpation in all four abdominal quadrants. The patient has a history of chronic symptoms and is sexually active, which suggests a condition like ulcerative colitis.

Lifetime incidence in the United States is 7%, and it is the most common cause of emergent abdominal surgery (28). The symptoms and signs of appendicitis can be similar to those of PID, but the nausea and emesis are often more prominent with appendicitis. The first symptom of appendicitis is typically diffuse abdominal pain, periumbilical pain, followed by anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Within a matter of hours, the pain generally shifts to the right lower quadrant. Fever, chills, emesis, and obstipation (no \ufb02atus or stool per rectum) may ensue. However, this classic symptom pattern is often absent. Atypical abdominal pain can occur when the appendix is retrocecal or entirely within the true pelvis (which occurs in 15% of the population). In this setting, tenesmus and diffuse suprapubic pain may occur."

She describes herself as \u201cchronically miserable and worried all the time.\u201d Her medical history is notable for chronic neck pain from a motor vehicle accident for which she is being treated with tramadol and meperidine. In addition, she is on hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol for hypertension. The patient has a history of one depressive episode after a divorce that was treated successfully with fluoxetine. Medical workup including complete blood cell count, thyroid func-tion tests, and a chemistry panel reveals no abnormalities. She is started on fluoxetine for a presumed major depressive episode and referred for cognitive behavioral psychotherapy. What CYP450 and pharmacodynamic interactions might be associated with fluoxetine use in this patient? Which class of antidepressants would be contraindicated in this patient? A 47-year-old woman"

In a woman with pelvic pain and tenderness, increased numbers of PMNs (30 per 1000\u00d7 microscopic field in strands of cervical mucus) or leukocytes outnumbering epithelial cells in vaginal fluid (in the absence of trichomonal vaginitis, which also produces PMNs in vaginal discharge) increase the predictive value of a clinical diagnosis of acute PID, as do onset with menses, history of recent abnormal menstrual bleeding, presence of an IUD, history of salpingitis, and sexual exposure to a male with urethritis. Appendicitis or another disorder of the gut is favored by the early onset of anorexia, nausea, or vomiting; the onset of pain later than day 14 of the menstrual cycle; or unilateral pain limited to the right or left lower quadrant. Whenever the diagnosis of PID is being considered, serum assays for human \u03b2-chorionic gonadotropin should be performed; these tests are usually positive with ectopic pregnancy. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can"

Of travelers who develop an amebic liver abscess after leaving an endemic area, 95% do so within 5 months. Young patients with an amebic liver abscess are more likely than older patients to present in the acute phase with prominent symptoms of <10 days\u2019 duration. Most patients are febrile and have right-upperquadrant pain, which may be dull or pleuritic in nature and may radiate to the shoulder. Point tenderness over the liver and right-sided pleural effusion are common. Jaundice is rare. Although the initial site of infection is the colon, fewer than one-third of patients with an amebic abscess have active diarrhea. Older patients from endemic areas are more likely to have a subacute course lasting 6 months, with weight loss and hepatomegaly. About one-third of patients with chronic pre sentations are febrile. Thus, the clinical diagnosis of an amebic liver abscess may be difficult to"

Focused History: Ten days ago, CR had her spleen removed following a bicycle accident in which she fractured her tibial eminence, necessitating immobilization of the right knee. She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."

            "content": "Thoracic disease and abdominal disease frequently coexist and may be difficult or impossible to differentiate. For example, the patient with known biliary tract disease often has epigastric pain during myocardial infarction, or biliary colic may be referred to the precordium or left shoulder in a patient who has suffered previously from angina pectoris. For an explanation of the radiation of pain to a previously diseased area, see Chap. 18. Referred pain from the spine, which usually involves compression or irritation of nerve roots, is characteristically intensified by certain motions such as cough, sneeze, or strain and is associated with hyperesthesia over the involved dermatomes. Pain referred to the abdomen from the testes or seminal vesicles is generally accentuated by the slightest pressure on either of these organs. The abdominal discomfort experienced is of dull, aching character and is poorly localized."

Patients may notice changes in bowel habits or malaise and vague, perhaps intermittent, crampy, abdominal pain in the epigastric or periumbilical region. The pain subsequently migrates to the right lower quadrant over 12\u201324 h, where it is sharper and can be definitively localized as transmural inflammation when the appendix irritates the parietal peritoneum. Parietal peritoneal irritation may be associated with local muscle rigidity and stiffness. Patients with appendicitis FIGURE 356-2 Locations of the appendix and cecum."
