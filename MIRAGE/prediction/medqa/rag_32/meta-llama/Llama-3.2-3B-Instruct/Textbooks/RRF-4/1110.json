His BMI is 23 kg/m2. There is tenderness above the left posterior calcaneus and a firm, 3-cm, skin-colored nodule that moves with the left Achilles tendon. A photomicrograph from a biopsy of the nodule is shown. Serum studies in this patient are most likely to show increased levels of which of the following?",

        "A": "Rheumatoid factor",
        "B": "Angiotensin converting enzyme",
        "C": "Low-density lipoprotein",
        "D": "Triglycerides"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the given question: The patient is a 16-year-old boy with a 5-day history of pain at the back of his left ankle, tenderness above the left posterior calcaneus, and a firm, 3-cm, skin-colored nodule that moves with the left Achilles tendon. This presentation is highly suggestive of a calcaneal apophysitis, which is also known as Sever's disease. This condition is common in adolescents and is characterized by inflammation of the apophysis, a growth plate located at the back of the calcaneus. Sever's disease is often associated with an overuse injury, typically in sports that involve running or jumping. The condition is also known to be associated with an increased risk of osteochondritis, which is an inflammation of a piece of cartilage and bone in the growth plate. Given the patient's age, sex, and symptoms, the most likely laboratory finding would be related to the inflammatory process associated with Sever's disease. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Rheumatoid factor: This is a type of antibody associated with rheumatoid arthritis, which is not typically associated with Sever's disease. B. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE): This enzyme is involved in the regulation of blood pressure and is not directly related to Sever's disease. C. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL): This type of cholesterol is not directly related to the inflammatory process associated with Sever's disease. D. Triglycerides: While elevated triglycerides can be associated with various metabolic disorders, they are not directly related to Sever's disease. Considering the patient's age, sex, and symptoms, the most likely laboratory finding would be an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which is a measure of inflammation. However, since ESR is not an option, we can consider another inflammatory marker that is often elevated in conditions associated with inflammation, such as rheumatoid factor. Since the patient's condition is not rheumatoid arthritis, the next best choice would be a marker that is associated with the inflammatory process. Given the options, the best answer is A. Rheumatoid factor, although it is not the most direct choice. However, considering the inflammatory nature of Sever's disease, an elevated rheumatoid factor could be a reasonable choice. Here is the final answer in the requested format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with Sever\\\\u2019s disease, which is a common condition in adolescents characterized by inflammation of the apophysis. The most likely laboratory finding would be related to the inflammatory process, and rheumatoid factor is a reasonable choice given the options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Heart rate also should be recorded. Hypertensive individuals have an increased prevalence of atrial fibrillation. The neck should be palpated for an enlarged thyroid gland, and patients should be assessed for signs of hypoand hyperthyroidism. Examination of blood vessels may provide clues about underlying vascular disease and should include funduscopic examination, auscultation for bruits over the carotid and femoral arteries, and palpation of femoral and pedal pulses. The retina is the only tissue in which arteries and arterioles can be examined directly. With increasing"

Diabetes can lead to vascular disease of large and medium arteries, narrowing the lumen and reducing blood supply to the extremities, thereby impairing healing. In addition, diabetes can also affect blood supply to nerves, which leads to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy results in reduced sensation, and therefore minor injuries can often go unnoticed. This patient has developed an ulcer on his heel, which is a pressure point and likely to be under repeated strain. The nurse examined the ulcer and found that the ulcer was looking infected with pus at the base of the ulcer and asked for a specialist orthopedic opinion, who requested an x-ray and an MRI. The MRI and x-ray both demonstrated infection invading into the calcaneus with destruction of the bone (Fig. 6.141A,B)."

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

Neither the patient nor the family physician had any concerns about the pregnancy. However, the patient did complain of unilateral swelling of her left leg, which had gradually increased over the previous 2 days. Furthermore, the evening before her visit she developed some sharp chest pain, which was exacerbated by deep breaths. The family physician ordered a duplex ultrasound scan of the left leg venous system. Ultrasound scanning of the vascular tree can demonstrate flow and occlusion of arteries and veins."

Focused History: Ten days ago, CR had her spleen removed following a bicycle accident in which she fractured her tibial eminence, necessitating immobilization of the right knee. She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

The calcific masses are typically painless and grow at variable rates, sometimes becoming large and bulky. The masses are often located near major joints but remain extracapsular. Joint range of motion is not usually restricted unless the tumors are very large. Complications include compression of neural structures and ulceration of the overlying skin with drainage of chalky fluid and risk of secondary infection. Small deposits not detected by standard radiographs may be detected by 99mTc bone scanning. The most common laboratory findings are hyperphosphatemia and elevated serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. Serum calcium, parathyroid hormone, and ALP levels are usually normal. Renal function is also usually normal. Urine calcium and phosphate excretions are low, and calcium and phosphate balances are positive."
