    "question": "A 29-year-old female presents to the clinic for a regular check-up. She has no specific complaints. Vital signs include: blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 76/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, and temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F). Her physical examination is within normal limits. The woman\u2019s complete blood count shows an absolute increase in the cells shown in the first image. Which of the following is true regarding these cells?",
    "options": {
        "A": "These cells transform to macrophages when they migrate to peripheral tissues.",
        "B": "These cells express CD25 on their surfaces.",
        "C": "These cells normally constitute 25\u201340% of total leucocyte count.",
        "D": "These cells have lymphoid origin."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To solve this question, we need to analyze the given information step by step. Step 1: The patient is a 29-year-old female with no specific complaints and normal vital signs except for an elevated white blood cell count. Step 2: The question asks about the nature of the elevated white blood cells, which can be determined by the options provided. Step 3: Let's evaluate the options one by one: - Option A: These cells transform to macrophages when they migrate to peripheral tissues. This is true for monocytes, which are a type of white blood cell. - Option B: These cells express CD25 on their surfaces. This is true for T lymphocytes, not a characteristic of the cells described in the question. - Option C: These cells normally constitute 25\u201340% of total leucocyte count. This is a general characteristic of neutrophils, but not the only type of white blood cell. - Option D: These cells have lymphoid origin. This is true for lymphocytes, but not the only type of white blood cell. Step 4: Based on the information provided, the elevated white blood cell count is most likely due to neutrophils, which are known to constitute 50-70% of total leucocyte count and can be elevated in response to infection or inflammation. Step 5: Considering the options provided, the correct answer is A. These cells transform to macrophages when they migrate to peripheral tissues, which is a characteristic of monocytes. The final answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The elevated white blood cell count is most likely due to neutrophils, which are known to constitute 50-70% of total leucocyte count and can be elevated in response to infection or inflammation. Monocytes are a type of white blood cell that transform to macrophages when they migrate to peripheral tissues. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The white count can fluctuate substantially and unpredictably during and between painful crises, infectious episodes, and other intercurrent illnesses. Vasoocclusion causes protean manifestations. Intermittent episodes of vasoocclusion in connective and musculoskeletal structures produce ischemia manifested by acute pain and tenderness, fever, tachycardia, and anxiety. These recurrent episodes, called painful crises, are the most common clinical manifestation. Their frequency and severity vary greatly. Pain can develop almost anywhere in the body and may last from a few hours to 2 weeks. Repeated crises requiring hospitalization (>3 episodes per year) correlate with reduced survival in adult life, suggesting that these episodes are associated with accumulation of chronic end-organ damage. Provocative factors include infection, fever, excessive exercise, anxiety, abrupt changes in temperature, hypoxia, or hypertonic dyes."

The idea that 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F) is the normal human body temperature dates back to the nineteenth century and was initially based on axillary measurements. Rectal temperatures more accurately reflect the core body temperature and are 0.4\u00b0C (0.7\u00b0F) and 0.8\u00b0C (1.4\u00b0F) higher than oral and axillary temperatures, respectively. Although the definition of fever varies greatly throughout the medical literature, the most common definition, which is based on studies defining fever of unknown origin (Chap. 26), uses a temperature \u226538.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F). Although fever is very commonly associated with infection, it is also documented in many other diseases (Chap. 23).

Beyond a few standard screening tests, laboratory evaluation should be guided by the history and physical examination; extensive testing is more likely to lead to false-positive results that require explanation and unnecessary investigation and should be avoided in lieu of frequent clinical follow-up. A reasonable approach to screening includes a complete blood count with differential (to screen for anemia, infection, and malignancy), electrolytes (including sodium, potassium, and calcium), glucose, renal function, liver function, and thyroid function. Testing for HIV and adrenal function can also be considered. Published guidelines defining chronic fatigue syndrome also recommend an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) as part of the evaluation for mimics, but unless the value is very high, such nonspecific testing in the absence of other features is unlikely to clarify the situation."

            "content": "No signs or symptoms are specific for PMF. Many patients are asymptomatic at presentation, and the disease is usually detected by the discovery of splenic enlargement and/or abnormal blood counts during a routine examination. However, in contrast to its companion MPN, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss are common presenting complaints. A blood smear will show the characteristic features of extramedullary hematopoiesis: teardrop-shaped red cells, nucleated red cells, myelocytes, and promyelocytes; myeloblasts may also be present (Fig. 131-1). Anemia, usually mild initially, is the rule, whereas the leukocyte and platelet counts are either normal or increased, but either can be depressed. Mild hepatomegaly may accompany the splenomegaly but is unusual in the absence of splenic enlargement; isolated lymphadenopathy should suggest another diagnosis. Both serum lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase levels can be elevated. The LAP score can be low, normal, or high. Marrow is"

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."
