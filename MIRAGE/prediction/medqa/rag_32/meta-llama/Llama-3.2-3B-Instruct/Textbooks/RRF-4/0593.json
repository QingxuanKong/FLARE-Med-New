    "question": "A 42-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of fatigue. He has not been to the doctor since he was 22 years of age. He reports that over the past three months, he has felt tired and weak despite no changes in diet or exercise. He is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. Family history is notable for colorectal cancer in his father and paternal uncle, ovarian cancer in his paternal grandmother, and pancreatic cancer in his paternal uncle. Physical examination is notable for conjunctival pallor. A complete blood count reveals a hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL and hematocrit of 31%. A stool sample is hemoccult positive and a colonoscopy reveals a fungating hemorrhagic mass in the ascending colon. Which of the following processes is most likely impaired in this patient?",

A stool sample is hemoccult positive, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding, and a colonoscopy reveals a fungating hemorrhagic mass in the ascending colon. This suggests a colorectal cancer diagnosis.\\n\\nThe family history of colorectal cancer in the patient's father and paternal uncle, ovarian cancer in the paternal grandmother, and pancreatic cancer in the paternal uncle, suggests a possible hereditary component to the patient's condition.\\n\\nNow, let's evaluate the answer choices:\\n\\nA. Base excision repair: This is a process involved in repairing damage to DNA caused by environmental factors such as UV radiation. It is not directly related to the patient's colorectal cancer diagnosis.\\n\\nB. Nucleotide excision repair: This process also repairs DNA damage caused by environmental factors, such as UV radiation. Again, not directly related to the patient's colorectal cancer.\\n\\nC. Mismatch repair: This process is involved in correcting errors in DNA replication and recombination. It is known to be associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by an increased risk of colorectal cancer, as well as other types of cancer, due to mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes.\\n\\nD. Non-homologous end joining: This process is involved in repairing DNA double-strand breaks and is not directly related to the patient's colorectal cancer diagnosis.\\n\\nGiven the patient's family history of colorectal cancer and the presence of a fungating hemorrhagic mass in the ascending colon, the most likely impaired process is mismatch repair, which is associated with Lynch syndrome.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

The American Gastroenterological Association has delineated factors to be considered when determining the aggressiveness of the diagnostic evaluation. These include the duration of symptoms, the change in symptoms over time, the age and sex of the patient, the referral status of the patient, prior diagnostic studies, a family history of colorectal malignancy, and the degree of psychosocial dysfunction. Thus, a younger individual with mild symptoms requires a minimal diagnostic evaluation, while an older person or an individual with rapidly progressive symptoms should undergo a more thorough exclusion of organic disease.

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

            "content": "CLINICAL FEATURES Presenting Symptoms Symptoms vary with the anatomic location of the tumor. Because stool is relatively liquid as it passes through the ileocecal valve into the right colon, cancers arising in the cecum and ascending colon may become quite large without resulting in any obstructive symptoms or noticeable alterations in bowel habits. Lesions of the right colon commonly ulcerate, leading to chronic, insidious blood loss without a change in the appearance of the stool. Consequently, patients with tumors of the ascending colon often present with symptoms such as fatigue, palpitations, and even angina pectoris and are found to have a hypochromic, microcytic anemia indicative of iron deficiency. Because the cancers may bleed intermittently, a random fecal occult blood test may be negative. As a result, the unexplained presence of iron-deficiency anemia in any adult (with the possible exception of a premenopausal, multiparous woman) mandates a thorough endoscopic and/or"

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"
