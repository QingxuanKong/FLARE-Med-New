    "question": "A 70-year-old man is brought to the physician by his daughter because of increasing forgetfulness over the past 3 years. Initially, he used to forget his children's names or forget to lock the house door. During the past year, he has gotten lost twice while returning from the grocery store and was unable to tell passersby his address. One time, he went to the park with his granddaughter and returned home alone without realizing he had forgotten her. His daughter says that over the past year, he has withdrawn himself from social gatherings and avoids making conversation. He does not sleep well at night. His daughter has hired a helper to cook and clean his home. On mental status examination, he is oriented only to person. He describes his mood as fair. Short- and long-term memory deficits are present. He appears indifferent about his memory lapses and says this is normal for someone his age. The most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for this patient is a drug that acts on which of the following neurotransmitters?",

The patient is a 70-year-old man with increasing forgetfulness over the past 3 years, including difficulty remembering his children's names, locking the house door, and getting lost while returning from the grocery store. 2. The patient's forgetfulness has progressed to the point where he has withdrawn from social gatherings, avoids conversation, and has difficulty sleeping at night. 3. The patient's mental status examination reveals short- and long-term memory deficits, and he appears indifferent about his memory lapses. 4. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative dementia that affects memory and cognitive function. 5. The most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for Alzheimer's disease is a medication that targets the neurotransmitter involved in memory formation and consolidation. 6. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter involved in memory formation and consolidation, and cholinesterase inhibitors are the primary treatment for Alzheimer's disease. 7. Among the options provided, the most appropriate answer is B. Acetylcholine.

This may appear before the more obvious memory or language defects announce themselves. The patient becomes convinced that relatives are stealing his possessions or that an elderly and even infirm spouse is guilty of infidelity. He may hide his belongings, even relatively worthless ones, and go about spying on family members. Hostilities arise, and wills may be altered irrationally. Many of these patients are constantly worried, tense, and agitated. Of course, paranoid delusions may be part of a depressive psychosis and of other dementias, but most of the elderly patients in whom paranoia is the presenting problem, seem not to be depressed, and their cognitive functions are for a time relatively well preserved. Social indiscretions, rejection of old friends, embarking on imprudent financial ventures, or an amorous pursuit that is"

An observant relative of the patient or an employer may become aware of a certain lack of initiative or lack of interest in work, a neglect of routine tasks, or an abandonment of pleasurable pursuits. Initially, these changes may be attributed to depression, fatigue, or boredom in retirement. More often, gradual development of forgetfulness is the most prominent early symptom. Proper names are no longer remembered and cannot be recalled with time, to a far greater extent than can be attributed to mild cognitive impairment. Difficulty in balancing a checkbook and making change becomes evident. The purpose of an errand is forgotten, appointments are not kept, and recent conversations or social events have been overlooked.

When such patients are calmed by reassurance and encouraged to try harder, their mental function improves, indicating that intellectual deterioration has not occurred. Conversely, it is helpful to remember that demented patients in the mid-stages of the process infrequently have sufficient insight to complain of mental deterioration; if they admit to poor memory, they do so without conviction or full appreciation of the degree of their disability. The physician must not rely on the patient\u2019s statements alone in gauging the efficiency of mental function and should seek corroboration from family members. Yet another problem is that of the impulsive, cantankerous, and quarrelsome patient who is a constant source of distress to employer and family. Such changes in personality and behavior (as, e.g., in Huntington disease) may precede or mask early intellectual deterioration."

His patient was a capable foreman of a railroad gang who became irreverent, dissipated, irresponsible, and vacillating (he also confabulated freely) following an injury in which an explosion drove a large iron-tamping bar into his frontal lobes. In Harlow\u2019s words, \u201che was no longer Gage.\u201d Another similarly dramatic example was Dandy\u2019s patient (the subject of a monograph by Brickner), who underwent a bilateral frontal lobotomy during the removal of a meningioma. Feuchtwanger, in a clinical study of 200 cases of frontal lobe injury, was impressed most with the lack of initiative, changes in mood (euphoria), and inattentiveness, without intellectual and memory deficits. Rylander, in a classic monograph, described similar changes in patients with unilateral and bilateral frontal lobectomies (see later)."

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

One of our patients, functioning normally in every other way, carried the unshakable idea that people were sneaking into her house at night when she was away and rearranging the furniture. She functioned extremely well through her eighties but had a schizophrenic sister. Also, several physicians under our care have woven extensive delusional ideas around tenuous scientific theories; these ideas have applied to personal life events as well as physical and psychologic symptoms and in some cases have resulted in bizarre regimens of self-medication. Rarely, a patient comes to the hospital for some other medical reason and it is found that he or she has been living quietly in the community, preoccupied with a bizarre delusional system yet appearing neither depressed nor schizophrenic. Certainly one often sees delusions in depressed patients who decompensate as their depression deepens."

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

In children, a precipitous drop in grades may re\ufb02ect poor concentration. In elderly individ- uals, memory difficulties may be the chief complaint and may be mistaken for early signs of a dementia (\u201dpseudodementia\u201d). When the major depressive episode is successfully treated, the memory problems often fully abate. However, in some individuals, particu- larly elderly persons, a major depressive episode may sometimes be the initial presenta- tion of an irreversible dementia. Thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts (Criterion A9) are common."
