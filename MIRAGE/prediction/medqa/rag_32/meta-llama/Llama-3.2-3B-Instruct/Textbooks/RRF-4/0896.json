    "question": "A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his mother because of a change in his personality. The mother reports that over the past 7 months her son has become increasingly withdrawn; he has not answered any phone calls or visited his family and friends. He had always been a quiet boy, who needed some time on his own, but he used to meet with friends at least once a week. The patient says that he cannot leave the house because aliens are watching him and \u201cstealing his thoughts\u201d. He does not drink alcohol. He used to smoke marijuana occasionally but quit 1 year ago. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, it is impossible to follow the patient's sequence of thoughts. He is anxious and has a flat affect. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Delusional disorder",
        "B": "Mood disorder with psychotic features",
        "C": "Schizoid personality disorder",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the patient's presentation and analyze them in relation to the provided options.\\n\\nThe patient has become increasingly withdrawn over the past 7 months, which could be indicative of a mood disorder. However, the presence of delusions (believing that aliens are watching him and stealing his thoughts) and disorganized thinking (impossible to follow sequence of thoughts) are more suggestive of a psychotic disorder.\\n\\nDelusional disorder (A) is characterized by the presence of one or more non-bizarre delusions for a period of at least 1 month. While the patient's delusions are unusual, they are not necessarily non-bizarre, and the duration of the symptoms is less than 1 month. Therefore, this option is less likely.\\n\\nMood disorder with psychotic features (B) is a possibility, but the primary symptoms are more consistent with a psychotic disorder. The presence of delusions and disorganized thinking takes precedence over mood symptoms.\\n\\nSchizoid personality disorder (C) is characterized by a pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of emotional expression. While the patient is withdrawn, there is no indication of a long-standing pattern of social isolation, and his emotional expression is not restricted. Therefore, this option is less likely.\\n\\nSchizophrenia (D) is the most likely diagnosis. The patient's combination of delusions, disorganized thinking, and social withdrawal is consistent with a psychotic disorder. The duration of the symptoms (7 months) also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's flat affect and anxiety are common symptoms of schizophrenia.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is schizophrenia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

            "content": "A 66-year-old obese Caucasian man presented to an academic Diabetes Center for advice regarding his diabetes treatment. His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

Case 4: Hypoglycemia, Hyperketonemia, and Liver Dysfunction Patient Presentation: AK, a 59-year-old male with slurred speech, ataxia (loss of skeletal muscle coordination), and abdominal pain, was dropped off at the Emergency Department (ED). Focused History: AK is known to the ED staff from previous visits. He has a 6year history of chronic, excessive alcohol consumption. He is not known to take illicit drugs. At this ED visit, AK reports that he has been drinking heavily in the past day or so. He cannot recall having eaten anything in that time. There is evidence of recent vomiting, but no blood is apparent."

Activities that were formerly found pleasurable are no longer so. Often, however, change in mood is less conspicuous than reduction in psychic and physical energy, and it is in this type of patient that diagnosis is most difficult. A complaint of fatigue is almost invariable; not uncommonly, it is worse in the morning after a night of restless sleep. The patient complains of a \u201closs of energy,\u201d \u201cweakness,\u201d \u201ctiredness,\u201d \u201chaving no energy,\u201d that his job has become more difficult. His outlook is pessimistic.

He saw his PCP for evaluation of low back pain. X-rays of the spine showed some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine plus several wedge deformities in the thoracic spine. The patient is a long-time smoker (up to two packs per day) and has two to four glasses of wine with dinner, more on the weekends. He has chronic bronchitis, presumably from smoking, and has been treated on numerous occasions with oral prednisone for exacerba-tions of bronchitis. He is currently on 10 mg/d prednisone. Examination shows kyphosis of the thoracic spine, with some tenderness to fist percussion over the thoracic spine. The dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measure-ment of the lumbar spine is \u201cwithin the normal limits,\u201d but the radiologist noted that the reading may be misleading because of degenerative changes.

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

These, too, are easier to observe in the patient\u2019s natural environment than to measure by psychologic tests. It has been difficult to find a term for all these personality changes. Some patients, particularly those with inferofrontal lesions, feel compelled to make silly jokes that are inappropriate to the situation, witzelsucht or moria; they are socially uninhibited and lack awareness of their behavior. The patient is no longer the sensitive, compassionate, effective human being that he once was, having lost his usual ways of reacting with affection and consideration to family and friends. In more advanced instances, there is an almost complete disregard for social conventions and an interest only in immediate personal gratification. The patient at the same time seems to lose an appreciation of the motivations and thought processes of"
