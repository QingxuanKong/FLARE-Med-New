    "question": "A 63-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease complains of feeling lightheaded after her hemodialysis sessions for the past month. She worries she might eventually lose her balance and fall. She has had diabetes mellitus for 22 years. Her medications include folic acid, vitamin B12, amlodipine, and erythropoietin. At the clinic, her blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg when lying down before dialysis and 110/55 mm Hg when seated after hemodialysis. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies after hemodialysis show a Hb of 10.5 mg/dL, a blood sugar of 189 mg/dL, and a hemoglobin A1C of 7.1%. To reduce the likelihood of falls, the most appropriate management is which of the following?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Cooling the dialysate",
        "B": "Eating heavier meals during dialysis",
        "C": "Increasing ultrafiltration",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and experiences lightheadedness after hemodialysis sessions. To reduce the likelihood of falls, we need to consider the underlying causes of lightheadedness in this patient. The patient has diabetes mellitus and is on hemodialysis, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypotension. The patient's blood pressure drops from 135/80 mmHg to 110/55 mmHg after hemodialysis, indicating orthostatic hypotension. This is a common complication in patients with ESRD. The patient's lightheadedness is likely related to the sudden drop in blood pressure. To reduce the likelihood of falls, we need to address this orthostatic hypotension. Increasing ultrafiltration during dialysis may worsen hypotension, so option C is not the best choice. Eating heavier meals during dialysis may not address the underlying issue and may even worsen hypotension. Steroid administration is not a standard treatment for orthostatic hypotension in patients with ESRD. Cooling the dialysate is not relevant to the patient's symptoms. Option A, increasing fluid removal during dialysis, is not the best choice as it may worsen hypotension. Option D, administering a medication to increase blood pressure, is the most appropriate choice. Midodrine or fludrocortisone can be used to treat orthostatic hypotension in patients with ESRD. These medications can help increase blood pressure and reduce the risk of falls.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid.

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg.

Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension.
