Cephalic phase: The brain receives information about food and stimulates the vagus nerve, leading to increased vagal stimulation of the stomach.\\n2. Oral phase: The food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes such as amylase and lipase.\\n3. Gastric phase: The stomach secretes gastric juice containing HCl, pepsinogen, and mucus.\\n4. The presence of food in the stomach stimulates the release of gastrin from the G cells in the antrum, which in turn stimulates the parietal cells to secrete HCl.\\n5. The acidic environment in the stomach activates the release of histamine from enterochromaffin-like cells (ECL cells) and stimulates the release of acetylcholine from the vagus nerve.\\n\\nThe graph shows the pH of the stomach contents and the rate of stomach acid secretion over time. The point D is located 2 hours after the meal, when the pH has decreased and acid secretion is at its peak.\\n\\nBased on this information, the most likely mechanism contributing to the changes seen at point D is increased activity of enterochromaffin-like cells (ECL cells), which release histamine to stimulate acid secretion. This is supported by the fact that histamine is released in response to acidic conditions in the stomach and stimulates parietal cells to secrete more HCl.\\n\\nThe other options are not directly related to the changes seen at point D:\\nA. Increased vagal stimulation would likely lead to increased acid secretion, but the graph shows a peak in acid secretion at 2 hours, which is not consistent with increased vagal stimulation.\\nB. Increased activity of D cells would lead to increased secretion of secretin, which is not directly related to acid secretion.\\nD. Increased activity of I cells would lead to increased secretion of cholecystokinin (CCK), which is involved in gallbladder contraction and pancreatic enzyme secretion, but not directly related to acid secretion.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.

In the following chapters there will be discussion of the integrated response to a meal to provide the details of GI physiology. The response to a meal is classically divided into phases: cephalic, oral, esophageal, gastric, duodenal, and intestinal. In each phase the meal presents certain stimuli (e.g., chemical, mechanical, and osmotic) that activate different pathways (e.g., neural, paracrine, and humoral reflexes) that result in changes in effector function (e.g., secretion and motility). There is considerable crosstalk between the regulatory mechanisms that have been outlined, and this will be discussed in the next chapters. As with maintenance of homeostasis in other systems of the body, control of GI function requires complex regulatory mechanisms to sense and act in a dynamic fashion. 1."

The rate of gastric emptying is dependent on the macronutrient content of the meal and the amount of solids it contains. Thus solids and liquids of similar nutritional composition will empty at different rates. Liquids empty rapidly, but solids do so only after a lag phase, which means that after a solid meal, there is a period of time during which little or no emptying occurs (Fig. 30.1"

When the concentration of H+ in the lumen reaches a certain threshold (<pH 3), somatostatin is released from endocrine cells in the antral mucosa. Somatostatin has a paracrine action on neighboring G cells to decrease the release of gastrin and thereby decrease gastric acid secretion (Fig. 29.8 The receptors on the parietal cell membrane for acetylcholine, gastrin, and histamine, as well as the intracellular second messengers by which these secretagogues act, are shown in"

Pepsins may digest as much as 20% of the protein in a typical meal but are not required for digestion, because their function can be replaced by that of pancreatic proteases. When the pH of the duodenal lumen is neutralized, pepsins are inactivated by the neutral pH.

An insufficient tonic contraction of the LES is associated with reflux disease, a gradual erosion of the esophageal mucosa, which is not as well protected as the gastric and duodenal mucosa. There is also some evidence that peristalsis in the absence of swallowing (secondary peristalsis) is important for clearing refluxed gastric contents. 1. The cephalic and oral phases of the meal share many characteristics and prepare the remainder of the GI tract for the meal; these responses are neurally mediated, predominantly by the efferent vagus nerve. 2.

Like acid hydrolysis, the first of these phases takes place in the gastric lumen and is mediated by pepsin, the product of chief cells localized to the gastric glands. When gastric secretion is activated by signals coincident with ingestion of a meal, pepsin is released from the chief cells as the inactive precursor pepsinogen. At acidic pH, this precursor is autocatalytically cleaved to yield the active enzyme. Pepsin is highly specialized to act in the stomach, since it is activated by low pH. The enzyme cleaves proteins at sites of neutral amino acids, with a preference for aromatic or large aliphatic side chains. Because such amino acids occur only relatively infrequently in a given protein, pepsin is not capable of digesting protein fully into a form that can be absorbed by the intestine. Instead it yields a mixture of intact protein, large peptides (the majority), and a limited number of free amino acids."

The amount of chyme in the duodenum decreases as it passes further down the small intestine into the jejunum; thus the strength of intestinal feedback inhibition fades as there is less activation of duodenal sensory mechanisms by nutrients. At this time, intragastric pressure in the proximal portion of the stomach increases, thereby moving material into the antrum and toward the antral pump.

            "content": "chyme. This phase starts when gastric emptying of ingested food begins, and it continues as long as nutrients remain in the proximal small intestine. It accounts for about 10% of meal-induced acid secretion.Interprandial basal acid secretion is 2 to 5 mEq hydrochlo-ric acid per hour, about 10% of maximal acid output (MAO), and it is greater at night. Basal acid secretion probably contrib-utes to the relatively low bacterial counts found in the stomach. Basal acid secretion is reduced 75% to 90% by vagotomy or continuous H2-receptor blockade.The pivotal role that ECL cells play in the regulation of gastric acid secretion is emphasized in Fig. 26-13. The acid stimulatory effect of gastrin is largely mediated by histamine released from mucosal ECL cells. H2-receptor knockout mice do not secrete acid in response to gastrin.24 This explains why the H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) are effective inhibitors of acid secretion, even though histamine is only one of three parietal cell"

            "content": "In contrast, the predominant motor pattern of the distal part of the stomach in the gastric phase of the meal is activation of smooth muscle to produce and strengthen the antral contractions. The rate of antral contractions is set by the gastric pacemaker; however, the magnitude of the contractions is regulated by release of neurotransmitters from enteric neurons, including substance P and acetylcholine, which increase the level of depolarization of the smooth muscle and therefore produce stronger contractions. In this phase of the meal the pylorus is mostly closed. Thus antral contractions will tend to move the contents toward the pylorus; however, because the pylorus is closed, the contents will be returned to the more proximal part of the stomach. In this way the gastric contents will be mixed. In addition, antral contractions can occlude the lumen, and thus larger particles will be dispersed, a process referred to as grinding ( Fig. 29.14"

What are the major functions of the esophagus and associated structures in terms of protection and propulsion? his chapter will describe the processes that occur in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in the early stages of the integrated response to a meal. There are changes in GI tract physiology (1) before food is ingested (the cephalic phase), (2) when ingested food is in the mouth (the oral phase), and (3) when food is transferred from the mouth to the esophagus (the esophageal phase). The responses of the GI tract to the presence of food are mainly associated with preparing the GI tract for digestion and absorption."

The stimulation that occurs in the cephalic and oral phases (before food reaches the stomach) results in stimulation of parietal cells to secrete acid and chief cells to secrete pepsinogen. Thus when food reaches the stomach, protein digestion is initiated by generating protein hydrolysate, which further stimulates secretion of gastrin from the mucosa of the gastric antrum.

            "content": "The potencies of the four H2-receptor antagonists vary over a 50-fold range (Table 62\u20131). When given in usual prescription doses, however, all inhibit 60\u201370% of total 24-hour acid secretion. H2 antagonists are especially effective at inhibiting nocturnal acid secretion (which depends largely on histamine), but they have a modest impact on meal-stimulated acid secretion (which is stimulated by gastrin and acetylcholine as well as histamine). Therefore, nocturnal and fasting intragastric pH is raised to 4\u20135, but the impact on the daytime, meal-stimulated pH profile is less. Recommended prescription doses maintain greater than 50% acid inhibition for 10 hours; hence, these drugs are commonly given twice daily. At doses available in over-the-counter formulations, the duration of acid inhibition is 6\u201310 hours."
