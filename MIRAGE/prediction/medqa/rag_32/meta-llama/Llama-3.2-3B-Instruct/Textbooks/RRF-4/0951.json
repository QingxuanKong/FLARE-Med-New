    "question": "A 22-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine health examination. She feels well but asks for advice about smoking cessation. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 7 years. She has tried to quit several times without success. During the previous attempts, she has been extremely nervous and also gained weight. She has also tried nicotine lozenges but stopped taking them because of severe headaches and insomnia. She has bulimia nervosa. She takes no medications. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m2. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's history of bulimia nervosa, the most appropriate next step in management would be to consider the potential impact of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) on her eating disorder. NRT can sometimes trigger binge eating or other disordered eating behaviors, especially in individuals with a history of bulimia nervosa. Therefore, NRT may not be the best choice for this patient. Motivational interviewing, which is a goal-oriented, client-centered approach to facilitating behavior change, may be a more appropriate approach for this patient. Motivational interviewing can help the patient explore her reasons for wanting to quit smoking and identify her own motivations for change, which can be particularly helpful for individuals with eating disorders. The other options, diazepam and varenicline, are not directly related to addressing the patient's eating disorder and may not be the best choice for this patient. Nicotine patch is a form of NRT, which may not be the best choice given the patient's history of bulimia nervosa.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of \u201closs of vision.\u201d Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver\u2019s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

A fine lanugo covers the face, body, and limbs. The skin is thin and dry, without its normal elasticity, and the nails are brittle. The dental enamel is eroded. Pubic hair and breast tissue (except for loss of fat) are normal, and, in this respect, anorexia nervosa is unlike hypopituitary cachexia (Simmonds disease). Surprisingly, however, there are no neurologic signs of nutritional deficiency. The patient is alert and cheerfully indifferent to her condition. Any suggestion that she is unattractively thin or seriously depleted is rejected."

The majority of these are related to cell damage caused by smoking and alcohol use. Certain viruses are also related to cancers in the head and neck, including human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). A 50-year-old overweight woman came to the doctor complaining of hoarseness of voice and noisy breathing. She was also concerned at the increase in size of her neck. On examination she had a slow pulse rate (45 beats per minute). She also had an irregular knobby mass in the anterior aspect of the lower neck, which deviated the trachea to the right. A clinical diagnosis of a multinodular goiter and hypothyroidism was made."
