However, the presence of confluent scaly patches, plaques, and erythroderma, along with a solid skin lesion, suggests a condition that affects the epidermis and is potentially malignant.\\n\\nLet's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Vascular tumor containing spindle cells: This option suggests a vascular tumor, which may not fully explain the widespread scaly patches and plaques.\\n\\nB. Tumor arising from the folliculosebaceous-apocrine germ: This option suggests a tumor originating from the hair follicles and sweat glands, which may not fit with the widespread nature of the lesions.\\n\\nC.

However, the presence of scaly patches and plaques is not typical for lymphoma.\\n\\nD. Tumor arising from epidermal keratinocytes: This option suggests a carcinoma, which could explain the presence of scaly patches, plaques, and a solid skin lesion.

Thus, when lesions are distributed on elbows, knees, and scalp, the most likely possibility based solely on distribution is psoriasis or dermatitis herpetiformis (Figs. 70-7 and 70-8, respectively). The primary lesion in psoriasis is a scaly papule that soon forms erythematous plaques covered with a white scale, whereas that of dermatitis herpetiformis is an urticarial papule that quickly becomes a small vesicle. In this manner, identification of the primary lesion directs the examiner toward the proper diagnosis. Secondary changes in skin can also be quite helpful. For example, scale represents excessive epidermis, while crust is the result of a discontinuous epithelial cell layer. Palpation of skin lesions can yield insight into the character of an eruption. Thus, red papules on the lower extremities that blanch with pressure can be a manifestation of many different diseases, but hemorrhagic red papules that do not blanch with pressure indicate palpable purpura"

Involvement of other sun-exposed sites is also common. B. Acute cutaneous LE on the upper chest, demonstrating brightly erythematous and slightly edematous papules and plaques. (B, Courtesy of Robert Swerlick, MD; with permission.) correlated with systemic involvement. Patients may have widespread 375 involvement of the face as well as erythema and scaling of the extensor surfaces of the extremities and upper chest (Fig. 73-5B). These acute lesions, while sometimes evanescent, usually last for days and are often associated with exacerbations of systemic disease. Skin biopsy of acute lesions may show only a sparse dermal infiltrate of mononuclear cells and dermal edema. In some instances, cellular infiltrates around blood vessels and hair follicles are notable, as is hydropic degeneration of basal cells of the epidermis. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy"

            "content": "Squamous Cell Carcinoma Primary cutaneous SCC is a malignant neoplasm of keratinizing epidermal cells. SCC has a variable clinical course, ranging from indolent to rapid growth kinetics, with the potential for metastasis to regional and distant sites. Commonly, SCC appears as an ulcerated erythematous nodule or superficial erosion on sun-exposed skin of the head, neck, trunk, and extremities (Fig. 105-5). It may also appear as a banal, firm, dome-shaped papule or rough-textured plaque. It is commonly mistaken for a wart or callous when the inflammatory response to the lesion is minimal. Clinically visible overlying telangiectasias are uncommon, although dotted or coiled vessels are a hallmark of SCC when viewed through a dermatoscope. FIGURE 105-5 Cutaneous neoplasms. A. Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma involves the skin with typical violaceous, \u201cplum-colored\u201d nodules."

            "content": "Pustular Eruptions AGEP is a rare reaction pattern (3\u20135 cases per million per year) that is often associated with exposure to drugs (Fig. 74-8). Usually beginning on the face or intertriginous areas, small nonfollicular pustules overlying erythematous and edematous skin may coalesce and lead to superficial erosion. Differentiating this eruption from TEN in its initial stages may be difficult. A skin biopsy is important and shows neutrophil collections and sparse necrotic keratinocytes in the upper part of the epidermis instead of the full-thickness epidermal necrosis that characterizes TEN. Fever and leukocytosis are common, and eosinophilia occurs in one-third of cases. Acute pustular psoriasis is the principal differential diagnostic consideration. DIHS with pustular features must also be clinically considered, although the timing for the onset of DIHS is distinct (much later onset). AGEP often begins within a few days of initiating drug treatment, most notably antibiotics, but may"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

            "content": "The shape of lesions is also an important feature. Flat, round, erythematous papules and plaques are common in many cutaneous diseases. However, target-shaped lesions that consist in part of erythematous plaques are specific for erythema multiforme (Fig. 70-9). Likewise, the arrangement of individual lesions is important. Erythematous papules and vesicles can occur in many conditions, but their arrangement in a specific linear array suggests an external etiology such as allergic contact dermatitis (Fig. 70-10) or primary irritant dermatitis. In contrast, lesions with a generalized arrangement are common and suggest a systemic etiology. As in other branches of medicine, a complete history should be obtained to emphasize the following features: 1. Evolution of lesions a. Site of onset b. Manner in which the eruption progressed or spread c. d. Periods of resolution or improvement in chronic eruptions 2. Symptoms associated with the eruption a. Itching, burning, pain, numbness b."
