The cross-bridge cycle consists of four steps: attachment, power stroke, detachment, and recocking. Phosphate release occurs during the power stroke (step 2) and recocking (step 4). The drug selectively inhibits phosphate release, so we need to identify the step where phosphate release occurs. According to Document [0] and [5], phosphate release occurs during the power stroke and recocking. Inhibiting phosphate release would therefore block steps 2 and 4. However, since the question asks for the step that will most likely be blocked, we need to consider which of these two steps is more critical for the overall process. In both steps 2 and 4, the myosin head is already bound to actin, so the drug's effect would be to prevent the myosin head from releasing its grip on actin. However, the power stroke (step 2) is the step where the myosin head undergoes a conformational change that pulls the actin filament toward the center of the sarcomere, generating force. This step is more critical for force generation, and the recocking step (step 4) is a preparatory step that allows the myosin head to be ready for another cycle. Therefore, the step that will most likely be blocked is the power stroke (step 2).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The variation in maximal shortening velocity as a function of the degree of myosin phosphorylation may reflect dephosphorylation of the myosin light chain while the myosin is still attached to the actin, thus slowing the rate of detachment (i.e., latch state) at low levels of phosphorylation.

(A) The controlled phosphorylation by the enzyme myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) of one of the two light chains (the so-called regulatory light chain, shown in light blue) on non-muscle myosin II in a test tube has at least two effects: it causes a change in the conformation of the myosin head, exposing its actinbinding site, and it releases the myosin tail from a \u201csticky patch\u201d on the myosin head, thereby allowing the myosin molecules to assemble into short, bipolar, thick filaments. Smooth muscle is regulated by the same mechanism (see Figure 16\u201337). (B) Electron micrograph of negatively stained short filaments of myosin II that have been induced to assemble in a test tube by phosphorylation of their light chains. These myosin II filaments are much smaller than those found in skeletal muscle cells (see Figure 16\u201327). (B, courtesy of John Kendrick-Jones.) matrix through"

            "content": "These traces show filament movement in two separate experiments. Initially, when the actin filament is unattached to myosin, thermal motion of the filament produces noisy fluctuations in filament position. When a single myosin binds to the actin filament, thermal motion decreases abruptly and a roughly 10-nm displacement results from movement of the filament by the motor. The motor then releases the filament. Because the ATP concentration is very low in this experiment, the myosin remains attached to the actin filament for much longer than it would in a muscle cell.

            "content": "1. Skeletal muscle is composed of numerous muscle cells (muscle fibers) that are typically 10 to 80 \u00b5m in diameter and up to 25 cm in length. The appearance of striations in skeletal muscle is due to the highly organized arrangement of thick and thin filaments in the myofibrils of skeletal muscle fibers. The sarcomere is a contractile unit in skeletal muscle. Each sarcomere is approximately 2 \u00b5m in length at rest and is bounded by two Z lines. Sarcomeres are arranged in series along the length of the myofibril. Thin filaments, containing actin, extend from the Z line toward the center of the sarcomere. Thick filaments, containing myosin, are positioned in the center of the sarcomere and overlap the actin thin filaments. Muscle contraction results from the Ca++-dependent interaction of myosin and actin, in which myosin pulls the thin filaments toward the center of the sarcomere. 2."

            "content": "Sarcomere shortening is caused by the myosin filaments sliding past the actin thin filaments, with no change in the length of either type of filament (see Figure 16\u201332C and D). Bipolar thick filaments walk toward the plus ends of two sets of thin filaments of opposite orientations, driven by dozens of independent myosin heads that are positioned to interact with each thin filament. Because there is no coordination among the movements of the myosin heads, it is critical that they remain tightly bound to the actin filament for only a small fraction of each ATPase cycle so that they do not hold one another back. Each myosin thick filament has about 300 heads (294 in frog muscle), and each head cycles about five times per second in the course of a rapid contraction\u2014sliding the myosin and actin filaments past one another at rates of up to 15 \u03bcm/sec and enabling the sarcomere to shorten by 10% of its length in less than one-fiftieth of a second.

Step 3: The muscle contracts when ADP dissociates from the cross-bridge. This step leads to the formation of the low-energy rigor complex (lower left) in which the chemical energy derived from ATP hydrolysis has been expended to perform mechanical work (the \u201crowing\u201d motion of the cross-bridge). Step 4: The muscle returns to its resting state, and the cycle ends when a new molecule of ATP binds to the rigor complex and dissociates the cross-bridge from the thin filament. This cycle continues until calcium is dissociated from troponin C in the thin filament, which causes the contractile proteins to return to the resting state with the cross-bridge in the energized state.
