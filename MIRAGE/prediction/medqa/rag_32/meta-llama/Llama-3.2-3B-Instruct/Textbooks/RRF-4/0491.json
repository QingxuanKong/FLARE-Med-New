    "question": "A 26-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up vaccination 1 week after being bitten by a rodent while camping. She received appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis in the emergency department and has already received 2 doses of the rabies vaccine. The same physician has been managing the post-exposure care regimen. After the physician administers the third dose of the rabies vaccine, the patient asks him if he would like to join her for a movie and dinner. The physician is interested in going on a date with her. Which of the following is the most appropriate reaction for the physician to have to the patient's invitation?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Inform the patient that romantic relationships with current patients are unethical.",
        "B": "Inform the patient that he will go on a date with her because her case is uncomplicated and does not require decision-making on his part.",
        "C": "Inform the patient that dating her will never be appropriate even once the physician-patient relationship has been terminated.",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question revolves around the ethics of a physician-patient relationship and potential romantic involvement. The key issue here is the power dynamic and the potential conflict of interest in a romantic relationship with a patient. The physician has a duty to maintain professional boundaries and prioritize the patient's well-being and confidentiality. The patient's request to go on a date with the physician after receiving post-exposure prophylaxis for rabies is a breach of professional ethics and could compromise the patient's trust and confidentiality. The American Medical Association (AMA) and other medical organizations have guidelines that prohibit romantic relationships with current or recent patients, especially if the relationship could create a conflict of interest or compromise patient care. Therefore, the most appropriate reaction for the physician is to decline the invitation and maintain professional boundaries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

In the period 2001\u20132010, 643 animal bites were documented during medical encounters among U.S. forces in the combat theaters of southwest and central Asia; the majority of these potential exposures were dog bites. Of bitten personnel, 18% received rabies postexposure prophylaxis. Recently, a U.S. soldier developed rapidly progressive signs and symptoms of rabies 8 months after a dog bite in Afghanistan and died within 17 days of illness onset. This case, which represents the first rabies death in nearly 40 years in a member of the U.S. military who acquired the infection overseas, reinforces both the lethality of the disease and the need to practice vigilant exposure precautions among deployed military personnel and to administer postexposure prophylaxis to troops who are bitten by animals in high-risk areas."

All preparations of IG contain anti-HAV concentrations sufficient to be protective. When administered before exposure or during the early incubation period, IG is effective in preventing clinically apparent hepatitis A. For postexposure prophylaxis of intimate contacts (household, sexual, institutional) of persons with hepatitis A, the administration of 0.02 mL/kg is recommended as early after exposure as possible; it may be effective even when administered as late as 2 weeks after exposure. Prophylaxis is not necessary for those who have already received hepatitis A vaccine, for casual contacts (office, factory, school, or hospital), for most elderly persons, who are very likely to be immune, or for those known to have anti-HAV in their serum. In day care centers, recognition of hepatitis A in children or staff should provide a stimulus for immunoprophylaxis in the center and in"

            "content": "Several mumps virus vaccines are used throughout the world; in the United States, only the live attenuated Jeryl Lynn strain is used. Current recommendations are that mumps vaccine be administered as part of the combined trivalent measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (M-M-R\u00ae II) or the quadrivalent measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine (ProQuad\u00ae). Monovalent vaccine is no longer produced for the U.S. market but is available in other countries. Before administering mumps-containing vaccine, physicians should always consult the latest recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Current recommendations for children specify two doses of mumps-containing vaccine: the first dose given on or after the first birthday and the second dose administered no earlier than 28 days after the first. In the United States, children often receive the second dose between the ages of 4 and 6 years."

            "content": "A 45-year-old man with no significant medical history was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 10 days ago after suffering third-degree burns over 40% of his body. He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

Rabies should usually be suspected on the basis of the clinical presentation. The disease usually presents as atypical encephalitis with relative preservation of consciousness. Rabies may be difficult to recognize late in the clinical course when progression to coma has occurred. A minority of patients present with acute flaccid paralysis. There are prodromal, acute neurologic, and comatose phases that usually progress to death despite aggressive therapy (Table 232-1)."
