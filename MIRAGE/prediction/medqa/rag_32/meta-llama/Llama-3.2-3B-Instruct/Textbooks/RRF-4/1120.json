    "question": "A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician\u2019s office with concerns about a recent pregnancy. She and her boyfriend had intercourse for the first time a few weeks ago. Two weeks ago she missed her menstrual period. She took several over the counter pregnancy tests that confirmed her pregnancy. She is tearful about the pregnancy and is very concerned. After extensive conversations with her physician and counseling, she decides she wants to medically abort her 6-week pregnancy. Which of the following drugs should be administered to this patient for this purpose?",

        "A": "Tamoxifen",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to consider the patient's situation and the available treatment options for medical abortion. The patient is 6 weeks pregnant and has decided to undergo a medical abortion. We need to identify the most appropriate medication for this purpose. The patient is 6 weeks pregnant, which falls within the gestational age range for medical abortion using mifepristone and misoprostol. Mifepristone is a progesterone receptor antagonist that blocks the action of progesterone, which is necessary for pregnancy maintenance. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analog that causes uterine contractions, leading to abortion. Options A (Tamoxifen) and B (Terbutaline) are not typically used for medical abortion. Tamoxifen is an estrogen receptor antagonist used to treat breast cancer and endometriosis, while Terbutaline is a bronchodilator used to treat asthma. Option D (Copper intrauterine device) is a form of emergency contraception, not a medication for medical abortion. Considering the options, C (Mifepristone) is the most appropriate medication for this patient's situation. It is commonly used in combination with misoprostol for medical abortion up to 9 weeks of gestation. The patient's concern about her pregnancy and her decision to undergo medical abortion are also important considerations. It is essential to provide counseling and support throughout the process to ensure the patient's physical and emotional well-being.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

A study of over 1,000 patients with recurrent pregnancy loss reported no difference in the prevalence of abnormal results for evidence-based and investigative diagnostic tests when the diagnostic workup was initiated after two versus three or more losses (6).

The history should include a review of symptoms, general medical history, review of past surgery, and current medications. The woman\u2019s most troubling symptoms must be ascertained\u2014how often she leaks urine, how much urine she leaks, what provokes urine loss, what improves or worsens the problem, and what treatment (if any) she had in the past. It is essential to keep the patient\u2019s chief symptom at the forefront to avoid inappropriate management. Consider, for example, a woman whose chief concern is that once a month, while leading a business seminar, she has a sudden, overwhelming urge to void followed by complete bladder emptying. She finds this leakage devastating and is considering quitting her job because of her acute embarrassment. On occasion, she leaks a few drops of urine during exercise, but this minor leakage does not bother her. During the evaluation, urodynamics reveal minimal stress"

            "content": "Most women with recurrent pregnancy losses tend to experience spontaneous abortion at approximately the same gestational age in sequential pregnancies (321). Unfortunately, the gestational age when pregnancy loss occurs, as determined by last menstrual period, may not be informative, because there is often a 2-to 3-week delay between fetal demise and signs of pregnancy expulsion (322). The designation of couples experiencing recurrent abortion into either primary or secondary categories is not helpful in either the diagnosis or management of most women with recurrent abortion. Approximately 10% to 15% of couples cannot be classified into either the primary or secondary category because, although their first pregnancy resulted in a loss, it was followed by a term delivery prior to subsequent losses."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

According to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the safest part of pregnancy in which to travel is between 18 and 24 weeks, when there is the least danger of spontaneous abortion or premature labor. Some obstetricians prefer that women stay within a few hundred miles of home after the 28th week of pregnancy in case problems arise. In general, however, healthy women may be advised that it is acceptable to travel."
