    "question": "A 30-year-old woman presents to an outpatient clinic for a scheduled gynecologic check-up. The patient appears well and has no specific complaints. She is current with her Pap smears, all of which have been normal. Her menstrual periods are regular and usually last 3\u20134 days. She denies any recent travel or a history of trauma. The patient has not been sexually active for the past 2 months. She smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol occasionally, but has never used illicit drugs. The pelvic examination reveals a small, firm, non-tender, immobile cystic mass at the edge of the exocervical os with a yellow hue. The patient is otherwise asymptomatic and has no other complaints. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",

The patient appears well and has no specific complaints, but the pelvic examination reveals a small, firm, non-tender, immobile cystic mass at the edge of the exocervical os with a yellow hue. This finding is concerning for a cervical polyp or a cervical neoplasm. Given the patient's age and regular menstrual cycles, the most likely cause is a cervical polyp. The patient's Pap smears have been normal in the past, but this finding warrants further evaluation. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that women with a cervical polyp undergo colposcopy and biopsy to rule out high-grade cervical dysplasia or cancer. Therefore, the next best step in management is colposcopy and biopsy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The pelvic examination occasionally may be deferred in young teenagers who have a classic history of irregular cycles soon after menarche, who have normal hematocrit levels, who deny sexual activity, and who will reliably return for follow-up.

Most often, this is postcoital bleeding, but it may occur as irregular or postmenopausal bleeding. Patients with advanced disease may present with a malodorous vaginal discharge, weight loss, or obstructive uropathy. In asymptomatic women, cervical cancer is most commonly identified through evaluation of abnormal cytologic screening tests. The false-negative rate for Pap tests in the presence of invasive cancer is up to 50%, so a negative Pap test should never be relied on in a symptomatic patient (10). Initially, all women suspected of having cervical cancer should have a general physical examination performed to include evaluation of the supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinofemoral lymph Figure 36.1 Gross appearance of cervical cancer on examination."

The senior physician realized that a potential cause of the abdominal pain was a pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). The patient was rushed for an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed no fetus or sac in the uterus. She was also noted to have a positive pregnancy test. The patient underwent surgery and was found to have a ruptured fallopian tube caused by an ectopic pregnancy. Whenever a patient has apparent pelvic pain, it is important to consider the gender-related anatomical differences. Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age."

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

            "content": "Signs Physical examination seldom reveals any evidence of endometrial carcinoma, although obesity and hypertension are commonly associated constitutional factors. Special attention should be given to the more common sites of metastasis. Peripheral lymph nodes and breasts should be assessed carefully. Abdominal examination is usually unremarkable, except in advanced cases in which ascites or hepatic or omental metastases may be palpable. On gynecologic examination, the vaginal introitus and suburethral area, and the entire vagina and cervix, should be carefully inspected and palpated. Bimanual rectovaginal examination should be performed specifically to evaluate the uterus for size and mobility, the adnexa for masses, the parametria for induration, and the cul-de-sac for nodularity."

            "content": "A 53-year-old woman with a history of knee osteoarthritis, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension presents with new onset of hot flashes and a question about a dietary supplement. She is obese (body mass index [BMI] 33), does not exercise, and spends a good portion of her work day in a seated position. She eats a low-sugar diet and regularly eats packaged frozen meals for dinner because she doesn\u2019t have time to cook regularly. Her most recent laboratory values include a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that is above goal at 160 mg/dL (goal < 100 mg/dL) and a hemo-globin A1c that is well controlled at 6%. Her blood pressure is high at 160/100 mm Hg. Her prescription medications include simvastatin, metformin, and benazepril. She also takes over-the-counter ibuprofen for occasional knee pain and a multivitamin supplement once daily. She has heard good things about natural products and asks you if taking a garlic supplement daily could help to bring her blood"

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

            "content": "The most frequent presenting symptom is postmenopausal bleeding, which occurs in 80% to 90% of cases. Other less common symptoms are vaginal discharge, abdominal or pelvic pain, weight loss, and passage of tissue from the vagina. The duration of symptoms usually is only a few months. On physical examination, uterine enlargement is present in 50% to 95% of patients, and a polypoid mass may be seen within or protruding from the endocervical canal in up to 50% of patients. Diagnosis can usually be determined by biopsy of an endocervical mass or endometrial curettage."

The use of triphasic oral contraceptives is not associated with an appreciable increased risk of functional ovarian cysts (207). Other Benign Masses Women with endometriosis may develop ovarian endometriomas (\u201cchocolate\u201d cysts), which can enlarge to 6 to 8 cm in size. A mass that does not resolve with observation may be an endometrioma (see Chapter 17). Excision is preferable to ablative techniques with regard to resolution of pain, achievement of spontaneous pregnancy, and risk of recurrence (208)."

Mild straining by the patient may cause some lesions, which are out of reach of the finger, to descend sufficiently low to be detected by palpation. e. Test for occult blood: Examine the finger after it is withdrawn for evidence of gross blood, pus, or other alterations in color or consistency. Smear the stool to test for occult blood (guaiac). 6. Evaluate the rectum: a. Anterior wall 1. Cervix: size, shape, symmetry, consistency, and tenderness, especially on manipulation 2. 3. In patients with an intact hymen, the examination of the anterior wall of the rectum is the usual method of examining the pelvic organs. b.
