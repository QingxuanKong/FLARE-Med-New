    "question": "A 57-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of abdominal bloating and increased frequency of stools. He describes the stools as bulky, foul-smelling, and difficult to flush. He also has a 4-month history of recurrent dull upper abdominal pain that usually lasts for a few days, worsens after meals, and is not relieved with antacids. He has had a 10-kg (22-lb) weight loss in the past 4 months. He has no personal or family history of serious illness. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 37 years. He has a 12-year history of drinking 6 to 8 beers daily. He is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 52 kg (115 lb); BMI is 20 kg/m2. His vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination shows mild epigastric tenderness without rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds are normal. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: **Step 1:** Review the patient's symptoms and history The patient presents with abdominal bloating, increased frequency of stools, bulky and foul-smelling stools, and recurrent dull upper abdominal pain that worsens after meals. These symptoms, combined with weight loss and a history of smoking and heavy drinking, raise suspicion for a gastrointestinal disorder. **Step 2:** Consider the differential diagnosis Based on the symptoms, possible diagnoses include inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, or a functional disorder like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). **Step 3:** Evaluate the need for imaging or endoscopy Given the patient's symptoms and history, imaging or endoscopy may be necessary to rule out structural abnormalities or inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. **Step 4:** Choose the most appropriate next step Considering the patient's symptoms and the need for visualization of the gastrointestinal tract, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the most appropriate next step. Endoscopy can help identify inflammation, ulcers, or other abnormalities in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. **Answer:** ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a gastrointestinal disorder, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the most appropriate next step to visualize the gastrointestinal tract and rule out structural abnormalities or inflammation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" } ``` Note: The other options are not the best next steps in this case. An abdominal CT scan may be useful in certain cases, but it is not the most appropriate initial choice. Endoscopic ultrasonography and abdominal ultrasound may also be useful, but they are not as direct or informative as endoscopy in this case.",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Auscultation can detect bruits or friction rubs from vascular disease or hepatic tumors. Loss of bowel sounds signifies ileus, whereas high-pitched, hyperactive sounds characterize intestinal obstruction. Percussion assesses liver size and can detect shifting dullness from ascites. Palpation assesses for hepatosplenomegaly as well as neoplastic or inflammatory masses. Abdominal exam is helpful in evaluating unexplained pain. Intestinal ischemia elicits severe pain but little tenderness. Patients with visceral pain may exhibit generalized discomfort, whereas those with parietal pain or peritonitis have directed pain, often with involuntary guarding, rigidity, or rebound. Patients with musculoskeletal abdominal wall pain may note tenderness exacerbated by Valsalva or straight-leg lift maneuvers."

Weight loss is common\u2014typically 10\u201320% of body weight\u2014and develops as a consequence of diarrhea, anorexia, and fear of eating. An inflammatory mass may be palpated in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. The mass is composed of inflamed bowel, adherent and indurated mesentery, and enlarged abdominal lymph nodes."

            "content": "The history helps define the etiology of nausea and vomiting. Drugs, toxins, and infections often cause acute symptoms, whereas established illnesses evoke chronic complaints. Gastroparesis and pyloric obstruction elicit vomiting within an hour of eating. Emesis from intestinal blockage occurs later. Vomiting occurring within minutes of meal consumption prompts consideration of rumination syndrome. With severe gastric emptying delays, the vomitus may contain food residue ingested hours or days before. Hematemesis raises suspicion of an ulcer, malignancy, or Mallory-Weiss tear. Feculent emesis is noted with distal intestinal or colonic obstruction. Bilious vomiting excludes gastric obstruction, whereas emesis of undigested food is consistent with a Zenker\u2019s diverticulum or achalasia. Vomiting can relieve abdominal pain from a bowel obstruction, but has no effect in pancreatitis or cholecystitis. Profound weight loss raises concern about malignancy or obstruction. Fevers suggest"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

Although attention is often directed by the history to the diseased organ or part of the body, the examination of a new patient must extend from head to toe in an objective search for abnormalities. Unless the physical examination is systematic and is performed consistently from patient to patient, important segments may be omitted inadvertently. The results of the examination, like the details of the history, should be recorded at the time they are elicited\u2014not hours later, when they are subject to the distortions of memory. Skill in physical diagnosis is acquired with experience, but it is not merely technique that determines success in eliciting signs of disease. The detection of a few scattered petechiae, a faint diastolic murmur, or a small mass in the abdomen is not a question of keener eyes and ears or more sensitive fingers but of a mind alert to those"

Recent travel and exposures should be documented, dietary factors should be investigated, and a list of medications recently used should be obtained. Factors that seem to worsen or improve the diarrhea should be determined. Physical examination should be thorough, evaluating for abdominal distention, tenderness, quality of bowel sounds, presence of blood in the stool or a large fecal mass on rectal examination, and anal sphincter tone."

Thus, complaints may include lower-right-sided cramping abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, lowgrade fever, and obstructive symptoms. The disease is chronic with exacerbations and remissions, and importantly, it cannot be cured medically or surgically. Approximately a third of patients require surgery within the first year ater diagnosis, and thereater, 5 percent per year. Reactive arthritis is common, and the gastrointestinal cancer risk, although not as great as. with ulcerative colitis, is increased substantially. FIGURE 54-2 Causes of colitis.
