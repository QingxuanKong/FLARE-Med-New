    "question": "A 64-year-old man presents to the clinic with easy fatigability and breathlessness when climbing stairs for the last 2 weeks. He also mentions that he occasionally has bouts of cough at night after about 2\u20133 hours of sleep which is relieved when he sits upright. He denies shortness of breath at rest, palpitations, and loss of consciousness. He has had hypertension for the last 20 years and is on antihypertensive medications. On physical examination, his temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse is 104/min, blood pressure is 122/82 mm Hg, and respirations are 18/min. Chest auscultation reveals crackles over the lung bases bilaterally. Examination of his abdomen reveals mildly tender hepatomegaly. Laboratory investigation results include a hemoglobin of 14.8 g/dL (9.18 mmol/L) and an elevated serum B-type natriuretic peptide. His two-dimensional echocardiogram reveals an enlarged left atrium and an ejection fraction of 55%. Which of the following novel drugs is most likely to benefit the patient in addition to valsartan?",

The physical examination reveals crackles over the lung bases bilaterally and mildly tender hepatomegaly. Laboratory investigations show an elevated serum B-type natriuretic peptide and an enlarged left atrium on echocardiogram. These findings suggest heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The patient is already on valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), for hypertension. To add to the patient's treatment, we need a novel drug that can benefit HFpEF. Among the options, sacubitril is an ACE inhibitor with neprilysin inhibition, which has been shown to improve symptoms and exercise capacity in patients with HFpEF.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" } ``` The reasoning behind this answer is as follows: * The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). * HFpEF is a condition where the left ventricle is stiff and cannot relax properly, leading to increased filling pressures and symptoms. * Valsartan, an ARB, is already being used to treat the patient's hypertension. * Sacubitril, an ACE inhibitor with neprilysin inhibition, has been shown to improve symptoms and exercise capacity in patients with HFpEF. * Etanercept is a TNF-alpha inhibitor, which is not typically used in the treatment of HFpEF. * Moxonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, which is not typically used in the treatment of HFpEF. * Aliskiren is an direct renin inhibitor, which is not typically used in the treatment of HFpEF.",

His heart fail-ure must be treated first, followed by careful control of the hypertension. He was initially treated with a diuretic (furo-semide, 40 mg twice daily). On this therapy, he was less short of breath on exertion and could also lie flat without dyspnea. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhib-itor was added (enalapril, 20 mg twice daily), and over the next few weeks, he continued to feel better. Because of continued shortness of breath on exercise, digoxin at 0.25 mg/d was added with a further modest improvement in exercise tolerance. The blood pressure stabilized at 150/90 mm Hg, and the patient will be educated regarding the relation between his hypertension and heart failure and the need for better blood pressure control. Cautious addition of a \u03b2 blocker (metoprolol) will be considered. Blood lipids, which are currently in the normal range, will be monitored."

Thus, dyspnea is observed in disorders as diverse as pulmonary disease, marked obesity, and anxiety (Chap. 47e). Similarly, chest discomfort may result from a variety of noncardiac and cardiac causes other than myocardial ischemia (Chap. 19). Edema, an important finding in untreated or inadequately treated heart failure, also may occur with primary renal disease and in hepatic cirrhosis (Chap. 50). Syncope occurs not only with serious cardiac arrhythmias but in a number of neurologic conditions as well (Chap. 27). Whether heart disease is responsible for these symptoms frequently can be determined by carrying out a careful clinical examination (Chap. 267), supplemented by noninvasive testing using electrocardiography at rest and during exercise (Chap. 268), echocardiography, roentgenography, and other forms of myocardial imaging (Chap. 270e)."

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

CXR, MRI, and cardiac catheterization may be helpful, but echocardiography is key to diagnosis and reveals rapid early filling with a normal or near-normal EF. Cardiac biopsy may reveal fibrosis or evidence of infiltration. ECG frequently shows LBBB. Therapeutic options are limited and generally are palliative only. Medical treatment includes cautious use of diuretics for \ufb02uid overload, vasodilators to \u2193 filling pressure, and anticoagulation if not contraindicated. Major risk factors for CAD include age, male gender, hyperlipidemia, DM, hypertension, obesity, a family history, and smoking. The classic triad of angina consists of substernal chest pain that is provoked by exertion and relieved by rest or nitrates."

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

            "content": "The most common cause of right-sided heart failure is left-sided heart failure. Diuretics are for symptomatic relief only and confer no mortality benef t. Heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction is defined as a \u2193 EF (< 50%) and left ventricular end-diastolic volumes. It is caused by inadequate left ventricular contractility or \u2191 afterload. The heart compensates for low EF and preload through hypertrophy and ventricular dilation (Frank-Starling law), but the compensation ultimately fails, leading to \u2191 myocardial work and worsening systolic function. Exertional dyspnea is the earliest and most common presenting symptom and progresses to orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), and finally rest dyspnea. Chronic cough, fatigue, lower extremity edema, nocturia, Cheyne-Stokes respirations, and/or abdominal fullness may be seen. Look for signs to distinguish leftfrom right-sided heart failure (see Table 2.1-6)."

In more severe HF, the patient must sit upright, may have labored breathing, and may not be able to finish a sentence because of shortness of breath. Systolic blood pressure may be normal or high in early HF, but it generally is reduced in advanced HF because of severe LV dysfunction. The pulse pressure may be diminished, reflecting a reduction in stroke volume. Sinus tachycardia is a nonspecific sign caused by increased adrenergic activity. Peripheral vasoconstriction leading to cool peripheral extremities and cyanosis of the lips and nail beds is also caused by excessive adrenergic activity."

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"
