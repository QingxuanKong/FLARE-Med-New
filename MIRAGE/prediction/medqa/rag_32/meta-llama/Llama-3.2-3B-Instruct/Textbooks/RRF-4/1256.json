    "question": "A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain. She states that she was walking up the stairs at work when she felt sudden and severe abdominal pain followed by nausea and vomiting. Her past medical history is non-contributory and she is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 99.7\u00b0F (37.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 122/78 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of abdominal tenderness, a left adnexal mass, and left adnexal tenderness. A transvaginal ultrasound demonstrates free fluid surrounding the ovary with edema and the presence of doppler flow. A urinary pregnancy test is negative. The patient's symptoms persisted after ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's consider the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient presents with sudden and severe abdominal pain that started with walking up the stairs, nausea, and vomiting. The pain is severe, and the patient is tachycardic (120/min) and slightly tachypneic (17/min). The physical exam is notable for the absence of abdominal tenderness, but the presence of left adnexal tenderness and a left adnexal mass on ultrasound. The ultrasound also shows free fluid surrounding the ovary with edema and the presence of Doppler flow, which suggests ovarian torsion. Given these findings, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are highly suggestive of ovarian torsion, a medical emergency that requires prompt surgical intervention. The patient's symptoms persisted after ibuprofen and acetaminophen, indicating that conservative management is not appropriate. Therefore, the best next step in management is surgical intervention. Laparotomy (B) is the most appropriate choice as it allows for immediate surgical assessment and treatment of the ovarian torsion. Laparoscopy (A) may not provide the same level of control and may not be suitable for a patient with suspected ovarian torsion. MRI of the pelvis (C) may not be the best choice in this acute setting as it is not as urgent as surgical intervention. Observation and serial abdominal exams (D) are not appropriate for a patient with suspected ovarian torsion, as this condition can rapidly progress to necrosis and require surgical intervention.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The uterus may be slightly enlarged, with findings similar to a normal pregnancy (103,104). Cervical motion tenderness may or may not be present. An adnexal mass may be palpable in up to 50% of cases, but the mass varies markedly in size, consistency, and tenderness. A palpable mass may be the corpus luteum and not the ectopic pregnancy. With rupture and intra-abdominal hemorrhage, the patient develops tachycardia followed by hypotension. Bowel sounds are decreased or absent. The abdomen is distended, with marked tenderness and rebound tenderness. Cervical motion tenderness is present.

What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?"

Fever is present in about half of these patients; abnormal uterine bleeding occurs in about one-third. New vaginal discharge, urethritis, and chills may be present but are less specific signs. Adnexal pathology can present acutely and may be due to rupture, bleeding or torsion of cysts, or, much less commonly, neoplasms of the ovary, fallopian tubes, or paraovarian areas. Fever may be present with ovarian torsion. Ectopic pregnancy is associated with rightor left-sided lower abdominal pain, with clinical signs generally appearing 6\u20138 weeks after the last normal menstrual period. Amenorrhea is present in ~75% of cases and vaginal bleeding in ~50% of cases. Orthostatic signs and fever may be present. Risk factors include the presence of known tubal disease, previous ectopic pregnancies, a history of infertility,"

Few clinical situations require greater judgment, because the most catastrophic of events may be forecast by the subtlest of symptoms and signs. In every instance, the clinician must distinguish those conditions 20 that require urgent intervention from those that do not and can best be managed nonoperatively. A meticulously executed, detailed history and physical examination are critically important for focusing the differential diagnosis, where necessary, and allowing the diagnostic evaluation to proceed expeditiously (Table 20-1). The etiologic classification in Table 20-2, although not complete, provides a useful framework for evaluating patients with abdominal pain."

Diverticulitis is less likely to lead to perforation and peritonitis than is appendicitis. Fever, chills, and constipation typically are present, but anorexia and vomiting are uncommon. Bowel sounds are hypoactive and are substantially decreased with peritonitis related to a ruptured diverticular abscess. Abdominal examination reveals distention with left lower quadrant tenderness on direct palpation and localized rebound tenderness. Abdominal and bimanual rectovaginal examinations may reveal a poorly mobile, doughy in\ufb02ammatory mass in the left lower quadrant. Leukocytosis and fever are common. Stool guaiac may be positive as a result of in\ufb02ammation of the colon or microperforation."

The patient subsequently underwent a transvaginal ultrasound examination for evaluation of adnexal pathology. The scan showed a markedly enlarged right ovary measuring up to 8 cm in long axis with echogenic stroma and peripherally distributed follicles. There was no internal vascularity when color Doppler was applied. A small amount of free fluid was seen in the pouch of Douglas. The diagnosis of ovarian torsion was made."
