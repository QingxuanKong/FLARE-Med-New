During these episodes, she has had nausea and vomiting. She has no diarrhea, dysuria, or hematuria and is asymptomatic between episodes. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Seven years ago, she underwent resection of the terminal ileum because of severe Crohn's disease. She is 155 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 79 kg (175 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. Her temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.5\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/95 mm Hg. There is mild scleral icterus. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation of the right upper quadrant without guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The stool is brown, and test for occult blood is negative. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 12.5 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 9,500 mm3\nPlatelet count 170,000 mm3\nSerum\nTotal bilirubin 4.1 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 348 U/L\nAST 187 U/L\nALT 260 U/L\nAbdominal ultrasonography shows a normal liver, a common bile duct caliber of 10 mm (normal < 6 mm) and a gallbladder with multiple gallstones and no wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid.

The patient presents with three episodes of severe, sharp, penetrating abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. She has no diarrhea, dysuria, or hematuria and is asymptomatic between episodes. The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, which was treated with resection of the terminal ileum 7 years ago. She also has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient's laboratory studies show elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), elevated total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. The abdominal ultrasonography shows a common bile duct caliber of 10 mm (normal < 6 mm) and a gallbladder with multiple gallstones. Considering the patient's history of Crohn's disease and the presence of multiple gallstones, the most likely cause of her symptoms is choledocholithiasis, which is the presence of gallstones in the common bile duct. This condition can cause pain, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes due to obstruction of bile flow. The narrow common bile duct caliber and the presence of multiple gallstones support this diagnosis. The other options are less likely: * Acute hepatitis A (A) would not typically cause such a specific pattern of elevated liver enzymes and bile duct dilation. * Cholecystitis (C) is possible, but the patient's symptoms are more suggestive of an obstructive cause rather than an inflammatory one. * Pancreatitis (D) is also possible, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory studies are more consistent with an obstructive cause rather than an inflammatory one.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

            "content": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is usually made on the basis of a characteristic history and physical examination. The triad of sudden onset of RUQ tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis is highly suggestive. Typically, leukocytosis in the range of 10,000\u201315,000 cells per microliter with a left shift on differential count is found. The serum bilirubin is mildly elevated (<85.5 \u03bcmol/L [5 mg/dL]) in fewer than half of patients, whereas about one-fourth have modest elevations in serum aminotransferases (usually less than a fivefold elevation). Ultrasound will demonstrate calculi in 90\u201395% of cases and is useful for detection of signs of gallbladder inflammation including thickening of the wall, pericholecystic fluid, and dilatation of the bile duct. The radionuclide (e.g., HIDA) biliary scan may be confirmatory if bile duct imaging is seen without visualization of the gallbladder."

Auscultation can detect bruits or friction rubs from vascular disease or hepatic tumors. Loss of bowel sounds signifies ileus, whereas high-pitched, hyperactive sounds characterize intestinal obstruction. Percussion assesses liver size and can detect shifting dullness from ascites. Palpation assesses for hepatosplenomegaly as well as neoplastic or inflammatory masses. Abdominal exam is helpful in evaluating unexplained pain. Intestinal ischemia elicits severe pain but little tenderness. Patients with visceral pain may exhibit generalized discomfort, whereas those with parietal pain or peritonitis have directed pain, often with involuntary guarding, rigidity, or rebound.

It is steady rather than intermittent, as would be suggested by the word colic, which must be regarded as a misnomer, although it is in widespread use. An episode of biliary pain persisting beyond 5 h should raise the suspicion of acute cholecystitis (see below). Nausea and vomiting frequently accompany episodes of biliary pain. An elevated level of serum bilirubin and/or alkaline phosphatase suggests a common duct stone. Fever or chills (rigors) with biliary pain usually imply a complication, i.e., cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or cholangitis.

Abdominal swelling caused by intestinal gas can be differentiated from swelling caused by fluid or a solid mass by percussion; an abdomen filled with gas is tympanic, whereas an abdomen containing a mass or fluid is dull to percussion.

Some patients, particularly those with associated disease of the biliary tract, have symptoms and signs localized to the right upper quadrant, including pain, guarding, punch tenderness, and even rebound tenderness. Nonspecific symptoms, such as chills, anorexia, weight loss, nausea, and vomiting, may also develop. Only 50% of patients with liver abscesses, however, have hepatomegaly, right-upper-quadrant tenderness, or jaundice; thus, one-half of patients have no symptoms or signs to direct attention to the liver. Fever of unknown origin may be the only manifestation of liver abscess, especially in the elderly. Diagnostic studies of the abdomen, especially the right upper quadrant, should be a part of any workup for fever of unknown origin. The single most reliable laboratory finding is an elevated serum concentration of alkaline phosphatase, which is documented in 70% of patients with liver abscesses. Other tests of liver"

The symptoms may also be intermittent, such as pain and transient jaundice caused by a stone that temporar-ily impacts the ampulla but subsequently moves away, acting as a ball valve. A small stone may pass through the ampulla spontaneously with resolution of symptoms. Finally, the stones may become completely impacted, causing severe progressive jaundice. Elevation of serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and transaminases are commonly seen in patients with bile duct stones. However, in about one-third of patients with common bile duct stones, the liver chemistries are normal, particularly if the obstruction is incomplete or intermittent.Diagnosis Ultrasonography is useful for documenting stones in the gallbladder (if still present), as well as determining the size of the common bile duct.

It may be difficult to differentiate acute cholecystitis from acute pancreatitis, because an elevated serum amylase may be found in both disorders. Pain of biliary tract origin is more right sided or epigastric than periumbilical or left upper quadrant and can be more severe; ileus is usually absent. Ultrasound is helpful in establishing the diagnosis of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. Intestinal obstruction due to mechanical factors can be differentiated from pancreatitis by the history of crescendo-decrescendo pain, findings on abdominal examination, and CT of the abdomen showing changes"

            "content": "A 25-year-old man developed severe pain in the left lower quadrant of his abdomen. The pain was diffuse and relatively constant but did ease for short periods of time. On direct questioning the patient indicated that the pain was in the inguinal region and radiated posteriorly into his left infrascapular region (loin). A urine dipstick was positive for blood (hematuria). A diagnosis of a ureteric stone (calculus) was made. The patient\u2019s initial infrascapular pain, which later radiated to the left groin, relates to passage of the ureteric stone along the ureter. The origin of the pain relates to ureteral distention. A series of peristaltic waves along the ureter transport urine along the length of the ureter from the kidney to the bladder. As the ureteric stone obstructs the kidney, the ureter becomes distended, resulting in an exacerbation of the pain. The peristaltic waves are superimposed upon the distention, resulting in periods of exacerbation and periods of relief."
