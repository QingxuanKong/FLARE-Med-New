Suppression is a defense mechanism where an individual consciously pushes unpleasant thoughts, feelings, or memories into the unconscious mind to avoid dealing with them. In the context of the patient's situation, suppression would manifest as the patient downplaying or minimizing the significance of their recent colonoscopy results, which showed no remaining cancer or polyps. The correct answer can be deduced by analyzing each option in light of this definition.\\n\\nOption A suggests that the patient is taking action to help others, which may be a way of avoiding feelings of guilt or anxiety related to their own cancer experience. This could be a manifestation of denial or avoidance, rather than suppression.\\n\\nOption B implies that the patient has an overly optimistic view of their situation and believes that the doctor's actions have already cured their cancer, which is a form of denial. While it may seem like suppression, this statement is more indicative of denial.\\n\\nOption C involves apologizing for being late and not getting the requested labs, which appears to be a genuine concern for the patient's care and not a way of avoiding dealing with the colonoscopy results. This is not consistent with suppression.\\n\\nOption D suggests that the patient is acknowledging the colonoscopy and is aware of the results, but is choosing not to dwell on them. This statement aligns with the definition of suppression, as the patient is consciously pushing the unpleasant thoughts (the colonoscopy results) into the unconscious mind by not focusing on them.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Such screening programs are particularly important for individuals with a family history of the disease in first-degree relatives. The relative risk for developing colorectal cancer increases to 1.75 in such individuals and may be even higher if the relative was afflicted before age 60. The prior use of proctosigmoidoscopy as a screening tool was based on the observation that 60% of early lesions are located in the rectosigmoid. For unexplained reasons, however, the proportion of large-bowel cancers arising in the rectum has been decreasing during the past several decades, with a corresponding increase in the proportion of cancers in the more proximal descending colon.

Remind patient and family you won\u2019t abandon them. Possible phrases to use: I imagine this is very hard for you to hear. You look very upset. Tell me how you are feeling. I wish the news were different. We\u2019ll do whatever we can to help you."

How clear is the information from us about what to expect regarding your illness? How much do you feel that the medical care you are getting fits with your goals? If concern is detected in any of these areas, deeper evaluative questions are warranted."

Nondirective questions about the effect of bladder volume changes include \u201cAs your next urination approaches, does this pain get better, get worse, or stay the same?\u201d and \u201cAfter you urinate, does this pain get better, get worse, or stay the same?\u201d Establishing that the pain is exacerbated by the consumption of certain foods and drinks not only supports the diagnosis of IC/BPS but also serves as the basis for one of the first steps in managing this syndrome. A nondirective way to ask about urgency is to describe it to the patient as a compelling urge to urinate that is difficult to postpone; follow-up questions can determine whether this urge is intended to relieve pain or prevent incontinence. To assess severity and provide quantitative baseline"

(Courtesy of Dr. R. Odze, Division of Gastrointestinal Pathology, Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts; with permission.) Dysplasia can be flat or polypoid. If flat high-grade dysplasia is encountered on colonoscopic surveillance, the usual treatment is colectomy for UC and either colectomy or segmental resection for CD. If flat low-grade dysplasia is found (Fig. 351-13), most investigators recommend immediate colectomy. Adenomas may occur coincidently in UC and CD patients with chronic colitis and can be removed endoscopically provided that biopsies of the surrounding mucosa are free of dysplasia. High-definition and high-magnification colonoscopes and dye sprays have increased the rate of dysplasia detection."

You inoculate each of 10 cultures with a single E. coli bacterium, allow the cultures to grow until each contains 106 cells, and then measure the number of cells in each culture that carry a mutation in your gene of interest. You were so surprised by the initial results that you repeated the experiment to confirm them. Both sets of results display the same extreme variability, as shown in Table Q5\u20131. Assuming that the rate of mutation is constant, why do you suppose there is so much variation in the frequencies of mutant cells in different cultures?"

Colonoscopy is currently the most accurate and most complete method for examining the large bowel. This procedure is highly sensitive for detecting even small polyps (<1 cm) and allows biopsy, polypectomy, control of hemor-rhage, and dilation of strictures. However, colonoscopy does require mechanical bowel preparation, and the discomfort asso-ciated with the procedure requires conscious sedation in most patients. Colonoscopy is also considerably more expensive than other screening modalities and requires a well-trained endos-copist. The risk of a major complication"
