    "question": "A 3-month-old girl is brought to the physician because of a productive cough for 5 days. Over the past month, she has had several episodes of watery stools. She is exclusively breastfed every 3\u20134 hours for 15\u201320 minutes. She was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation at home and has not yet been evaluated by a physician. The mother reports that her child is not gaining weight. The mother had no prenatal care. The infant is at the 5th percentile for height and weight. The infant has not received any immunizations. Her temperature is 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F), pulse is 155/min, respirations are 45/min, and blood pressure is 88/50 mm Hg. Oral examination shows white plaques covering the tongue and the palate. Rales are heard bilaterally on cardiopulmonary examination. Cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",

The presence of white plaques on the tongue and palate, and cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy are also notable. These symptoms, especially in an exclusively breastfed infant with no immunizations, suggest an infectious etiology. The key to this case is to consider congenital infections that can cause these symptoms. One possibility is congenital syphilis, which can cause a variety of symptoms including rash, lymphadenopathy, and respiratory problems. The presence of congenital syphilis can be confirmed by a fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS). This test detects the presence of antibodies against Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis. The other options, karyotyping, DNA test for CFTR mutation, and polymerase chain reaction for viral genes, are not directly relevant to this clinical presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Meconium staining of the umbilical cord, nails, and skin suggest fetal distress and the possibility of aspiration pneumonia. The level of spontaneous activity, passive muscle tone, quality of the cry, and apnea are useful screening signs to evaluate the state of the nervous system. The examination should proceed with an assessment of vital signs, particularly heart rate (normal rate, 120 to 160 beats/min); respiratory rate (normal rate, 30 to 60 breaths/min); temperature (usually done per rectum and later as an axillary measurement); and blood pressure (often reserved for sick infants). Length, weight, and head circumference should be measured and plotted on growth curves to determine whether growth is normal, accelerated, or retarded for the specific gestational age."

She is feeling well overall but reports a 25-pack-year smoking history. She drinks 3\u20134 beers per week and has no known medication allergies. She has a history of heroin use and is currently receiving methadone. Physical examination reveals normal vital signs and no abnormalities. White blood cell count is 5800 cells/mm3 with a normal differential, hemoglobin is 11.8 g/dL, all liver tests are within normal limits, CD4 cell count is 278 cells/mm3, and viral load (HIV RNA) is 110,000 copies/mL. What other laboratory tests should be ordered? Which antiretroviral medica-tions would you begin?"

Indicators of medical diseases, such as vomiting, diarrhea, fever, respiratory symptoms, and fatigue, should be noted. A careful diet history is essential. Lactation problems in breastfed infants and improper formula preparation are frequent causes of growth failure early in infancy. It is crucial to evaluate intake of solid foods and liquids for older infants and children. Due to parental dietary beliefs, some children have inappropriately restricted diets; others drink excessive amounts of fruit juice, leading to malabsorption or anorexia. The child\u2019s daily meal schedule (timing, frequency, location) should also be noted. Mealtime practices, especially distractions that interfere with completing meals, can influence growth. A complete psychosocial assessment of the child and family is required. Child factors (temperament,"

Given the frequency of viral gastroenteritis as the etiology, it is important to be alert for unusual features that suggest another diagnosis. Viral gastroenteritis usually is not associated with severe abdominal pain or headache and does not recur at frequent intervals. Physical examination should include assessment of the child\u2019s hydration status, including examination of capillary refill, moistness of mucous membranes, and skin turgor (see Chapter 38). The chest should be auscultated for evidence of rales or other signs of pulmonary involvement. The abdomen must be examined carefully for distention, organomegaly, bowel sounds, tenderness, and guarding. A rectal examination and testing stool for occult blood should be considered."

Current World Health Organization (2013) recommendations are to exclusively breastfeed for the first 6 months of life with partial breastfeeding until 2 years of age. Neonatal infection, especially in its early stages, may be dificult to diagnose because these newborns often fail to express classic clinical signs. If the fetus was infected in utero, there may be depression and acidosis at birth for no apparent reason. The neonate may suck poorly, vomit, or show abdominal distention. Respiratory insuiciency can develop, which may present similarly to idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome. he neonate may be lethargic or jittery. he response to sepsis may be hypothermia rather than hyperthermia, and the total leukocyte and neutrophil counts may be depressed."

Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria.
