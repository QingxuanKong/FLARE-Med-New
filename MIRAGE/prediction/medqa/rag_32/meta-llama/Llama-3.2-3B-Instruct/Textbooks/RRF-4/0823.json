    "question": "A 40-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe left upper quadrant pain (duration 3 hours, stabbing quality, 10/10 on the pain scale). Past medical history is significant for sickle cell anemia. Physical examination is significant for severe tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant. Significant splenomegaly is also noted. The patient is admitted to the hospital for close observation and placed on deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis as part of a routine protocol. Laboratory findings drawn sometime after admission demonstrate a normal prothrombin time (PT) and elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Which of the following factors is most directly affected by the DVT prophylaxis?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the effects of DVT prophylaxis on coagulation factors. DVT prophylaxis typically involves the use of anticoagulant medications such as low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin. These medications work by inhibiting the activity of various coagulation factors, which are essential for blood clotting. The specific factors affected by DVT prophylaxis are the ones involved in the intrinsic and common pathways of the coagulation cascade. The partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test measures the activity of these factors, including factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, V, and fibrinogen. Since the patient's PTT is elevated, it indicates that the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade is affected. The most directly affected factor is likely to be factor XII, which is involved in the initiation of the intrinsic pathway. Among the options provided, factor XII is the one that is most directly affected by DVT prophylaxis. Therefore, the correct answer is D. XII.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

However, patients with a high clinical likelihood of VTE should skip d-dimer testing and undergo imaging as the next step in the diagnostic algorithm. Clinical Pearls Not all leg pain is due to DVT, and not all dyspnea is due to PE (Table 300-2). Sudden, severe calf discomfort suggests a ruptured Baker\u2019s cyst. Fever and chills usually herald cellulitis rather than DVT. Physical findings, if present, may consist only of mild palpation discomfort in the lower calf. However, massive DVT often presents with marked thigh swelling, tenderness, and erythema. If the leg is diffusely edematous, DVT is unlikely. More probable is an acute exacerbation of venous insufficiency due to postthrombotic syndrome. Upper extremity venous thrombosis may present with asymmetry in the supraclavicular fossa or in the circumference of the upper arms."

This clot may break off and pass through the heart to enter the pulmonary circulation, resulting in occlusion of the pulmonary artery, cardiopulmonary arrest, and death. A significant number of patients undergoing surgery are likely to develop a DVT, so most surgical patients are given specific prophylactic treatment to prevent thrombosis. A typical DVT prophylactic regimen includes anticoagulant injections and graduated stockings (to prevent deep venous stasis and facilitate emptying of the deep veins). Although physicians aim to prevent the formation of DVT, it is not always possible to detect it because there may be no clinical signs. Calf muscle tenderness, postoperative pyrexia, and limb swelling can be helpful clues. The diagnosis is predominantly made by duplex Doppler sonography or rarely by ascending venography."

Examination findings include abdominal distention with mild to moderate tenderness and signs of dehydration. The diagnosis of mesenteric thrombosis is frequently made on abdominal spiral CT with oral and IV contrast. Findings on CT angiography with venous phase include bowel-wall thickening and ascites. Intravenous contrast will demonstrate a delayed arterial phase and clot within the superior mesenteric vein. The goal of management is to optimize hemodynamics and correct electrolyte abnormalities with massive fluid resuscitation. Intravenous antibiotics as well as anticoagulation should be initiated. If laparotomy is performed and 1981 mesenteric venous thrombosis is suspected, heparin anticoagulation is Acute intestinal obstruction immediately initiated, and compromised bowel is resected.

            "content": "once an iron-deficient state is achieved, phlebotomy is usually only required at 3-month intervals. Neither phlebotomy nor iron deficiency increases the platelet count relative to the effect of the disease itself, and thrombocytosis is not correlated with thrombosis in PV, in contrast to the strong correlation between erythrocytosis and thrombosis in this disease. The use of salicylates as a tonic against thrombosis in PV patients is not only potentially harmful if the red cell mass is not controlled by phlebotomy, but is also an unproven remedy. Anticoagulants are only indicated when a thrombosis has occurred and can be difficult to monitor if the red cell mass is substantially elevated owing to the artifactual imbalance between the test tube anticoagulant and plasma that occurs when blood from these patients is assayed for prothrombin or partial thromboplastin activity. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia (<10 mg/dL) requires no therapy, but allopurinol should be administered to avoid"

The risk is further increased in patients with malignancy and a history of venous thrombo-embolism. Options for DVT prophylaxis include intermit-tent pneumatic compression, use of graduated compression stockings, and administration of low-dose unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, fondaparinux, and vitamin K antagonists. Direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors are approved for prophylactic use only for orthopedic procedures and for recurrent VTE. However, prophylaxis should be stratified based on the patient\u2019s level of risk.3 In patients with established DVT, unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, fondaparinux, and some factor Xa inhibitors are options for initial antithrombotic therapy.

Less common presenting findings include thrombotic or vasoocclusive events (from severe leukocytosis or thrombocytosis).
