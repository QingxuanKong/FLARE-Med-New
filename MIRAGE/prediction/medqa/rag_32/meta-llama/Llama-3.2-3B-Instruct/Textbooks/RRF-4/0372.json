The patient's laboratory studies show an elevated leukocyte count, normal differential, and abnormal electrolytes (low sodium, low potassium, and low bicarbonate). The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a respiratory infection, possibly pneumonia. The patient's confusion and altered mental status may be due to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or a systemic infection. The patient's abdominal pain and diarrhea may be related to the respiratory infection or a gastrointestinal issue. The localized crackles in the left lower lung field suggest a pulmonary infiltrate, which could be due to pneumonia. The patient's elevated leukocyte count supports the presence of an infection. The patient's low sodium and low potassium levels may be due to dehydration, vomiting, or a gastrointestinal issue. The patient's low bicarbonate level may be due to metabolic acidosis. The patient's creatinine level is within normal limits, but the patient's urine output is not provided. The patient's calcium level is normal. The patient's oxygen saturation is 94% on room air, which is within normal limits. The patient's temperature is 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C), which is consistent with a fever. The patient's heart rate is elevated at 120/min, which may be due to the infection or dehydration. The patient's respiratory rate is 17/min, which is within normal limits. The patient's physical examination is notable for localized crackles and decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung field, which suggests a pulmonary infiltrate. The patient's confusion and altered mental status may be due to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or a systemic infection.

Chest radiography can confirm the presence of a pulmonary infiltrate and assess the extent of the infection, which is essential for guiding treatment, such as antibiotics and oxygen therapy. While a lung biopsy (B) could provide more detailed information about the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, it is an invasive procedure that carries risks and is not typically the first-line diagnostic test. A sputum culture (C) may be useful in identifying the causative organism, but it may not be available immediately, and the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a respiratory infection that requires prompt treatment. A urine antigen test (D) is not typically used to diagnose pneumonia or respiratory infections.",

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

Bibasilar rales are the most common pulmonary sign. Less common clinical manifestations include abdominal pain, confusion, stupor, seizures, ataxia, coma, and jaundice. Clinical laboratory studies frequently reveal anemia and leukopenia early in the course, leukocytosis late in the course, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, hypoalbuminemia, mildly increased serum hepatic aminotransferases, and prerenal azotemia. Complications can include respiratory failure, hematemesis, cerebral hemorrhage, and hemolysis. Severe illness necessitates the admission of 10% of hospitalized patients to an intensive care unit. Greater severity is generally associated with old age, underlying disease, and treatment with a sulfonamide; the case-fatality rate is 1%. In a"
