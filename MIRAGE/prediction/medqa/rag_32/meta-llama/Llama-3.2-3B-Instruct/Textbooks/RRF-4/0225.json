This suggests a condition that affects the production or distribution of melanocytes, rather than a condition that affects the melanocytes themselves. The options can be evaluated as follows: A. Tinea versicolor is a fungal infection that can cause hypopigmentation, but it is not typically associated with an absence of melanocytes. B. Albinism is a congenital condition that affects the production of melanin, but it is not typically associated with an absence of melanocytes in the epidermis. C. Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition that causes the destruction of melanocytes, leading to hypopigmented skin. This option is consistent with the biopsy results. D. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can cause hypopigmentation, but it is not typically associated with an absence of melanocytes in the epidermis. The biopsy results suggest that the patient has an autoimmune condition that is causing the destruction of melanocytes, making option C the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

This is a congenital lesion caused by entrapment of melanocytes in the dermis during their migration from the neural crest into the epidermis. Although most of these lesions are found in the lumbosacral area (Mongolian spot), they also occur at other sites such as the buttocks, flank, extremities, or, rarely, the face (Fig. 193-1). Single or multiple, poorly demarcated, gray-blue patches up to 10 cm in size may be present. Most lesions gradually disappear during the first few years of life; aberrant lesions in unusual sites are more likely to persist."

Cutaneous melanoma is predominantly a malignancy of white-skinned people (98% of cases), and the incidence correlates with latitude of residence, providing strong evidence for the role of sun exposure. Men are affected slightly more than women (1.3:1), and the median age at diagnosis is the late fifties. Dark-skinned populations (such as those of India and Puerto Rico), blacks, and East Asians also develop melanoma, albeit at rates 10\u201320 times lower than those in whites. Cutaneous melanomas in these populations are diagnosed more often at a higher stage, and patients tend to have worse outcomes. Furthermore, in nonwhite populations, there is a much higher frequency of acral (subungual, plantar, palmar) and mucosal melanomas. In 2014, more than 76,000 individuals in the United States were expected to develop melanoma, and"

This accounts for 50% to 70% of melanomas and typically arises from a precursor melanocytic nevus. Nodular subtype accounts for 15% to 30% of melanomas, and typically arises de novo, most commonly in men and on the trunk (Figs. 16-11 and 16-12). This subtype is aggressive with an early vertical growth pat-tern and is often diagnosed at a later stage. Up to 5% of these lesions will lack melanin and can be mistaken for other cutane-ous lesions. Lentigo maligna represents 10% of melanoma cases and is a less aggressive subtype of melanoma in situ that typi-cally arises on sun-exposed areas of the head and neck. Acral Figure 16-10.

The examining physician discovers postural hypotension and moderate vitiligo (depigmented areas of skin) and obtains routine blood tests. She finds hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis and suspects Addison\u2019s disease. She performs a standard ACTH 1\u201324 stimulation test, which reveals an insufficient plasma cortisol response compatible with primary adrenal insuf-ficiency. The diagnosis of autoimmune Addison\u2019s disease is made, and the patient must start replacement of the hormones he cannot produce himself. How should this patient be treated? What precautions should he take?"
