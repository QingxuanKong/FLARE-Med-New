    "predict": "To approach this question, let's analyze the provided clinical scenario and laboratory results. The patient presents with symptoms of pyelonephritis, as evidenced by: * Fever (38.2\u00b0C or 100.7\u00b0F) * Malaise * Vomiting * Decreased urination * Laboratory results showing: + Elevated white blood cell count (8.1 x 10^9/L) with a predominance of neutrophils (4.8 x 10^9/L) + Presence of WBC casts + Elevated serum creatinine (1.9 mg/dL) and blood urea nitrogen (25 mg/dL) + Urine dipstick showing red blood cells per field of high power (2) + Urine density 1.010 and pH 6.2 These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis, which is an infection of the kidneys. Now, let's consider the skin manifestations associated with pyelonephritis. The correct answer is: D. Erythema nodosum Erythema nodosum is a type of skin inflammation that can occur in association with pyelonephritis, particularly in women. It is characterized by the appearance of tender, erythematous nodules on the skin, typically on the shins. The other options are not directly related to pyelonephritis: A. Janeway lesions are typically associated with infective endocarditis, characterized by small, painless, erythematous lesions on the palms and soles. B. Diffuse maculopapular rash can be seen in various conditions, including infections, autoimmune disorders, and skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis. C. Malar rash is characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a systemic autoimmune disease. Here is the answer in the requested JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory results consistent with pyelonephritis, a urinary tract infection that has spread to the kidneys.

He was started on demeclocycline, 600 mg PO in the morning and 300 mg in the evening, just before discharge from hospital. Plasma Na+ concentration increased to 140 meq/L with a BUN of 23 and creatinine of 1.4, at which point demeclocycline was reduced to 300 mg PO bid.

The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation.

The febrile stage lasts 3 or 4 days and is identified by the abrupt onset of fever, headache, severe myalgia, thirst, anorexia, and often nausea and vomiting. Photophobia, retroorbital pain, and pain on ocular movement are common, and the vision may become blurred with ciliary body inflammation. Flushing over the face, the V area of the neck, and the back is characteristic, as are pharyngeal injection, periorbital edema, and conjunctival suffusion. Petechiae often develop in areas of pressure, the conjunctivae, and the axillae. Back pain and tenderness to percussion at the costovertebral angle reflect massive retroperitoneal edema. Laboratory evidence of mild to moderate DIC is present. Other laboratory findings of HFRS include proteinuria and active urinary sediment. The hypotensive stage lasts from a few hours to 48 h and begins with falling blood pressure and sometimes shock. The relative bradycardia typical of the febrile"

He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"
