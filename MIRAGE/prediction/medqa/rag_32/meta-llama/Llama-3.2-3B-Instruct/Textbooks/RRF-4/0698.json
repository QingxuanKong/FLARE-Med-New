    "question": "A 34-year-old man comes to the physician with a 2-month history of difficulty concentrating at work. He is worried he may lose his job due to poor performance. He feels constantly tired but attributes his fatigue to waking up early most mornings and being unable to fall back asleep. His wife has noticed that he has been speaking more slowly than usual and his appetite has decreased. He used to enjoy dance classes with her but has not been as interested in this recently. He is a veteran who returned from a deployment to Afghanistan 2 years ago. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Major depressive disorder",
        "B": "Adjustment disorder",

        "D": "Post traumatic stress disorder"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the patient's history and symptoms. The patient has a 2-month history of difficulty concentrating at work, feeling constantly tired, and has noticed a decrease in appetite and has become less interested in activities he used to enjoy, such as dance classes. He also reports waking up early and having trouble falling back asleep. Additionally, he is worried about losing his job due to poor performance.\\n\\nThe patient's symptoms of fatigue, decreased appetite, and lack of interest in activities are classic signs of depression. The patient's difficulty concentrating at work and worry about losing his job can be seen as stressors that may have triggered or exacerbated his depressive symptoms. The fact that he has been a veteran and recently returned from deployment to Afghanistan could also be a contributing factor, as military personnel are at higher risk for developing mental health conditions such as depression and PTSD.\\n\\nLet's evaluate the options provided:\\n\\nA. Major depressive disorder: This is a possible diagnosis given the patient's symptoms of persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, changes in appetite, and fatigue.\\n\\nB. Adjustment disorder: While the patient's job concerns and recent deployment may have triggered his symptoms, adjustment disorder typically involves a more acute response to a specific stressor and does not include the full range of depressive symptoms seen in this patient.\\n\\nC. Acute stress disorder: This diagnosis would typically involve more severe symptoms of dissociation, anxiety, and flashbacks, which are not described in the patient's presentation.\\n\\nD. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): While the patient's military service and deployment may be relevant, PTSD typically involves symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal, which are not the primary concerns in this patient's presentation.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the most likely diagnosis is A. Major depressive disorder.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

A formal neurologic examination is required to determine whether objective muscle weakness is present.

On confrontational testing, they are able to generate full power for only a brief period before suddenly giving way to the examiner.

Physicians should inquire about when the patient typically goes to bed, when they fall asleep and wake up, whether they awaken during sleep, whether they feel rested in the morning, and whether they nap during the day. Depending on the primary complaint, it may be useful to ask about snoring, witnessed apneas, restless sensations in the legs, movements during sleep, depression, anxiety, and behaviors around the sleep episode.

He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

He has hypertension, and during the last 8 years, he has been adequately managed with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH\u2019s problem? What information would you gather to confirm your diagnosis? What treatment steps would you initiate?"

            "content": "Differential Diagnosis of Fatigue If one looks critically at patients who seek medical help because of incapacitating exhaustion, lassitude, and fatigability, it is evident that the most commonly overlooked diagnoses are anxiety and depression as described in Chap. 47. The correct conclusion can usually be reached by keeping these illnesses in mind as one elicits the history from patient and family. Difficulty arises when symptoms of the psychiatric illness are so inconspicuous as not to be appreciated; one comes then to suspect the diagnosis only by having eliminated the common medical causes. Repeated observation may bear out the existence of an anxiety state or gloomy mood. Reassurance in combination with a therapeutic trial of antidepressant drugs may suppress symptoms of which the patient was barely aware, thus clarifying the diagnosis. The best that can be done is to assist the patient in adjusting to the adverse circumstances that have brought him under medical surveillance."

However, folate has no effect on the neurologic damage caused by B12 deficiency. Over time, then, the neurologic effects can become severe and irreversible. Thus, folate can mask a deficiency of B12 and prevent treatment until the neuropathy is apparent. III.

He saw his PCP for evaluation of low back pain. X-rays of the spine showed some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine plus several wedge deformities in the thoracic spine. The patient is a long-time smoker (up to two packs per day) and has two to four glasses of wine with dinner, more on the weekends. He has chronic bronchitis, presumably from smoking, and has been treated on numerous occasions with oral prednisone for exacerba-tions of bronchitis. He is currently on 10 mg/d prednisone. Examination shows kyphosis of the thoracic spine, with some tenderness to fist percussion over the thoracic spine. The dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measure-ment of the lumbar spine is \u201cwithin the normal limits,\u201d but the radiologist noted that the reading may be misleading because of degenerative changes.
