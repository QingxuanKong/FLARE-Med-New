These symptoms are characteristic of Parkinson's disease. The patient does not swing his arms while walking, which is another hallmark of Parkinson's disease. The antiviral drug prescribed alleviates the patient's symptoms, suggesting that the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms is related to a viral infection. The most common viral infection associated with Parkinson's disease is the flu, which can be treated with antiviral medications. Among the options provided, ribavirin is an antiviral medication used to treat various viral infections, including the flu. It is also used to treat Parkinson's disease, particularly in cases caused by viral infections such as influenza.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Some of these disorders are diagnosed on the basis of failure of levodopa/carbidopa to produce a clinical response. Other idiopathic dementias may mimic Parkinson\u2019s disease and include progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy. If a 43-year-old male patient presents with sudden onset of chorea, irritability, and antisocial behavior and his father experienced these symptoms at a slightly older age, think Huntington\u2019s disease. A signif cant difference between gait abnormalities in Parkinson\u2019s and that of NPH is preservation of arm swing in NPH. There are four PaRTS to Parkinson\u2019s: Postural instability, Rigidity (cogwheeling), Tremor (\u201cpill rolling\u201d), and Slowed movements (bradykinesia)."

It is difficult to classify and more relevant to disorders of gait than it is to tremors of other types. The frequency of the tremor has been recorded as approximately 14 to 16 Hz, making it difficult to observe and more easily palpable. An important accompanying feature is the sensation of severe imbalance, which causes the patient to assume a widened stance while standing; these patients are unable to walk a straight line (tandem gait). We have observed prominent tonic contraction of the legs during standing, seemingly in an attempt to overcome imbalance (see Heilman; Thompson, Rothwell, Day et al). The arms are affected little or not at all. Often the first step or two when the patient begins to walk are halting, but thereafter, the gait is entirely normal.

The rhythmic beat coincides with an alternating burst of activity in agonist and antagonist muscles in the electromyogram (EMG) and sometimes palpable by the examiner; hence, the description alternating tremor is applied. The arm, jaw, tongue, eyelids, and foot are less often involved. Even the least degree of tremor is felt during passive movement of a rigid part (cogwheel phenomenon, or Negro sign, or at least this is the ostensible explanation for cogwheeling but there has been a dissociation of these two signs in many of our patients). The tremor shows surprising fluctuations in severity and is aggravated by walking and excitement, but its frequency remains constant (Hunker and Abbs). It bears repetition that one side of the body is typically involved before the other with tremor and rigidity, and the tremor in particular remains asymmetrical as the illness advances."

The patient totters and staggers while standing and walking. In mild form, it is best seen as the patient walks between obstacles or along a straight line, turns suddenly, or halts. To correct the instability, the patient places his feet and legs wide apart, flexes his body slightly, and repeatedly contracts the extensor muscles of his feet as he sways (la danse des tendons). In moving forward, the patient flings his stiffened leg abruptly, and the foot strikes the floor with a resounding thump in a manner quite unlike that seen in the ataxia of cerebellar disease. The patient clatters along in this way with eyes glued to the floor. If his vision is blocked, he is rendered helpless.

The face acquires a staring, \u201cworried\u201d expression with a furrowed brow (a result of the tonic contraction of the procerus muscle), made more striking by the paucity of eye movements. A number of our patients have displayed mild dystonic postures of a hand or foot, especially as the illness advanced but occasionally early on. The limbs may be slightly stiff and there are Babinski signs in a few cases."

Symptoms of neuropathy appeared between 3 and 35 weeks after treatment was begun and affected approximately 10 percent of patients receiving therapeutic doses in the upper range (10 mg/kg daily). The initial symptoms are symmetrical numbness and tingling of the toes and feet spreading, if the drug is continued, to the knees and occasionally to the hands. Aching and burning pain in these parts then becomes prominent. In addition to sensory loss, examination usually discloses a loss of tendon reflexes and weakness in the distal muscles of the legs. Severe degrees of weakness and loss of deep sensation are observed only rarely."

Abnormalities of movement and posture as well as tremors may be revealed by observing the limbs at rest and in motion (see Chaps. 4 to 5). This is accomplished by watching the patient maintain the arms and move them from the prone to the supine positions; perform simple tasks, such as alternately touching his nose and the examiner\u2019s finger; make rapid alternating movements that necessitate sudden acceleration and deceleration and changes in direction, such as tapping one hand on the other while alternating pronation and supination of the forearm; rapidly touch the thumb to each fingertip; and accomplish simple tasks such as buttoning clothes, opening a safety pin, or handling common tools. Estimates of the strength of leg muscles with the patient in bed may be unreliable; there may seem to be little or no weakness even though the patient cannot arise from a chair or from a kneeling position"

Watching the patient walk is the most important part of the neurologic examination. Normal gait requires that multiple systems\u2014including strength, sensation, and coordination\u2014function in a highly integrated fashion. Unexpected abnormalities may be detected that prompt the examiner to return in more detail to other aspects of the examination. The patient should be observed while walking and turning normally, walking on the heels, walking on the toes, and walking heel-to-toe along a straight line. The examination may reveal decreased arm swing on one side (corticospinal tract disease), a stooped posture and short-stepped gait (parkinsonism), a broad-based unstable gait (ataxia), scissoring (spasticity), or a high-stepped, slapping gait (posterior column or peripheral nerve disease), or the patient may appear to be stuck in place (apraxia with frontal lobe disease)."

Elements of parkinsonian akinesia and rigidity and a fine tremor can be perceived in patients with advanced stages of the disease. Ultimately, the patient loses the ability to stand and walk, being forced to lie inert in bed and having to be fed and bathed, the legs curled into a fixed posture of paraplegia in flexion (in essence, a persistent vegetative state)."

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian"
