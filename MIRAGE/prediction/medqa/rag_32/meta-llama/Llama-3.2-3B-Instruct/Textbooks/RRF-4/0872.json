As the splenic artery passes along the superior border of the pancreas, it gives off numerous small branches to supply the neck, body, and tail of the pancreas (Fig. 4.124).

The spleen is mobilized by dividing ligamentous attachments, usually beginning with the splenocolic ligament (Fig. 34-6). In patients with signifi-cant splenomegaly, once lesser sac access has been achieved through either the gastrosplenic or gastrohepatic attachments, ligating the splenic artery in continuity along the superior bor-der of the pancreas may be preferable. This maneuver may serve several purposes: allowing safer manipulation of the Figure 34-6.

There are also reports of splenic injuries after endoscopic procedures, such as colonoscopy.Improper traction on the spleen against its peritoneal attachments is the most common mechanism of intraopera-tive injury. Capsular tears are the most common type of injury, but parenchymal lacerations and subcapsular hematomas also occur. The lower pole is more commonly injured, owing to its orientation and the greater concentration of peritoneal attach-ments found here.As with all hemorrhage, prompt temporary control of bleeding should be obtained by direct compression of the spleen itself, packing of the left upper quadrant, compression of the vessels at the splenic hilum, or pressure on the splenic artery at the superior pancreatic margin. The spleen should then be mobi-lized from its peritoneal"

As noted in the discussion of splenic anatomy, the tail of the pancreas lies within 1 cm of the splenic hilum in 75% of patients; therefore, during hilar dissec-tion, great care must be taken to avoid injuring the pancreas. Once the spleen is excised, hemostasis is secured by irrigating, suctioning, and scrupulously inspecting the bed of dissection. The splenic bed is not routinely drained. A thorough search for accessory spleens must be undertaken when a hematologic disorder has occasioned splenectomy. At the completion of sur-gery, the nasogastric tube is removed.Laparoscopic SplenectomyLaparoscopic splenectomy (LS) has become the procedure of choice over the last two decades, since it has been first described Delaitre and Maignien in 1991.133 In fact, LS is now the gold standard for elective splenectomy in patients with normal-sized spleens.

The left colon, spleen, pancreas, and stomach are then rotated toward the midline. The authors prefer to leave the kidney in situ when mobilizing the viscera because this exaggerates the separation of the renal vessels from the SMA. The operative approach for SMA injuries is based on the level of injury. Fullen zone I SMA injuries, located posterior to the pancreas, are best exposed by a left medial visceral rotation. Fullen zone II SMA injuries, extending from the pancreatic edge to the middle colic branch, on the other hand, are approached via the lesser sac along the inferior edge of the pancreas at the base of the transverse mesocolon; the pancreatic body may be divided to gain proximal vascular access. More distal SMA injuries, Fullen zones III and IV, are approached directly within the mesentery. A venous injury behind the pancreas, from the junction of"

The artery must be repaired after the venous injury is treated, however, because of limb-threatening ischemia.Once overt hemorrhage is controlled, sources of enteric contamination are identified by serially running along the small and large bowel, looking at all surfaces. Associated hematomas should be unroofed to rule out adjacent bowel injury. The ante-rior and posterior aspects of the stomach should be inspected, which requires opening the lesser sac for complete visualiza-tion. Duodenal injuries should be evaluated with a wide Kocher maneuver. During exploration of the lesser sac, visualization and palpation of the pancreas is done to exclude injury.

Similarly, clamping the splenic hilum may be required for hilar bleeding. When the spleen is mobilized, it should be gently rotated medi-ally to expose the lateral peritoneum; this peritoneum and endo-abdominal fascia are incised, which allows blunt dissection of the spleen and pancreas as a composite from the retroperito-neum anterior to Gerota\u2019s fascia (Fig. 7-39).Rapid exposure of the intra-abdominal vasculature can prove challenging in the face of exsanguinating hemorrhage.
