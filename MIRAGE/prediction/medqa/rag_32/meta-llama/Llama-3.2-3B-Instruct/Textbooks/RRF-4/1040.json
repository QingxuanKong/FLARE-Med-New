She reports that the pain radiates to her back and is associated with nausea. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which she takes enalapril, furosemide, and simvastatin. Her temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), blood pressure is 84/58 mm Hg, and pulse is 115/min. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Examination shows abdominal distention with epigastric tenderness and guarding. Bowel sounds are decreased. Extremities are warm. Laboratory studies show:\nHematocrit 48%\nLeukocyte count 13,800/mm3\nPlatelet count 175,000/mm3\nSerum  \nCalcium 8.0 mg/dL\nUrea nitrogen 32 mg/dL\nAmylase 250 U/L\nAn ECG shows sinus tachycardia.

The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and laboratory studies show a low blood pressure, tachycardia, and decreased bowel sounds. The patient's vital sign abnormalities include hypotension (blood pressure 84/58 mmHg), tachycardia (pulse 115/min), and decreased extremities (warm extremities). The laboratory studies show an elevated hematocrit (48%) and leukocyte count (13,800/mm3). The patient's ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Given these findings, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The patient's abdominal pain radiating to the back and nausea are consistent with pancreatic colic. The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased extremities may be due to capillary leakage, which is a common complication of acute pancreatitis. The elevated hematocrit and leukocyte count may also be related to capillary leakage. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's vital sign abnormalities is capillary leakage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The diagnosis is established by two of the following three criteria: (1) typical abdominal pain in the epigastrium that may radiate to the back, (2) threefold or greater elevation in serum lipase and/or amylase, and (3) confirmatory findings of acute pancreatitis on cross-sectional abdominal imaging. Patients also have associated nausea, emesis, fever, tachycardia, and abnormal findings on abdominal examination. Laboratory studies may reveal leukocytosis, hypocalcemia, and hyperglycemia. Although not required for diagnosis, markers of severity may include hemoconcentration (hematocrit >44%), admission azotemia (BUN >22 mg/dL), SIRS, and signs of organ failure (Table 371-3)."

An umbilical venous hum may suggest the presence of portal hypertension, and a harsh bruit over the liver is heard rarely in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or alcoholic hepatitis. Abdominal swelling caused by intestinal gas can be differentiated from swelling caused by fluid or a solid mass by percussion; an abdomen filled with gas is tympanic, whereas an abdomen containing a mass or fluid is dull to percussion. The absence of abdominal dullness, however, does not exclude ascites, because a minimum of 1500 mL of ascitic fluid is required for detection on physical examination.

Frequently, the findings before rupture and hemorrhage are nonspecific, and vital signs are normal. The abdomen may be nontender or mildly tender, with or without rebound. The uterus may be slightly enlarged, with findings similar to a normal pregnancy (103,104). Cervical motion tenderness may or may not be present. An adnexal mass may be palpable in up to 50% of cases, but the mass varies markedly in size, consistency, and tenderness. A palpable mass may be the corpus luteum and not the ectopic pregnancy. With rupture and intra-abdominal hemorrhage, the patient develops tachycardia followed by hypotension. Bowel sounds are decreased or absent. The abdomen is distended, with marked tenderness and rebound tenderness. Cervical motion tenderness is present. Frequently, the findings of the pelvic examination are inadequate because of pain and guarding."

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future.

            "content": "Vomiting typically follows the pain; early emesis is bilious and nonfeculent if the obstruction is proximal but feculent if it is distal. In partial obstruction, there is continued passage of \ufb02atus but no stool, whereas in complete obstruction, no \ufb02atus or stool is passed (obstipation). Abdominal exam often reveals distention, tenderness, prior surgical scars, or hernias. Bowel sounds are characterized by high-pitched tinkles and peristaltic rushes. Peristalsis may disappear later in disease progression. Fever, hypotension, rebound tenderness, and tachycardia suggest peritonitis, a surgical emergency. CBC may demonstrate leukocytosis if there is ischemia or necrosis of bowel. Labs often re\ufb02 ect dehydration and metabolic alkalosis due to vomiting. Lactic acidosis is particularly worrisome, as it suggests necrotic bowel and the need for emergent surgical intervention."

The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

Auscultation can detect bruits or friction rubs from vascular disease or hepatic tumors. Loss of bowel sounds signifies ileus, whereas high-pitched, hyperactive sounds characterize intestinal obstruction. Percussion assesses liver size and can detect shifting dullness from ascites. Palpation assesses for hepatosplenomegaly as well as neoplastic or inflammatory masses. Abdominal exam is helpful in evaluating unexplained pain. Intestinal ischemia elicits severe pain but little tenderness. Patients with visceral pain may exhibit generalized discomfort, whereas those with parietal pain or peritonitis have directed pain, often with involuntary guarding, rigidity, or rebound. Patients with musculoskeletal abdominal wall pain may note tenderness exacerbated by Valsalva or straight-leg lift maneuvers."
