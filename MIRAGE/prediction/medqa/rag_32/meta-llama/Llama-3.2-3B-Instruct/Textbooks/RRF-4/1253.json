During the first 2 days of clinical manifestations, the parents of the child tried to control the symptoms using acetaminophen; however, the newborn continued to be ill, and blisters were noticeable around the buttocks, hands, and feet. During the physical examination, the vital signs include body temperature 39.0\u00b0C (102.3\u00b0F), heart rate 130/min, and respiratory rate 45/min. Ears, nose, and oral mucosa preserved their integrity, while the skin presents with diffuse blanching erythema and flaccid blisters with a positive Nikolsky\u2019s sign.

The presence of blisters with a positive Nikolsky's sign is a key clinical feature. The patient is 7 days old, and the condition started 2 days ago. The child's age and the characteristics of the skin lesions, such as blanching erythema and flaccid blisters with a positive Nikolsky's sign, suggest Staphylococcal Scalded-Skin Syndrome (SSSS). SSSS is a condition caused by exfoliative toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus. It typically affects infants and young children, and the condition usually begins with fever, irritability, and a maculopapular rash that progresses to blisters. The presence of blisters with a positive Nikolsky's sign is a hallmark of SSSS. The other options, scarlet fever, impetigo, and pyoderma, do not typically present with blisters and a positive Nikolsky's sign. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is B.

Meconium staining of the umbilical cord, nails, and skin suggest fetal distress and the possibility of aspiration pneumonia. The level of spontaneous activity, passive muscle tone, quality of the cry, and apnea are useful screening signs to evaluate the state of the nervous system. The examination should proceed with an assessment of vital signs, particularly heart rate (normal rate, 120 to 160 beats/min); respiratory rate (normal rate, 30 to 60 breaths/min); temperature (usually done per rectum and later as an axillary measurement); and blood pressure (often reserved for sick infants). Length, weight, and head circumference should be measured and plotted on growth curves to determine whether growth is normal, accelerated, or retarded for the specific gestational age."

The examination begins with vital signs, weight, length, and head circumference, looking for effects of systemic illness on growth. A thorough inspection of the infant is important to identify possible sources of pain, including skin lesions, corneal abrasions, hair tourniquets, skeletal infections, or signs of child abuse such as fractures (see Chapters 22 and 199). Infants with common conditions such as otitis media, urinary tract infections, mouth ulcerations, and insect bites may present with crying. A neurologic examination may reveal previously undiagnosed neurologic conditions, such as perinatal brain injuries, as the cause of irritability and crying. Observation of the infant during a crying episode is invaluable to assess the infant\u2019s potential for calming and the parents\u2019 skills in soothing the infant."

The idea that 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F) is the normal human body temperature dates back to the nineteenth century and was initially based on axillary measurements. Rectal temperatures more accurately reflect the core body temperature and are 0.4\u00b0C (0.7\u00b0F) and 0.8\u00b0C (1.4\u00b0F) higher than oral and axillary temperatures, respectively. Although the definition of fever varies greatly throughout the medical literature, the most common definition, which is based on studies defining fever of unknown origin (Chap. 26), uses a temperature \u226538.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F). Although fever is very commonly associated with infection, it is also documented in many other diseases (Chap. 23).

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

Extraintestinal disorders may produce GI manifestations (e.g., emesis with group A streptococcal pharyngitis, abdominal pain with lower lobe pneumonia). The examination should begin with a careful external inspection for abdominal distention, bruising or discoloration, abnormal veins, jaundice, surgical scars, and ostomies. Abnormalities of intensity and pitch of bowel sounds can occur with bowel obstruction. When palpating for tenderness, the examiner should note location, facial expression, guarding, and rebound tenderness. Palpation can also detect enlargement of the liver or spleen as well as feces and masses. If detected, organomegaly should be measured (with a tape measure), noting abnormal firmness or contour. A rectal examination, including inspection for fissures, skin tags, abscesses, and fistulous openings, should be performed"

Assessment of the patient\u2019s general appearance and vital signs, skin and soft tissue examination, and the neurologic evaluation are of particular importance. The patient may appear either anxious and agitated or lethargic and apathetic. Fever is usually present, although elderly patients and compromised hosts (e.g., patients who are uremic or cirrhotic and those who are taking glucocorticoids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be afebrile despite serious underlying infection. Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate helps determine the degree of hemodynamic and metabolic compromise. The patient\u2019s airway must be evaluated to rule out the risk of obstruction from an invasive oropharyngeal infection."

The rash of erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), which is caused by human parvovirus B19, primarily affects children 3\u201312 years old; it develops after fever has resolved as a bright blanchable erythema on the cheeks (\u201cslapped cheeks\u201d) with perioral pallor (Chap. 221). A more diffuse rash (often pruritic) appears the next day on the trunk and extremities and then rapidly develops into a lacy reticular eruption that may wax and wane (especially with temperature change) over 3 weeks. Adults with fifth disease often have arthritis, and fetal hydrops can develop in association with this condition in pregnant women."

The onset of fever is followed by conjunctival erythema; mucosal changes, including dry, cracked lips and a strawberry tongue; cervical lymphadenopathy; and swelling of the hands and feet (Fig. 88-1). Conjunctivitis is bilateral, bulbar, and nonsuppurative. Cervical lymphadenopathy is found in 70% of children and should be greater than 1.5 cm in diameter for the purposes of diagnosis. A rash, which can vary in appearance, occurs in 80% of children with KD and may be particularly accentuated in the inguinal area and on the chest. Extreme irritability is prominent, especially in infants. Abdominal pain and hydrops of the gallbladder, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, sterile pyuria, and arthritis, particularly of medium-sized to large joints, may occur. Carditis in the acute phase may be manifested by tachycardia, shortness of breath, or overt congestive"
