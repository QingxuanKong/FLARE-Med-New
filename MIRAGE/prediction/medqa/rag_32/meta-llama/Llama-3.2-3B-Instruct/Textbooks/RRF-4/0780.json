    "question": "A 14-year-old teenager presents to his pediatrician complaining of frequent headaches and excessive fatigue during soccer practice. His mother notes that he seems to have gained a lot of weight despite the fact that he eats a healthy, well-balanced diet. His teachers have also become concerned because he leaves class to use the restroom frequently throughout the day. He has no medical problems and family history is insignificant. A physical exam is significant for a short, overweight child with nonpitting edema and decreased reflexes. His systolic blood pressure drops by 20 mm Hg when he stands. Fundoscopic exam is significant for papilledema and visual field exam is significant for bitemporal hemianopsia. Laboratory findings include:\nBUN 22 mg/dL N: 7\u201320 mg/dL\npCO2 32 mm Hg N: 35\u201345 mm Hg\nCreatinine 0.8 mg/dL N: 0.8\u20131.4 mg/dL\nGlucose 50 mg/dL N: 64\u2013128 mg/dL\nSerum chloride 95 mmol/L N: 101\u2013111 mmol/L\nSerum potassium 3.3 mEq/L N: 3.7\u20135.2 mEq/L\nSerum sodium 120 mEq/L N: 136\u2013144 mEq/L\nBicarbonate (HCO3) 15 mmol/L N: 18\u201322 mmol/L\nThyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.1 mIU/L N: 0.5\u20135 mIU/L\nFree T4 6 pmol/L N: 10\u201320 pmol/L\nWhat is the necessary treatment?",

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with: * Growth hormone deficiency: short stature, overweight, frequent headaches, excessive fatigue, and decreased reflexes * Thyroid hormone deficiency: hypothyroidism, indicated by elevated TSH and low free T4 * Adrenal insufficiency: hypokalemia, alkalosis, and hypotension The patient's visual field exam showing bitemporal hemianopsia is also consistent with a craniopharyngioma, which can compress the optic chiasm. The necessary treatment for this patient would be hormone replacement therapy, which would involve replacing the deficient hormones to alleviate the symptoms and prevent further complications.

The patient should eat nothing after midnight prior to the test day. On the morning of the test, adults are then given 75 g of glucose in 300 mL of water; children are given 1.75 g of glucose per kilogram of ideal body weight. The glucose load is consumed within 5 minutes. Blood samples for plasma glucose are obtained at 0 and 120 minutes after ingestion of glucose. An oral glucose tolerance test is normal if the fasting venous plasma glucose value is less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and the 2-hour value falls below 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L). A fasting value of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher or a 2-hour value of greater than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus.

The increased concentration of Na+ and Cl\u2212 enables CSF to be isotonic to blood. The pressure in the CSF column is about 120 to 180 mm H2O when a person is recumbent.

Hypotension that is refractory to vasopressors or volume expansion may be an early sign. Nausea, lethargy, and weakness may progress to respiratory failure, paralysis, and coma, with hypoactive tendon reflexes, at serum magnesium levels >4 mmol/L. Other findings may include gastrointestinal hypomotility or ileus; facial flushing; pupillary dilation; paradoxical bradycardia; prolongation of PR, QRS, and QT intervals; heart block; and, at serum magnesium levels approaching 10 mmol/L, asystole.
