    "question": "A four-day-old neonate is brought to the pediatrician with vaginal discharge for the last two days. Her mother is concerned about the blood-tinged discharge but states that her daughter has been feeding and voiding well. The neonate was delivered at 39 weeks gestation by an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, and she and her mother were discharged home after two days. The prenatal course was complicated by chlamydia in the mother during the first trimester, for which she and the partner were both treated with a negative test of cure. The neonate\u2019s biological father is no longer involved the patient's care, but her mother\u2019s boyfriend has been caring for the baby whenever the mother rests. At this visit, the neonate\u2019s temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), pulse is 138/min, and respirations are 51/min. She appears comfortable, and cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. There are no bruises or marks on her skin. Examination of the genitals reveals no vulvar irritation or skin changes, but there is scant pink mucoid discharge at the introitus. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",

The neonate was delivered at 39 weeks gestation and has been feeding and voiding well, but the presence of blood-tinged discharge warrants further investigation. The prenatal course was complicated by chlamydia in the mother, for which both she and her partner were treated with a negative test of cure. This increases the risk of neonatal chlamydia. The neonate's symptoms and signs are non-specific, but the presence of scant pink mucoid discharge at the introitus is a red flag that requires further evaluation. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that all neonates with vaginal discharge at any age should be evaluated for gonococcal and chlamydial infections. Therefore, the best next step in management would be to perform a vaginal culture to determine the causative organism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

During prenatal care, the woman is instructed to be aware of luid leakage from the vagina and to report such an event promptly. Rupture of the membranes is signiicant for three reasons. First, if the presenting part is not ixed in the pelvis, the umbilical cord can prolapse and be compressed. Second, labor is likely to begin soon if the pregnancy is at or near term."

If patency is in doubt, a rectal thermometer may be used to gently test the patency. It is suggested that this examination should be performed on all female infants in the delivery room (31,32). Various types of hymenal configurations in the newborn are described, ranging from imperforate to microperforate, to cribriform, to hymenal bands, and to hymens with central anterior, posterior, or eccentric orifices (33).

For these, initial steps of warming the newborn can be done on the mother's chest or abdomen. Direct skin-to-skin contact with the mother and drying and covering the newborn with a warm blanket will help maintain euthermia (36.5 to 37.5\u00b0C). A vigorously crying newborn does not require routine oral suctioning (Carrasco, 1997; Gungor, 2006). Instead, bulb suctioning to remove secretions is best reserved for those who cannot clear secretions on their own due to apnea or copious secretions. Additional routine care steps include drying, gentle stimulation by rubbing the newborn's back, and continued observation during the transition period."

The World Health Organization (2014) cites a minimal stay of only 24 hours. Although it is clear that most newborns can be safely discharged within 48 hours, this is not uniformly true. For example, in more than 2.1 million neonates in Canada, Liu and associates (2000) examined readmission rates following initial neonatal discharge. As the length of hospital stay dropped from 4.2 days in 1990 to 2.7 days in 1997, the readmission rate rose from 27 to 38 per 1000. Dehydration and jaundice accounted for most of these readmissions.

Dark-field examination of direct fluorescent antibody staining of organisms obtained by scraping a skin or mucous membrane lesion is the quickest and most direct method of diagnosis. More commonly, serologic testing is used. The nontreponemal reaginic antibody assays\u2014the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and the rapid plasma reagin\u2014are helpful as indicators of disease. The test performed on the infant should be the same as that performed on the mother to enable comparison of results. An infant should be evaluated further if the maternal titer has increased fourfold, if the infant\u2019s titer is fourfold greater than the mother\u2019s titer, if the infant is symptomatic, or if the mother has inadequately treated syphilis.

            "content": "he end of second-stage labor is heralded as the perineum begins to distend, the overlying skin becomes stretched, and the fetal scalp is seen through the separating labia. Increased perineal pressure from the fetal head creates reflexive bearing-down eforts, which are encouraged when appropriate. At this time, preparations are made for delivery. If the bladder is distended, catheterization may be necessary. Continued attention is also given to fetal heart rate monitoring. s one example, a nuchal cord oten tightens with descent and may lead to deepening variable decelerations."

Unusual complications include distal glans amputation, acquisition of HIV infection or other sexually transmitted disease, meatal stenosis, penile denudation, penile destruction with electrosurgical coagulation, subsequent epidermal inclusion cyst and urethrocutaneous fistula, and ischemia following the inappropriate use of lidocaine with epinephrine (Amukele, 2003; Neulander, 1996; Nicoll, 1997; Pippi-Salle, 2013; Upadhyay, 1998). Hospital rooming in places newborns in their mothers' rooms instead of central nurseries. This practice attempts to make all phases of childbearing as natural as possible and to foster early mother-child relationships. By 24 hours, the mother is generally fully ambulatory. hereafter, with rooming-in, she can usually provide routine care for herself and her newborn. n obvious advantage of this is her ability to assume full care when she arrives home."

Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age. A 35-year-old woman visited her family practitioner because she had a \u201cbloating\u201d feeling and an increase in abdominal girth. The family practitioner examined the lower abdomen, which revealed a mass that extended from the superior pubic rami to the level of the umbilicus. The superior margin of the mass was easily palpated, but the inferior margin appeared to be less well defined. This patient has a pelvic mass. When examining a patient in the supine position, the observer should uncover the whole of the abdomen."

A category 1 or 2 FHR tracing associated with Apgar scores ?7 at 5 minutes, normal cord gases (\u00b1 1 SD), or both are not consistent with an acute HIE event (Graham, 2014). An FHR pattern at the time of presentation with persistently minimal or absent variability and lacking accelerations, with duration ?60 minutes, and even without decelerations is suggestive of an already compromised fetus (Chap. 24, p. 462). The 2014 Task Force further recommended that if fetal well-being cannot be established with these findings present, the woman should be evaluated for the method and timing of delivery."

Our policies were developed in conjunction with the Division of Neonatal Medicine. Importantly, the decision not to perform cesarean delivery does not necessarily imply that care for the fetus is discounted. Neonatologists are consulted before delivery, and a trilateral discussion of survival and morbidity rates ensues with the woman and her family. A neonatologist attends each delivery and determines subsequent management. In our institution, traditional fetal indications for cesarean delivery are practiced in women at 25\u00b0/7 weeks or beyond. Cesarean delivery is not ofered for fetal indications before 24\u00b0/7 weeks. At 240r weeks, cesarean delivery is not ofered unless fetal weight is estimated at 750 g or greater. Aggressive obstetrical management is practiced in cases of growth restriction, wherein gestational age is used to guide management rather than fetal size."

            "content": "The ideal management of labor and delivery requires two potentially opposing viewpoints on the part of clinicians. First, birthing should be recognized as a normal physiological process that most women experience without complications. Second, intrapartum complications, often arising quickly and unexpectedly, should be anticipated. Thus, clinicians must simultaneously make every woman and her supporters feel comfortable, yet ensure safety for the mother and newborn if complications suddenly develop. he American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017) have collaborated in the development of Guidelines or Perinatal Care. These provide detailed information on the appropriate content of intrapartum care, including both personnel and facility requirements (Table 22-2). Labor and delivery outside the hospital is elected by some parturients. This option and its risks and benefits are discussed in Chapter 27 (p. 524)."
