The patient's physical examination reveals a firm, asymmetric uterus, which could be indicative of a uterine anomaly. The laboratory studies show a low hemoglobin and hematocrit, indicating anemia. The platelet count is slightly low, but not significantly low. The serum electrolytes and renal function are within normal limits. Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely cause of her pregnancy losses is a uterine anomaly, such as a septate uterus or a unicornuate uterus. A hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is a diagnostic imaging test that can help identify uterine anomalies, making it the most appropriate test to elucidate the cause of her pregnancy losses. Karotyping (genetic testing) may be useful in identifying genetic abnormalities, but it is not the first-line test for this patient's presentation. Prolactin level and TSH level are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Condous and associates (2005) described 152 women with heavy bleeding, an empty uterus with endometrial thickness < 15 mm, and a diagnosis of completed miscarriage. Six percent were subsequently found to have an ectopic pregnancy. Thus, a complete abortion cannot be surely diagnosed unless: (1) true products of conception are seen grossly or (2) unless sonography confidently documents first an intrauterine pregnancy and then later an empty cavity.

            "content": "Traditionally, recurrent abortion has been defined as the occurrence of three or more clinically recognized pregnancy losses before 20 weeks from the last menstrual period. Using this definition, recurrent pregnancy loss occurs in approximately 1 in 300 pregnancies (2). Clinical investigation of pregnancy loss, however, may be initiated after two consecutive spontaneous abortions, especially when fetal heart activity is identified before any of the pregnancy losses, when the women is older than 35 years of age, or when the couple has had difficulty conceiving (5). A study of over 1,000 patients with recurrent pregnancy loss reported no difference in the prevalence of abnormal results for evidence-based and investigative diagnostic tests when the diagnostic workup was initiated after two versus three or more losses (6). If clinical intervention is undertaken in the form of investigation after two spontaneous abortions, approximately 1% of pregnant women will require evaluation (3)."

Physical examina-tion reveals a pale woman with diminished vibration sen-sation, diminished spinal reflexes, and extensor plantar reflexes (Babinski sign). Examination of her oral cavity reveals atrophic glossitis, in which the tongue appears deep red in color and abnormally smooth and shiny due to atro-phy of the lingual papillae. Laboratory testing reveals a mac-rocytic anemia based on a hematocrit of 30% (normal for women, 37\u201348%), a hemoglobin concentration of 9.4 g/dL, an erythrocyte mean cell volume (MCV) of 123 fL (nor-mal, 84\u201399 fL), an erythrocyte mean cell hemoglobin con-centration (MCHC) of 34% (normal, 31\u201336%), and a low reticulocyte count. Further laboratory testing reveals a normal serum folate concentration and a serum vitamin B12 (cobalamin) concentration"

During pregnancy, requirements are increased, and 400 \ufffdg/ d is recommended. he earliest biochemical evidence is low plasma folic acid concentrations (Appendix, p. 1255). Early morphological changes usually include neutrophils that are hypersegmented and newly formed erythrocytes that are macrocytic. With preexisting iron deiciency, macrocytic erythrocytes cannot be detected by measurement of the mean corpuscular volume. Careful examination of a peripheral blood smear, however, usually demonstrates some macrocytes. As the anemia becomes more intense, peripheral nucleated erythrocytes appear, and bone marrow examination discloses megaloblastic erythropoiesis. Anemia may then become severe, and thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, or both may develop. he fetus and placenta extract folate from maternal circulation so efectively that the fetus is not anemic despite severe maternal anemia."

Laboratory Testing Any adolescent with abnormal bleeding should undergo sensitive pregnancy testing, regardless of whether she states that she has had intercourse. The medical consequences of failing to diagnose a pregnancy are too severe to risk missing the diagnosis. Complications of pregnancy should be managed accordingly. In addition to a pregnancy test, laboratory testing should include a complete blood count with platelet count and screening tests for coagulopathies and platelet dysfunction. An international expert panel made recommendations about when a gynecologist should suspect a bleeding disorder and pursue a diagnosis (Table 14.8). The consensus report recommends measurement of complete blood cell count (CBC), platelet count and function, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT),"
