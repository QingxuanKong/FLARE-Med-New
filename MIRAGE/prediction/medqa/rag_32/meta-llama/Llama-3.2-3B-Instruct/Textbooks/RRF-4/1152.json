    "question": "A 51-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of fatigue, weight loss, and intermittent fevers for the past 6 months. He has had sexual intercourse with multiple men and women over the past year and does not use barrier protection. His last screen for sexually transmitted diseases was 10 years ago and was normal. His past medical history is notable for well-controlled asthma. He was involved in a motorcycle accident 2 years ago and suffered multiple fractured bones in his upper and lower extremities, all of which have healed. He has a distant history of cocaine abuse. He drinks 5-6 glasses of wine per week. His temperature is 100.8\u00b0F (38.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/75 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, he appears cachectic but is pleasant and appropriately interactive. An HIV differentiation assay and follow-up Western blot are performed and are positive. The patient is started on tenofovir, abacavir, and efavirenz. However, the patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, so the decision is made to replace this medication with ritonavir. Which of the following adverse effects is this patient at greatest risk for as a result of this change in medication regimen?",

Its primary side effects include hypersensitivity reactions, lactic acidosis, and liver enzyme elevations.\\n\\nRitonavir, on the other hand, is a protease inhibitor used in combination with other medications to treat HIV-1 infection. Its primary side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms, liver enzyme elevations, and increased risk of lipodystrophy.\\n\\nGiven the patient's hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, the most likely adverse effect they are at risk for with the change in medication regimen is related to the mechanism of action of the new medication, ritonavir.\\n\\nAmong the options provided, the most relevant adverse effect associated with ritonavir is lipodystrophy, which includes lipoatrophy (loss of fat from the face, arms, and legs) and lipohypertrophy (accumulation of fat in the abdominal area, particularly in the liver and muscles).\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.

Review of the past history and growth chart demonstrates normal birth weight and birth length, but a progressive decrease in height per-centiles relative to age-matched normal ranges starting at 6 months of age, and orthostasis with febrile illnesses. Physical examination demonstrates short stature and mild generalized obesity. Genital examination reveals descended but small testes and a phallic length of \u20132 SD. Laboratory evaluations demonstrate growth hormone (GH) deficiency and a delayed bone age of 18 months. The patient is started on replacement with recombinant human GH at a dose of 40 mcg/kg per day subcutaneously. After 1 year of treatment, his height velocity has increased from 5 cm/y to 11 cm/y.

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced. Blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, increasing to 160/98 mmHg after 1 L of saline, with a JVP at 8 cm. There was generalized muscle weakness.

Interestingly, the height of the patient and the previous lens surgery would suggest a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and a series of blood tests and review of the family history revealed this was so. A 35-year-old male patient presented to his family practitioner because of recent weight loss (14 lb over the previous 2 months). He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets."
