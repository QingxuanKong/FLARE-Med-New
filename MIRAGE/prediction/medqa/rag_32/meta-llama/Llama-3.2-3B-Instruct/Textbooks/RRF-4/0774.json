    "question": "A 25-year-old African American man presents to his primary care provider for routine blood work. He is a well-known case of sickle cell disease treated with hydroxyurea and tramadol as needed for pain. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. The patient asks if his disease can adversely affect his kidneys because his friend was recently diagnosed with end-stage renal failure. Which of the following is a renal complication of sickle cell disease?",

        "A": "Membranous glomerulonephritis",
        "B": "Proximal renal tubular acidosis",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the renal complications associated with sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects hemoglobin production, leading to abnormal red blood cells that can cause vaso-occlusive crises, which can damage various organs, including the kidneys. The question asks about a specific renal complication of sickle cell disease. Let's evaluate each option: A. Membranous glomerulonephritis - This is not a commonly reported renal complication of sickle cell disease. B. Proximal renal tubular acidosis - While sickle cell disease can cause renal damage, proximal renal tubular acidosis is not a specific or commonly reported complication. C. Impaired urine diluting ability - Sickle cell disease can affect the kidneys' ability to concentrate urine due to damage to the renal medulla, but this is not the most specific or direct renal complication. D. Impaired urine concentration ability - This is the correct answer. Sickle cell disease can lead to impaired urine concentration ability due to the subclinical infarction of the renal medulla, which can result in hyposthenuria, a decrease in urine concentration ability. The patient's history of sickle cell disease and the potential for renal damage due to vaso-occlusive crises make impaired urine concentration ability a plausible renal complication.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

As patients with sickle cell syndrome increasingly survive into their fifth and sixth decades, end-stage renal failure and pulmonary hypertension are becoming increasingly prominent causes of end-stage morbidity. A sickle cell cardiomyopathy and/or premature coronary artery disease may compromise cardiac function in later years. Sickle cell patients have received kidney transplants, but they often experience an increase in the frequency and severity of crises, possibly due to increased infection as a consequence of immunosuppression.

The low partial pressure of oxygen and high osmolarity predispose to hemoglobin S polymerization and erythrocyte sickling. Sequelae include hyposthenuria, hematuria, and papillary necrosis (which can also occur in sickle trait). The kidney responds by increases in blood flow and glomerular filtration rate mediated by prostaglandins. This dependence on prostaglandins may explain the greater reduction of glomerular filtration rate by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in these patients than in others. The glomeruli are typically enlarged. Intracapillary fragmentation and phagocytosis of sickled erythrocytes are thought to be responsible for the membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis\u2013like lesion, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is seen in more advanced cases. Proteinuria is present in 20\u201330%, and nephrotic-range proteinuria is associated with progression to renal failure."

[Note: The lifetime of a RBC in sickle cell anemia is <20 days, compared with 120 days for normal RBC, hence, the anemia.] Other symptoms include acute chest syndrome, stroke, splenic and renal dysfunction, and bone changes due to marrow hyperplasia. Life expectancy is reduced. Heterozygotes, representing 1 in 12 African Americans, have one normal and one sickle cell gene. The blood cells of such heterozygotes contain both HbS and HbA, and these individuals have sickle cell trait. They usually do not show clinical symptoms (but may under conditions of extreme physical exertion with dehydration) and can have a normal life span."

            "content": "Sickle cell syndromes are remarkable for their clinical heterogeneity. Some patients remain virtually asymptomatic into or even through adult life, while others suffer repeated crises requiring hospitalization from early childhood. Patients with sickle thalassemia and sickle-HbE tend to have similar, slightly milder symptoms, perhaps because of the ameliorating effects of production of other hemoglobins within the RBC. Hemoglobin SC disease, one of the more common variants of sickle cell anemia, is frequently marked by lesser degrees of hemolytic anemia and a greater propensity for the development of retinopathy and aseptic necrosis of bones. In most respects, however, the clinical manifestations resemble sickle cell anemia. Some rare hemoglobin variants actually aggravate the sickling phenomenon."

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

It is considered as a third-line therapy after failure of steroids or anti-CD20 antibody administration.39Hemoglobinopathies. Sickle cell disease is an inherited chronic hemolytic anemia that results from the mutant sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS) within the red blood cell and is inher-ited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Persons who inherit an HbS gene from one parent (heterozygous) are carriers; those who inherit an HbS gene from both parents (homozygous) have sickle cell anemia.40In sickle cell disease, the underlying abnormality is the mutation of adenine to"

D. Krabbe disease. E. Niemann-Pick disease. Correct answer = A. Fabry disease, a deficiency of \u03b1-galactosidase, is the only X-linked sphingolipidosis. It is characterized by pain in the extremities, a red-purple skin rash (generalized angiokeratomas), and kidney and cardiac complications. Protein in his urine indicates kidney damage. Enzyme replacement therapy is available. 7.4. Current medical advice for individuals experiencing chest pain is to call emergency medical services and chew a regular strength, noncoated aspirin. What is the basis for recommending aspirin?"
