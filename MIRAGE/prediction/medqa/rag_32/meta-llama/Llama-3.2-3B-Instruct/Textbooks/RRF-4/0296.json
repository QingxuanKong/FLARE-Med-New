He states that he first noticed the lesion last year, but he believes that it has been slowly growing in size. Dermatopathology determines that the lesion contains neoplastic cells of melanocytic origin. Which of the following characteristics of the lesion would likely be found on physical examination?",

Complete physical examination with attention to the regional lymph nodes is part of the initial evaluation in a patient with suspected melanoma.

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

            "content": "Biopsy Any pigmented cutaneous lesion that has changed in size or shape or has other features suggestive of malignant melanoma is a candidate for biopsy. An excisional biopsy with 1to 3-mm margins is suggested. This facilitates pathologic assessment of the lesion, permits accurate measurement of thickness if the lesion is melanoma, and constitutes definitive treatment if the lesion is benign. For lesions that are large or on anatomic sites where excisional biopsy may not be feasible (such as the face, hands, and feet), an incisional biopsy through the most nodular or darkest area of the lesion is acceptable; this should include the vertical growth phase of the primary tumor, if present. Incisional biopsy does not appear to facilitate the spread of melanoma. For suspicious lesions, every attempt should be made to preserve the ability to assess the deep and peripheral margins and to perform immunohistochemistry. Shave biopsies are an acceptable alternative, particularly if the suspicion"

FIguRE 76e-26 Squamous cell carcinoma is seen here as a hyper-keratotic, crusted, and somewhat eroded plaque on the lower lip. Sun-exposed skin of the head, neck, hands, and arms are other typical sites of involvement.

The more uncommon subtype, nodular melanoma, may not manifest all these features but rather may present as a more symmetric, evenly pigmented, or amelanotic lesion. Dysplastic (atypical) melanocytic nevi may occur as solitary or multiple lesions as well as in the setting of familial melanoma. These nevi display some degree of asymmetry, border irregularity, and color variation. Ordinary nevi may be acquired or congenital and are quite common."
