Step 1: Identify the pathogen - The patient presents with fever, chills, severe headache, nuchal rigidity, and photophobia. - The Gram stain of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows gram-negative cocci in pairs. Based on the Gram stain result, the most likely pathogen is Neisseria meningitidis, a gram-negative diplococcus. Step 2: Determine the virulence factor involved in the initial step of the infection - Neisseria meningitidis is known to cause meningitis and sepsis. - The initial step of Neisseria meningitidis infection involves the adherence of the bacteria to the host cells, which is facilitated by the presence of adhesive pili. Therefore, the virulence factor most likely involved in the initial step of this patient's infection is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and the Gram stain result suggest Neisseria meningitidis infection. The initial step of Neisseria meningitidis infection involves the adherence of the bacteria to the host cells, which is facilitated by the presence of adhesive pili.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Infants, of course, cannot complain of headache, stiff neck may be absent, and one has only the nonspecific signs of a systemic illness: fever, irritability, drowsiness, vomiting, convulsions, and a bulging fontanel to suggest the presence of meningeal infection. Signs of meningeal irritation do occur, but only late in the course of the illness. A high index of suspicion and liberal use of the lumbar puncture are the keys to early diagnosis. Lumbar puncture is ideally performed before any antibiotics are administered for other neonatal infections or, at a minimum, blood cultures should be obtained before treatment. An antibiotic regimen sufficient to control a septicemia may allow a meningeal infection to smolder and to flare up after antibiotic therapy for the systemic infection has been discontinued."

Computed tomography (CT) scans show hydrocephalus, edema, periventricular lucencies, and infarctions.

            "content": "The classic CSF abnormalities in tuberculous meningitis are as follows: (1) elevated opening pressure, (2) lymphocytic pleocytosis (10\u2013500 cells/\u03bcL), (3) elevated protein concentration in the range of 1\u20135 g/L, and (4) decreased glucose concentration in the range of 1.1\u20132.2 mmol/L (20\u201340 mg/dL). The combination of unrelenting headache, stiff neck, fatigue, night sweats, and fever with a CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis and a mildly decreased glucose concentration is highly suspicious for tuberculous meningitis. The last tube of fluid collected at LP is the best tube to send for a smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). If there is a pellicle in the CSF or a cobweb-like clot on the surface of the fluid, AFB can best be demonstrated in a smear of the clot or pellicle. Positive smears are typically reported in only 10\u201340% of cases of tuberculous meningitis in adults. Cultures of CSF take 4\u20138 weeks to identify the organism and are positive in ~50% of adults. Culture remains the gold standard to make"

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

Splenomegaly often appears four or more days after onset of symptoms. Patients are often asymptomatic between attacks, which recur every 2\u20133 days, depending on the Plasmodium strain. Severely ill patients may present with hyperpyrexia, prostration, impaired consciousness, agitation, hyperventilation, and bleeding. The presence of rash, lymphadenopathy, neck stiffness, or photophobia suggests a different or additional diagnosis. Timely diagnosis of the correct strain is essential because P. falciparum can be fatal and is often resistant to standard chloroquine treatment."

            "content": "aseptic meningitis and encepHalitis In children and young adults, enteroviruses are the cause of up to 90% of cases of aseptic meningitis in which an etiologic agent can be identified. Patients with aseptic meningitis typically present with an acute onset of fever, chills, headache, photophobia, and pain on eye movement. Nausea and vomiting also are common. Examination reveals meningismus without localizing neurologic signs; drowsiness or irritability may also be apparent. In some cases, a febrile illness may be reported that remits but returns several days later in conjunction with signs of meningitis. Other systemic manifestations may provide clues to an enteroviral cause, including diarrhea, myalgias, rash, pleurodynia, myocarditis, and herpangina. Examination of the CSF invariably reveals pleocytosis; the CSF cell count shows a shift from neutrophil to lymphocyte predominance within 1 day of presentation, and the total cell count does not exceed 1000/\u03bcL. The CSF glucose level is"

            "content": "After lumbar puncture, this syndrome is usually attributable to a lowering of ICP by leakage of CSF through the needle track into the paravertebral muscles. The headache may last for days or, rarely, weeks. Most characteristic is the relation of the cranial pain to upright posture, and its relief within moments after assuming the recumbent position. Actually, the syndrome includes more than headache. There may be pain at the base of the skull posteriorly and in the back of the neck and upper thoracic spine, mild stiffness of the neck and shoulders, and nausea and vomiting. At times, the signs of meningeal irritation are so prominent as to raise the question of postlumbar puncture meningitis, although lack of fever usually excludes this possibility. In addition to a low or unmeasurable CSF pressure if another spinal tap is performed (the CSF pressure is found to be in the range of 0 to 60 mm H2O), there are occasionally a few to a dozen white cells in the CSF, which may further raise"

It is critical to inform the laboratory of the intent to test for unusual organisms. Specialized media should be used when the history suggests uncommon microorganisms, such as Histoplasma or Legionella. Performing more than three blood cultures or more than one urine culture is useless in patients with FUO in the absence of PDCs (e.g., a high level of clinical suspicion of endocarditis). Repeating blood or urine cultures is useful only when previously cultured samples were collected during antibiotic treatment or within 1 week after its discontinuation. FUO with headache should prompt microbiologic examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for organisms including herpes simplex virus (HSV; especially HSV-2), Cryptococcus neoformans, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In CNS tuberculosis, the CSF typically has elevated protein and"
