    "question": "Please refer to the summary above to answer this question\nA medical student is examining the table in the abstract. She notices that the standard error surrounding measurements in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group is generally greater than the standard errors for the placebo and pulmharkimab 75 mg/day groups. Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?\"\n\"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma\nIntroduction:\nActive asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.\nPatients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.\nAnalyses were performed from baseline to month 12.\nResults:\nAt baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants\nPulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants\nPlacebo: 395 participants\nTable 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value\nPlaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 \u00b1 2.8 1.2 \u00b1 4.7 15.8 \u00b1 2.9 < 0.01\nLDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 \u00b1 3.6 -11.2 \u00b1 14.3 -8.4 \u00b1 3.9 0.28\nFEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 \u00b1 2.21 0.34 \u00b1 5.54 -0.22 \u00b1 3.21 0.27\nACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 \u00b1 1.22 0.46 \u00b1 3.25 0.12 \u00b1 1.33 0.43\nConclusion:\nPulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.\nSource of funding: Southeast Institute for Advanced Lung and Cardiovascular Studies, American Center for Advancement of Cardiovascular Health\"",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of standard error and its relation to the sample size and the effect size. The standard error is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A smaller standard error indicates that the data points tend to be closer to the mean, while a larger standard error indicates that the data points are more spread out. In this case, we are given the standard errors for the pulmharkimab 75 mg/day and 150 mg/day groups, and we need to determine why the standard error for the 150 mg/day group is larger. The correct answer can be deduced by understanding that a larger standard error indicates a wider range of values, which can be due to various factors such as a smaller sample size, less precise measurements, or a smaller effect size. However, in this case, the sample sizes for the three groups are not explicitly stated, but we can make an educated inference. Given that the sample sizes for the two pulmharkimab groups are 202 and 400, respectively, it is likely that the 150 mg/day group has a larger sample size compared to the 75 mg/day group. A larger sample size generally leads to a smaller standard error, as it provides more precise measurements. Therefore, the correct answer is not A (decreased external validity) or B (lack of statistical significance), as these are not directly related to the standard error. C (smaller sample size) is also incorrect, as the 150 mg/day group has a larger sample size. The correct answer is D (more narrow confidence intervals), as a larger sample size generally leads to narrower confidence intervals, which is reflected by the larger standard error for the 150 mg/day group. However, the correct interpretation is actually the opposite, a larger standard error indicates a wider confidence interval, not narrower.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Lung Function Tests Simple spirometry confirms airflow limitation with a reduced FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, and PEF (Fig. 309-6). Reversibility is demonstrated by a >12% and 200-mL increase in FEV1 15 min after an inhaled short-acting \u03b22-agonist or in some patients by a 2to 4-week trial of oral corticosteroids (OCS) (prednisone or prednisolone 30\u201340 mg daily). Measurements of PEF twice daily may confirm the diurnal variations in airflow obstruction. Flow-volume loops show reduced peak flow and reduced maximum expiratory flow. Further lung function tests are rarely necessary, but whole-body plethysmography shows increased airway resistance and may show increased total lung capacity and residual volume. Gas diffusion is usually normal, but there may be a small increase in gas transfer in some patients."

Sequential measurement of the FEV1 or of the peak expiratoy low rate-PEFR-is the best measure of severity. n FEV1 less than 1 L, or less than 20 percent of predicted value, correlates with severe disease defined by hypoxia, poor response to therapy, and a high relapse rate. The PEFR correlates well with the FEVl, and it can be measured reliably with inexpensive portable meters. It is advantageous for each woman to determine her own baseline when asymptomatic to compare with values when symptomatic. \u2022 Management of Chronic Asthma Asthma management by an experienced team produces the most salutary outcomes (Bonham, 2017; Lim, 2014; Wendel, 1996). Management guidelines include: 1. Patient education-general asthma management and its efect on pregnancy. 2. Environmental precipitating factors-avoidance or control."

            "content": "Deaths from asthma are uncommon, and in many affluent countries have been steadily declining over the last decade. A rise in asthma mortality seen in several countries during the 1960s was associated with increased use of short-acting inhaled \u03b22-adrenergic agonists (as rescue therapy), but there is now compelling evidence that the more widespread use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in patients with persistent asthma is responsible for the decrease in mortality in recent years. Major risk factors for asthma deaths are poorly controlled disease with frequent use of bronchodilator inhalers, lack of or poor compliance with ICS therapy, and previous admissions to hospital with near-fatal asthma. It has proved difficult to agree on a definition of asthma, but there is good agreement on the description of the clinical syndrome and disease pathology. Until the etiologic mechanisms of the disease are better understood, it will be difficult to provide an accurate definition."

            "content": "The challenges of assessing severity and adjusting therapy for these two domains of asthma are different. For relief of distress in the present domain, the key information is obtained by asking specific questions about the frequency and severity of symptoms, the frequency of rescue use of an inhaled \u03b2 agonist, the frequency of nocturnal awakenings, and the ability to exercise, and by measuring lung function with spirometry. The best predictor of the risk for future exacerbations is the frequency and severity of their occurrence in the past. Without such a history, estimation of risk is more difficult. In general, patients with poorly controlled symptoms have a heightened risk of exacerbations in the future, but some patients seem unaware of the severity of their airflow obstruction (sometimes described as \u201cpoor perceivers\u201d) and can be identified only by measurement of pulmonary function. Reductions in the FEV1 correlate with heightened risk of future attacks of asthma. Other possible"

Inhaled glucocorticoids reduce the frequency of exacerbations by 25\u201330% in most analyses. The use of inhaled glucocorticoids should be considered in patients with frequent exacerbations or those who have an asthmatic component, i.e., significant reversibility on pulmonary function testing or marked symptomatic improvement after inhaled bronchodilators. Similar magnitudes of reduction have been reported for anticholinergic and long-acting \u03b2-agonist therapy. The influenza vaccine has been shown to reduce exacerbation rates in patients with COPD. As outlined above, daily azithromycin administered to subjects with COPD and an exacerbation history reduces exacerbation frequency."
