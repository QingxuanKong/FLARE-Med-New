    "question": "A 43-year-old man comes to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and progressive perioral numbness for the past 24 hours. 3 days ago, he underwent a total thyroidectomy for treatment of papillary thyroid cancer. His only medication is a multivitamin supplement. He appears fatigued. While measuring the patient's blood pressure, the nurse observes a spasm in the patient's hand. Physical examination shows a well-healing surgical wound on the neck. Which of the following ECG findings are most likely in this patient?",

The patient is also experiencing fatigue and a spasm in the hand while measuring blood pressure. These symptoms are suggestive of hypocalcemia, which can occur after thyroidectomy due to damage to the parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands are responsible for producing parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates calcium levels in the blood. Damage to these glands can lead to a decrease in PTH production, resulting in hypocalcemia. The patient's symptoms of numbness and muscle spasms are consistent with hypocalcemia. The ECG findings that are most likely in this patient would be related to the effects of hypocalcemia on the heart. Hypocalcemia can cause a prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Diarrhea occurs in 30% of patients and is associated either with elevated circulating concentrations of calcitonin or tumor-related secretion of serotonin and prostaglandins. Some patients may also experience flushing. In addition, ectopic ACTH production by MTC may cause Cushing\u2019s syndrome. The diagnosis of MTC relies on the demonstration of hypercalcitoninemia (>90 pg/mL in the basal state); stimulation tests using IV pentagastrin (0.5 mg/kg) and or calcium infusion (2 mg/kg) are rarely used now, reflecting improvements in the assay for calcitonin. Neck ultrasonography with fine-needle aspiration of the nodules can confirm the diagnosis. Radionucleotide thyroid scans may reveal MTC tumors as \u201ccold\u201d nodules. Radiography may reveal dense irregular calcification within the involved portions of the thyroid gland and in lymph nodes involved with metastases. Positron emission tomography (PET) may help to identify the MTC and metastases (Fig. 408-2)."

He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

These complaints are new since she used to always feel \u201chot,\u201d noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to \u201cprotect her bones\u201d and omeprazole for \u201cheartburn.\u201d On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm.
