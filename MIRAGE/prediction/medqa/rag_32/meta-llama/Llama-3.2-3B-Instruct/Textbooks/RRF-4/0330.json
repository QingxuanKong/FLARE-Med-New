The histology shown in Image A is not described, but given the context, it is likely showing diffuse alveolar damage consistent with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's inability to respond to mechanical ventilation and rapid deterioration suggests a severe and aggressive form of ARDS. Given the patient's recent trauma and multiple fractures, a pulmonary embolism could be a contributing factor, but it is not the most likely cause given the autopsy findings. Diaphragmatic hypertrophy and interstitial edema are not consistent with the severe respiratory distress and autopsy findings. Left apical bronchoalveolar carcinoma would not cause such rapid progression to respiratory insufficiency in a previously healthy individual. The most likely condition present shortly before death is ARDS, which is often preceded by a systemic inflammatory response to the trauma, including the release of inflammatory mediators that can cause vascular permeability and edema in the lungs. The heavy, red lungs on autopsy are consistent with ARDS, which is characterized by non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The patient's inability to respond to mechanical ventilation and rapid progression to death is consistent with severe ARDS, which is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Most patients are older than 40 years. AIP is similar in presentation to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Chap. 322) and probably corresponds to the subset of cases of idiopathic ARDS. The onset is usually abrupt in a previously healthy individual. A prodromal illness, usually lasting 7\u201314 days before presentation, is common. Fever, cough, and dyspnea are common manifestations at presentation. Diffuse, bilateral, air-space opacification is present on the chest radiograph. HRCT scans show bilateral, patchy, symmetric areas of ground-glass attenuation. Bilateral areas of air-space consolidation also may be present. A predominantly subpleural distribution may be seen."

What would be true about the levels of ketone bodies and glucose during periods of physiologic stress in individuals with impaired FA oxidation? Case 4: Hypoglycemia, Hyperketonemia, and Liver Dysfunction Patient Presentation: AK, a 59-year-old male with slurred speech, ataxia (loss of skeletal muscle coordination), and abdominal pain, was dropped off at the Emergency Department (ED). Focused History: AK is known to the ED staff from previous visits. He has a 6year history of chronic, excessive alcohol consumption. He is not known to take illicit drugs. At this ED visit, AK reports that he has been drinking heavily in the past day or so. He cannot recall having eaten anything in that time. There is evidence of recent vomiting, but no blood is apparent."

            "content": "Patients may have a wide spectrum of modes of injury from a simple fall to complex multiple trauma. The age of the patient and ability to communicate about the injuries are important factors. The circumstances in which the injury may have occurred should be documented because some head injuries result from a serious assault, and the physician may be required to give evidence to a court of law. Determining the severity of head injury may be difficult because some injuries occur as a result of or in association with alcohol intoxication. Even when the diagnosis has been made and the correct management has been instigated, the circumstances in which the injury occurred and the environment to which the patient will return after treatment need to be reviewed to prevent further injuries (e.g., an elderly person tripping on loose carpet on a staircase)."

Avian influenza should be considered in patients with severe respiratory tract illness, particularly if they have been exposed to poultry. Patients present with high fever, an influenza-like illness, and lower respiratory tract symptoms; this illness can progress rapidly to bilateral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure, and death. Early antiviral treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors should be initiated along with aggressive supportive measures. Unlike avian influenza, for which human-to-human transmission has been rare so far and has not been sustained, a novel swine-associated influenza A/H1N1 virus has spread rapidly throughout the world. Patients most at risk of severe disease are children <5 years of age, elderly persons, patients with underlying chronic conditions, and pregnant"

A treatment goal for the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) caused by acute bronchitis is to insure appropriate nutrition without increasing the respiratory quotient (RQ), which is the ratio of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced to oxygen consumed, thereby minimizing the production of CO2. Less CO2 is produced from the metabolism of fat (RQ = 0.7) than from the catabolism of carbohydrate (RQ =1.0). Fat contains fewer oxygen atoms. Fat is calorically denser than is carbohydrate. [Note: RQ is determined by indirect calorimetry.] 7.7. A 32-year-old man who was rescued from a house fire was admitted to the hospital with burns over 45% of his body (severe burns). The man weighs 154 lb (70 kg) and is 72 in (183 cm) tall. Which one of the following is the best rapid estimate of the immediate daily caloric needs of this patient?"

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"
