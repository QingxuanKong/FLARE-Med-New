    "question": "A 72-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a 6-month history of shortness of breath. He says that he used to enjoy playing golf with his friends but now he cannot walk for long enough to play. The shortness of breath is now starting to complicate his ability to get around in daily life. His past medical history is significant for diabetes, hypertension, and early stage prostate cancer that was removed 10 years ago without recurrence. He has smoked 1 pack per day for the past 55 years and drinks about 6 drinks per week. On presentation he is found to be breathing with pursed lips. Physical exam reveals decreased breath sounds on auscultation, increased chest diameter, and hyperresonance to percussion. Which of the following findings would most likely be seen in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Decreased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume",
        "B": "Decreased residual volume and increased 1 second forced expiratory volume",
        "C": "Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume",
        "D": "Normal residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's analyze the symptoms and physical examination findings presented in the scenario. The patient is a 72-year-old man with a 6-month history of shortness of breath, which has progressed to the point where he can no longer walk for long periods. He has a history of smoking (1 pack per day for 55 years) and hypertension. On physical examination, he is found to be breathing with pursed lips, has decreased breath sounds on auscultation, increased chest diameter, and hyperresonance to percussion. These findings suggest that the patient likely has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The pursed-lip breathing pattern is a common finding in patients with COPD, as it helps to increase lung volume and improve gas exchange. The decreased breath sounds on auscultation and hyperresonance to percussion also support this diagnosis. In COPD, the lung volumes are typically affected, leading to decreased lung function. The residual volume (RV) is increased in COPD, as the lungs are overinflated, and the patient is unable to fully deflate them. The forced expiratory volume (FEV1) is also decreased, as the patient has difficulty exhaling air from the lungs. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume. Here is the step-by-step thinking in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The pursed-lip breathing pattern, decreased breath sounds on auscultation, and hyperresonance to percussion are all characteristic findings in COPD. The increased residual volume and decreased forced expiratory volume are consistent with the pathophysiology of COPD. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

            "content": "Chronic severe AR may have a long latent period, and patients may remain relatively asymptomatic for as long as 10\u201315 years. However, uncomfortable awareness of the heartbeat, especially on lying down, may be an early complaint. Sinus tachycardia, during exertion or with emotion, or premature ventricular contractions may produce particularly uncomfortable palpitations as well as head pounding. These complaints may persist for many years before the development of exertional dyspnea, usually the first symptom of diminished cardiac reserve. The dyspnea is followed by orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and excessive diaphoresis. Anginal chest pain even in the absence of CAD may occur in patients with severe AR, even in younger patients. Anginal pain may develop at rest as well as during exertion. Nocturnal angina may be a particularly troublesome symptom, and it may be accompanied by marked diaphoresis. The anginal episodes can be prolonged and often do not respond satisfactorily to"

After admission a bronchoscopy was carried out and sputum was aspirated from the left upper lobe bronchus. This was cultured in the laboratory and also viewed under the microscope and tuberculous bacilli (TB) were identified. A 68-year-old man came to his family physician complaining of discomfort when swallowing (dysphagia). The physician examined the patient and noted since his last visit he had lost approximately 18 lb over 6 months. Routine blood tests revealed the patient was anemic and he was referred to the gastroenterology unit. A diagnosis of esophageal cancer was made and the patient underwent a resection, which involved a chest and abdominal incision. After 4 years the patient remains well though still subject to follow-up."

He has hypertension, and during the last 8 years, he has been adequately managed with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH\u2019s problem? What information would you gather to confirm your diagnosis? What treatment steps would you initiate?"

Patients may also develop resting hypoxemia and require institution of supplemental oxygen. In the early stages of COPD, patients usually have an entirely normal physical examination. Current smokers may have signs of active smoking, including an odor of smoke or nicotine staining of fingernails. In patients with more severe disease, the physical examination is notable for a prolonged expiratory phase and may include expiratory wheezing. In addition, signs of hyperinflation include a barrel chest and enlarged lung volumes with poor diaphragmatic excursion as assessed by percussion. Patients with severe airflow obstruction may also exhibit use of accessory muscles of respiration, sitting in the characteristic \u201ctripod\u201d position to facilitate the actions of the sternocleidomastoid, scalene, and intercostal muscles. Patients may develop cyanosis, visible in the lips and nail beds."

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

A 50-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with severe lower back pain that had started several days ago. In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."
