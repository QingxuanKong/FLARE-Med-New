    "question": "A 16-year-old girl comes to the emergency department because of left wrist pain and swelling for 5 hours. She fell on an outstretched hand while playing basketball. She ignored it initially as she thought it was just a bruise, but the pain and swelling worsened throughout the day. The analgesic spray she used did not provide adequate relief. There is no family history of serious illness. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive pill. Her immunizations are up-to-date. She appears anxious. Her temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg. Examination shows a swollen and tender left wrist; range of motion is limited. The anatomical snuffbox is tender to palpation. The grip strength of the left hand is decreased. The thumb can be opposed towards the other fingers. Finkelstein's test is negative. X-rays of the wrist shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?",

        "A": "Corticosteroid injections",
        "B": "Thumb spica cast and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate next step in management, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and examination findings. The patient is a 16-year-old girl with left wrist pain and swelling after a fall, and the pain and swelling worsened over time. The Finkelstein's test is negative, which suggests that De Quervain's tenosynovitis is less likely. The anatomical snuffbox is tender to palpation, which is a common finding in De Quervain's tenosynovitis. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings are more consistent with a scaphoid fracture, especially with the limited range of motion and decreased grip strength of the left hand. The X-rays show no abnormalities, which is consistent with a scaphoid fracture. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to immobilize the wrist and repeat X-rays in 2 weeks to check for healing. Corticosteroid injections and thumb spica cast are not indicated as they are not the first line of treatment for scaphoid fractures. Rest, ice, and repeat X-rays in 2 weeks are not sufficient as the patient's symptoms are worsening. Percutaneous pinning is not necessary as the patient does not have a significantly displaced fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

            "content": "A detailed history is very diagnostic but the use of a couple simple tests can help to confirm it (63). The most common one is the Phalen maneuver, in which the patient \ufb02exes her palms at the wrist as close to 90 degrees as possible. Then with the dorsal portion of the hands touching and the arms parallel to the \ufb02oor, the patient presses the \ufb02exed hands against each other for approximately 1 minute. This should reproduce her symptoms along the median nerve. The Tinel test involves percussion over the top of the carpal tunnel where the median nerve travels. A positive test is when the percussion reproduces the pain and paresthesia. Additional testing such as nerve conduction studies should be reserved for patients who do not respond to conservative management or have significant muscle weakness."

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

The examiner\u2019s right or left hand, depending on his or her preference, is gloved. The pelvic area is illuminated well, and the examiner faces the patient. The following order of procedure is suggested for the pelvic examination: A. External genitalia 1. Inspect the mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, perineal body, and anal region for characteristics of the skin, distribution of the hair, contour, and swelling. Palpate any abnormality. 2. Separate the labia majora with the index and middle fingers of the gloved hand and inspect the epidermal and mucosal characteristics and anatomic configuration of the following structures in the order indicated below: a. b. c. d. e. f. g. 3."

Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"
