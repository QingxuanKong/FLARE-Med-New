    "question": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother after falling from the jungle gym and developing severe left knee pain and swelling. On presentation, he is found to be in pain with a hot, swollen, erythematous left knee. His past medical history is significant for abnormal coagulation lab tests before an appendectomy, but his mother cannot recall the exact details. Coagulation tests are conducted with the following results:\n\nBleeding time: 3 minutes\nProthrombin time: 11 seconds\nPartial thromboplastin time: 53 seconds\nBradykinin formation: decreased\n\nWhich of the following factors is most likely defective in this patient?",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which factor is most likely defective in this patient, we need to analyze the coagulation test results provided: \\nBleeding time: 3 minutes (normal range: 2-7 minutes) \\nProthrombin time (PT): 11 seconds (normal range: 10-14 seconds) \\nPartial thromboplastin time (aPTT): 53 seconds (normal range: 25-35 seconds) \\nBradykinin formation: decreased (normal range: normal)\\nThese results indicate that the patient's coagulation pathway is mostly intact, as PT and aPTT are within normal ranges. However, the prolonged aPTT suggests an issue with the intrinsic pathway, which involves factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, X, V, and II. The decreased bradykinin formation is also indicative of a problem with the kallikrein-kinin system, which is closely related to the intrinsic pathway.\\nConsidering the patient's symptoms of severe left knee pain and swelling after a fall, a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a strong possibility. DVT is often associated with abnormalities in the intrinsic coagulation pathway, particularly factor XII deficiency. Factor XII plays a crucial role in the initiation of the intrinsic coagulation cascade, and its deficiency can lead to a prolonged aPTT. Given the patient's history of abnormal coagulation lab tests before an appendectomy and the presence of DVT symptoms, factor XII deficiency is the most likely cause of the patient's condition.\\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. Factor XII.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP).

Preoperative laboratory screening for coagulation deficiencies is controversial. Routine screening is not warranted in patients who do not have historical evidence of a bleeding problem (233).

The origin of the pain relates to ureteral distention. A series of peristaltic waves along the ureter transport urine along the length of the ureter from the kidney to the bladder. As the ureteric stone obstructs the kidney, the ureter becomes distended, resulting in an exacerbation of the pain.

            "content": "scored by 1 point for each of the following: migration of pain to the right lower quadrant, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, rebound pain, temperature of at least 37.3\u00b0C, and WBC shift to greater than 75% neutrophils; 2 points are given for each of tenderness in the right lower quadrant and leukocytosis greater than 10,000/\u03bcL. Children with a score of 4 or less are unlikely to have appendicitis; a score of 7 or greater increases the likelihood that the patient has appendicitis. When classic history and physical examination findings are present, the patient is taken to the operating room. When doubt exists, imaging is helpful to rule out complications (right lower quadrant abscess, liver disease) and other disorders, such as mesenteric adenitis and ovarian or fallopian tube disorders. If the evaluation is negative and some doubt remains, the child should be admitted to the hospital for close observation and serial examinations."

            "content": "Similar consideration should be given in determining the need, if any, to test the patient and family members for thrombophilias. Careful history taking and clinical examination are essential components in the assessment of bleeding and thrombotic risk. The use of laboratory tests of coagulation complement, but cannot substitute for, clinical assessment. No test exists that provides a global assessment of hemostasis. The bleeding time has been used to assess bleeding risk; however, it does not predict bleeding risk with surgery and it is not recommended for this indication. The PFA-100, an instrument that measures platelet-dependent coagulation under flow conditions, is more sensitive and specific for VWD than the bleeding time; however, it is not sensitive enough to rule out mild bleeding disorders. PFA-100 closure times are prolonged in patients with some, but not all, inherited platelet disorders. Also, its utility in predicting bleeding risk has not been determined."

            "content": "Available @ StudentConsult.com Osgood-Schlatter disease is a common cause of knee pain at the insertion of the patellar tendon on the tibial tubercle. The stress from a contracting quadriceps muscle is transmitted through the developing tibial tubercle, which can cause a microfracture or partial avulsion fracture in the ossification center. It usually occurs after a growth spurt and is more common in boys. The age at onset is typically 11 years for girls and 13 to 14 years for boys. Patients will present with pain during and after activity as well as have tenderness and local swelling over the tibial tubercle. Radiographs may be necessary to rule out infection, tumor, or avulsion fracture."

            "content": "Screening Assays The most commonly used screening tests are the PT, aPTT, and platelet count. The PT assesses the factors I (fibrinogen), II (prothrombin), V, VII, and X (Fig. 78-6). The PT measures the time for clot formation of the citrated plasma after recalcification and addition of thromboplastin, a mixture of TF and phospholipids. The sensitivity of the assay varies by the source of thromboplastin. The relationship between defects in secondary hemostasis (fibrin formation) and coagulation test abnormalities is shown in Table 78-4. To adjust for this variability, the overall sensitivity of different thromboplastins to reduction of the vitamin K\u2013dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X in anticoagulation patients is now expressed as the International Sensitivity Index (ISI). An inverse relationship exists between ISI and thromboplastin sensitivity. The international normalized ratio (INR) is then determined based on the formula: INR = (PTpatient/PT )ISI."
