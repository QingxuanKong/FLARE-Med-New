The presence of fever with neutropenia, even in the absence of other signs or symptoms, demands prompt evaluation because of the potential for life-threatening infection. Despite being immunocompromised, these patients develop fever and some typical signs and symptoms associated with infections. All symptoms and signs should be evaluated thoroughly. However, some symptoms may be absent based on the underlying immunodeficiency. For example, in the absence of neutrophils to contain and induce localized signs of inflammation, determination of the source of infection by physical examination is often difficult. Chest findings may be absent, despite pneumonia, and revealed only by chest radiograph at presentation or when the neutrophil count recovers."

Asplenia is associated with recurrent and severe infections, even in the presence of protective antibody titers. Infection with HIV should be considered in any patient presenting with a history suggesting a T-cell immunodeficiency. The diagnosis of patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases depends on early recognition of signs and symptoms, followed by laboratory tests to evaluate immune function.

Because the phagocytes of these patients have defective phagolysosomal fusion, the patients experience defective killing of intracellular and extracellular pathogens in addition to defective cytolytic activity of CTLs and NK cells. Affected children therefore suffer early in life from severe, recurrent infections by a range of bacteria and fungi. This is typically followed by development of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, often triggered by viral infection such as EBV, leading to an accelerated phase of the disease.

            "content": "Ch\u00e9diak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare disease with autosomal recessive inheritance due to defects in the lysosomal transport protein LYST, encoded by the gene CHS1 at 1q42. This protein is required for normal packaging and disbursement of granules. Neutrophils (and all cells containing lysosomes) from patients with CHS characteristically have large granules (Fig. 80-9), making it a systemic disease. Patients with CHS have nystagmus, partial oculocutaneous albinism, and an increased number of infections resulting from many bacterial agents. Some CHS patients develop an \u201caccelerated phase\u201d in childhood with a hemophagocytic syndrome and an aggressive lymphoma requiring bone marrow transplantation. CHS neutrophils and monocytes have impaired chemotaxis and abnormal rates of microbial killing due to slow rates of fusion of the lysosomal granules with phagosomes. NK cell function is also impaired. CHS patients may develop a severe disabling peripheral neuropathy in adulthood that can"

            "content": "A complete blood count is frequently obtained for evidence of infection. The initial response to infection, especially in children, is usually a leukocytosis (increased number of circulating leukocytes) with an initial neutrophilic response to both bacterial and viral infections. With most viral infections, this response is transient and is followed quickly by a characteristic mononuclear response. In general, bacterial infections are associated with greater neutrophil counts than viral infections (Table 93-3). A shift-to-the-left is an increase in the numbers of circulating immature cells of the neutrophil series, including band forms, metamyelocytes, and myelocytes and indicates the rapid release of cells from the bone marrow. It is characteristic of the early stages of infection and, if sustained, bacterial infections. Transient lymphopenia at the beginning of illness and lasting 24 to 48 hours has been described with many viral infections. Atypical lymphocytes are mature T"

Kronman and Sherilyn Smith 16 Overlapping clinical symptoms caused by infectious and noninfectious illnesses make the diagnosis of some diseases difficult. Clinicians are concerned that an untreated minor infection may progress to a life-threatening illness, if appropriate treatment is not given. However unnecessary treatment with antimicrobial agents may lead to a serious problem\u2014emergence of antimicrobial resistant organisms. Accurate diagnosis of infectious and noninfectious diseases and providing specific treatment only as indicated reduce the unnecessaryuse of antibiotics. A thorough assessment of the patient, including a detailed history, complete physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic testing is the cornerstone of optimal care."

Vacuolated neutrophils may be a sign of bacterial sepsis. The presence of 1to 2-\u03bcm blue cytoplasmic inclusions, called Dle bodies, can reflect infections, burns, or other inflammatory states. If the neutrophil granules are larger than normal and stain a darker blue, \u201ctoxic granulations\u201d are said to be present, and they also suggest a systemic inflammation. The presence of neutrophils with more than five nuclear lobes suggests megaloblastic anemia. Large misshapen granules may reflect the inherited Ch\u00e9diak-Higashi syndrome. Eosinophils are slightly larger than neutrophils, have bilobed nuclei, and contain large red granules. Diseases of eosinophils are associated with too many of them rather than any morphologic or qualitative change. They normally total less than one-thirtieth the number of neutrophils. Basophils are even rarer than eosinophils in the"
