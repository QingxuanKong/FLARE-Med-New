He had a similar episode 1 year ago around springtime. He has iron deficiency anemia and ankylosing spondylitis. Current medications include ferrous sulfate, artificial tear drops, and indomethacin. He works as an elementary school teacher. His vital signs are within normal limits. Visual acuity is 20/20 without correction. Physical examination shows bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge. The pupils are 3 mm, equal, and reactive to light. Examination of the anterior chamber of the eye is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with itchy, watery eyes and sneezing, which suggests an allergic reaction. The patient's symptoms are similar to those experienced during a similar episode 1 year ago around springtime, which is a common time for allergic reactions to occur. The patient's iron deficiency anemia and ankylosing spondylitis are also relevant to consider, but they are not directly related to the current symptoms. The patient's current medications, including ferrous sulfate, artificial tear drops, and indomethacin, do not appear to be contributing to the symptoms. The patient's physical examination shows bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge, which is consistent with an allergic reaction. The pupils are 3 mm, equal, and reactive to light, which suggests that the patient's autonomic nervous system is intact. The examination of the anterior chamber of the eye is unremarkable, which suggests that there is no significant inflammation or infection in the eye. Based on the symptoms and physical examination, the most appropriate treatment would be to use a medication that can effectively reduce itching and inflammation in the eyes. Ketotifen eye drops are a commonly used medication for allergic conjunctivitis and would be an appropriate choice in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Discomfort can be relieved with artificial tears (e.g., 1% methylcellulose), eye ointment, and the use of dark glasses with side frames.

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."

She is feeling well overall but reports a 25-pack-year smoking history. She drinks 3\u20134 beers per week and has no known medication allergies. She has a history of heroin use and is currently receiving methadone. Physical examination reveals normal vital signs and no abnormalities. White blood cell count is 5800 cells/mm3 with a normal differential, hemoglobin is 11.8 g/dL, all liver tests are within normal limits, CD4 cell count is 278 cells/mm3, and viral load (HIV RNA) is 110,000 copies/mL. What other laboratory tests should be ordered? Which antiretroviral medica-tions would you begin?"

Case 3: Blood on the Toothbrush Patient Presentation: LT is an 84-year-old man whose gums have been bleeding for several months. Focused History: LT is a widower and lives alone in a suburban community on the East Coast. He no longer drives. His two children live on the West Coast and come east infrequently. Since the death of his wife 11 months ago, he has been isolated and finds it hard to get out of the house. His appetite has changed, and he is content with cereal, coffee, and packaged snacks. Chewing is difficult."

The small branch of the middle meningeal artery was ligated and the patient spent a few days in the intensive care unit. Fortunately the patient made an uneventful recovery. A 35-year-old man was involved in a fight and sustained a punch to the right orbit. He came to the emergency department with double vision. The double vision was only in one plane. Examination of the orbits revealed that when the patient was asked to look upward the right eye was unable to move superiorly when adducted. There was some limitation in general eye movement. Assessment of the lateral rectus muscle (abducent nerve [VI]), superior oblique muscle (trochlear nerve [IV]), and the rest of the eye muscles (oculomotor nerve [III]) was otherwise unremarkable. The patient underwent a CT scan."

Focused History: AK is known to the ED staff from previous visits. He has a 6year history of chronic, excessive alcohol consumption. He is not known to take illicit drugs. At this ED visit, AK reports that he has been drinking heavily in the past day or so. He cannot recall having eaten anything in that time. There is evidence of recent vomiting, but no blood is apparent."

Visual acuity has been estimated to be 20/200 in newborns and 20/20 in6-month-old infants. Standard visual charts displaying picturesinstead of letters can be used to assess visual acuity in toddlers.Peripheral vision is tested by surreptitiously bringing objectsinto the visual field from behind. A reduced pupillary reactionto light suggests anterior visual pathway lesions, including theretina, optic nerves, and chiasm. Unilateral optic nerve lesionsare identified by the swinging flashlight test. With an optic nerveabnormality, both pupils constrict when light is directed into thenormal eye. When light is swung over to the abnormal eye, bothpupils dilate inappropriately; this is called an afferent pupillary defect or Marcus Gunn pupil. Interruption of the sympatheticinnervation to the pupil produces Horner\u2019s syndrome (ptosis,miosis, and unilateral facial anhidrosis). In"

Physical examination findings include chemosis, injection of the conjunctiva, and edema of the eyelids. Corneal involvement suggests gonococcal or herpetic infection. Herpetic corneal lesions appear as dendritic or ameboid ulcers or, more commonly, in recurrent infection, as a deep keratitis. Unilateral conjunctivitis with ipsilateral otitis media is often caused by nontypable H. influenzae. The timing and manifestations of neonatal conjunctivitis are helpful in identifying the cause (Table 119-2). N. gonorrhoeaecauses severe conjunctivitis with profuse purulent discharge. Chlamydial conjunctivitis usually occurs in the second week of life but may appear 3 days to 6 weeks after delivery. There is mild to moderate inflammation with purulent discharge issuing from one or both eyes."
