The patient has worsening gait unsteadiness, bilateral hearing loss, and intermittent tingling sensations on both cheeks. The genetic evaluation shows a mutation of a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 that encodes merlin. This mutation is associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), a genetic disorder that increases the risk of developing certain types of tumors. The options provided are renal cell carcinoma, meningioma, astrocytoma, and vascular malformations. We need to determine which of these conditions is most closely associated with NF2. According to the provided documents, NF2 is characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas, multiple meningiomas, and spinal ependymomas and astrocytomas. Meningiomas are a type of tumor that occurs in the meninges, the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.

            "content": "Cause and pathogenesis The hereditary nature of NF has been appreciated for a century. More recently, it has been established that NF comprises two distinct disorders, the genes for which are located on different chromosomes. Both are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with a high degree of penetrance, but half the cases are a result of spontaneous mutations. The classic form of the disease with multiple neurofibromas, described below, is caused by a mutation located near the centromere on chromosome 17 in a gene called neurofibromin (Barker et al). The second type, in which the main feature is bilateral acoustic nerve neuromas, described further on, is caused by a mutation in the merlin gene (also called schwannomin). These two forms of NF have been loosely referred to as peripheral and central, respectively, but the terms neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) are less confusing (Martuza and Eldridge) and are used in the following discussion."

            "content": "The most frequent acquired genetic defects of meningiomas are truncating (inactivating) mutations in the neurofibromatosis 2 gene (merlin) on chromosome 22q. These are present in the great majority of certain meningiomas (e.g., fibroblastic and transitional types), but not others. Merlin deletions probably also play a role in those instances in which there is a loss of the long arm of chromosome 22. In meningiomas of both the sporadic and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)\u2013associated types, other somatic genetic defects are found, including deletions on chromosomes 1p, 6q, 9p, 10q, 14q, and 18q."

            "content": "Difficulty walking with a severe staggering gait is one manifestation of acute labrynthitis, but the diagnosis usually is clarified by the associated symptoms of a severe sense of spinning dizziness (vertigo), nausea and vomiting, and associated signs of pallor, sweating, and nystagmus. Ataxia-telangiectasia, an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, is the most common of the degenerative ataxias. Affected patients present with ataxia around age 2 years, progressing to loss of ambulation by adolescence. In mid-childhood, telangiectasia is evident over the sclerae, nose, ears, and extremities. Abnormalities in immune function and greatly increased risk of lymphoreticular tumors result in early death."

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

            "content": "The choice of ancillary tests should be guided by the history and examination findings. Audiometry should be performed whenever a vestibular disorder is suspected. Unilateral sensorineural hearing loss supports a peripheral disorder (e.g., vestibular schwannoma). Predominantly low-frequency hearing loss is characteristic of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease. Electronystagmography or videonystagmography includes recordings of spontaneous nystagmus (if present) and measurement of positional nystagmus. Caloric testing assesses the responses of the two horizontal semicircular canals. The test battery often includes recording of saccades and pursuit to assess central ocular motor function. Neuroimaging is important if a central vestibular disorder is suspected. In addition, patients with unexplained unilateral hearing loss or vestibular hypofunction should undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the internal auditory canals, including administration of gadolinium, to rule out a schwannoma."
