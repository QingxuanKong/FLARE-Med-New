He has acute myeloid leukemia and is currently receiving chemotherapy. On arrival, his temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 63/min, respirations are 10/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. The pupils are equal and sluggish. There are multiple bruises over the face, trunk, and right upper and lower extremities. There is a 4-cm (1.6-in) laceration over his right cheek. He does not respond to any commands, but does groan. Painful stimuli cause him to open his eyes and withdraw all extremities. There are decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. There is tenderness to palpation over the left chest wall. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and shows diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. There is swelling of the right elbow and wrist. The right lower extremity is shorter than the left lower extremity. There are 2 lacerations around 2 cm (0.8 in) each on the right leg. The right knee is swollen.

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thought process for the given question: 1. The patient is a 36-year-old man involved in a high-speed motor-vehicle collision as an unrestrained passenger. He has acute myeloid leukemia and is receiving chemotherapy. His vital signs indicate hypotension (100/70 mmHg), bradypnea (10/min), and decreased level of consciousness (unresponsive to commands but responds to painful stimuli). 2. The patient has multiple bruises over the face, trunk, and right upper and lower extremities, indicating possible blunt trauma. The presence of a 4-cm laceration over his right cheek and swelling of the right elbow and wrist suggest potential injuries to the head and neck. 3. The decreased breath sounds over the right lung base and tenderness to palpation over the left chest wall suggest the possibility of a thoracic injury, potentially a pneumothorax or hemothorax. 4. The patient's swelling of the right elbow and wrist, as well as the shortening of the right lower extremity, may indicate a possible fracture or dislocation. 5. Given the patient's unstable condition, his multiple injuries, and the presence of possible thoracic injuries, the most critical step is to ensure his airway is secure and his oxygenation is maintained. 6. Intubation and mechanical ventilation are essential to secure the patient's airway and provide adequate oxygenation, especially considering his decreased level of consciousness and potential respiratory compromise. 7. While imaging studies like CT scans of the head and neck (option B) and X-rays of the extremities (option C) may be necessary for further evaluation, they should not take precedence over securing the patient's airway. 8. Insertion of an intercostal chest tube (option A) may be necessary if a pneumothorax or hemothorax is confirmed, but it is not the immediate next step. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to intubate and mechanically ventilate the patient to secure his airway and ensure adequate oxygenation. Here is the final answer in the required format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is in a critical condition with multiple injuries, including possible thoracic injuries and decreased level of consciousness. The most critical step is to secure his airway and provide adequate oxygenation. Intubation and mechanical ventilation are essential to address this critical issue. Other imaging studies can be done later once the patient is stabilized.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

On follow-up the patient had no complications. A 25-year-old man complained of significant swelling in front of his right ear before and around mealtimes. This swelling was associated with considerable pain, which was provoked by the ingestion of lemon sweets. On examination he had tenderness around the right parotid region and a hard nodule was demonstrated in the buccal mucosa adjacent to the right upper molar teeth. A diagnosis of parotid duct calculus was made."

His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen.

Further examination of his left eye reveals rupture of his globe. The ophthalmolo-gist requests emergency surgery to repair and save his eye. Because the patient has suffered a recent trauma, you decide to perform a rapid sequence intubation in preparation for the surgical procedure.

The first heart sound is normal, whereas the second heart sound may not be split in the first day of life. Decreased splitting of the second heart sound is noted in PPHN, transposition of the great vessels, and pulmonary atresia. Heart murmurs in newborns are common in the delivery room and during the first day of life. Most of these murmurs are transient and are due to closure of the ductus arteriosus, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, or a small ventral septal defect. Pulses should be palpated in the upper and lower extremities (over the brachial and femoral arteries). Blood pressure in the upper and lower extremities should be measured in all patients with a murmur or heart failure. An upperto-lower extremity gradient of more than 10 to 20 mm Hg suggests coarctation of the aorta."

Maxillofacial injuries are common with multisystem trauma and require coordinated management by the trauma surgeon and the specialists in otolaryngology, plastic surgery, ophthalmology, and oral and maxillofacial surgery. Delay in addressing these systems that control vision, hearing, smelling, breathing, eating, and phonation may pro-duce dysfunction and disfigurement with serious psychological impact.
