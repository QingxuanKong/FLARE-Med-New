The researchers retrospectively surveyed 200 mothers with children diagnosed with ASD during the first 4 years of life and 200 mothers with healthy children. All participants were interviewed about their prenatal consumption of folic acid using standardized questionnaires. A 94% response rate was obtained from the surveys. The study ultimately found that folic acid supplementation was associated with lower rates of ASD in offspring (OR = 0.3, p < 0.01).

Folic acid supplementation with 0.4 mg per day is begun at least 1 month before conception. The dose is increased to 4 mg when the woman taking antiepileptic medication becomes pregnant. hese medications are assessed and adjusted with a goal of mono therapy using the least teratogenic medication. If this is not feasible, then attempts are made to reduce the number of medications used and to use them at the lowest efective dose (Patel, 2016). Medication withdrawal should be considered if a woman is seizure free for 2 years or more."

            "content": "Because the human brain can only be examined indirectly during life, genome analyses have been extremely important for obtaining molecular clues about the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. A wealth of new information has been made possible by recent technological developments that have permitted affordable, large-scale genome-wide association studies and fine-scale sequencing. As an example, significant progress has been made in the genetics of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), which are a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental diseases that share clinical features of impaired reciprocal social communication and interaction and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior. ASDs are highly heritable; concordance rates in monozygotic twins (~60\u201390%) are roughly 10-fold higher than in dizygotic twins and siblings, whereas first-degree relatives show about 50-fold increased risk compared with the general population. ASDs are also genetically heterogeneous. More than 100 known"

As emphasized by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017), this dose should be consumed as a separate supplement and not as multivitamin tablets. This practice avoids excessive intake of fat-soluble vitamins."
