    "question": "An 8-week-old male presents with his mother to the pediatrician for a well visit. The patient has been breastfed since birth, and usually feeds for 30 minutes every 2-3 hours. The patient\u2019s mother is concerned that her milk production is not keeping up with the patient\u2019s nutritional requirements. She reports that about two weeks ago the patient began regurgitating breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds. She reports that he seems mildly upset during the episodes of regurgitation but usually settles down quickly and is hungry again soon afterwards. The patient\u2019s mother has already tried limiting the volume of each feed, which seems to have reduced the frequency of the regurgitation. She denies any diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies. Her older son had a similar problem with vomiting that resolved around 12 months of age. Four weeks ago, the patient\u2019s height and weight were in the 40th and 34th percentiles, respectively. His height and weight are now respectively in the 37th and 36th percentiles. On physical exam, the patient is cooing in his mother\u2019s lap and smiles reciprocally with her. He lifts his head and shoulders off the examination table when placed in the supine position. His abdomen is soft, non-tender and non-distended. Bowel sounds are normoactive.\n\nWhich of the following is the best next step in management?",

The patient is otherwise healthy, breastfed, and feeding well, with no signs of diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies. The regurgitation seems to be associated with feeding, but the patient settles down quickly and is hungry again soon after. The patient's height and weight have decreased slightly, but still within normal percentiles. The physical exam is unremarkable, with no signs of abdominal distension or tenderness. The mother's concerns about milk production not keeping up with the patient's nutritional requirements are also noted. The key points to consider are the age of the patient, the nature of the regurgitation, and the fact that the mother has a history of a similar issue with her older son that resolved by 12 months of age. This suggests that the regurgitation may be physiologic in nature, as seen in infants under 8-12 months old. The mother's efforts to limit the volume of each feed have already shown some reduction in the frequency of regurgitation. Therefore, reassurance and counseling on positioning and feeding techniques may be the most appropriate next step, as these are common strategies to help manage physiologic regurgitation in infants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

They may give the impression of gaining satisfaction from the activity. They may be irritable and hungry between episodes of regurgitation. Weight loss and failure to make expected weight gains are common features in infants with rumination disorder. Malnutrition may occur despite the infant\u2019s apparent hunger and the ingestion of relatively large amounts of food, particularly in severe cases, when regurgitation immediately follows each feeding episode and regurgitated food is expelled. Malnutrition might also occur in older children and adults, particularly when the regurgitation is accompanied by restriction of intake."

He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

Because infant vomiting is so common, it is important to differentiate between normal and abnormal vomit-ing, which may be indicative of a potentially serious underlying disorder. In order to determine the seriousness of a particular infant\u2019s bouts of emesis, one needs to characterize what the vomit looks like and how sick the baby is. Vomit that looks like feeds and comes up immediately after a feeding is almost always gastroesophageal reflux. This may or may not be of concern, as described earlier. Vomiting that occurs a short while after feed-ing, or vomiting that projects out of the baby\u2019s mouth may be indicative of pyloric stenosis. By contrast, vomit that has any green color in it is always worrisome. This may be reflective of intestinal volvulus, an underlying infection, or some other cause of intestinal obstruction. A more detailed description of the management of these conditions is provided in the follow-ing"

A 22-year-old woman presents to her college medical clinic complaining of a 2-week history of vaginal discharge. She denies any fever or abdominal pain but does report vaginal bleeding after sexual intercourse. When questioned about her sexual activity, she reports having vaginal intercourse, at times unprotected, with two men in the last 6 months. A pelvic examination is performed and is positive for muco-purulent discharge from the endocervical canal. No cervical"

Classically thefemoral pulses are weaker and delayed compared with theright radial pulse. The blood pressure in the lower extremities is lower than that in the upper extremities. If cardiac function is poor, however, these differences may not be asapparent until appropriate resuscitation is accomplished. Inthis situation, there may be no murmur, but an S3 is often present."

The vomiting often occurs after a meal, leaving the patient hungry and ready to eat again; it may be induced by unpleasant circumstances. Some of these patients can vomit at will, regurgitating food from the stomach like a ruminant animal. Vomiting may persist for weeks with no cause being found. Weight loss may occur, but seldom to the degree anticipated. As remarked earlier, the usual first-trimester vomiting of pregnancy may continue throughout the entire 9 months, and occasionally pregnancy will be interrupted because of it. Anorexia may be a prominent associated symptom and must be differentiated from anorexia nervosa\u2013bulimia, another closely related disease of young women. Factitious elf-induced vomiting is more aligned with malingering, with which hysteria may be allied."

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid.
