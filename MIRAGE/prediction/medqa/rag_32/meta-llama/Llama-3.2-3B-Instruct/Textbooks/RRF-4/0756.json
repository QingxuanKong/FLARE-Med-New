    "question": "An otherwise healthy 29-year-old man presents to his family physician with a slowly growing left neck mass for the past 5 weeks. He denies fever or recent upper respiratory tract infections. His temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.7\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 115/72 mm Hg, and the pulse are 82/min. On examination, a 4-cm (1.5 in), firm, non-tender mass is detected on the mid-left neck. Excisional biopsy of the mass reveals Hodgkin\u2019s cells. The patient is referred to the oncology department and chemotherapy is started. After the first cycle of chemotherapy, the patient notices that his urine becomes red. The urine tests are positive for blood on further analysis. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient condition?",

The urine tests are positive for blood. The question is to determine the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s condition. The options provided are bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide. All these drugs are used in the treatment of Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, but they have different side effects. Bleomycin can cause hemoptysis, cyclophosphamide can cause hemorrhagic cystitis, doxorubicin can cause cardiotoxicity, and etoposide can cause myelosuppression. The patient\u2019s urine becoming red and positive for blood is most likely due to hemorrhagic cystitis, which is a common side effect of cyclophosphamide. This condition occurs when the bladder lining is irritated, leading to bleeding and blood in the urine. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s condition is cyclophosphamide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The mass was not tender and the physician was not able to \u201cget above it.\u201d The testes were felt separate from the mass, and a transillumination test (in which a bright light is placed behind the scrotum and the scrotal sac is viewed from the front) was negative.

However, Hodgkin\u2019s disease is not more common in pregnant than nonpregnant women. Hodgkin\u2019s disease is diagnosed in approximately 1 in 6000 pregnancies. It generally presents as a nontender lymph node swelling, most often in the left supraclavicular region. It may be accompanied by B symptoms (fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss). Excisional biopsy is the preferred diagnostic procedure because fine-needle aspiration cannot reveal the architectural framework that is an essential component of Hodgkin\u2019s disease diagnosis. The stage at presentation appears to be unaffected by pregnancy. Women diagnosed in the second and third trimester can be treated safely with combination chemotherapy, usually doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD).

            "content": "The indications for lymph node biopsy are imprecise, yet it is a valuable diagnostic tool. The decision to biopsy may be made early in a patient\u2019s evaluation or delayed for up to 2 weeks. Prompt biopsy should occur if the patient\u2019s history and physical findings suggest a malignancy; examples include a solitary, hard, nontender cervical node in an older patient who is a chronic user of tobacco; supraclavicular adenopathy; and solitary or generalized adenopathy that is firm, movable, and suggestive of lymphoma. If a primary head and neck cancer is suspected as the basis of a solitary, hard cervical node, then a careful ENT examination should be performed. Any mucosal lesion that is suspicious for a primary neoplastic process should be biopsied first. If no mucosal lesion is detected, an excisional biopsy of the largest node should be performed. Fine-needle aspiration should not be performed as the first diagnostic procedure. Most diagnoses require more tissue than such aspiration can"

The mass in the patient\u2019s pelvis compressed this nerve, producing his sensory and motor dysfunction. During surgery, the mass was found to be a benign nerve tumor and was excised. This patient had no long-standing neurological deficit. A 65-year-old man was examined by a surgical intern because he had a history of buttock pain and impotence. On examination he had a reduced peripheral pulse on the left foot compared to the right. On direct questioning, the patient revealed that he experienced severe left-sided buttock pain after walking 100 yards. After a short period of rest, he could walk another 100 yards before the same symptoms recurred. He also noticed that over the past year he was unable to obtain an erection. He smoked heavily and was on no other drugs or treatment."

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

The tumor embolus passed through the right atrium and right ventricle and occluded the pulmonary artery. This could not be cleared at the time of surgery, and the patient succumbed. A 65-year-old businessman came to the emergency department with severe lower abdominal pain that was predominantly central and left sided. He had pain radiating into the left loin, and he also noticed he was passing gas and fecal debris as he urinated. A CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis was performed (eFig. 4.191)."
