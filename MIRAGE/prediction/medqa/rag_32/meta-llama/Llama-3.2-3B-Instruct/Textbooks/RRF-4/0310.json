To determine the main outcome measure, we need to consider what the researchers are trying to measure. They want to know how often HIV is related to high-risk behaviors and sociodemographic factors. The outcome of interest is the occurrence of HIV infection, which can be measured as either the number of new cases (incidence) or the total number of cases present in the population (prevalence). The hazard rate and attributable risk are not directly relevant to the measurement of the occurrence of HIV infection. The hazard rate is a measure of the rate at which new cases occur within a specified time period, while attributable risk is the proportion of disease cases that can be attributed to a specific risk factor. In this case, the researchers are interested in the total number of HIV infections, not just the rate at which new cases occur. Therefore, the main outcome measure of their study is prevalence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Despite these small number of documented cases, the risk of HIV transmission involving health care workers (infected or not) to patients is extremely low in developed countries\u2014in fact, too low to be measured accurately. In this regard, several epidemiologic studies have been performed tracing thousands of patients of HIV-infected dentists, physicians, surgeons, obstetricians, and gynecologists, and no other cases of HIV transmission that could be linked to the health care providers were identified."

Reduction of the average rate of sexual exposure to STIs through alteration of sexual risk behaviors and behavioral norms among both susceptible and infected persons in all population groups. The necessary changes include reduction in the total number of sexual partners and the number of concurrent sexual partners. 2."

Epidemiologic methods and behavioral research are used in clinical research to examine the distribution of disease and the factors that affect health and how people make health-related decisions. Outcomes research and health services research include studies that seek to identify the most effective and efficient intervention, treatments, and services for patient care (1). The purpose of a research study is to test a hypothesis about and to measure an association between exposure (or treatment) and disease occurrence (or prevention).

In developing countries, with three-quarters of the world\u2019s population and 90% of the world\u2019s STIs, factors such as population growth (especially in adolescent and young-adult age groups), rural-to-urban migration, wars, limited or no provision of reproductive health services for women, and poverty create exceptional vulnerability to disease resulting from unprotected sex. During the 1990s in China, Russia, the other states of the former Soviet Union, and South Africa, internal social structures changed rapidly as borders opened to the West, unleashing enormous new epidemics of HIV infection and other STIs. Despite advances in the provision of highly effective antiretroviral therapy worldwide, HIV remains the leading cause of death in some developing countries, and HPV and"

In addition, more than 140 possible cases of occupationally acquired HIV infection have been reported among health care personnel in the United States. The number of these workers who actually acquired their infection through occupational exposures is not known. Taken together, data from several large studies suggest that the risk of HIV 1283 infection following a percutaneous exposure to HIV-contaminated blood is ~0.3%, and after a mucous membrane exposure, ~0.09%. Although episodes of HIV transmission after nonintact skin exposure have been documented, the average risk for transmission by this route has not been precisely quantified but is estimated to be less than the risk for mucous membrane exposures. The risk for transmission after exposure to fluids or tissues other than HIV-infected blood also has not been quantified but is probably considerably lower than for blood exposures.
