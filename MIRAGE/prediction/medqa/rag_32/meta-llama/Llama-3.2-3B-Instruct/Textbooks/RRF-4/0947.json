    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of Tanner stage and its relation to pubertal development. Tanner stage is a measure of pubertal development in children and adolescents, with Stage 1 being preadolescent, Stage 5 being adult. The girl in question is at Tanner stage 3, indicating that she has started pubertal development but is not yet fully developed. Given her age and Tanner stage, we can infer that she has entered puberty but is still in the early stages of development. Now, we need to consider the potential consequences of this stage of development as an adult. The options provided are: delayed skeletal maturity, short stature, genu varum, and coarse facial features. Tanner stage 3 is associated with the development of breast budding and pubic hair, which are precursors to more advanced pubertal changes. As an adult, a girl who has reached Tanner stage 3 but not Stage 5 may still have a slightly different skeletal maturity compared to peers who reached Tanner stage 5 earlier. However, this is not a significant concern. Short stature is not typically associated with Tanner stage 3. Genu varum (bowleggedness) is not directly related to Tanner stage. Coarse facial features are not a direct consequence of Tanner stage 3. The most likely concern for an adult who has reached Tanner stage 3 without reaching Tanner stage 5 is delayed skeletal maturity. This is because Tanner stage 3 is an early stage of pubertal development, and the girl may not have completed the growth spurt associated with more advanced stages. Therefore, she may be at risk for delayed skeletal maturity as an adult. Based on the information provided, the correct answer is A. Delayed skeletal maturity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Chrousos, MD A 25-year-old woman with menarche at 13 years and menstrual periods until about 1 year ago complains of hot flushes, skin and vaginal dryness, weakness, poor sleep, and scanty and infrequent menstrual periods of a year\u2019s dura-tion. She visits her gynecologist, who obtains plasma levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, both of which are moderately elevated. She is diagnosed with premature ovarian failure, and estrogen and pro-gesterone replacement therapy is recommended. A dual-energy absorptiometry scan (DEXA) reveals a bone density t-score of <2.5 SD, ie, frank osteoporosis. How should the ovarian hormones she lacks be replaced? What extra mea-sures should she take for her osteoporosis while receiving treatment? \u25a0 THE OVARY (ESTROGENS, PROGESTINS, OTHER OVARIAN HORMONES, ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES, INHIBITORS & ANTAGONISTS, & OVULATIONINDUCING AGENTS)"

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

Basal levels of LH tend to be elevated in most affected individuals, and androgen production is invariably increased, even though circulating levels of androgens may be near the upper limits of the normal range in many affected women. Figure 29.21 Typical facial hirsutism in three women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. A: 25-year-old. 4. In anovulatory women, estrone levels are typically greater than estradiol levels. 5. Because circulating levels of estrogens are not diminished in PCOS and androgen levels are only mildly elevated, affected girls become both feminized and masculinized at puberty. This is an important feature because girls with classic forms of CAH who do not experience precocious puberty (and even those who do) only become masculinized at puberty (i.e., they do not develop breasts). 6."

Women may be affected, and other associated defects may include cleft lip and palate, cerebellar ataxia, nerve deafness, and abnormalities of thirst and vasopressin release. The frequency approximates Figure 29.11 A: A 16-year-old individual with 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis and primary amenorrhea. Circulating follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were markedly elevated. The small amount of breast development (Tanner stage 2) is unusual, but some pubertal development may occur in such patients."

A small mound is formed by the elevation of the breast and papilla. The areolar diameter enlarges. Stage 3 There is further enlargement of breast and areola with no separation of their contours. Stage 4 There is a projection of the areola and papilla to form a secondary mound above the level of the breast. Stage 5 The breasts resemble those of a mature female as the areola has recessed to the general contour of the breast. Stage 2 There is sparse growth of long, slightly pigmented, downy hair, straight or only slightly curled, primarily along the labia."
