    "question": "An 83-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with fever, weakness, and decreased responsiveness. He is diagnosed with urosepsis based on urinalysis and culture and started on ceftriaxone and intravenous fluids. By hospital day 3, he is clinically improving. During the evening, the patient becomes irritable. He is talking to someone despite nobody being present in the room. He is easily agitated and attempts to strike a nurse with a remote control to his TV. Subsequently, the patient keeps getting out of bed and trying to walk away despite being a fall risk. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is showing signs of delirium, such as agitation, hallucinations (talking to someone despite nobody being present), and attempting to walk away from the bed despite being a fall risk. This is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention. The patient is likely experiencing a withdrawal-like reaction due to the antibiotics ceftriaxone, which can cause pseudomeningoencephalopathy, a rare but serious side effect. The patient needs to be managed with antipsychotic medication to prevent further harm to themselves or others. The options include Diphenhydramine, Lorazepam, Olanzapine, and Physical restraints. However, antipsychotics are generally preferred over sedatives or physical restraints as they can help manage symptoms more effectively and are less likely to cause further harm. Lorazepam and Diphenhydramine are sedatives that may worsen the patient's confusion and disorientation, while Physical restraints may exacerbate the situation. Olanzapine is an antipsychotic that is commonly used to treat delirium and is a suitable choice in this scenario. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to start Olanzapine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy. One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC). He undergoes surgical resection and is found to have high-risk stage III CRC with five positive lymph nodes. After surgery, he feels entirely well with no symptoms.
