The physical examination reveals generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and the blood smear shows mature lymphocytes that rupture easily. Flow cytometry results show lymphocytes expressing CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD23, which are characteristic of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). CLL is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, characterized by the production of an excessive number of immature white blood cells. The patient's symptoms and test results are consistent with CLL. The treatment options for CLL include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Given the patient's age and overall health, chemotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (B) is a reasonable treatment option. All-trans retinoic acid (A) is typically used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia, not CLL. Observation and disease progression monitoring (C) is not an appropriate treatment approach for CLL, as it requires active treatment to manage symptoms and slow disease progression. Imatinib (D) is a targeted therapy used to treat certain types of cancer, such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), but it is not the first-line treatment for CLL.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Many patients are asymptomatic at presentation, and the disease is usually detected by the discovery of splenic enlargement and/or abnormal blood counts during a routine examination. However, in contrast to its companion MPN, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss are common presenting complaints. A blood smear will show the characteristic features of extramedullary hematopoiesis: teardrop-shaped red cells, nucleated red cells, myelocytes, and promyelocytes; myeloblasts may also be present (Fig. 131-1). Anemia, usually mild initially, is the rule, whereas the leukocyte and platelet counts are either normal or increased, but either can be depressed. Mild hepatomegaly may accompany the splenomegaly but is unusual in the absence of splenic enlargement; isolated lymphadenopathy should suggest another diagnosis. Both serum lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase levels can be elevated. The LAP score can be low, normal, or high. Marrow is"

The diagnosis is made from peripheral blood smear, which shows cells about 25% larger than those in small lymphocytes, with cytoplasmic blebs and nuclei that may be indented. The cells express T-cell markers like CD2, CD3, and CD7; two-thirds of patients have cells that are CD4+ and CD8\u2013, and 25% have cells that are CD4+ and CD8+. T-cell receptor \u03b2 chains are clonally rearranged. In 80% of patients, inversion of chromosome 14 occurs between q11 and q32. Ten percent have t(14;14) translocations that bring the T-cell receptor alpha/beta gene locus into juxtaposition with oncogenes TCL1 and TCL1b at 14q32.1."

Mediastinal lymphadenopathy producing cough or shortness of breath is another frequent initial presentation. The presence of one of three B symptoms has prognostic value: fever (>38\u00b0 C for 3 consecutive days), drenching night sweats, and unintentional weight loss of 10% or more within 6 months of diagnosis. The sporadic (North American) form of Burkitt lymphoma more commonly has an abdominal presentation (typically with pain), whereas the endemic (African) form frequently presents with tumors of the jaw. The anterior mediastinum and cervical nodes are the usual primary sites for T-cell lymphomas. These lymphomas may cause airway or superior vena cava obstruction, pleural effusion, or both."

            "content": "The physician will be aided in the pursuit of an explanation for the lymphadenopathy by a careful medical history, physical examination, selected laboratory tests, and perhaps an excisional lymph node biopsy. The medical history should reveal the setting in which lymphadenopathy is occurring. Symptoms such as sore throat, cough, fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, or pain in the nodes should be sought. The patient\u2019s age, sex, occupation, exposure to pets, sexual behavior, and use of drugs such as diphenylhydantoin are other important historic points. For example, children and young adults usually have benign (i.e., nonmalignant) disorders that account for the observed lymphadenopathy such as viral or bacterial upper respiratory infections; infectious mononucleosis; toxoplasmosis; and, in some countries, tuberculosis. In contrast, after age 50, the incidence of malignant disorders increases and that of benign disorders decreases."
