Congenital hypothyroidism is characterized by a deficiency of thyroid hormones in newborns, which can be caused by various factors, including inadequate maternal iodine intake during pregnancy. The signs and symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism can vary depending on the severity of the deficiency and the gestational age at diagnosis. However, common signs and symptoms include delayed growth and development, poor muscle tone (hypotonia), and macroglossia (enlarged tongue). In some cases, infants with untreated congenital hypothyroidism may also have umbilical hernias. Diarrhea is not a typical sign of congenital hypothyroidism. In fact, constipation is a more common symptom. Therefore, diarrhea would NOT be expected to be observed in a child with congenital hypothyroidism caused by inadequate maternal iodine intake.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The use of iodized salt and bread products is recommended during pregnancy to ofset the increased fetal requirements and maternal renal losses of iodine. Despite this, iodine intake has declined substantially in the past 15 years, and in some areas it is probably inadequate (Casey, 2017). Severe maternal iodine deficiency predisposes ofspring to endemic cretinism, which is characterized by multiple severe neurological defects. In parts of China and Africa where this condition is common, iodide supplementation very early in pregnancy prevents some cretinism cases (Cao, 1994). To obviate this, many prenatal supplements now contain various quantities of iodine."

First, maternal thyroxine production rises to maintain maternal euthyroidism and to transfer thyroid hormone to the fetus prior to fetal thyroid functioning. Second, fetal thyroid hormone production increases during the second half of pregnancy. This contributes to greater maternal iodine requirements because iodide readily crosses the placenta. hird, the primary route of iodine excretion is through the kidney. Beginning in early pregnancy, the iodide glomerular iltration rate increases by 30 to 50 percent. In sum, because of greater thyroid hormone production, fetal iodine requirements, and augmented renal clearance, dietary iodine needs are higher during normal gestation. lthough the placenta has the ability to store iodine, whether this organ functions to protect the fetus from inadequate maternal dietary iodine is currently unknown (Burns, 2011).

According to Leung and coworkers (2011), however, only 51 percent of the prenatal multivitamins in the United States contain iodine. It has even been suggested that because most cases of maternal hypothyroxinemia world wide are related to relative iodine deficiency, supplementation may obviate the need to consider thyroxine treatment in such women (Gyami, 2009). However, without evidence of benefit, it is hard to justiy the cost of iodine supplementation of large numbers of pregnant women in areas with mild iodine dei ciency (Pearce, 2016)."

Maternal thyroxine is important for normal fetal brain development, especially before the onset of fetal thyroid gland function (Bernal, 2007; Korevaar, 2016). And, even though the fetal gland begins concentrating iodine and synthesizing thyroid hormone after 12 weeks' gestation, maternal thyroxine contribution remains important. In fact, maternal sources account for 30 percent of thyroxine in fetal serum at term (horpe-Beeston, 1991).

Furthermore, at least four long-term studies report no abnormal intellectual and physical development of these children (Mestman, 1998).

In both, thyroid unction is dependent on adequate iodide intake, and its deiciency early in pregnancy can cause both maternal and fetal hypothyroidism. And, as discussed, maternal TSH-receptor-blocking antibodies can cross the placenta and cause fetal thyroid dysunction. Rovelli and colleagues (2010) evaluated 129 neonates born to women with autoimmune thyroiditis. They found that 28 percent had an elevated TSH level on the third or fourth day of life, and 47 percent of these had TPO antibodies on day 15. Still, autoantibodies were undetectable at 6 months of age. It seems paradoxical that despite these transient laboratory findings in the neonate, TPO and anti thyroglobulin antibodies have little or no efect on etalthyroid function (Fisher, 1997).

There is no evidence that radioiodine given before pregnancy causes fetal anomalies if enough time has passed to allow radiation efects to dissipate and if the woman is euthyroid (Ayala, 1998). The International Commission on Radiological Protection has recommended that women avoid pregnancy for 6 months after radioablative therapy (Brent, 2008).

            "content": "In contrast, the well-known abortifacient action of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus is detailed in Chapter 57 (p. 1099). Optimal periconceptional glycemic control will mitigate many of these losses. Likewise, the efects of overt hypothyroidism and severe iodine deficiency on early pregnancy failure are well known and discussed in Chapter 58 (p. 1124). Correction with supplementation reverses these actions. Also, the influence of subclinical hypothyroidism and antithyroid antibodies are sporadic, and thus any efects on recurrent miscarriage rates have been debated (Garber, 2012). That said, two metaanalyses reported convincingly positive associations between these antibodies and a greater risk for sporadic and recurrent miscarriages (Chen, 2011; Thangaratinam, 2011). One ongoing randomized trial regarding potential beneits of treatment will help guide future management (Vissenberg, 2015)."

            "content": "Physicians should be aware of the changes in thyroid physiology during pregnancy. Pregnancy is associated with reversible changes in thyroid physiology that should be noted before diagnosing thyroid abnormalities (see Fig. 31.12 for pregnancy associated changes in TBG, total T4, hCG, TSH, and free T4) (403). Women with a history of hypothyroidism often require increased thyroxine replacement during pregnancy, and patients should have thyroid function tests performed at the first prenatal visit and during each trimester thereafter. Evidence suggests that optimal fetal and infant neurodevelopmental outcomes may require careful titration of replacement thyroxine that meets the frequently increased requirements of pregnancy (413,414)."

            "content": "A single dose of radioactive iodine-131 is an effective cure in about 80% of cases and is the definitive treatment in nonpregnant women. Any woman of childbearing age should be tested for pregnancy before undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic administration of iodine. Ablation of a second-trimester fetal thyroid gland and congenital hypothyroidism (cretinism) from treatment during the first trimester were reported (395). Nuclear medicine professionals provide expertise in the administration of the radioactive isotope, and because the effect of the radioactive iodine is not immediate, the endocrinologist continues to provide suppressive medical treatment for 6 to 12 weeks after administration of iodine while the patient remains hyperthyroid. As early as 2 to 3 months after treatment, patients may become hypothyroid and should be supplemented with thyroxine as indicated by serum levels of free thyroid hormone levels (368). TSH testing is not sensitive for predicting thyroid function"
