On occasion during this period, she has noticed that he does not respond when called by name and cannot follow 1-step instructions. He has a history of recurrent ear infections treated with antibiotics since birth. He is at the 60th percentile for length and 50th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. His speech is quiet and difficult to understand. Otoscopic examination shows retracted tympanic membranes bilaterally that are immobile on pneumatic otoscopy. Nasopharyngoscopy shows mild adenoid hypertrophy. Pure tone audiometry shows a conductive hearing loss of 26 dB on the right side and 28 dB on the left side.

The nasopharyngoscopy shows mild adenoid hypertrophy, which is a common cause of Eustachian tube dysfunction in children. Given the patient's age and symptoms, the most appropriate next step in management is to consider surgical intervention to relieve the middle ear effusion and improve hearing, which is the insertion of tympanostomy tubes. Adenoidectomy may be considered concurrently to address the Eustachian tube dysfunction, but it is not the primary treatment for the conductive hearing loss.

Hearing can be screened by means of an office audiogram, but other techniques are needed (ABR, behavior audiology) for young, neurologically immature or impaired, and behaviorally difficult children. The typical audiologic assessment includes pure-tone audiometry over a variety of sound frequencies (pitches), especially over the range of frequencies in which most speech occurs. Pneumatic otoscopic examination and tympanometry are used to assess middle ear function and the tympanic membrane compliance for pathology in the middle ear, such as fluid, ossicular dysfunction, and eustachian tube dysfunction (see Chapter 9)."

Persistent middle ear effusion may last for many weeks or months in some children but usually resolves by 3 months following infection. Evaluating young children for this condition is part of all well-child examinations. Conductive hearing loss should be assumed to be present with persistent middle ear effusion; the loss is mild to moderate and often is transient or fluctuating. Normal tympanograms after 1 month of treatment obviate the need for further follow-up. In children at developmental risk or with frequent episodes of recurrent acute OM, 3 months of persistent effusion with significant bilateral hearing loss is a reasonable indicator of need for intervention with insertion of pressure equalization tubes."

The tympanic membrane of the normal, air-filled middle ear has much greater compliance than if the middle ear is fluid-filled. With acute OM, the tympanic membrane is characterized by hyperemia, or red color rather than the normal pearly gray color, but it can be pink, white, or yellow with a full to bulging position and with poor or absent mobility to negative and positive pressure. The light reflex is lost, and the middle ear structures are obscured and difficult to distinguish. A hole in the tympanic membrane or purulent drainage confirms perforation. Occasionally bullae are present on the lateral aspect of the tympanic membrane, which characteristically are associated with severe ear pain."

Antibiotic therapy or myringotomy with insertion of tympanostomy tubes typically is reserved for patients in whom bilateral effusion (1) has persisted for at least 3 months and (2) is associated with significant bilateral hearing loss. With this conservative approach and the application of strict diagnostic criteria for acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion, it is estimated that 6\u20138 million"

White, shiny, multiple transient epidermal inclusion cysts (Epstein pearls) on the hard palate are normal. Hard, marble-sized masses in the buccal mucosa are usually transient idiopathic fat necrosis. The tympanic membranes are dull, gray, opaque, and immobile in the first 1 to 4 weeks. These findings should not be confused with otitis media."

It is virtually impossible to predict whether such a child\u2019s speech will eventually be normal in all respects and just when this will occur. Prelanguage speech continues into the period when words and phrases should normally be used in propositional speech. The combinations of sounds are close to the standard of normal vowel\u2013consonant combinations of the 1to 2-year-old, and they may be strung together as if forming sentences. Yet, as time passes, the child may utter only a few understandable words, even by the third or fourth year. Three of 4 such patients will be boys and often one discovers a family history of delayed speech. When the child finally begins to talk, he may skip the early stages of spoken language and progress rapidly to speak in full sentences and to develop fluent speech and language in weeks or months. During the period of speech delay, the understanding of words and general"

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

The examining physician discovers postural hypotension and moderate vitiligo (depigmented areas of skin) and obtains routine blood tests. She finds hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis and suspects Addison\u2019s disease. She performs a standard ACTH 1\u201324 stimulation test, which reveals an insufficient plasma cortisol response compatible with primary adrenal insuf-ficiency. The diagnosis of autoimmune Addison\u2019s disease is made, and the patient must start replacement of the hormones he cannot produce himself. How should this patient be treated? What precautions should he take?"
