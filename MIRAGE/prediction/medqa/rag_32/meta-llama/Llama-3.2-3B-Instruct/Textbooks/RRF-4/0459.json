    "question": "A 14-year-old obese boy presents with severe right hip and knee pain. The patient says that he has been limping with mild pain for the past three weeks, but the pain acutely worsened today. He describes the pain as severe, non-radiating, sharp and aching in character, and localized to the right hip and knee joints. The patient denies recent illness, travel, trauma, or similar symptoms in the past. No significant past medical history and no current medications. The patient is not sexually active and denies any alcohol, smoking or drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, pulse 72/min, respiratory rate 15/min, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Body mass index (BMI) is 32 kg/m2. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The right leg is externally rotated, and there is a limited range of motion in the right hip. Strength is 4 out of 5 at the right hip joint and 5 out of 5 elsewhere. There is no tenderness to palpation. No joint erythema, edema or effusion present. Sensation is intact. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory tests are unremarkable. Plain radiographs of the right hip joint are significant for displacement of the right femoral head inferoposterior off the femoral neck. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of treatment for this patient?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate course of treatment for the 14-year-old obese boy, we need to analyze the symptoms and examination findings. The patient presents with severe right hip and knee pain, which worsened acutely, and has a limited range of motion in the right hip. The plain radiographs show displacement of the right femoral head inferoposteriorly off the femoral neck. This finding is suggestive of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), a common cause of hip pain in adolescents, especially in obese individuals. SCFE is a slipped or subluxation of the femoral head from the femoral neck, which can lead to pain, limited mobility, and potentially, avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Given the patient's age, obesity, and symptoms, the most appropriate course of action is to provide immobilization and monitoring to prevent further displacement and potential complications. Among the options provided, Pavlik harness is the most suitable treatment for SCFE, as it allows for immobilization of the hip joint and helps to reduce the risk of further displacement and complications. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection may be considered if there is a significant amount of joint inflammation, but it is not the primary treatment for SCFE. Surgical pinning of the right hip is not indicated in this case, as it is typically reserved for more severe cases or those that do not respond to non-surgical treatment. Reassessing in 3 months may not provide adequate immobilization and monitoring, and may lead to further displacement of the femoral head.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

            "content": "OA is the most common cause of chronic knee pain in persons over age 45, but the differential diagnosis is long. Inflammatory arthritis is likely if there is prolonged morning stiffness and many other joints are affected. Bursitis occurs commonly around knees and hips. A physical examination should focus on whether tenderness is over the joint line (at the junction of the two bones around which the joint is articulating) or is outside of it. Anserine bursitis, medial and distal to the knee, is an extremely common cause of chronic knee pain that may respond to a glucocorticoid injection. Prominent nocturnal pain in the absence of end-stage OA merits a distinct workup. For hip pain, OA can be detected by loss of internal rotation on passive movement, and pain isolated to an area lateral to the hip joint usually reflects the presence of trochanteric bursitis. No blood tests are routinely indicated for workup of patients with OA unless symptoms and signs suggest inflammatory arthritis."

The apparent shortening and external rotation of the leg on clinical examination were accounted for by spasm of the muscles connecting the pelvis to the trochanters and proximal femur. Of the muscles that surround the hip joint the largest group is the adductor group (adductor longus, brevis, and magnus) and the psoas major. The psoas major inserts onto the lesser trochanter and its action is to externally rotate and flex the hip. The fulcrum of action of the psoas major is the femoral head in the acetabulum. However, when the femoral neck is detached its overriding action pulls the femur proximally and into external rotation. The external rotation is exacerbated by the spasm in the adductor muscles.

            "content": "Knee pain may result from intraarticular (OA, RA) or periarticular (anserine bursitis, collateral ligament strain) processes or be referred from hip pathology. A careful history should delineate the chronology of the knee complaint and whether there are predisposing conditions, trauma, or medications that might underlie the complaint. For example, patellofemoral disease (e.g., OA) may cause anterior knee pain that worsens with climbing stairs. Observation of the patient\u2019s gait is also important. The knee should be carefully inspected in the upright (weight-bearing) and supine positions for swelling, erythema, malalignment, visible trauma, muscle wasting, and leg length discrepancy. The most common malalignment in the knee is genu varum (bowlegs) or genu valgum (knock-knees) resulting from asymmetric cartilage loss medially or laterally. Bony swelling of the knee joint commonly results from hypertrophic osseous changes seen with disorders such as OA and neuropathic arthropathy."

Focused History: This was IR\u2019s first occurrence of severe joint pain. In the ED, he was given an anti-inflammatory medication. Fluid aspirated from the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb was negative for organisms but positive for needle-shaped monosodium urate (MSU) crystals (see image at right). The inflammatory symptoms have since resolved. IR reports he is in good health otherwise, with no significant past medical history. His body mass index (BMI) is 31. No tophi (deposits of MSU crystals under the skin) were detected in the physical examination."

Other aspects of the exam include assessment of leg length discrepancy, joint con-tractures, skin changes, assessment for prior surgical incisions to identify prior treatments or plan future surgical approaches, neurovascular status, and strength, as well as range of motion. These details document functional status and help to formulate a differential diagnosis. Patients with \u201chip pain\u201d may have lumbar spinal stenosis, radiculopathy, or vascular disease that may play a large role in their presentation. Once an appropriate physi-cal examination is performed, weight-bearing radiographs are needed. Advanced imaging, including CT and MRI, are rarely indicated in the initial workup. Once a diagnosis is made, spe-cific treatment directed towards the patient\u2019s condition can be initiated. The goals of treatment are to improve pain, preserve motion, and maximize patient"

Fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and orthopnea are the most prominent complaints in patients with chronic severe MR. Palpitations are common and may signify the onset of AF. Right-sided heart failure, with painful hepatic congestion, ankle edema, distended neck veins, ascites, and secondary TR, occurs in patients with MR who have associated pulmonary vascular disease and pulmonary hypertension. Acute pulmonary edema is common in patients with acute severe MR. In patients with chronic severe MR, the arterial pressure is usually normal, although the carotid arterial pulse may show a sharp, low-volume upstroke owing to the reduced forward CO. A systolic thrill is often palpable at the cardiac apex, the LV is hyperdynamic with a brisk systolic impulse and a palpable rapid-filling wave (S3), and the apex beat is often displaced laterally."

            "content": "The clinical picture of PVNS is characterized by the insidious onset of persistent swelling and pain in affected joints, most commonly the knee. Other joints affected include the hips, ankles, calcaneocuboid joints, elbows, and small joints of the fingers or toes. The disease may also involve the common flexor sheath of the hands or fingers. Less often, tendon sheaths in the wrist, ankle, or foot may be involved. Symptoms of pain, a catching sensation, or stiffness may initially be mild and intermittent and may be present for years before the patient seeks medical attention. Radiographs may show joint space narrowing, erosions, and subchondral cysts. The diagnosis of PVNS is strongly suggested by gradient echo MRI, which reveals a synovial mass lesion of low signal intensity typical of tissue containing hemosiderin (Fig. 397-3). The joint fluid contains blood and is dark red or almost black in color. Lipid-containing macrophages may be present in the fluid. The joint fluid may be"
