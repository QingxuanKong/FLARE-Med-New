    "question": "A 62-year-old man with a history of chronic bronchitis comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of worsening shortness of breath and cough productive of thick sputum. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years but quit 5 years ago. Physical examination shows an increased anteroposterior chest diameter and coarse crackles in the lower lung fields bilaterally. Treatment with a drug that directly antagonizes the effects of vagal stimulation on the airways is begun. Which of the following drugs was most likely started?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to identify the underlying condition of the 62-year-old man and understand the treatment options for that condition. The patient has a history of chronic bronchitis and is experiencing worsening shortness of breath and cough productive of thick sputum. The physical examination reveals an increased anteroposterior chest diameter and coarse crackles in the lower lung fields bilaterally. These findings suggest chronic bronchitis with possible emphysema. The treatment option that directly antagonizes the effects of vagal stimulation on the airways is a key to this question. The drugs listed as options are all used to treat respiratory conditions, but only one directly antagonizes vagal stimulation on the airways. Fluticasone is a corticosteroid, montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, tiotropium is an anticholinergic, and cromolyn is a mast cell stabilizer. Among these options, tiotropium is the one that directly antagonizes the effects of vagal stimulation on the airways, which is a key feature of chronic bronchitis with emphysema. Therefore, the most likely drug started is tiotropium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

It is common among cigarette smokers and urban dwellers in smog-ridden cities; some studies indicate that 20% to 25% of men in the 40to 65-year-old age group have the disease. In early stages of the disease, the cough raises mucoid sputum, but airflow is not obstructed. Some patients with chronic bronchitis have evidence of hyperresponsive airways, with intermittent bronchospasm and wheezing (asthmatic bronchitis), while other bronchitic patients, especially heavy smokers, develop chronic outflow obstruction, usually with associated emphysema (COPD). The distinctive feature of chronic bronchitis is hypersecretion of mucus, beginning in the large airways."

Within 1\u20132 years of beginning to smoke regularly, many young smokers will develop inflammatory changes in their small airways, although lung function measures of these changes do not predict development of chronic airflow obstruction. After 20 years of smoking, pathophysiologic changes in the lungs develop and progress proportional to smoking intensity and duration. Chronic mucous hyperplasia of the larger airways results in a chronic productive cough in as many as 80% of smokers >60 years of age. Chronic inflammation and narrowing of the small airways and/or enzymatic digestion of alveolar walls resulting in pulmonary emphysema can result in reduced expiratory airflow sufficient to produce clinical symptoms of respiratory limitation in ~15\u201325% of smokers."

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Prevalence is estimated to be between 10% and 25% of the adult population who are smokers.

Chronic bronchitis is classified as a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; e.g., \u201cblue bloaters\u201d). Other causes include chronic infections and environmental pathogens found in dust. The cardinal manifestation of disease is an incessant cough, usually in the morning, with expectoration of sputum. Because of frequent exacerbations, the hospitalizations involved and the complexity of medical management, these patients should be referred to an internist."

An abnormal chest film prompts an evaluation aimed at explaining the cough. In a patient with chronic productive cough, examination of expectorated sputum is warranted. Purulent-appearing sputum should be sent for routine bacterial culture and, in certain circumstances, mycobacterial culture as well. Cytologic examination of mucoid sputum may be useful to assess for malignancy and to distinguish neutrophilic from eosinophilic bronchitis.

The tip of the catheter is then placed more inferiorly at the junction of the right atrium and the superior vena cava. The reason for placing the catheter in such a position relates to the agents that are infused. Most chemotherapeutic agents are severely cytotoxic (kill cells), and enabling good mixing with the blood prevents thrombosis and vein wall irritation. A 15-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of productive cough with copious purulent sputum, increasing shortness of breath, fatigue, fever around 38.5\u00b0 C, and no response to oral amoxicillin prescribed to her by a family physician. The patient was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis shortly after birth and had multiple admissions to the hospital for pulmonary and gastrointestinal manifestations of the disease."

Which of the eicosanoid agonists have been demonstrated to reduce both morbidity and mortality in patients with such a diagnosis? What are the modes of action? A 40-year-old woman presented to her doctor with a 6-month history of increasing shortness of breath. This was associated with poor appetite and ankle swell-ing. On physical examination, she had elevated jugular venous distention, a soft tricuspid regurgitation murmur, clear lungs, and mild peripheral edema. An echocardio-gram revealed tricuspid regurgitation, severely elevated"

            "content": "A 69-year-old retired teacher presents with a 1-month history of palpitations, intermittent shortness of breath, and fatigue. She has a history of hypertension. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"
