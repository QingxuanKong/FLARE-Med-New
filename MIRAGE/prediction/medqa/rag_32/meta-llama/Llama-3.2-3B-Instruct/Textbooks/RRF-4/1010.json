    "question": "A 25-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider for evaluation of a \"painful mass in my left groin.\" She says that her symptoms began 4 days ago as a painful mass that slowly enlarged, ruptured, and ulcerated. However, she denies fever, chills, dysuria, or hematuria. Three weeks prior to her current symptoms she noted a small, painless ulcer on her labium majorum that resolved after a few days. She admits to having unprotected sex with a male partner a month ago while she was traveling in Southeast Asia. Temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 139/84 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 18/min.

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and history to determine the most likely diagnosis. The patient presents with a painful mass in the left groin that began as a painful mass, slowly enlarged, ruptured, and ulcerated 4 days ago. She denies fever, chills, dysuria, or hematuria. Three weeks prior to her current symptoms, she noted a small, painless ulcer on her labium majorum that resolved after a few days. She admits to having unprotected sex with a male partner a month ago while traveling in Southeast Asia. The physical examination is significant for left-sided, tender, ulcerative lymph nodes with a dark discoloration. Based on these symptoms, the patient's condition is likely caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Given the patient's history of unprotected sex and the symptoms of a painful mass and ulcerative lymph nodes, the most likely diagnosis is lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). LGV is a type of STI caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serovars L1-L3. The presence of a painless ulcer on the labium majorum prior to the onset of the painful mass and ulcerative lymphadenopathy is consistent with LGV. The fact that the patient is from Southeast Asia, where LGV is more common, also supports this diagnosis. The Gram stain may show Gram-negative rods in a school of fish formation, which is characteristic of LGV. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

On direct questioning the patient indicated that the pain was in the inguinal region and radiated posteriorly into his left infrascapular region (loin). A urine dipstick was positive for blood (hematuria). A diagnosis of a ureteric stone (calculus) was made. The patient\u2019s initial infrascapular pain, which later radiated to the left groin, relates to passage of the ureteric stone along the ureter. The origin of the pain relates to ureteral distention. A series of peristaltic waves along the ureter transport urine along the length of the ureter from the kidney to the bladder. As the ureteric stone obstructs the kidney, the ureter becomes distended, resulting in an exacerbation of the pain. The peristaltic waves are superimposed upon the distention, resulting in periods of exacerbation and periods of relief."

Late in the course of the infection, the involved skin may be anesthetized secondary to necrosis of superficial nerves. Temperature abnormalities, both hyperthermia and hypothermia, are concomitant with the release of bacterial toxins and with bacterial sepsis (104). The involved skin is initially tender, erythematous, and warm. Edema develops, and the erythema spreads diffusely, fading into normal skin, characteristically without distinct margins or induration.

Insulin E. pH Case 10: Calf Pain Patient Presentation: CR is a 19-year-old female who is being evaluated for pain and swelling in her right calf. Focused History: Ten days ago, CR had her spleen removed following a bicycle accident in which she fractured her tibial eminence, necessitating immobilization of the right knee. She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

Reflex activity may therefore occur below the injury, but communication with the brain is lost. A 25-year-old woman complained of increasing lumbar back pain. Over the ensuing weeks she was noted to have an enlarging lump in the right groin, which was mildly tender to touch. On direct questioning, the patient also complained of a productive cough with sputum containing mucus and blood, and she had a mild temperature. The chest radiograph revealed a cavitating apical lung mass, which explains the pulmonary history."
