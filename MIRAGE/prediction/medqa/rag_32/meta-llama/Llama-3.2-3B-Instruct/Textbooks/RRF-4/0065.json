He could not recall any precipitating event except for an amateur weight-lifting competition that he participated in 2 months ago. Past medical history is significant for non-small cell lung cancer that was diagnosed and successfully treated. A PET scan 1 year ago demonstrated no recurrence.

            "content": "Back pain is the most common neurologic symptom in patients with systemic cancer and is the presenting symptom in 20%. The cause is usually vertebral body metastasis but can also result from spread of cancer through the intervertebral foramen (especially with lymphoma), from carcinomatous meningitis, or from metastasis to the spinal cord. Cancer-related back pain tends to be constant, dull, unrelieved by rest, and worse at night. By contrast, mechanical low back pain usually improves with rest. MRI, CT, and CT myelography are the studies of choice when spinal metastasis is suspected. Once a metastasis is found, imaging of the entire spine reveals additional tumor deposits in one-third of patients. MRI is preferred for soft tissue definition, but the most rapidly available imaging modality is best because the patient\u2019s condition may worsen quickly without intervention. Fewer than 5% of patients who are nonambulatory at the time of diagnosis ever regain the ability to walk; thus, early"

Pain is usually present for days or months before other neurologic findings appear. It is exacerbated by movement and by coughing or sneezing. It can be differentiated from the pain of disk disease by the fact that it worsens when the patient is supine. Radicular pain is less common than localized back pain and usually develops later. Radicular pain in the cervical or lumbosacral areas may be unilateral or bilateral. Radicular pain from the thoracic roots is often bilateral and is described by patients as a feeling of tight, band-like constriction around the thorax and abdomen. Typical cervical radicular pain radiates down the arm; in the lumbar region, the radiation is down the legs.

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Plasma Na+ concentration was initially 129 meq/L, decreasing within 3 days to 118\u2013120 meq/L despite fluid restriction to 1 L/d. A chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a right 2.8 \u00d7 1.6 cm infrahilar mass and postobstructive pneumonia. The patient was an active smoker. Past medical history was notable for laryngeal carcinoma treated 15 years prior with radiation therapy, renal cell carcinoma, peripheral vascular disease, and hypothyroidism. On review of systems, he denied headache, nausea, and vomiting. He had chronic hip pain, managed with acetaminophen with codeine. Other medications included cilostazol, amoxicillin/clavulanate, digoxin, diltiazem, and thyroxine. He was euvolemic on examination, with no lymphadenopathy and a normal chest examination.

            "content": "Metastatic carcinoma (breast, bronchus, prostate, thyroid, kidney, stomach, uterus), multiple myeloma, and lymphoma are the common malignant tumors that involve the spine. The primary lesion may be small and asymptomatic, and the first manifestation of the tumor may be pain in the back caused by metastatic deposits. The pain is constant and dull; it is often unrelieved by rest and is generally worse at night, interrupting sleep. Radicular pain may be added if the metastasis extends laterally. A fracture of a vertebral body in an otherwise healthy young or middle-aged person should alert the physician to the possibility of an underlying metastasis. At the time of onset of the back pain, there may be no radiographic changes on plain radiographs; when such changes do appear, they usually take the form of destructive lesions in one or several vertebral bodies with little or no involvement of the disc space, even in the face of a compression fracture. However, the changes are evident on CT"

            "content": "The history must include the onset and duration of symptoms. The location, character, and radiation of pain are important. Neurologic symptoms (muscle weakness, sensory changes, and bowel or bladder dysfunction) must be reviewed. Medical history and family history should be obtained, with a focus on back pain, rheumatologic disorders, and neoplastic processes. The review of systems should include detailed questions on overall health, fever, chills, recent weight loss, and recent illnesses. Physical examination should include a complete musculoskeletal and neurologic evaluation. Spinal alignment, range of motion, areas of tenderness, and muscle spasm should be noted. Red flags for childhood back pain include persistent or increasing pain, systemic findings (e.g., fever, weight loss), neurologic deficits, bowel or bladder dysfunction, young age (under 4 is strongly associated with tumor), night waking, pain that restricts activity, and a painful left thoracic spinal curvature."

Review of the past history and growth chart demonstrates normal birth weight and birth length, but a progressive decrease in height per-centiles relative to age-matched normal ranges starting at 6 months of age, and orthostasis with febrile illnesses. Physical examination demonstrates short stature and mild generalized obesity. Genital examination reveals descended but small testes and a phallic length of \u20132 SD. Laboratory evaluations demonstrate growth hormone (GH) deficiency and a delayed bone age of 18 months. The patient is started on replacement with recombinant human GH at a dose of 40 mcg/kg per day subcutaneously. After 1 year of treatment, his height velocity has increased from 5 cm/y to 11 cm/y. How does GH stimulate growth in children? What other hormone deficiencies are sug-gested by the patient\u2019s history and physical examination? What"

On physical examination, she had left upper abdominal tenderness with evidence of hepatomegaly and mild scleral icterus.

Interestingly, the height of the patient and the previous lens surgery would suggest a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and a series of blood tests and review of the family history revealed this was so. A 35-year-old male patient presented to his family practitioner because of recent weight loss (14 lb over the previous 2 months). He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets."
