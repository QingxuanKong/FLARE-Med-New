    "question": "A 22-year-old primigravida presents for a regular prenatal visit at 16 weeks gestation. She is concerned about the results of a dipstick test she performed at home, which showed 1+ glucose. She does not know  if her liquid consumption has increased, but she urinates more frequently than before. The course of her pregnancy has been unremarkable and she has no significant co-morbidities. The BMI is 25.6 kg/cm2 and she has gained 3 kg (6.72 lb) during the pregnancy. The blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, the heart rate is 82/min, the respiratory rate is 14/min, and the temperature is 36.6\u2103 (97.9\u2109). The lungs are clear to auscultation, the heart sounds are normal with no murmurs, and there is no abdominal or costovertebral angle tenderness. The laboratory tests show the following results:\nFasting glucose 97 mg/L\nALT 12 IU/L\nAST 14 IU/L\nTotal bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL(15 \u00b5mol/L)\nPlasma creatinine 0.7 mg/dL (61.9 \u00b5mol/L)\nWhich of the following tests are indicated to determine the cause of the abnormal dipstick test results?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the cause of the abnormal dipstick test results, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. The patient is a 22-year-old primigravida at 16 weeks gestation with a 1+ glucose result on a dipstick test, which indicates mild hyperglycemia. The patient reports increased urination and does not know if her liquid consumption has increased. The patient's BMI is 25.6 kg/m^2 and she has gained 3 kg during pregnancy. The laboratory results show a fasting glucose of 97 mg/dL, which is within the normal range for pregnancy (typically < 95 mg/dL). The liver enzymes (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels are also within normal limits. The plasma creatinine level is 0.7 mg/dL, which is within the normal range for pregnancy (typically < 1.1 mg/dL). Given these results, the next step is to confirm the diagnosis of gestational diabetes or rule out other causes of hyperglycemia. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the most appropriate test to confirm gestational diabetes, but it is not necessary to perform it immediately. Instead, a 50-g, 1-hour oral glucose challenge test (OGCT) is usually performed first. Since the patient's dipstick test result is only 1+, it is likely that the patient is not diabetic and the result may be due to a false positive or other factors such as dehydration or stress. Therefore, no further testing is required at this time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Women at low risk for gestational diabetes are those <25 years of age; those with a body mass index <25 kg/m2, no maternal history of macrosomia or gestational diabetes, and no diabetes in a first-degree relative; and those who are not members of a high-risk ethnic group (African American, Hispanic, Native American). A typical two-step strategy for establishing the diagnosis of gestational diabetes involves administration of a 50-g oral glucose challenge with a single serum glucose measurement at 60 min. If the plasma glucose is <7.8 mmol/L (<130 mg/dL), the test is considered normal. Plasma glucose >7.8 mmol/L (>130 mg/dL) warrants administration of a 100-g oral glucose challenge with plasma glucose measurements obtained in the fasting state and at 1, 2, and 3 h.

Daytime frequency is seven. The patient has nocturia (gets up to void two times during sleeping hours) and also has nocturnal polyuria (an increased proportion of the 24-hour output occurs at night; note that nighttime urine output excludes the last void before sleep but includes the first void of the morning). She has urge incontinence, likely caused by the relatively larger bladder volumes voided at night, which in turn may be related to her greater \ufb02uid, caffeine, and alcohol consumption in the evening."

Women with only minimal metabolic derangement may be more diicult to identiY. To diagnose overt diabetes in pregnancy, he International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) Consensus Panel (2010) recognizes the threshold values found in Table 57-4 for fasting or random plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1J levels at prenatal care initiation. The ADA (2017a) and the World Health Organization (2013) now also consider a plasma glucose level >200 mg/dL measured 2 hours after a 75 g oral glucose load to be diagnostic. No consensus has been reached as to whether such testing should be universal or limited to those women classiied as high risk."

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality.

Laboratory evaluation of patients with known or suspected heart disease should include a blood count and serum chemistry analysis. Patients with heart disease tolerate anemia poorly. Serum sodium and potassium levels are particularly important in patients taking diuretics and digitalis. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine values provide information on renal function and hydration status. Assessment of blood glucose levels may detect undiagnosed DM. Chest radiography and electrocardiography are mandatory as part of the preoperative evaluation, and the results may be particularly helpful when compared with those of previous studies."
