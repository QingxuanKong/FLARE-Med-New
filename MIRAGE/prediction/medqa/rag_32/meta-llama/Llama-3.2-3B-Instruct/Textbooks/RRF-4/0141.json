    "question": "A 25-year-old woman presents to her physician with a four month history of fatigue and weakness. The weakness has been progressive to the point where she cannot climb stairs and stand from a sitting position. She has only had one menstrual period in the last four months and has never been pregnant. She smokes a pack of cigarettes every day and does not take any medications. Her temperature is 98\u00b0F (36.7\u00b0C), blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 15/min. She is obese with a significant pannus. Abdominal striae are present. Her laboratory workup is notable for the following:\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 142 mEq/L\nCl-: 102 mEq/L\nK+: 3.9 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 25 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 314 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.1 mg/dL\nCa2+: 10.1 mg/dL\nAST: 9 U/L\nALT: 8 U/L\n24-hour urinary cortisol: 470 \u00b5g (< 300 \u00b5g)\nSerum cortisol 30 \u00b5g/mL (5-23 \u00b5g/dL)\nSerum adrenocorticotropin-releasing hormone (ACTH) 2 pg/mL (> 5 pg/mL)\n\nA 48-hour high dose dexamethasone suppression trial shows that her serum cortisol levels do not decrease.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, including progressive weakness, obesity, abdominal striae, and hyperglycemia. The high 24-hour urinary cortisol level and lack of suppression with high-dose dexamethasone suggest an ACTH-independent cause of Cushing's syndrome. The elevated serum cortisol level also supports this diagnosis. The next step in management would be to determine the source of the excess cortisol production, which could be an adrenal tumor or an ectopic source. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPS) is the most sensitive test for localizing the source of ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome, as it measures the ratio of cortisol production in the right and left inferior petrosal sinuses, which can help identify the source of the excess cortisol production. Therefore, IPS is the best next step in management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Physiologically normal adults suppress cortisol levels to <3 \u03bcg/dL, whereas most patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome do not. False-negative results may be obtained in patients with mild disease; therefore, some authors consider the test positive only if cortisol levels are suppressed to <1.8 \u03bcg/dL. False-positive results can occur in up to 3% of patients with chronic renal fail-ure, depression, or those taking medications such as phenytoin, which enhance dexamethasone metabolism. In patients with a negative test but a high clinical suspicion, the classic low-dose dexamethasone (0.5 mg every 6 hours for eight doses, or 2 mg over 48 hours) suppression test or urinary cortisol measurement should be performed.

This is best accom-plished by measurement of plasma ACTH levels (normal 10\u2013100 pg/mL).

            "content": "Diagnosis The diagnosis of ectopic ACTH syndrome is usually not difficult in the setting of a known malignancy. Urine free cortisol levels fluctuate but are typically greater than two to four times normal, and the plasma ACTH level is usually >22 pmol/L (>100 pg/mL). A suppressed ACTH level excludes this diagnosis and indicates an ACTH-independent cause of Cushing\u2019s syndrome (e.g., adrenal or exogenous glucocorticoid). In contrast to pituitary sources of ACTH, most ectopic sources of ACTH do not respond to glucocorticoid suppression. Therefore, high-dose dexamethasone (8 mg PO) suppresses 8:00 a.m. serum cortisol (50% decrease from baseline) in ~80% of pituitary ACTH-producing adenomas but fails to suppress ectopic ACTH in ~90% of cases. Bronchial and other carcinoids are well-documented exceptions to these general guidelines, as these ectopic sources of ACTH may exhibit feedback regulation indistinguishable from pituitary adenomas, including suppression by high-dose dexamethasone,"

A markedly elevated free testosterone level (2.5 times the upper normal range) is considered typical of an adrenal androgen-secreting tumor, while moderately elevated free testosterone levels are often ovarian in origin. A DHEAS level greater than 800 \u03bcg/dL is typical of an adrenal tumor. An adrenal tumor is unlikely when serum DHEAS and urinary 17-ketosteroid excretion measurements are in the normal basal range and the serum cortisol concentration is less than 3.3 \u03bcg/dL after dexamethasone administration (195).

The ACTH peptide contains 39 amino acids but the first 24 are sufficient to elicit a physiologic response.

A low-dose (1 \u03bcg cosyntropin IV) version of this test has been advocated; however, it has no superior diagnostic value and is more cumbersome to carry out. Alternatively, an insulin tolerance test (ITT) can be used to assess adrenal function. It involves injection of insulin to induce hypoglycemia, which represents a strong stress signal that triggers hypothalamic CRH release and activation of the entire HPA axis.

She is obese (body mass index [BMI] 33), does not exercise, and spends a good portion of her work day in a seated position. She eats a low-sugar diet and regularly eats packaged frozen meals for dinner because she doesn\u2019t have time to cook regularly. Her most recent laboratory values include a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that is above goal at 160 mg/dL (goal < 100 mg/dL) and a hemo-globin A1c that is well controlled at 6%. Her blood pressure is high at 160/100 mm Hg. Her prescription medications include simvastatin, metformin, and benazepril. She also takes over-the-counter ibuprofen for occasional knee pain and a multivitamin supplement once daily. She has heard good things about natural products and asks you if taking a garlic supplement daily could help to bring her blood"

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"
