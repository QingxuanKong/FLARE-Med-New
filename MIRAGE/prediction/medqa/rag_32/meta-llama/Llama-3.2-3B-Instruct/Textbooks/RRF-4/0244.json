The specimen contains type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate, which are key components of cartilage. Based on this information, we can infer that the specimen is likely to be a cartilaginous tissue. Now, let's examine the options provided in the question. Option A, Blood vessel, is unlikely to be the origin of the specimen because blood vessels are composed of collagen, but they do not typically contain chondroitin sulfate. Option B, Pinna, is also unlikely to be the origin of the specimen. The pinna is a cartilaginous structure, but it is not the most common source of cartilage tissue. Option C, Lens, is not a cartilaginous tissue and is therefore an unlikely origin of the specimen. Option D, Larynx, is a cartilaginous structure that contains hyaline cartilage, which is rich in type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate. Therefore, this option is the most likely origin of the specimen. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is D. Larynx.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

To color or stain the tissue sections, the paraffin must be dissolved out, again with xylol or toluol, and the slide must then be rehydrated through a series of solutions of descending alcohol concentration. The tissue on the slides is then stained with hematoxylin in water. Because the counterstain, eosin, is more soluble in alcohol than in water, the specimen is again dehydrated through a series of alcohol solutions of ascending concentration and stained with eosin in alcohol. Figure 1.1 shows the results of staining with hematoxylin alone, eosin alone, and hematoxylin with counterstain eosin. After staining, the specimen is then passed through xylol or toluol to a nonaqueous mounting medium and covered with a coverslip to obtain a permanent preparation."

Requesting frozen section diagnosis is sometimes desirable, as, for example, in determining the nature of a mass lesion or in evaluating the regional lymph nodes in a patient with cancer for metastasis. This method, in which a sample is quick-frozen and sectioned, permits histologic evaluation within minutes. In experienced, competent hands, frozen section diagnosis is accurate, but there are particular instances in which the superior histologic detail provided by more time-consuming routine methods is needed.

The components that remain after fixation consist mostly of large molecules that do not readily dissolve, especially after treatment with the fixative. These large molecules, particularly those that react with other large molecules to form macromolecular complexes, are usually preserved in a tissue section. Examples of such large macromolecular complexes include: \u0081 nucleoproteins formed from nucleic acids bound to protein, \u0081 intracellular cytoskeletal proteins complexed with as sociated proteins, \u0081 extracellular proteins in large insoluble aggregates, bound to similar molecules by cross-linking of neighbor ing molecules, as in collagen fiber formation, and \u0081 FOLDER 1.1 Clinical Correlation: Frozen Sections"

The upper portion of the micrograph shows the dense connective tissue (DCT ) overlying the perichondrium (P), from which new cartilage cells are derived. A slightly basophilic layer of growing cartilage (GC) underlying the perichondrium contains chondroblasts and immature chondrocytes that display little more than the nucleus residing in an empty-appearing lacuna. This layer represents deposition of new cartilage (appositional growth) on the surface of the existing hyaline cartilage. Mature chondrocytes with clearly visible nuclei (N) reside in the lacunae and are well preserved in this specimen. They produce the cartilage matrix that shows the dark-staining capsule or territorial matrix (TM) immediately surrounding the lacunae. The interterritorial matrix (IM) is more removed from the immediate vicinity of the chondrocytes and is less intensely stained. Growth from within the cartilage"

Many of these substances can be studied in special preparations, sometimes with considerable loss of structural integrity. These small soluble ions and molecules do not make up the formed elements of a tissue; they participate in synthetic processes or cellular reactions. When they can be preserved and demonstrated by specific \u0081 At a slightly acidic to neutral pH (5 to 7), sulfate and phos phate groups are ionized and available for reaction with the basic dye by electrostatic linkages. \u0081 At low pH (below 4), only sulfate groups remain ionized methods, they provide invaluable information about cell metabolism, active transport, and other vital cellular pro cesses.
