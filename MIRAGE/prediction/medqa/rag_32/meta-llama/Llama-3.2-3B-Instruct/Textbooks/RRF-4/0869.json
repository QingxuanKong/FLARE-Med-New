A study is done with a null hypothesis that there is no association between alcohol use and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The data obtained shows, of the 200 alcoholics who were followed-up, 30 developed GERD; and out of the 400 non-alcoholics, 30 developed GERD. What fraction of GERD can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed in this town?",

We can then divide this difference by the total rate of GERD in the general population to find the fraction that can be prevented.\\n\\nFirst, let's calculate the rate of GERD in alcoholics: 30 alcoholics developed GERD out of 200 alcoholics, so the rate is 30/200 = 0.15.\\n\\nNext, let's calculate the rate of GERD in non-alcoholics: 30 non-alcoholics developed GERD out of 400 non-alcoholics, so the rate is 30/400 = 0.075.\\n\\nNow, let's find the difference in these rates: 0.15 - 0.075 = 0.075.\\n\\nSince the rate of GERD in the general population is not given, we can't calculate the fraction that can be prevented directly. However, we can calculate the fraction of GERD that can be prevented in alcoholics by dividing the difference in rates by the rate in alcoholics: 0.075 / 0.15 = 0.5.\\n\\nHowever, this is the fraction that can be prevented in alcoholics, not the general population. To find the fraction that can be prevented in the general population, we need to know the rate of GERD in the general population. Let's assume the rate in the general population is x. Then, the fraction that can be prevented is (x - 0.075) / x.\\n\\nNow, we need to find the value of x. We know that the prevalence of alcohol use is 30%, so the proportion of the general population that is alcoholics is 0.3. We also know that 30 alcoholics developed GERD, and 30 non-alcoholics developed GERD. So, the proportion of alcoholics that developed GERD is 30/200 = 0.15, and the proportion of non-alcoholics that developed GERD is 30/400 = 0.075. Since these proportions are equal to the rate of GERD in each group, we can set up the equation: 0.15 = 0.3x and 0.075 = (1-0.3)x.\\n\\nSolving for x, we get x = 0.5 and x = 0.225, respectively. However, these values don't make sense, as the rate of GERD in the general population can't be greater than 0.3. Therefore, we need to use a different approach.\\n\\nLet's assume that the rate of GERD in the general population is y. Then, the fraction that can be prevented is (y - 0.075) / y.\\n\\nSince we know that 30 alcoholics developed GERD, and 30 non-alcoholics developed GERD, we can set up the equation: (y - 0.075) / y = (30/200) / (30/400).\\n\\nSimplifying the equation, we get (y - 0.075) / y = 0.15 / 0.075.\\n\\nSolving for y, we get y = 0.15.\\n\\nNow, we can find the fraction that can be prevented: (0.15 - 0.075) / 0.15 = 0.075 / 0.15 = 0.5.\\n\\nHowever, this is the fraction that can be prevented in alcoholics, not the general population. To find the fraction that can be prevented in the general population, we need to multiply this fraction by the proportion of the population that is alcoholics: 0.5 \\* 0.3 = 0.15.\\n\\nTherefore, the fraction of GERD that can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed is 0.15/0.3 = 0.5.\\n\\nHowever, this is not among the answer choices. Let's re-examine the answer choices and see if we can find a match.\\n\\nLooking at the answer choices, we can see that choice C, (30/200) / (30/400), is equivalent to 0.5. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

It is estimated that 15% of adults in the United States are affected by GERD, although such estimates are based only on population studies of self-reported chronic heartburn. With respect to the esophagus, the spectrum of injury includes esophagitis, stricture, Barrett\u2019s esophagus, and adenocarcinoma (Fig. 347-9). Of particular concern is the rising incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma, an epidemiologic trend that parallels the increasing incidence of GERD. There were about 8000 incident cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma in the United States in 2013 (half of all esophageal cancers); it is estimated that this disease burden has increased twoto sixfold in the last 20 years."

The stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus is resistant to abrasion from foods but is sensitive to acid. The submucosal glands of the proximal and distal esophagus contribute to mucosal protection by secreting mucin and bicarbonate. More important, high lower esophageal sphincter tone protects against reflux of acidic gastric contents, which are under positive pressure. Reflux of gastric juices is central to the development of mucosal injury in GERD. In severe cases, duodenal bile reflux may exacerbate the damage. Conditions that decrease lower esophageal sphincter tone or increase abdominal pressure contribute to GERD and include alcohol and tobacco use, obesity, central nervous system depressants, pregnancy, hiatal hernia (discussed later), delayed gastric emptying, and increased gastric volume. In many cases, no definitive cause is identified."

Liver and Gastrointestinal Tract Liver disease is the most common medical complication of alcohol abuse; an estimated 15\u201330% of chronic heavy drinkers eventually develop severe liver disease. Alcoholic fatty liver, a reversible condition, may progress to alcoholic hepatitis and finally to cirrhosis and liver failure. In the United States, chronic alcohol abuse is the leading cause of liver cirrhosis and of the need for liver transplantation. The risk of developing liver disease is related both to the average amount of daily consumption and to the duration of alcohol abuse. Women appear to be more susceptible to alcohol hepatotoxicity than men. Concurrent infection with hepatitis B or C virus increases the risk of severe liver disease. Cirrhosis contributes to elevated portal blood pressure and esophageal and gastric venous varices. These varices may rupture and result in massive bleeding.

Women are more susceptible to alcoholic liver injury when compared to men. They develop advanced liver disease with substantially less alcohol intake.

Risk factors for GERD include hiatal hernia and \u2191 intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., obesity, pregnancy). GERD can mimic cough-variant asthma. Patients with GERD should avoid caffeine, alcohol, chocolate, garlic, onions, mints, and nicotine. Type A gastritis is associated with pernicious anemia due to the lack of intrinsic factor necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. \u25a0 EGD with biopsies should be performed in patients whose symptoms are unresponsive to initial empiric therapy, long-standing (to rule out Barrett\u2019s esophagus and adenocarcinoma), or suggestive of complicated disease (e.g., anorexia, weight loss, dysphagia/odynophagia). Lifestyle: Weight loss, head-of-bed elevation, reduction of meal size, and avoidance of nocturnal meals and substances that \u2193 LES tone."

Women alcoholics are less likely 6e-5 to be diagnosed than men. A greater proportion of men than women seek help for alcohol and drug abuse. Men are more likely to go to an alcohol or drug treatment facility, whereas women tend to approach a primary care physician or mental health professional for help under the guise of a psychosocial problem. Late-life alcoholism is more common in women than in men. On average, alcoholic women drink less than alcoholic men but exhibit the same degree of impairment. Blood alcohol levels are higher in women than in men after drinking equivalent amounts of alcohol, adjusted for body weight. This greater bioavailability of alcohol in women is due to both the smaller volume of distribution and the slower gastric metabolism of alcohol secondary to lower activity of gastric alcohol dehydrogenase than is"

The incidence of Barrett esophagus is rising; it is estimated to occur in as many as 10% of individuals with symptomatic GERD. White males are affected most often and typically present between 40 and 60 years of age. The greatest concern in Barrett esophagus is that it confers an increased risk for development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Molecular studies suggest that Barrett epithelium may be more similar genetically to adenocarcinoma than to normal esophageal epithelium, consistent with the view that Barrett esophagus is a direct precursor of cancer. In keeping with this, epithelial dysplasia, considered to be a preinvasive lesion, develops in 0.2% to 1% of individuals with Barrett esophagus each year; its incidence increases with duration of symptoms and increasing patient age. Although the vast majority of esophageal adenocarcinomas are"

            "content": "When initially identified with mild symptoms of uncomplicated GERD, patients can be placed on 12 weeks of simple antacids before diagnostic testing is initi-ated. This approach may successfully and completely resolve the symptoms. Patients should be counseled to elevate the head of the bed; avoid tight-fitting clothing; eat small, frequent meals; avoid eating the nighttime meal immediately prior to bedtime; and avoid alcohol, coffee, chocolate, and peppermint, which are known to reduce resting LES pressure and may aggravate symptoms.Used in combination with simple antacids, alginic acid may augment the relief of symptoms by creating a physical bar-rier to reflux, as well as by acid reduction. Alginic acid reacts with sodium bicarbonate in the presence of saliva to form a highly viscous solution that floats like a raft on the surface of the gastric contents. When reflux occurs, this protective layer is refluxed into the esophagus, and acts as a protective barrier against the noxious"

Broadly speaking, these fall into three categories: (1) avoidance of foods that reduce LES pressure, making them \u201crefluxogenic\u201d (these commonly include fatty foods, alcohol, spearmint, peppermint, tomato-based foods, and possibly coffee and tea); (2) avoidance of acidic foods that are inherently irritating; and (3) adoption of behaviors to minimize reflux and/or heartburn. In general, minimal evidence supports the efficacy of these measures. However, clinical experience dictates that subsets of patients are benefitted by specific recommendations, based on their unique history and symptom profile. A patient with sleep disturbance from nighttime heartburn is likely to benefit from elevation of the head of the bed and avoidance of eating before retiring, but those recommendations are superfluous for a patient without nighttime symptoms. The most broadly applicable recommendation is for weight reduction. Even though the"
