The daughter reports that her mother has recently been having difficulty combing her hair in the mornings. The patient\u2019s family history is significant for an ischemic stroke in her father.

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, we can analyze the situation step by step: 1. **Chief Complaint and History:** The patient is having difficulty combing her hair in the mornings, which could be indicative of hair loss or scalp issues. 2. **Past Medical History:** The patient has a history of ischemic stroke in her father and diverticulosis, but there's no direct connection between these conditions and hair loss. 3. **Physical Examination:** The patient's neck is stiff, and she has bilateral shoulder tenderness, which could suggest a musculoskeletal or inflammatory condition. However, muscle strength is intact. 4. **Laboratory Results:** - Hemoglobin and hematocrit are within normal limits, which doesn't directly indicate anemia or blood loss. - Leukocyte count is slightly elevated (5,500/mm3), but the differential count doesn't show a significant shift towards neutrophils, which is often seen in infections. - Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is slightly below the normal range (82.2 \u03bcm3), which could indicate microcytic anemia but isn't strongly suggestive of iron deficiency anemia. - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated at 65 mm/h, indicating inflammation. - C-reactive protein (CRP) is elevated at 44 mg/dL, also suggesting inflammation. Given these findings, the patient's symptoms and lab results point towards an inflammatory condition rather than a hematological or infectious cause. The elevated ESR and CRP, along with the patient's symptoms of stiff neck and shoulder tenderness, are suggestive of an inflammatory process affecting the scalp. Considering the options provided: - **A. Jaw claudication** is typically associated with peripheral arterial disease and is not directly related to the patient's symptoms. - **B. Heliotrope rash** is associated with dermatomyositis, a condition that could explain the elevated inflammatory markers and muscle weakness but is not directly indicated by the patient's symptoms. - **C. Gastroesophageal reflux** is a condition that can cause neck stiffness due to referred pain but does not explain the elevated inflammatory markers or the specific symptom of difficulty combing hair. - **D. Pink plaques with silvery scales** is characteristic of psoriasis, a condition that can cause scalp issues, including hair loss, and is associated with elevated inflammatory markers, such as ESR and CRP. **Answer:** The patient should be screened for psoriasis, given the combination of scalp symptoms, elevated inflammatory markers, and the presence of pink plaques with silvery scales. **JSON Output:** ``` { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Analyzing the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, we can rule out options A and C as they don't directly relate to the patient's condition. The elevated inflammatory markers and physical examination findings point towards an inflammatory condition affecting the scalp. Option B, heliotrope rash, is associated with dermatomyositis, but the patient's symptoms don't strongly suggest muscle weakness. Option D, pink plaques with silvery scales, is characteristic of psoriasis, which could explain the patient's scalp symptoms, elevated inflammatory markers, and the presence of pink plaques with silvery scales.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" } ```",

A healthy young adult with thrombocytopenia will have a much more limited differential diagnosis than an ill hospitalized patient who is receiving multiple medications. Except in unusual inherited disorders, decreased platelet production usually results from bone marrow disorders that also affect red blood cell (RBC) and/or white blood cell (WBC) production. Because myelodysplasia can present with isolated thrombocytopenia, the bone marrow should be examined in patients presenting with isolated thrombocytopenia who are older than 60 years of age.

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills.
