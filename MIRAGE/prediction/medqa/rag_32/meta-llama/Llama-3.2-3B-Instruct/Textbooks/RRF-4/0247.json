    "question": "A 42-year-old man with AIDS comes to the physician for intermittent fever, nonproductive cough, malaise, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and a 3.6-kg (8-lb) weight loss over the past month. He has not seen a doctor since he became uninsured 2 years ago. His temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F). Abdominal examination shows mild, diffuse tenderness throughout the lower quadrants. The liver is palpated 2\u20133 cm below the right costal margin, and the spleen is palpated 1\u20132 cm below the left costal margin. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 49/mm3 (N \u2265 500 mm3). Blood cultures grow acid-fast organisms. A PPD skin test shows 4 mm of induration. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results to determine the most likely diagnosis and the appropriate pharmacotherapy. The patient has AIDS with a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 49/mm3, which makes him immunocompromised. He presents with intermittent fever, nonproductive cough, malaise, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and weight loss. The abdominal examination shows mild, diffuse tenderness throughout the lower quadrants, and the liver and spleen are palpated. Blood cultures grow acid-fast organisms, and the PPD skin test shows 4 mm of induration. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is disseminated mycobacterial infection, specifically tuberculosis (TB). The patient's immunocompromised status and the presence of acid-fast organisms in the blood cultures support this diagnosis. The appropriate pharmacotherapy for TB in an immunocompromised patient is a combination of first-line antitubercular agents. The recommended regimen includes isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. However, among the options provided, the closest match is azithromycin and ethambutol, which is a combination of a macrolide (azithromycin) and a second-line agent (ethambutol) that can be used as an alternative in certain situations. Nevertheless, the most appropriate choice would be a combination of first-line agents, but among the options provided, D. Azithromycin and ethambutol is the closest match.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The patient\u2019s age, sex, occupation, exposure to pets, sexual behavior, and use of drugs such as diphenylhydantoin are other important historic points. For example, children and young adults usually have benign (i.e., nonmalignant) disorders that account for the observed lymphadenopathy such as viral or bacterial upper respiratory infections; infectious mononucleosis; toxoplasmosis; and, in some countries, tuberculosis.

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

A mass, the gallbladder and adherent omentum, is occasionally palpable; however, guarding may pre-vent identification of this. Murphy\u2019s sign, an inspiratory arrest with deep palpation in the right subcostal area, is characteristic of acute cholecystitis.Laboratory evaluation commonly reveals a mild to mod-erate leukocytosis (12,000\u201315,000 cells/mm3). However, a normal WBC does not rule out the diagnosis. An unusually high WBC count (>20,000 cells/mm3) suggests a complicated form of cholecystitis such as gangrenous cholecystitis, perfo-ration, or associated cholangitis.

The lesions are of roughly the same size as a millet seed, from which the name miliary is derived. Miliary tuberculosis is characterized by fever, general malaise, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, night sweats, and hepatosplenomegaly. Diffuse bilateral pneumonitis is common, and meningitis may be present. The chest radiograph reveals bilateral miliary infiltrates, showing overwhelming infection. The TST may be nonreactive as a result of anergy. Liver or bone marrow biopsy is useful for the diagnosis."

Interestingly, the height of the patient and the previous lens surgery would suggest a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and a series of blood tests and review of the family history revealed this was so. A 35-year-old male patient presented to his family practitioner because of recent weight loss (14 lb over the previous 2 months). He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets."
