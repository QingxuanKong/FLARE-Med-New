    "question": "A 26-year-old nurse comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of fatigue. She has had a lot of stress at work and has been on sick leave for 2 weeks, but states that she would like to return to work. She has had several episodes of lower abdominal pain. She says, \"\"I know I have cancer.\"\" She requests a diagnostic laparoscopy. She was diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease 6 months ago. Her only medication is omeprazole. The patient appears pale. Her temperature is 36.5\u00b0 C (97.7\u00b0 F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg. On mental status examination she is tired and has a depressed mood. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae and dry mucous membranes. There are numerous crusts along the course of her left arm veins. A grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard along the right-upper sternal border. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities. There is generalized weakness of the proximal muscles. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 7.5 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 89 \u03bcm3\nReticulocyte count 13.3%\nSerum\nSodium 139 mEq/L\nPotassium 3.9 mEq/L\nCalcium 8.5 mg/dL\nTest of the stool for occult blood is negative.

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and physical examination: 1. The patient presents with a 2-month history of fatigue, stress, and several episodes of lower abdominal pain. She also mentions that she thinks she has cancer and requests a diagnostic laparoscopy. 2. She has a history of peptic ulcer disease and is currently taking omeprazole. 3. Physical examination findings include pallor, tachycardia (120/min), low blood pressure (90/65 mmHg), dry mucous membranes, and a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur. 4. Laboratory studies show anemia (Hemoglobin 7.5 g/dL), a low mean corpuscular volume (89 \u03bcm^3), and a high reticulocyte count (13.3%). 5. The patient appears to be malnourished, as evidenced by her pale conjunctivae and dry mucous membranes. 6. The abdominal examination is normal, and the stool test for occult blood is negative. 7. The abdominal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Considering these points, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with a factitious disorder, where the patient is fabricating or exaggerating symptoms to gain attention or sympathy. The patient's request for a diagnostic laparoscopy, despite normal abdominal findings, is a red flag for factitious disorder. Additionally, the patient's history of peptic ulcer disease and her current symptoms of abdominal pain and fatigue could be related to her actual medical condition, but the patient's behavior and requests for unnecessary testing suggest a factitious component. The other options are less likely: * Somatic symptom disorder: While the patient does report somatic symptoms, there is no evidence of excessive worry or concern about her symptoms, which is a key feature of somatic symptom disorder. * Conversion disorder: There is no evidence of neurological symptoms or signs of a conversion disorder. * Acute small bowel hemorrhage: The abdominal ultrasonography and stool test for occult blood are negative, making this diagnosis unlikely.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month.

Laboratory evaluation of patients with known or suspected heart disease should include a blood count and serum chemistry analysis. Patients with heart disease tolerate anemia poorly. Serum sodium and potassium levels are particularly important in patients taking diuretics and digitalis. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine values provide information on renal function and hydration status. Assessment of blood glucose levels may detect undiagnosed DM. Chest radiography and electrocardiography are mandatory as part of the preoperative evaluation, and the results may be particularly helpful when compared with those of previous studies."
