    "question": "A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician for intermittent stabbing face pain. The pain typically occurs in waves of several individual episodes lasting about one second. It is bilateral, but rarely occurs on both sides simultaneously. Touching her face or brushing her teeth can trigger an attack. Four months ago, she had an episode of weakness in her right arm that lasted for about a week. Family history is notable for migrainous headaches in her mother and brother. Vital signs are within normal limits. There is decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution of her face bilaterally. Muscle strength is 3/5 in the left upper extremity and 5/5 in the right upper extremity. There is spasticity of the lower extremities with sustained clonus. Further evaluation is most likely going to reveal which of the following findings?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's analyze the symptoms and history provided: 1. **Intermittent stabbing face pain**: The pain occurs in waves of several seconds, is bilateral but rarely simultaneous, and can be triggered by touching her face or brushing her teeth. This pattern suggests a trigeminal neuralgia, a condition characterized by sudden, severe, stabbing pain in the face, often triggered by light touch or movement. 2. **History of weakness in her right arm**: The episode lasted for about a week, which could be related to a neurological condition such as multiple sclerosis (MS). 3. **Decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution of her face**: This finding is consistent with trigeminal neuralgia, as the trigeminal nerve is responsible for sensation in the face. 4. **Muscle strength is 3/5 in the left upper extremity and 5/5 in the right upper extremity**: This indicates that the left arm is affected, which could be related to the weakness episode mentioned earlier. 5. **Spasticity of the lower extremities with sustained clonus**: This finding suggests a neurological condition affecting the lower motor neurons, which could be related to MS. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is **Trigeminal Neuralgia**. Now, let's evaluate the answer choices: A. **Multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques** are more characteristic of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which is a condition that can cause weakness, numbness, and vision problems, but it is not primarily associated with trigeminal neuralgia. B. **Erythematous papules in the V2/V3 nerve distribution** are more characteristic of conditions such as Rosacea, which can cause facial redness and flushing, but it does not typically cause the symptoms described. C. **Photophobia and phonophobia** are symptoms often associated with migraines, but the pattern of pain and the lack of headache history make this less likely. D. **Rhinorrhea, lacrimination, and ptosis** are symptoms of Horner's syndrome, which is a neurological disorder that can be caused by damage to the sympathetic nerves, but it is not directly related to the symptoms described. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The symptoms described are consistent with trigeminal neuralgia, a condition characterized by sudden, severe, stabbing pain in the face, often triggered by light touch or movement. The history of weakness in her right arm and decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution of her face also support this diagnosis. The other options do not match the symptoms described.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

A 60-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department with acute right-sided weakness, predominantly in the upper limb, which lasted for 24 hours. She made an uneventful recovery, but was extremely concerned about the nature of her illness and went to see her local doctor. A diagnosis of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) was made. A TIA is a neurological deficit resolving within 24 hours. It is a type of stroke. Neurological deficits may be permanent or transient. Most transient events resolve within 21 days; any failure of resolution beyond 21 days is an established stroke. An investigation into the cause of the TIA was undertaken. Eighty-five percent of all strokes result from cerebral infarction, of which most are due to embolization. A duplex Doppler scan of the carotid vessels was performed."

The onset can be remarkably abrupt and occasionally awakens the patient from sleep. It is made worse by movements that involve the muscles in the region and the patient searches for a comfortable position. Narcotics are usually required to suppress the pain. After a period of several days there is a rapid development of muscular weakness and thereafter, sensory and reflex impairment. With the development of weakness, the pain begins to subside. In a few cases, the neurologic disorder occurs with little or no antecedent pain. Possibly in some there is pain that is not followed by demonstrable weakness.

Spasticity is typical but may not be present acutely. Rapid repetitive movements are slowed and coarse, but normal rhythmicity is maintained. With corticobulbar involvement, weakness occurs in the lower face and tongue; extraocular, upper facial, pharyngeal, and jaw muscles are typically spared. Bilateral corticobulbar lesions produce a pseudobulbar palsy: dysarthria, dysphagia, dysphonia, and emotional lability accompany bilateral facial weakness and a brisk jaw jerk.

The levator spasm lifts the affected shoulder slightly, and tautness in this muscle is sometimes the earliest feature. As a general observation, we have been impressed with information gained from palpating the muscles of the neck and shoulder in order to establish which muscles are the predominant causes of the spasm and to direct treatment to them as noted further on. In most patients the spasms remain confined to the neck muscles and persist in unmodified form, but in some the spasms spread, involving muscles of the shoulder girdle and back or the face and limbs.

A detailed mental status examination should be performed with particular attention to symptoms of depression and anxiety. A formal neurologic examination is required to determine whether objective muscle weakness is present. This is usually a straightforward exercise, although occasionally patients with fatigue have difficulty sustaining effort against resistance and sometimes report that generating full power requires substantial mental effort. On confrontational testing, they are able to generate full power for only a brief period before suddenly giving way to the examiner. This type of weakness is often referred to as breakaway weakness and may or may not be associated with pain. This is contrasted with weakness due to lesions in the motor tracts or lower motor unit, in which the patient\u2019s resistance can be overcome in a smooth and steady fashion and full power can never be"

At an early stage, the arm muscles are usually stronger than the leg muscles, and in a few cases, they are spared almost entirely. Facial diplegia occurs in more than half, sometimes bilaterally at the same time or sequentially over days. Other cranial nerve palsies, if they occur, usually come later, after the arms and face are affected; they are the initial signs in a variant pattern of disease as described further on. At the onset, there is no fever, and if lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly occurs, they are related to a preceding viral infection."

            "content": "Most patients, however, are symptomatic and have weakness, paresthesias, and pain as the usual complaints. The symptoms are insidious in onset and slowly progressive, but occasionally they seem to evolve or to worsen rapidly over a matter of days. The initial symptoms are usually referred to the distal portions of the limbs and progress proximally if the illness remains untreated. The feet are always affected earlier and more severely than the hands. Usually some aspect of motor disability is part of the chief complaint, but in about one-third of the patients the main complaints are pain and paresthesias. It is this painful syndrome that has been the most prominent feature in the patients we have encountered. The discomfort takes several forms: a dull, constant ache in the feet or legs; sharp and lancinating pains, momentary in duration, like those of tabes dorsalis; sensations of cramping or tightness in the muscles of the feet and calves; or band-like feelings around the legs."

            "content": "The pattern of inheritance is autosomal dominant as noted, with an onset usually in infancy and childhood. Characteristically, attacks of weakness occur before breakfast and later in the day, particularly when resting following exercise. In the latter case, the weakness appears after 20 to 30 min of becoming sedentary. The patient notes difficulty that begins in the legs, thighs, and lower back and spreads to the hands, forearms, and shoulders over minutes or more. Only in the severest attacks are the neck and cranial muscles involved; respiratory muscles are usually spared. As the muscles become inexcitable, tendon reflexes are diminished or lost. Attacks usually last 15 to 60 min, and recovery can be hastened by mild exercise. After an attack, mild weakness may persist for a day or 2. In severe cases, the attacks may occur every day; during late adolescence and the adult years, when the patient becomes more sedentary, the attacks may diminish and even cease entirely. In certain"

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

The weakness is generalized but always more severe in the muscles of the shoulders and hips and proximal portions of the limbs. A tiptoe gait, the result of fibrous contractures of flexors of the ankles, is a common late abnormality. Tendon reflexes are depressed or abolished, but only commensurate with the degree of muscle weakness. Intermittent low-grade fever, substernal and abdominal pain (like that of peptic ulcer), melena, and hematemesis from bowel infarction may occur, the result of an accompanying systemic vasculitis."

At first the stiffness and spasms are intermittent, then gradually they become more or less continuously active in the proximal leg and axial trunk muscles and increasingly painful. The spasms impart a robotic appearance to walking and an exaggerated lumbar lordosis. Attempts to move an affected part passively yield an almost rock-like immobility, perceptibly different from spasticity, paratonia, or extrapyramidal rigidity. Muscles of respiration and swallowing and those of the face may be involved in advanced cases, but trismus, a common feature of tetanus, does not occur. We have observed brief periods of cyanosis and respiratory arrest during episodes of intense spasm, and one of our patients died during such an episode. The eye muscles are rarely affected."
