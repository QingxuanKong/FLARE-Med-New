    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the role of ribosomes in protein synthesis and the different locations where they can be found in a cell. Ribosomes are complex molecular machines that read the genetic code in messenger RNA (mRNA) and assemble amino acids into proteins. There are two main types of ribosomes: free ribosomes, which are found in the cytosol, and ribosomes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is also known as rough ER due to the presence of ribosomes on its surface. Rough ER is involved in the synthesis of proteins that are destined for secretion or incorporation into membranes, while smooth ER is involved in lipid synthesis and storage. In protein-secreting cells, such as those found in the liver or pancreas, the majority of proteins are synthesized on rough ER-bound ribosomes. This is because the rough ER provides a signal recognition particle (SRP) that recognizes signal sequences on the proteins and directs them to the ER membrane for further processing and secretion. On the other hand, cytosolic ribosomes are involved in the synthesis of proteins that are required within the cell or are destined for other organelles such as the nucleus, mitochondria, or peroxisomes. The nucleus is not a site of protein synthesis, but rather a repository of genetic material. Therefore, the location of the ribosome that is essential for protein-secreting cells is the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

To maintain the correct reading frame and to ensure accuracy (about 1 mistake every 10,000 amino acids), protein synthesis is performed in the ribosome, a complex catalytic machine made from more than 50 different proteins (the ribosomal proteins) and several RNA molecules, the ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). A typical eukaryotic cell contains millions of ribosomes in its cytoplasm (Figure 6\u201360). The large and small ribosome subunits are assembled at the nucleolus, where newly transcribed and modified rRNAs associate with the ribosomal proteins that have been transported into the nucleus after their synthesis in the cytoplasm. These two ribosomal subunits are then exported to the cytoplasm, where they join together to synthesize proteins."

Extensive protein similarities, however, suggest that both organelles originated when a primitive eukaryotic cell entered into a stable endosymbiotic relationship with a bacterium. Although some of the genes of these former bacteria still function to make organelle proteins and RNA, most of them have been transferred into the nuclear genome, where they encode bacteria-like enzymes that are synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes and then imported into the organelle. The mitochondrial DNA replication and DNA repair processes are substantially less effective than the corresponding processes in the cell nucleus. Damage therefore accumulates in the genome of mitochondria over time; this damage may be a substantial contributor to the aging of cells and organisms, and it can cause serious diseases.

In contrast, the RNA components of the ribosome are final gene products, and a growing mammalian cell must synthesize approximately 10 million copies of each type of ribosomal RNA in each cell generation to construct its 10 million ribosomes. The cell can produce adequate quantities of ribosomal RNAs only because it contains multiple copies of the rRNA genes that code for ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). Even E. coli needs seven copies of its rRNA genes to meet the cell\u2019s need for ribosomes.

If the recognition site is poor enough, scanning ribosomal subunits will sometimes ignore the first AUG codon in the mRNA and skip to the second or third AUG codon instead. This phenomenon, known as \u201cleaky scanning,\u201d is a strategy frequently used to produce two or more closely related proteins, differing only in their N-termini, from the same mRNA. A particularly important use of this mechanism is the production of the same protein with and without a signal sequence attached at its N-terminus.

As its codons enter the core of the ribosome, the mRNA nucleotide sequence is translated into an amino acid sequence using the tRNAs as adaptors to add each amino acid in the correct sequence to the growing end of the polypeptide chain. When a stop codon is encountered, the ribosome releases the finished protein, and its two subunits separate again. These subunits can then be used to start the synthesis of another protein on another mRNA molecule. Ribosomes operate with remarkable efficiency: in one second, a eukaryotic ribosome adds 2 amino acids to a polypeptide chain; the ribosomes of bacterial cells operate even faster, at a rate of about 20 amino acids per second."

            "content": "Another complex macromolecular aggregate that can reassemble from its component parts is the bacterial ribosome. This structure is composed of about 55 different protein molecules and 3 different rRNA molecules. Incubating a mixture of the individual components under appropriate conditions in a test tube causes them to spontaneously re-form the original structure. Most importantly, such reconstituted ribosomes are able to catalyze protein synthesis. As might be expected, the reassembly of ribosomes follows a specific pathway: after certain proteins have bound to the RNA, this complex is then recognized by other proteins, and so on, until the structure is complete. It is still not clear how some of the more elaborate self-assembly processes are regulated. Many structures in the cell, for example, seem to have a precisely defined length that is many times greater than that of their component macromolecules. How such length determination is achieved is in many cases a mystery. In"

The translation of the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA molecule into protein takes place in the cytosol on a large ribonucleoprotein assembly called a ribosome. Each amino acid used for protein synthesis is first attached to a tRNA molecule that recognizes, by complementary base-pair interactions, a particular set of three nucleotides (codons) in the mRNA. As an mRNA is threaded through a ribosome, its sequence of nucleotides is then read from one end to the other in sets of three according to the genetic code."

Thus, in the upper right and left, the membranes of the reticulum have been cut at a right angle to their surface. In the center, the reticulum has twisted and is shown as in an aerial view (from above the membrane). The large spiral cytoplasmic assemblies (arrows) are chains of ribosomes that form polyribosomes that are actively engaged in translation of the mRNA molecule. 38,000."

The nucleus contains the genome (aside from mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA), and it is the principal site of DNA and RNA synthesis. The surrounding cytoplasm consists of the cytosol and the cytoplasmic organelles suspended in it. The cytosol constitutes a little more than half the total volume of the cell, and it is the main site of protein synthesis and degradation. It also performs most of the cell\u2019s intermediary metabolism\u2014that is, the many reactions that degrade some small molecules and synthesize others to provide the building blocks for macromolecules (discussed in Chapter 2)."
