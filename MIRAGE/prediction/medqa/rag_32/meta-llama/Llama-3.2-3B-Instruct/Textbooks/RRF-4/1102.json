The patient states that for the past several weeks he has felt oddly fatigued and has struggled to complete his work. He is a foreign exchange student and is concerned he will fail out of his academic program. He has experienced some occasional nausea and vomiting which has caused him to lose weight. The patient is a first year college student, drinks alcohol regularly, smokes marijuana, and has unprotected sex with multiple partners. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best diagnostic test for the patient, let's analyze the given information step by step. The patient presents with constant fatigue, occasional nausea and vomiting, and is a regular user of marijuana and has unprotected sex with multiple partners. The laboratory values show elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and a positive urine test for marijuana, amphetamines, and cocaine. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible sexually transmitted infection (STI). The patient's refusal to undergo a genital examination makes it difficult to determine the cause of the symptoms, but the positive urine tests for multiple substances suggest that the patient may have engaged in high-risk behaviors. The best diagnostic test to confirm the suspected STI would be a viral core antibody test, which can detect the presence of certain viruses, such as HIV, syphilis, and chlamydia, that are commonly transmitted through sexual contact. This test can provide a more specific diagnosis and guide further treatment. The other options are not the best choice: A. CAGE questions: While the CAGE questionnaire is a useful screening tool for substance abuse, it is not specific for diagnosing STIs. B. Urethral swab and culture: This test can be used to diagnose certain STIs, but it may not be able to detect all types of STIs, and the patient's refusal of a genital examination makes it difficult to obtain a sample. C. Viral surface antibody: This test detects the presence of antibodies against the surface of certain viruses, but it may not be specific for the suspected STIs in this case. Therefore, the best diagnostic test for the patient is a viral core antibody test.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

A venous blood gas was drawn soon after his presentation; venous and arterial blood gases demonstrate a high level of agreement in hemodynamically stable patients, allowing for the interpretation of acid-base disorders with venous blood gas results. In response to his metabolic alkalosis, the Pco2 should have increased by 0.75 mmHg for each 1-meq/L increase in bicarbonate; the expected Pco2 should have been ~55 mmHg. Given the Pco2 of 62 mmHg, he had an additional respiratory acidosis, likely caused by respiratory muscle weakness from his acute hypokalemia and subacute hypercortisolism."

She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases.

            "content": "If the fasting plasma glucose level is less than 126 mg/dL (7 mMol/L) but diabetes is nonetheless suspected, then a standardized oral glucose tolerance test may be done (Table 41\u20134). The patient should eat nothing after midnight prior to the test day. On the morning of the test, adults are then given 75 g of glucose in 300 mL of water; children are given 1.75 g of glucose per kilogram of ideal body weight. The glucose load is consumed within 5 minutes. Blood samples for plasma glucose are obtained at 0 and 120 minutes after ingestion of glucose. An oral glucose tolerance test is normal if the fasting venous plasma glucose value is less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and the 2-hour value falls below 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L). A fasting value of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher or a 2-hour value of greater than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. Patients with 2-hour value of 140\u2013199 mg/dL (7.8\u201311.1 mmol/L) have impaired glucose tolerance."

Signs of advanced disease include muscle wasting, ascites, edema, dilated abdominal veins, hepatic fetor, asterixis, mental confusion, stupor, and coma. In male patients with cirrhosis, particularly that related to alcohol use, signs of hyperestrogenemia such as gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and loss of male-pattern hair distribution may be found. Icterus is best appreciated when the sclera is inspected under natural light. In fair-skinned individuals, a yellow tinge to the skin may be obvious. In dark-skinned individuals, examination of the mucous membranes below the tongue can demonstrate jaundice. Jaundice is rarely detectable if the serum bilirubin level is <43 \u03bcmol/L (2.5 mg/dL) but may remain detectable below this level during recovery from jaundice (because of protein and tissue binding of conjugated bilirubin)."

His blood urate was 8.5 mg/dl (reference = 2.5\u20138.0). The unusually young age of presentation is suggestive of an enzymopathy of purine metabolism, and additional blood tests are ordered. Diagnosis: IR has gout (MSU crystal deposition disease), a type of inflammatory arthritis. Treatment: IR was given prescriptions for allopurinol and colchicine. The treatment goals are to reduce his blood urate levels to <6.0 mg/dl and prevent additional attacks. He was advised to lose weight because being overweight or obese is a risk factor for gout. His BMI of 31 puts him in the obese category. He was also given written information on the association between diet and gout. Prognosis: Gout increases the risk of developing renal stones. It is also associated with hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease."
