    "question": "A 2-day-old infant male is brought to the emergency department with a 5-hour history of vomiting and irritability. He was born at home and had unreliable prenatal care because his parents have been experiencing housing instability. About a day after birth, he started to become lethargic and was feeding poorly. His parents thought that he might just be tired so they put him to bed; however, by the next morning he started to vomit and act extremely irritable. On presentation, he is found to have nuchal rigidity and bulging fontanelles. Based on this presentation, appropriate cultures are obtained and he is placed on empiric antibiotics. After all cultures grow out the same gram-positive bacteria, the patient is narrowed to penicillin G. Which of the following is a characteristic of the most likely organism that is causing this patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Enlarges hemolytic area of Staphylococcus aureus",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: Step 1: Analyze the patient's symptoms - The patient is a 2-day-old infant with vomiting, irritability, lethargy, and nuchal rigidity, which are classic signs of meningitis. Step 2: Consider the patient's age and presentation - The patient is a 2-day-old infant, which makes him more susceptible to neonatal meningitis, particularly caused by gram-negative bacteria. Step 3: Review the cultures - The patient's cultures grow the same gram-positive bacteria, but the question asks about the most likely organism causing the symptoms, which is gram-negative. Step 4: Consider the options - The options are all related to bacterial characteristics, but only one option describes a gram-negative bacteria. Step 5: Analyze the options - - A: Enlarges hemolytic area of Staphylococcus aureus - This is a characteristic of Staphylococcus aureus, which is gram-positive, not gram-negative. - B: Produces lipooligosaccharide rather than lipopolysaccharide - This is a characteristic of gram-negative bacteria, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms. - C: Produces toxin that increases cAMP levels - This is a characteristic of some gram-positive bacteria, not gram-negative. - D: Tumbling motility in broth at 22 degrees - This is a characteristic of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is gram-negative, but not the most likely cause of neonatal meningitis. Conclusion: The most likely organism causing this patient's symptoms is a gram-negative bacteria, which is consistent with option B.

Infants, of course, cannot complain of headache, stiff neck may be absent, and one has only the nonspecific signs of a systemic illness: fever, irritability, drowsiness, vomiting, convulsions, and a bulging fontanel to suggest the presence of meningeal infection. Signs of meningeal irritation do occur, but only late in the course of the illness. A high index of suspicion and liberal use of the lumbar puncture are the keys to early diagnosis. Lumbar puncture is ideally performed before any antibiotics are administered for other neonatal infections or, at a minimum, blood cultures should be obtained before treatment. An antibiotic regimen sufficient to control a septicemia may allow a meningeal infection to smolder and to flare up after antibiotic therapy for the systemic infection has been discontinued."

Antibiotics are used to suppress bacterial growth, allowing the infant\u2019s defense mechanisms time to respond. In addition, support measures, such as assisted ventilation and cardiovascular support, are equally important to the management of the infant. A combination of ampicillin and an aminoglycoside (usually gentamicin) for 10 to 14 days is effective treatment against most organisms responsible for early-onset sepsis. The combination of ampicillin and cefotaxime also is proposed as an alternative method of treatment. If meningitis is present, the treatment should be extended to 21 days or 14 days after a negative result from a CSF culture.

Obstetric abnormalities in the third trimester (premature birth, prolonged labor, premature rupture of fetal membranes) occur frequently in mothers of infants who develop meningitis in the first weeks of life. The most significant factor in the pathogenesis of the meningitis is maternal infection (usually a urinary tract infection or puerperal fever of unknown cause). The infection in both mother and infant is most often caused by gram-negative enterobacteria, particularly E. coli, and group B streptococci, and less often to Pseudomonas, Listeria, S. aureus, or Staphylococcus epidermidis (formerly albus), and group A streptococci. Analysis of postmortem material indicates that in most cases infection occurs at or near the time of birth, although clinical signs of meningitis may not become evident until several days or a week later."

He complained that his face and extremities had taken on a blue color. His medical history included chronic stable angina treated with isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin. Blood obtained for analysis was brown. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A. Carboxyhemoglobinemia B. Hemoglobin SC disease C. Methemoglobinemia D.

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

Shown in Figure 64-6, this strategy is designed to identiy women who should be given intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis. Women are screened for GBS colonization at 35 to 37 weeks' gestation, and intrapartum antimicrobials are given to women with rectovaginal GBS-positive cultures. Selective enrichment broth followed by subculture improves detection. In addition, more rapid techniques such as DNA probes and NAATs are being developed (Helali, 2012).

Empiric antibiotics must be chosen carefully based on the most likely pathogens (gram-negative rods, gram-positive cocci, and anaerobes) because the portal of entry of the offending organism and its identity may not be evi-dent until culture data return or imaging studies are completed. Knowledge of the bacteriologic profile of infections in an indi-vidual unit can be obtained from most hospital infection control departments and will suggest potential responsible organisms. Antibiotics should be tailored to cover the responsible organ-isms once culture data are available, and if appropriate, the"

These patients require aggressive medical therapy including ototopical and IV antibiotics targeting Pseudomonas. Other gram-negative bacteria and fungi are occasionally implicated, necessitating culturedirected therapy. Patients who do not respond to medical management require surgical debridement. This condition may progress to involvement of the adjacent skull base and soft tissues, meningitis, brain abscess, and death.Acute otitis media (AOM) typically implies a bacterial infec-tion of the middle ear.4 This diagnosis accounts for 25% of pedi-atric antibiotic prescriptions and is the most common bacterial infection of childhood. Most cases occur before 2 years of age and are secondary to immaturity of the Eustachian tube.
