    "question": "An 18-month-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her mother for vaginal bleeding. The mother states that she noticed the bleeding today, which appeared as brown discharge with clots in the patient\u2019s diaper. The mother denies frequent nosebleeds or easy bruising. She also denies any known trauma. She does mention that the patient has been limping and complaining of left leg pain since a fall 2 months ago. On physical exam, there are multiple 2-3 cm hyperpigmented patches on the patient\u2019s trunk. There is bilateral enlargement of the breasts but no pubic hair. The vaginal orifice is normal and clear with an intact hymen. A plain radiograph of the left lower leg shows patchy areas of lytic bone and sclerosis within the femoral metaphysis. Which of the following is associated with the patient\u2019s most likely diagnosis?",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and the provided options: 1. **Vaginal bleeding in an 18-month-old girl**: This could be indicative of several conditions, including sexual abuse, infection, or a developmental disorder. 2. **Brown discharge with clots and hyperpigmented patches on the trunk**: These findings could suggest a bleeding disorder, infection, or a neoplastic process. 3. **Bilateral enlargement of the breasts without pubic hair**: This is a significant finding, as it suggests early onset of puberty, which could be due to precocious puberty, a condition where puberty begins earlier than usual. 4. **Intact hymen and normal vaginal orifice**: This makes sexual abuse less likely. 5. **Lytic bone lesions in the femoral metaphysis on radiograph**: This finding is crucial and points towards a bone disorder. Now, let's evaluate the options in relation to these findings: A. **Bitemporal hemianopsia**: This is a visual field defect that typically results from damage to the optic chiasm. While it's a significant finding, it's not directly related to the patient's primary symptoms. B. **Hypertension**: There's no mention of blood pressure issues in the patient's history or physical examination. C. **Pheochromocytoma**: This is a tumor of the adrenal gland that can cause hypertension, but it's not directly linked to the patient's presentation of vaginal bleeding, breast enlargement, and bone lesions. D. **Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia**: This is a condition characterized by the replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue, leading to lytic bone lesions, as seen in the patient's radiograph. It can also cause precocious puberty due to hormonal imbalances. The presence of hyperpigmented skin patches (caf\u00e9-au-lait spots) is also a classic finding in this condition. Given the combination of vaginal bleeding, breast enlargement, lytic bone lesions, and hyperpigmented skin patches, **D. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia** is the most likely diagnosis associated with the patient's presentation. Here is the answer in the required format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with vaginal bleeding, early onset of puberty (bilateral breast enlargement), and lytic bone lesions in the femoral metaphysis. These findings, combined with hyperpigmented skin patches, are characteristic of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. This condition is a bone disorder that can cause precocious puberty and lytic bone lesions, making it the most likely diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The examiner should be familiar with the normal appearance of the prepubertal genitalia. The normal unestrogenized hymenal ring and vestibule can appear mildly erythematous. The technique of examination is different from that used for examining an adult and may need to be tailored to the individual child based on her age, size, and comfort with the examiner."

Urethral prolapse can present acutely with a tender mass that may be friable or bleed slightly; it is most common in African American girls and may be confused with a vaginal mass (Fig. 14.2). The classic presentation is a mass symmetrically surrounding the urethra. This condition can be managed medically with the topical application of estrogens (7).

Reflex activity may therefore occur below the injury, but communication with the brain is lost. A 25-year-old woman complained of increasing lumbar back pain. Over the ensuing weeks she was noted to have an enlarging lump in the right groin, which was mildly tender to touch. On direct questioning, the patient also complained of a productive cough with sputum containing mucus and blood, and she had a mild temperature. The chest radiograph revealed a cavitating apical lung mass, which explains the pulmonary history."

Her vital signs include the following: temperature 99.8\u00b0F, blood pressure 132/64 mm Hg, pulse 78 bpm, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, she had left upper abdominal tenderness with evidence of hepatomegaly and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory data revealed the following: alanine aminotransferase, 527 IU/L (normal 10\u201335 IU/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 425 IU/L (normal < 35 IU/L); and bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL (normal 0.1\u20130.3 mg/dL).

New mothers of female infants should be informed of this possibility to preclude unnecessary anxiety. After the neonatal period, a number of causes of bleeding should be considered in the prepubertal age group (Table 14.3). Menses rarely occur before breast budding (5,6). Vaginal bleeding in the absence of secondary sexual characteristics should be evaluated carefully."

A 30-year-old woman came to her doctor with a history of amenorrhea (absence of menses) and galactorrhea (the production of breast milk). She was not pregnant and appeared otherwise fit and well. Serum prolactin was measured. Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland and necessary for the production of breast milk postpartum. This hormone was markedly elevated. Further clinical tests demonstrated visual field defects. The patient went to see an optometrist who performed a visual field assessment and demonstrated a reduction in the lateral aspects of the normal visual fields. This was bilateral and symmetrical\u2014a bilateral temporal hemianopia. The visual pathways have now determined the site of the lesion."

Most sexually abused children have a normal genital examination at the time of the medical evaluation. Genital injuries are seen more commonly in children who present for medical care within 72 hours of their most recent assault and in children who report genital bleeding, but they are diagnosed in only 5% to 10% of sexually abused children. Many types of sexual abuse (fondling, vulvar coitus, oral genital contact) do not injure genital tissue, and genital mucosa heals so rapidly and completely that injuries often heal by the time of the medical examination. For children who present within 72 hours of the most recent assault, special attention should be given to identifying acute injury and the presence of blood or semen on the child. Injuries to the oral mucosa, breasts, or thighs should not be overlooked. Forensic evidence collection is needed in a few cases and has the greatest yield when"
