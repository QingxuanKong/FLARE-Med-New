    "question": "A 95-year-old woman who is a resident at a long term care facility, got up from her chair, tripped on a rug, and fell on her right knee. She could not get up without assistance and complained of severe pain in her right hip and buttock. The nurse who evaluated her tried to stand her up, but when the patient tried to stand on her right leg, she dropped her left hip and lost her balance. The nurse then recognized that her patient had a foreshortened right leg fixed in the adducted position and a large swelling in her right buttock. At the receiving hospital, the patient was confused and, though she knew her name, she couldn\u2019t remember the date and insists to leave the hospital immediately to see her family. Past medical history includes diabetes, congestive heart failure, and incontinence. She is currently taking metformin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and oxybutynin. Physical exam confirmed the nurse\u2019s findings. Radiographs proved the presence of a right posterior hip dislocation without fractures. What medication is most likely associated with this patient\u2019s confusion?",

        "A": "Metformin",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient is a 95-year-old woman who recently fell and has a history of diabetes, congestive heart failure, and incontinence. She is currently taking several medications, including metformin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and oxybutynin. The patient's confusion and inability to remember the date could be related to her medication regimen. We need to evaluate each medication to determine which one is most likely associated with her confusion. First, let's consider metformin (A). Metformin is a biguanide antidiabetic medication that is not typically associated with confusion in older adults. It is possible that metformin could contribute to lactic acidosis, but this is not a common side effect of metformin. Next, let's consider oxybutynin (B). Oxybutynin is an anticholinergic medication used to treat overactive bladder. Anticholinergic medications are known to cause confusion, particularly in older adults. Oxybutynin is a potent anticholinergic agent that can cause cognitive impairment, delirium, and confusion. Now, let's consider metoprolol (C). Metoprolol is a beta-blocker used to treat hypertension and heart failure. Beta-blockers are not typically associated with confusion in older adults. Finally, let's consider lisinopril (D). Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor used to treat hypertension and heart failure. ACE inhibitors are not typically associated with confusion in older adults. Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, oxybutynin is the most likely medication to be associated with her confusion. Oxybutynin's anticholinergic properties can cause cognitive impairment and confusion, particularly in older adults.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

Thus, the diagnosis of kidney disease often surprises patients and may be a cause of skepticism and denial. Particular aspects of the history that are germane to renal disease include a history of hypertension (which can cause CKD or more commonly be a consequence of CKD), diabetes mellitus, abnormal urinalyses, and problems with pregnancy such as preeclampsia or early pregnancy loss. A careful drug history should be elicited: patients may not volunteer use of analgesics, for example. Other drugs to consider include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, antimicrobials, chemotherapeutic agents, antiretroviral agents, proton pump inhibitors, phosphate-containing bowel cathartics, and lithium. In evaluating the uremic syndrome, questions about appetite, weight loss, nausea, hiccups, peripheral edema,"

Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months.

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."
