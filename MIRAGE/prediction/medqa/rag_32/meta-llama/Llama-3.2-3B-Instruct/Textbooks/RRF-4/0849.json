The patient has small cell lung cancer and is experiencing persistent nausea and vomiting after starting chemotherapy. The symptoms improve significantly after the administration of metoclopramide, a dopamine antagonist. This suggests that the chemotherapy is causing nausea and vomiting due to its effect on the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the brain, which is responsible for regulating nausea and vomiting. The CTZ is sensitive to dopamine and serotonin, and dopamine antagonists like metoclopramide can block its activation and alleviate nausea and vomiting. The CTZ is located in the area postrema, a region outside the blood-brain barrier that is not protected by the blood-brain barrier and can detect toxins in the blood. Therefore, the patient's symptoms were most likely due to the effect of etoposide on the area postrema.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

In one randomized trial, 141 patients who were not considered candidates for further IV chemotherapy were randomized to receive either oral topotecan or best supportive care. Although the response rate to oral topotecan was only 7%, overall survival was significantly better in patients receiving chemotherapy (median survival time, 26 weeks vs 14 weeks; p = .01). Moreover, patients given topotecan had a slower decline in quality of life than did those not receiving chemotherapy.

These data launched two decades of clinical research aimed at detecting the optimal chemotherapy regimen for advanced NSCLC. For the most part, however, these efforts proved unsuccessful because the overwhelming majority of randomized trials showed no major survival improvement with any one regimen versus another (Table 107-11). On the other hand, differences in progression-free survival, cost, side effects, and schedule were frequently observed. These first-line studies were later extended to elderly patients, where doublet chemotherapy was found to"

Regimens of combination chemotherapy improved the median survival rates in small cell bronchogenic carcinoma, and these regimens are used for treatment of small cell carcinoma of the cervix. Combination chemotherapy may consist of vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC)or VP-16 (etoposide) and cisplatin (EP) (56). Patients must be monitored carefully because they are at high risk for developing recurrent metastatic disease (57).

He is then switched to celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily, and on this regimen his joint symptoms and heartburn resolve. Two years later, he returns with increased joint symptoms. His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor. With the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, he is started on a regimen"

            "content": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy refers to the use of chemotherapy in patients who present with localized cancer for which alternative local therapies, such as surgery, exist but which have been shown to be less than completely effective. At present, neoadjuvant therapy is most often administered in the treatment of anal cancer, bladder cancer, breast cancer, gastroesophageal cancer, laryngeal cancer, locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), osteogenic sarcoma, and locally advanced rectal cancer. For diseases such as anal cancer, gastroesophageal cancer, laryngeal cancer, NSCLC, and rectal cancer, optimal clinical benefit is derived when chemotherapy is administered with radiation therapy either concurrently or sequentially. The goal of the neoadjuvant approach is to reduce the size of the primary tumor so that surgical resection can be made easier and more effective. In addition, with rectal cancer and laryngeal cancer, the administration of combined modality ther apy prior to"
