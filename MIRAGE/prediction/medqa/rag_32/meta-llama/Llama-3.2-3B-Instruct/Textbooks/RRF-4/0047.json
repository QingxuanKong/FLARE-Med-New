    "question": "A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of tingling pain in the sole of his right foot when he raises it above chest level during exercises. He reports that he started exercising regularly 2 months ago and that his right calf cramps when he uses the incline feature on the treadmill, forcing him to take frequent breaks. The pain completely disappears after resting for a few minutes. He has an 8-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 34 years. His only medication is metformin. His pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 170/92 mm Hg. Straight leg raise test elicits pallor and tingling pain in the right foot. There is no pain in the back. His muscle strength is normal. Femoral pulses are palpable; right pedal pulses are absent. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Femoropopliteal artery stenosis",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: Step 1: Analyze the patient's symptoms - The patient has a 6-week history of tingling pain in the sole of his right foot when he raises it above chest level during exercises, and calf cramps when using the incline feature on the treadmill. These symptoms started after he started exercising regularly 2 months ago. Step 2: Analyze the patient's medical history - The patient has an 8-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a long history of smoking (34 years). He is also taking metformin, which is commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes. Step 3: Consider the physical examination findings - The straight leg raise test elicits pallor and tingling pain in the right foot, indicating a possible vascular issue. The absence of pain in the back and normal muscle strength suggest that the issue is not related to the spine. Step 4: Evaluate the options - - A. Femoropopliteal artery stenosis: This condition is characterized by narrowing of the femoral and popliteal arteries, which supply blood to the legs. The symptoms of tingling pain in the foot and calf cramps during exercise are consistent with this condition. - B. Acute thrombosis of right popliteal vein: This condition involves a blood clot in the popliteal vein, which would more likely present with swelling, redness, and warmth in the affected leg, rather than the patient's symptoms. - C. Lumbar spinal stenosis: This condition involves narrowing of the spinal canal, which would more likely present with back pain and numbness in the legs, rather than the patient's symptoms. - D. Aortoiliac artery stenosis: This condition involves narrowing of the aorta and iliac arteries, which supply blood to the lower extremities. While it could cause similar symptoms, it is less likely given the patient's symptoms are more localized to the foot and calf. Conclusion: The most likely diagnosis is A. Femoropopliteal artery stenosis, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms of tingling pain in the sole of his right foot and calf cramps during exercise, and the physical examination findings of absent pedal pulses. ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of tingling pain in the sole of his right foot and calf cramps during exercise, along with the physical examination findings of absent pedal pulses and positive straight leg raise test, are consistent with femoropopliteal artery stenosis.

For example, buttock, hip, thigh, and calf discomfort occurs in patients with aortoiliac disease, whereas calf claudication develops in patients with femoral-popliteal disease. Symptoms are far more common in the lower than in the upper extremities because of the higher incidence of obstructive lesions in the former region.

He was recently incarcerated near Bakersfield, California and returned to Oakland about 3 months ago. He is currently experiencing one month of severe headache and double vision. He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

Symptoms of carotid territory TIAs include transient monocular blindness (amaurosis), contralateral weakness or numbness, and dys-phasia. Symptoms persisting longer than 24 hours constitute a stroke. In contrast, the patient with chronic mesenteric isch-emia is likely to present with postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss. The patient fears eating because of the pain, avoids food, and loses weight. It is very unlikely that a patient with abdominal pain who has not lost weight has chronic mesenteric ischemia.The patient with lower extremity pain on ambulation has intermittent claudication that occurs in certain muscle groups; for example, calf pain upon exercise usually reflects superficial femoral artery disease, while pain in the buttocks reflects iliac disease. In most cases, the pain manifests in one muscle group below the level of the affected artery, occurs only with exercise, and"

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension.

            "content": "A 45-year-old man with diabetes mellitus visited his nurse because he had an ulcer on his foot that was not healing despite daily dressings. Diabetes can lead to vascular disease of large and medium arteries, narrowing the lumen and reducing blood supply to the extremities, thereby impairing healing. In addition, diabetes can also affect blood supply to nerves, which leads to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy results in reduced sensation, and therefore minor injuries can often go unnoticed. This patient has developed an ulcer on his heel, which is a pressure point and likely to be under repeated strain. The nurse examined the ulcer and found that the ulcer was looking infected with pus at the base of the ulcer and asked for a specialist orthopedic opinion, who requested an x-ray and an MRI. The MRI and x-ray both demonstrated infection invading into the calcaneus with destruction of the bone (Fig. 6.141A,B)."

            "content": "Clinical muscle manifestations in these conditions usually begin in adolescence. Symptoms are precipitated by brief bursts of high-intensity exercise such as running or lifting heavy objects. A history of myalgia and muscle stiffness usually precedes the intensely painful muscle contractures, which may be followed by myoglobinuria. Acute renal failure accompanies significant pigmenturia. Certain features help distinguish some enzyme defects. In McArdle\u2019s disease, exercise tolerance can be enhanced by a slow induction phase (warm-up) or brief periods of rest, allowing for the start of the \u201csecond-wind\u201d phenomenon (switching to utilization of fatty acids). Varying degrees of hemolytic anemia accompany deficiencies of both phosphofructokinase (mild) and phosphoglycerate kinase (severe). In phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency, the usual clinical presentation is a seizure disorder associated with mental retardation; exercise intolerance is an infrequent manifestation."

At the initial examination, blood pressure should be measured in both arms and preferably in the supine, sitting, and standing positions to evaluate for postural hypotension. Even if the femoral pulse is normal to palpation, arterial pressure should be measured at least once in the lower extremity in patients in whom hypertension is discovered before age 30. Heart rate also should be recorded. Hypertensive individuals have an increased prevalence of atrial fibrillation. The neck should be palpated for an enlarged thyroid gland, and patients should be assessed for signs of hypoand hyperthyroidism. Examination of blood vessels may provide clues about underlying vascular disease and should include funduscopic examination, auscultation for bruits over the carotid and femoral arteries, and palpation of femoral and pedal pulses. The retina is the only tissue in which arteries and arterioles can be examined directly. With increasing"

The ADA recommends annual screening for distal symmetric neuropathy beginning with the initial diagnosis of diabetes and annual screening for autonomic neuropathy 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 DM and at the time of diagnosis of type 2 DM. This includes testing for loss of protective sensation (LOPS) using monofilament testing plus one of the following tests: vibration, pinprick, ankle reflexes, or vibration perception threshold (using a biothesiometer).

A 50-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with severe lower back pain that had started several days ago. In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."
