    "question": "A patient is unresponsive in the emergency department following a motor vehicle accident. The patient's written advance directive states that he does not wish to be resuscitated in the event of a cardiac arrest. The patient's wife arrives and demands that \"everything\" be done to keep him alive because she \"can't go on living without him.\" The patient's adult son is on his way to the hospital. If the patient arrests, which of the following should occur?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Respect the wife's wishes and resuscitate the patient",
        "B": "Respect the patient's prior wishes and do not resuscitate",
        "C": "Consult a judge for the final decision on whether or not to resuscitate",
        "D": "Consult the hospital ethics committee"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the patient's written advance directive, the wife's demand, and the laws and principles of informed consent.\\n\\nFirst, we need to identify the type of advance directive. The question states that it is a written advance directive that states the patient does not wish to be resuscitated in the event of a cardiac arrest. This is a valid living will, which is a type of advance directive that outlines the patient's wishes for medical treatment in the event of a terminal illness or permanent loss of functional capacity.\\n\\nSecond, we need to consider the wife's demand. The wife's demand to \\\"everything\\\" be done to keep the patient alive is not in line with the patient's wishes as stated in the advance directive. However, as a family member, the wife may be able to influence the decision-making process.\\n\\nThird, we need to consider the laws and principles of informed consent. In general, a patient's advance directive takes precedence over the wishes of family members. However, in emergency situations, the patient's autonomy may be overridden if the situation is life-threatening and the patient is unable to communicate their wishes. But in this case, the patient is not unresponsive, so they can communicate their wishes.\\n\\nGiven these considerations, the correct answer is to respect the patient's prior wishes and not resuscitate. This is because the patient's advance directive is a legal document that outlines their wishes for medical treatment, and it takes precedence over the wishes of family members in this case.\\n\\nThe other options are incorrect because:\\n\\nA. Respecting the wife's wishes would go against the patient's advance directive and would be a violation of the patient's autonomy.\\n\\nC. Consulting a judge for the final decision is not necessary in this case, as the patient's advance directive is a legal document that outlines their wishes.\\n\\nD. Consulting the hospital ethics committee is also not necessary, as the patient's advance directive is a legal document that takes precedence over the wishes of family members and the hospital's ethics committee.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Respect the patient's prior wishes and do not resuscitate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

First, some commentators suggest that ordinary care should be administered but extraordinary care could be terminated. Because the ordinary/extraordinary distinction is too vague, courts and commentators widely agree that it should not be used to justify decisions about stopping treatment. Second, many courts have advocated the use of the substituted-judgment criterion, which holds that the proxy decision-makers should try to imagine what the incompetent patient would do if he or she were competent. However, multiple studies indicate that many proxies, even close family members, cannot accurately predict what the patient would have wanted.

First it must be determined whether the patient is breathing and has a clear airway and obtainable pulse and blood pressure, and whether there is hemorrhage from a scalp laceration or injured viscera. Severe head injuries that arrest respiration are soon followed by cessation of cardiac function. Injuries of this magnitude are often fatal; if resuscitative measures do not restore and sustain cardiopulmonary function within 4 to 5 min, the brain is usually irreparably damaged. Bleeding from the scalp can usually be controlled by a pressure bandage unless an artery is divided; then a suture becomes necessary. Resuscitative measures (artificial respiration and cardiac compression) should be continued until they are taken over by ambulance personnel. Oxygen should then be administered."

In the remainder, certain points are useful: (1) the circumstances and rapidity with which neurologic symptoms developed; (2) the antecedent symptoms (confusion, weakness, headache, fever, seizures, dizziness, double vision, or vomiting); (3) the use of medications, drugs, or alcohol; and (4) chronic liver, kidney, lung, heart, or other medical disease. Direct interrogation of family, observers, and ambulance technicians on the scene, in person or by telephone, is an important part of the evaluation when possible."

The third type of advance directive allows the designation of a health care proxy (sometimes also referred to as a durable attorney for health care), who is an individual selected by the patient to make decisions. The choice is not either/or; a combined directive that includes a living will and designates a proxy is often used, and the directive should indicate clearly whether the specified patient preferences or the proxy\u2019s choice takes precedence if they conflict. The Five Wishes and the Medical Directive are such combined forms. Some states have begun to put into practice a \u201cPhysician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST)\u201d paradigm, which builds on communication between providers and patients to include guidance for end-of-life care in a color-coordinated form that follows the patient across treatment settings. The procedures for completing advance care planning documents vary according to"

Several surveys have suggested a rate of alcohol dependence of 3 to 5.5 percent of adults. A minimum of 3 percent of deaths in the United States are attributable to alcohol-related causes. More striking, but not at all surprising, is the fact that alcohol intoxication is involved in approximately 45 percent of fatal motor vehicle accidents and 22 percent of boating accidents. It requires little imagination to conceive the havoc wrought by alcohol in terms of suicide, accidents, crime, mental and physical disease, and disruption of family life. Finally, the problems engendered by excessive drinking cannot easily be separated from one another."

Breathing may be quiet or stertorous. This state persists for several minutes, after which the patient opens his eyes, begins to look about, and appears bewildered and is confused and may be quite agitated. The patient may speak and later not remember anything that has been said and undisturbed becomes drowsy and falls asleep, sometimes for several hours, then often awakens with a pulsatile headache. When fully recovered, such a patient has no memory of any part of the spell but knows that something has happened because of the strange surroundings (in ambulance or hospital), the obvious concern of those around him, and often, a sore, bitten tongue and aching muscles from the violent movements. The convulsive contractions, if violent enough, may crush a vertebral body or result in a serious injury; a fracture, periorbital hemorrhages,"
