He has allergic asthma treated with inhaled salbutamol. He immigrated to the USA from Thailand 9 years ago. He lives by himself and works as a waiter in a restaurant. He has had 6 lifetime male sexual partners and uses condoms inconsistently. He drinks 1\u20132 beers daily. His temperature is 38.2\u00b0C (100.8\u00b0F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg. Examination of the mouth shows several white patches on the tongue and oral mucosa that can be easily scraped off with a tongue blade.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and CSF analysis to determine the underlying cause of the patient's neurological symptoms. The patient presents with a 4-week history of fatigue and headache, which have progressively worsened. He has a history of inconsistent condom use and has immigrated from Thailand, increasing the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The patient's symptoms of fatigue, headache, and short-term memory deficits, along with the presence of white patches on the tongue and oral mucosa, are suggestive of oral candidiasis, which is a common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised individuals. The patient's HIV test is positive, indicating immunocompromised status. The CSF analysis shows a high opening pressure, elevated protein concentration, and a low glucose concentration, which are consistent with meningitis. The India ink stain showing organisms with prominent capsules is diagnostic of Cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in HIV/AIDS patients. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with Cryptococcal meningitis, which requires immediate treatment with antifungal medications. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's neurological symptoms is Amphotericin B and flucytosine, which are the standard treatments for Cryptococcal meningitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

The typical profile is a pleocytosis, a normal or slightly elevated protein concentration (0.2\u20130.8 g/L [20\u201380 mg/dL]), a normal glucose concentration, and a normal or mildly elevated opening pressure (100\u2013350 mmH2O). Organisms are not seen on Gram\u2019s stain of CSF. The total CSF cell count in viral meningitis is typically 25\u2013500/\u03bcL, although cell counts of several thousand/\u03bcL are occasionally seen, especially with infections due to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and mumps virus. Lymphocytes are typically the predominant cell. Rarely, PMNs may predominate in the first 48 h of illness, especially with infections due to echovirus 9, West Nile virus, eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus, or mumps.

The combination of unrelenting headache, stiff neck, fatigue, night sweats, and fever with a CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis and a mildly decreased glucose concentration is highly suspicious for tuberculous meningitis. The last tube of fluid collected at LP is the best tube to send for a smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). If there is a pellicle in the CSF or a cobweb-like clot on the surface of the fluid, AFB can best be demonstrated in a smear of the clot or pellicle. Positive smears are typically reported in only 10\u201340% of cases of tuberculous meningitis in adults.

In general, examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reveals a high leukocyte count (up to 1000/\u03bcL), usually with a predominance of lymphocytes but sometimes with a predominance of neutrophils in the early stage; a protein content of 1\u20138 g/L (100\u2013800 mg/dL); and a low glucose concentration. However, any of these three parameters can be within the normal range. AFBs are infrequently seen on direct smear of CSF sediment, and repeated lumbar punctures increase the yield. Culture of CSF is diagnostic in up to 80% of cases and remains the gold standard. Real-time automated nucleic acid amplification (the Xpert MTB/RIF assay; see \u201cNucleic Acid Amplification Technology,\u201d below) has a sensitivity of up to 80% and is the preferred initial diagnostic option. Treatment should be initiated immediately upon a positive Xpert MTB/RIF result. A negative result does not exclude a diagnosis of TB and requires further diagnostic workup. Imaging studies"

Some infants with neonatal meningitis caused by group B streptococci do not have an elevated CSF leukocyte count but are seen to have microorganisms in the CSF on Gram stain. In addition to culture, other methods of identifying the pathogenic bacteria are the determination of bacterial antigen in samples of blood, urine, or CSF.

He has been generally healthy, is sedentary, drinks several cocktails per day, and does not smoke cigarettes. He has a family history of hypertension, and his father died of a myocardial infarction at age 55. Physical examination is remarkable only for moderate obesity. Total cholesterol is 220, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level is 40 mg/dL. Fasting glucose is 105 mg/dL. Chest X-ray is normal. Electrocardiogram shows left ven-tricular enlargement.

The patient had noted progressive weakness over several days, to the point that he was unable to rise from bed. Past medical history was notable for small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, liver, and adrenals. The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced. Blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, increasing to 160/98 mmHg after 1 L of saline, with a JVP at 8 cm. There was generalized muscle weakness.

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

The CSF protein content is high, (100 to 400 mg/100 mL or more) but the glucose is normal. Elevation of the sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and peripheral neutrophilic leukocytosis are additional indicators to the diagnosis. The last of these tests is abnormal in two-thirds of cases. Blood cultures demonstrate the organism in a similar proportion. Cultures from the CSF are infrequently positive. The decades old series reported by Baker and colleagues is still a valuable reference, as is the more recent discussion by Darouiche.

The cells are mostly lymphocytes, but there may be a significant number of neutrophils early on. In a few cases, 3 to 5 percent in some large series, the spinal fluid was normal in the first days of the illness, only to become abnormal when reexamined. The hemorrhagic nature of brain tissue destruction with this infection is infrequently reflected in the spinal fluid. In fact, in only a minority of cases, red cells, sometimes numbering in the thousands but usually far fewer, and xanthochromia are found. The protein content is increased in most cases. Rarely, the CSF glucose levels may be reduced to slightly less than 40 mg/dL, creating confusion with tuberculous and fungal meningitides. The cerebral imaging appearance, giving highly characteristic features, is discussed later in the section on \u201cDiagnosis.\u201d"
