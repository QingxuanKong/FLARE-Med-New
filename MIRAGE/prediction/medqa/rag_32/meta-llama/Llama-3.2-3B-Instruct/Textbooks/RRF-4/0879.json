    "question": "A 15-year-old girl comes to the physician because she has not had menstrual bleeding for the past 3 months. Menses had previously occurred at irregular 15\u201345 day intervals with moderate to heavy flow. Menarche was at the age of 14 years. She started having sexual intercourse with her boyfriend about 3 months ago. Six months ago she had a manic episode, which was treated with risperidone. Her mother has PCOS and her father has diabetes mellitus. She is very conscious of her weight and appearance. She is 171 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 79 kg (174 lb); BMI is 27.02 kg/m2. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 60/min, and blood pressure is 116/70 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Pelvic examination shows a normal vagina and cervix. Serum hormone studies show:\nProlactin 16 ng/mL\nThyroid-stimulating hormone 3.8 \u03bcU/mL\nFollicle-stimulating hormone 6 mIU/mL\nLuteinizing hormone 5.1 mIU/mL\nProgesterone 0.8 ng/mL (follicular N <3; luteal N >3\u20135)\nTestosterone 2.2 nmol/L (N <3.5)\nA urine pregnancy test is negative.

The patient's prolactin level is normal, and the serum hormone studies show a low progesterone level, indicating anovulation. The patient's symptoms of amenorrhea and irregular menstrual cycles are consistent with anovulation. The patient's history of manic episode and the use of risperidone, an antipsychotic medication, suggests a possible side effect of the medication on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. The patient's normal prolactin level and other hormone studies do not support a prolactinoma or other endocrine disorders. The patient's history of PCOS in her mother and diabetes in her father may be relevant, but the patient's low progesterone level and normal prolactin level do not support a diagnosis of PCOS. The patient's normal vagina and cervix on pelvic examination also make uterine fibroids or other anatomic abnormalities less likely. The patient's symptoms and hormone studies are most consistent with anovulation, likely caused by the side effect of risperidone on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" ``` The final answer is D.

Clomiphene citrate fails to stimulate a rise in LH, as it does normally. Administration of gonadotropic-releasing factor raises the LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, suggesting a hypothalamic disorder. The basal metabolic rate is low; triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are low, while levels of physiologically inactive 3,3,5-triiodothyronine (reverse T3) are normal or increased. Plasma thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) and growth hormone levels are normal. Serum cortisol levels are usually normal; excretion of 17-hydroxysteroids is slightly reduced. In sum, there is evidence of hypothalamic\u2013pituitary dysfunction, but this is probably secondary to starvation, as indicated by the study of Scheithauer and colleagues who found no definite changes in the pituitary gland in 12 fatal cases."

These disorders, which include ovulatory dysfunction and abnormalities of the uterus or outflow tract, may present as amenorrhea or as irregular or short menstrual cycles. A careful history and physical examination and a limited number of laboratory tests will help to determine whether the abnormality is (1) hypothalamic or pituitary (low follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], and estradiol with or without an increase in prolactin), (2) polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS; irregular cycles and hyperandrogenism in the absence of other causes of androgen excess), (3) ovarian (low estradiol with increased FSH), or (4) a uterine or outflow tract abnormality. The frequency of these diagnoses depends on whether the amenorrhea is primary or occurs after normal puberty and menarche (see Fig. 69-2)."

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

The physical examination may be particularly helpful in patients with Turner syndrome. A history of short stature but consistent growth rate, a family history of delayed puberty, and normal physical findings (including assessment of smell, optic discs, and visual fields) may suggest physiologic delay. Headaches, visual disturbances, short stature, symptoms of diabetes insipidus, and weakness of one or more limbs suggest central nervous system lesions (38). Galactorrhea may be seen with prolactinomas, a condition more commonly associated with secondary amenorrhea in the presence of normal secondary sexual characteristics. The diagnostic workup is summarized as follows: 1."

The most important elements in the diagnosis of amenorrhea include physical examination for secondary sexual characteristics and anatomic abnormalities, measurement of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to rule out pregnancy, serum prolactin and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, and assessment of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels to differentiate between hypergonadotropic and hypogonadotropic forms of hypogonadism."

Focused History: Ten days ago, CR had her spleen removed following a bicycle accident in which she fractured her tibial eminence, necessitating immobilization of the right knee. She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

The history usually discloses that menarche had occurred at the appropriate age; primary amenorrhea is rare. A common history is that the patient took birth control pills, only to find, when she stopped, that the menstrual cycle did not reestablish itself. On examination, there may be no abnormalities other than galactorrhea. Serum prolactin concentrations are increased (usually in excess of 100 ng/mL). In general, the longer the duration of amenorrhea and the higher the serum prolactin level, the larger the tumor (prolactinoma). The elevated prolactin levels distinguish this disorder from idiopathic galactorrhea, in which the serum prolactin concentration is normal."
