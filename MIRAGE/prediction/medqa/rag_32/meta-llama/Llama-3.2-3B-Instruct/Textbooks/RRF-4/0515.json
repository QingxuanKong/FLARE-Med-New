However, in the context of a recent sore throat and rash, we should consider infectious causes that can lead to cardiac manifestations.\\n\\nThe rash described as pink rings on the torso and inner surfaces of the limbs is a classic description of erythema marginatum, a characteristic rash associated with acute rheumatic fever (ARF).\\n\\nARF is a complication of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection, which is often preceded by a sore throat. The presence of a holosystolic murmur and the history of recent sore throat strongly suggest ARF.\\n\\nIn ARF, the cardiac involvement can lead to various histopathologic changes, but one of the hallmark findings is the presence of Aschoff bodies, which are granulomas with giant cells.

The rash is evanescent, appearing and disappearing before the examiner\u2019s eyes. It occurs usually on the trunk, sometimes on the limbs, but almost never on the face. Subcutaneous nodules occur as painless, small (0.5\u20132 cm), mobile lumps beneath the skin overlying bony prominences, particularly of the hands, feet, elbows, occiput, and occasionally the vertebrae. They are a delayed manifestation, appearing 2\u20133 weeks after the onset of disease, last for just a few days up to 3 weeks, and are commonly associated with carditis. Fever occurs in most cases of ARF, although rarely in cases of pure chorea. Although high-grade fever (\u226539\u00b0C) is the rule, lower grade temperature elevations are not uncommon. Elevated acute-phase reactants are also present in most cases."

The patient\u2019s age, sex, occupation, exposure to pets, sexual behavior, and use of drugs such as diphenylhydantoin are other important historic points. For example, children and young adults usually have benign (i.e., nonmalignant) disorders that account for the observed lymphadenopathy such as viral or bacterial upper respiratory infections; infectious mononucleosis; toxoplasmosis; and, in some countries, tuberculosis. In contrast, after age 50, the incidence of malignant disorders increases and that of benign disorders decreases."

The rash typically begins on the first or second day of illness over the upper trunk, spreading to involve the extremities but sparing the palms and soles. The rash is made up of minute papules, giving a characteristic \u201csandpaper\u201d feel to the skin. Associated findings include circumoral pallor, \u201cstrawberry tongue\u201d (enlarged papillae on a coated tongue, which later may become denuded), and accentuation of the rash in skinfolds (Pastia\u2019s lines). Subsidence of the rash in 6\u20139 days is followed after several days by desquamation of the palms and soles. The differential diagnosis of scarlet fever includes other causes of fever and generalized rash, such as measles and other viral exanthems, Kawasaki disease, TSS, and systemic allergic reactions (e.g., drug eruptions)."

            "content": "In adults, the most frequently reported illness has been acute respiratory disease caused by adenovirus types 4 and 7 in military recruits. This illness is marked by a prominent sore throat and the gradual onset of fever, which often reaches 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F) on the second or third day of illness. Cough is almost always present, and coryza and regional lymphadenopathy are frequently seen. Physical examination may show pharyngeal edema, injection, and tonsillar enlargement with little or no exudate. If pneumonia has developed, auscultation and x-ray of the chest may indicate areas of patchy infiltration."

            "content": "The physical examination should be methodical and thorough, with consideration given to the patient\u2019s comfort and modesty. Although attention is often directed by the history to the diseased organ or part of the body, the examination of a new patient must extend from head to toe in an objective search for abnormalities. Unless the physical examination is systematic and is performed consistently from patient to patient, important segments may be omitted inadvertently. The results of the examination, like the details of the history, should be recorded at the time they are elicited\u2014not hours later, when they are subject to the distortions of memory. Skill in physical diagnosis is acquired with experience, but it is not merely technique that determines success in eliciting signs of disease. The detection of a few scattered petechiae, a faint diastolic murmur, or a small mass in the abdomen is not a question of keener eyes and ears or more sensitive fingers but of a mind alert to those"

After an incubation period of 6\u201321 days, onset is characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Some patients recover spontaneously after a few days. The classic case description includes an eschar where the chigger has fed, regional lymphadenopathy, and a maculopapular rash\u2014signs that are seldom seen in indigenous patients. Fewer than 50% of Westerners develop an eschar, and fewer than 40% develop a rash (on day 4\u20136 of illness). Severe 1159 cases typically manifest with encephalitis and interstitial pneumonia due to vascular injury. The case-fatality rate for untreated classic cases is 7% but would probably be lower if all mild cases were diagnosed."

The dramatic increase in the number of serologic diagnostics, antigen tests, and molecular diagnostics available to the physician has, in fact, revolutionized medical care. However, all of these tests should be viewed as adjuncts to the history and physical examination\u2014not a replacement for them. The selection of initial tests should be based directly on the patient\u2019s history and physical exam findings. Moreover, diagnostic testing should generally be limited to those conditions that are reasonably likely and treatable, important in terms of public health considerations, and/ or capable of providing a definitive diagnosis that will consequently limit other testing."
