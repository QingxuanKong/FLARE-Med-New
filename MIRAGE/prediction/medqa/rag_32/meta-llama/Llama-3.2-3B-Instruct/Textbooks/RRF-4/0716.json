        "A": "Direct tissue damage by irradiated antibiotic agent",
        "B": "Cytotoxic T-cell destruction of antigen-tagged cells",

        "D": "Mast cell activation in subcutaneous tissues"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking for the given question: The patient is an 18-year-old woman who has been treated with ceftriaxone for pyelonephritis. She presents with a pruritic rash on her back, which started after starting the antibiotic. The rash is likely associated with the antibiotic treatment. Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. One of the known side effects of cephalosporins, including ceftriaxone, is a skin rash, which is often referred to as a \"cephalosporin rash\" or \"cefalexin rash.\" This type of rash is typically a maculopapular or erythematous rash that can appear within 1-2 weeks after starting the antibiotic. The rash is thought to be caused by an immune-mediated reaction to the antibiotic, which is believed to be related to the activation of T-cells that recognize the antibiotic as foreign. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Direct tissue damage by irradiated antibiotic agent: This is not a known mechanism of action for ceftriaxone. B. Cytotoxic T-cell destruction of antigen-tagged cells: While this is a mechanism of action for some antibiotics, it is not the primary mechanism for ceftriaxone-induced rash. C. Hyperpermeability of superficial dermal microvasculature: This is a known mechanism for the cefalexin rash, which is a similar type of rash caused by other cephalosporins. D. Mast cell activation in subcutaneous tissues: This is not a known mechanism for ceftriaxone-induced rash. Based on this analysis, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's rash is likely associated with the antibiotic treatment, ceftriaxone, which is a known cause of a maculopapular or erythematous rash due to hyperpermeability of superficial dermal microvasculature.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid.

The distinctive features of erysipelas are well-defined indurated margins, particularly along the nasolabial fold; rapid progression; and intense pain. Flaccid bullae may develop during the second or third day of illness, but extension to deeper soft tissues is rare. Treatment with penicillin is effective; swelling may progress despite appropriate treatment, although fever, pain, and the intense red color diminish. Desquamation of the involved skin occurs 5\u201310 days into the illness. Infants and elderly adults are most commonly afflicted, and the severity of systemic toxicity varies."

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula.

Cough is prominent, developing in 70% of patients. Myalgias are usually severe. A rash begins on the upper trunk, usually on the fifth day, and then becomes generalized, involving the entire body except the face, palms, and soles. Initially, this rash is macular; without treatment, it becomes maculopapular, petechial, and confluent. The rash often goes undetected in black skin; 60% of African patients have spotless epidemic typhus. Photophobia, with considerable conjunctival injection and eye pain, is common. The tongue may be dry, brown, and furred. Confusion and coma are common. Skin necrosis and gangrene of the digits as well as interstitial pneumonia may occur in severe cases.

Individual lesions begin as red papules, which evolve quickly into vesicular and then pustular lesions that break down and coalesce to form characteristic honeycomb-like crusts (Fig. 173-3). Lesions generally are not painful, and patients do not appear ill. Fever is not a feature of impetigo and, if present, suggests either infection extending to deeper tissues or another diagnosis. The classic presentation of impetigo usually poses little diagnostic difficulty. Cultures of impetiginous lesions often yield S. aureus as well as GAS. In almost all cases, streptococci are isolated initially and staphylococci appear later, presumably as secondary colonizing flora. In the past, penicillin was nearly always effective against these infections. However, an increasing frequency of penicillin treatment failure suggests that S. aureus may have become more prominent as a cause of impetigo. Bullous impetigo due to S. aureus is distinguished from typical"

In patients with penicillin allergy demonstrated by skin testing, desensitization and treatment with penicillin are recommended. Management of Syphilis in Pregnancy Every pregnant woman should undergo a nontreponemal test at her first prenatal visit and, if at high risk of exposure, again in the third trimester and at delivery. In the untreated pregnant patient with presumed syphilis, expeditious treatment appropriate to the stage of the disease is essential. Patients should be warned of the risk of a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, which may be associated with mild premature contractions but rarely results in premature delivery."
