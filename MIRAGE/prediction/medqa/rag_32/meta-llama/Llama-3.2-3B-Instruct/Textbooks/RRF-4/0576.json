    "question": "A 32-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her friend for acute onset abdominal pain. She states that she was in a kickboxing class when she suddenly developed left-sided abdominal pain. Her past medical history is significant for chlamydia. She is currently sexually active and does not use contraception. Her menstrual periods occur regularly every 30 days. Her last menstrual period ended 2 days ago. The patient\u2019s temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/68 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 14/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. On physical exam, there is left-sided, lower abdominal tenderness and guarding. Pelvic examination is notable for clear mucous in the vaginal introitus and tenderness of the left adnexa. A pelvic ultrasound with Doppler reveals a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and history: 1. **Acute onset of left-sided abdominal pain**: This symptom can be associated with several conditions, including ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and ruptured ovarian cyst. 2. **Recent sexual activity and lack of contraception**: This increases the risk of sexually transmitted infections, including chlamydia, which can lead to PID. 3. **Regular menstrual cycles and current menstrual period**: This makes an ectopic pregnancy less likely, as it typically occurs earlier in the cycle. 4. **Left-sided abdominal tenderness and guarding**: This finding is nonspecific but can be seen in all three conditions. 5. **Pelvic examination findings**: The presence of clear mucous in the vaginal introitus and tenderness of the left adnexa suggests a pelvic process. 6. **Pelvic ultrasound with Doppler showing a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch**: This finding is highly suggestive of a ruptured ovarian cyst or ectopic pregnancy, as it indicates fluid accumulation in the peritoneal cavity. Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is a **ruptured ovarian cyst** (Option D). Ectopic pregnancy (Option A) is less likely due to the patient's regular menstrual cycles and the timing of the pain. Ovarian torsion (Option B) is also possible but less likely given the presence of fluid in the rectouterine pouch, which is more consistent with a ruptured cyst. Pelvic inflammatory disease (Option C) is also a possibility but less likely given the lack of fever and other systemic symptoms. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D. Ruptured ovarian cyst.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The pain is similar to labor, with suprapubic cramping, and may be accompanied by lumbosacral backache, pain radiating down the anterior thigh, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and rarely syncopal episodes. The pain of dysmenorrhea is colicky in nature and, unlike abdominal pain that is caused by chemical or infectious peritonitis, is relieved by abdominal massage, counter-pressure, or movement of the body. On examination, the vital signs are normal. The suprapubic region may be tender to palpation. Bowel sounds are normal, and there is no upper abdominal tenderness and no abdominal rebound tenderness. Bimanual examination at the time of the dysmenorrheic episode often reveals uterine tenderness; severe pain does not occur with movement of the cervix or palpation of the adnexal structures. The pelvic organs are normal in primary dysmenorrhea."

The symptoms and signs of appendicitis can be similar to those of PID, but the nausea and emesis are often more prominent with appendicitis. The first symptom of appendicitis is typically diffuse abdominal pain, periumbilical pain, followed by anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Within a matter of hours, the pain generally shifts to the right lower quadrant. Fever, chills, emesis, and obstipation (no \ufb02atus or stool per rectum) may ensue. However, this classic symptom pattern is often absent. Atypical abdominal pain can occur when the appendix is retrocecal or entirely within the true pelvis (which occurs in 15% of the population).

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

            "content": "Symptoms The majority of women with epithelial ovarian cancer have vague and nonspecific symptoms (3,85\u201387). In early-stage disease, if the patient is premenopausal, she may experience irregular menses. If a pelvic mass is compressing the bladder or rectum, she may report urinary frequency or constipation (85\u201387). Occasionally, she may perceive lower abdominal distention, pressure, or pain, such as dyspareunia. Acute symptoms, such as pain secondary to rupture or torsion, are unusual. In advanced-stage disease, patients have symptoms related to the presence of ascites, omental metastases, or bowel metastases. The symptoms include abdominal distention, bloating, constipation, nausea, anorexia, or early satiety. Premenopausal women may report irregular or heavy menses, whereas vaginal bleeding may occur in postmenopausal women (86)."

            "content": "The patient gave no history of these disorders. Upon further questioning, however, the patient revealed that her last menstrual period was 6 weeks before this examination. The senior physician realized that a potential cause of the abdominal pain was a pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). The patient was rushed for an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed no fetus or sac in the uterus. She was also noted to have a positive pregnancy test. The patient underwent surgery and was found to have a ruptured fallopian tube caused by an ectopic pregnancy. Whenever a patient has apparent pelvic pain, it is important to consider the gender-related anatomical differences. Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age."

She is obese (body mass index [BMI] 33), does not exercise, and spends a good portion of her work day in a seated position. She eats a low-sugar diet and regularly eats packaged frozen meals for dinner because she doesn\u2019t have time to cook regularly. Her most recent laboratory values include a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that is above goal at 160 mg/dL (goal < 100 mg/dL) and a hemo-globin A1c that is well controlled at 6%. Her blood pressure is high at 160/100 mm Hg. Her prescription medications include simvastatin, metformin, and benazepril. She also takes over-the-counter ibuprofen for occasional knee pain and a multivitamin supplement once daily. She has heard good things about natural products and asks you if taking a garlic supplement daily could help to bring her blood"

            "content": "Vital signs are usually normal, although a low-grade temperature and mild tachycardia can be present with degeneration. Abdominal or bimanual examination and ultrasound reveal an irregular solid mass or masses arising from the uterus. If degeneration occurs, the in\ufb02ammation can cause abdominal tenderness in response to palpation and mild localized rebound tenderness. With degeneration there is usually leukocytosis. Ultrasound can distinguish adnexal from uterine etiology of an eccentric mass. If diagnosis is still uncertain, a pelvic MRI is more accurate (27). The fibroid can be excised laparoscopically; however, surgery is not mandatory. A submucous leiomyoma with pain and hemorrhage should be excised transcervically with hysteroscopic guidance."

            "content": "Ileus is usually manifested by abdominal distention and should be evaluated by physical examination. Pertinent points of the abdominal examination include assessment of the quality of bowel sounds and palpation in search of distension, masses, tenderness, or rebound. The possibility that the patient\u2019s signs and symptoms may be associated with a more serious intestinal obstruction or intestinal complication (such as a perforation) must be considered. Pelvic examination should be performed to evaluate the possibility of a pelvic abscess or hematoma that may contribute to the ileus. Abdominal radiography to evaluate the abdomen in the \ufb02at (supine) position and in the upright position will aid in the diagnosis of an ileus. The most common radiographic findings include dilated loops of small and large bowel and air-\ufb02uid levels while the patient is in the upright position. Sometimes, massive dilation of the colon or stomach may be noted. The remote possibility of distal colonic obstruction"

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"
