    "question": "A 6-day-old male newborn is brought to the physician because he has become increasingly irritable and restless over the past 2 days. During this period, he has had 12 bowel movements. He feeds 10 to 12 times a day. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation and weighed 1800 g (3 lb 15 oz); he currently weighs 1700 g (3 lb 12 oz). His mother has Graves' disease and received propylthiouracil during the last trimester of pregnancy. She has a history of intravenous heroin use. His temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse is 180/min, and respirations are 50/min. Examination shows mild diaphoresis and a firm 2-cm midline neck swelling. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

He was born at 38 weeks' gestation and has a history of maternal Graves' disease treated with propylthiouracil during pregnancy. The patient's symptoms and signs suggest hyperthyroidism, which can be congenital or acquired. Given the mother's history of intravenous heroin use, there is a possibility of neonatal abstinence syndrome. However, the primary concern is the potential for congenital hyperthyroidism due to maternal propylthiouracil exposure. The patient's symptoms and signs, such as irritability, increased bowel movements, and feeding frequency, are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The firm midline neck swelling suggests a goiter, which is a common finding in hyperthyroidism. The next step in management is to confirm the diagnosis and consider treatment options for congenital hyperthyroidism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"} The reasoning is as follows: * The patient's symptoms and signs suggest hyperthyroidism, which can be congenital or acquired. * The patient's history of maternal Graves' disease treated with propylthiouracil during pregnancy makes congenital hyperthyroidism a possibility. * The patient's symptoms and signs, such as irritability, increased bowel movements, and feeding frequency, are consistent with hyperthyroidism. * The firm midline neck swelling suggests a goiter, which is a common finding in hyperthyroidism. * The next step in management is to confirm the diagnosis and consider treatment options for congenital hyperthyroidism. * Methimazole and propranolol therapy is the most appropriate next step, as it is commonly used to treat congenital hyperthyroidism in neonates. * Potassium iodide therapy is not typically used to treat congenital hyperthyroidism in neonates. * Naloxone therapy is used to treat opioid overdose, which is not suspected in this case. * Calcium gluconate therapy is not indicated in this scenario.",

Current World Health Organization (2013) recommendations are to exclusively breastfeed for the first 6 months of life with partial breastfeeding until 2 years of age. Neonatal infection, especially in its early stages, may be dificult to diagnose because these newborns often fail to express classic clinical signs. If the fetus was infected in utero, there may be depression and acidosis at birth for no apparent reason. The neonate may suck poorly, vomit, or show abdominal distention. Respiratory insuiciency can develop, which may present similarly to idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome. he neonate may be lethargic or jittery. he response to sepsis may be hypothermia rather than hyperthermia, and the total leukocyte and neutrophil counts may be depressed."

It is often possible to stop treatment in the last trimester because TSIs tend to decline in pregnancy. Nonetheless, the transplacental transfer of these antibodies rarely causes fetal or neonatal thyrotoxicosis. Poor intrauterine growth, a fetal heart rate of >160 beats/min, and high levels of maternal TSI in the last trimester may herald this complication. Antithyroid drugs given to the mother can be used to treat the fetus and may be needed for 1\u20133 months after delivery, until the maternal antibodies disappear from the baby\u2019s circulation. The postpartum period is a time of major risk for relapse of Graves\u2019 disease. Breast-feeding is safe with low doses of antithyroid drugs. Graves\u2019 disease in children is usually managed with methimazole or carbimazole (avoid propylthiouracil), often given as a prolonged 2297 course of the titration regimen. Surgery or radioiodine may be indicated for"

Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

Fetal movements then declined to an average of 282 at 40 weeks. Normal weekly maternal counts of fetal movements ranged between 50 and 950. Count showed large daily variations, with included counts as low as 4 to 10 per 12-hour period in normal pregnancies. Diminished fetal activity may be a harbinger ofimpending fetal death (Sadovsky, 1973). To quantiy fetal movement, clinical methods include use of a uterine contraction tocodynamometer, visualization with sonography, and maternal subjective perceptions."
