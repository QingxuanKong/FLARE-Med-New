He was born at 38 weeks' gestation by cesarean section because of breech presentation. The pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios. Examination shows concavity of the medial border of the left foot with a skin crease just below the ball of the great toe. The lateral border of the left foot is convex. The heel is in neutral position. Tickling the lateral border of the foot leads to correction of the deformity. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the left foot shows an increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",

This clinical presentation is highly suggestive of metatarsus adductus, a common foot disorder in infants caused by in utero positioning. The fact that the deformity corrects with tickling of the lateral border of the foot further supports this diagnosis. Given the age of the patient and the non-surgical nature of the condition, the most appropriate next step in management is reassurance, as most cases of metatarsus adductus resolve spontaneously by 12-18 months of age without requiring any treatment. The other options are not appropriate as initial management for this condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Occurring equally in boys and girls, it is more common in first-born children because of the smaller primigravid uterus. Two percent of infants with metatarsus adductus have developmental dysplasia of the hip. The forefoot is adducted and sometimes supinated, but the midfoot and hindfoot are normal. The lateral border of the foot is convex, while the medial border is concave. Ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion are normal. With the midfoot and hindfoot stabilized, the deformity can be pushed beyond a neutral position (into abduction). Older children may present with an in-toeing gait."

The finger, upon removal from the anus, may be stained with meconium. The mouth and malar eminences form a triangular shape, whereas the ischial tuberosities and anus lie in a straight line. With a complete breech, the feet may be felt alongside the buttocks. In footling presentations, one or both feet are inferior to the buttocks."

            "content": "he prevalence of clubfoot approximates 1 in 1000 births, and the male:female ratio is 2:1 (Carey, 2003; Pavone, 2012). Clubfoot is bilateral in approximately 50 percent of afected individuals, and associated anomalies are present in at least 50 percent of all cases (lvfammen, 2004; Sharma, 201i1). Frequently associated anomalies include neuraltube defects, arthrogryposis, and myotonic dystrophy and other genetic syndromes. In cases with associated anomalies, aneuploidy is found in approximately 30 percent. In contrast, the rate is <4 percent when clubfoot appears isolated (Lauson, 2010; Sharma, 2011). hus, a careful search for associated structural abnormalities is warranted, and chromosomal microarray analysis may be considered.

With talipes equinovarus, the foot \"print\" is visible in the same plane as the tibia and fibula."

            "content": "Torsional (in-toeing and out-toeing) and angular (physiologic bowlegs and knock knees) variations in the legs are common reasons that parents seek medical attention for their child. Most of these concerns are physiologic and resolve with normal growth. Understanding the natural history allows physicians to reassure the family and to identify nonphysiologic disorders that necessitate further intervention. Physiologic disturbances are referred to as variations; pathologic disturbances are called deformities. The femur is internally rotated (anteversion) about 30\u00b0 at birth, decreasing to about 10\u00b0 at maturity. The tibia begins with up to 30\u00b0 of internal rotation at birth and can decrease to a mean of 15\u00b0 at maturity. Torsional variations should not cause a limp or pain. Unilateral torsion raises the index of suspicion for a neurologic (hemiplegia) or neuromuscular disorder. Available @ StudentConsult.com In-Toeing, Out-Toeing, and Toe-Walking"

On examination there was absence of dorsiflexion, a sensory disturbance over the lateral aspect of the leg and foot, and obvious wasting of the fibular muscles. As the patient walked, the foot was dragged between steps. A clinical diagnosis of footdrop was made and a common fibular nerve injury was diagnosed. The injury occurred at the time of surgery."

Release of an impacted fetal head raises the risk of hysterotomy extension, of associated blood loss, and of fetal skull fracture. In FIGURE 30-6 Delivery of the fetal head. this situation, there are three considerations for delivery. First, a \"push\" method may be used. With this, upward pressure exerted by a hand in the vagina by an assistant will help to dislodge the head and allow its delivery above the symphysis. If this is anticipated, a patient in frog-leg position may allow easier vaginal access. Second, as an alternative, a \"pull\" method grasps the fetal legs to bring them through the hysterotomy. he fetus is then delivered by traction as one would complete a breech extraction."
