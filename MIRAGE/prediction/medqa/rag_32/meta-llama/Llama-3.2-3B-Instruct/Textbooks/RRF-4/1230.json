    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with lower abdominal pain, fever, and nausea, and has a history of constipation. The CT scan shows segmental wall thickening of the descending colon with multiple diverticula and a 5.0-cm, low-attenuation pelvic lesion with air-fluid levels. The CT-guided drainage of the fluid collection yields 250 mL of yellow-greenish fluid. These findings are suggestive of diverticulitis, and the yellow-greenish fluid is likely to be infected. Diverticulitis is a common cause of lower abdominal pain and fever, especially in older adults. The presence of air-fluid levels in the CT scan further supports this diagnosis. The yellow-greenish color of the fluid is consistent with the presence of pus and debris. The question asks which substance is most likely responsible for the formation of the drained lesion. The correct answer is related to the infection and inflammation caused by the diverticulitis. Staphylococcal coagulase is an enzyme produced by Staphylococcus aureus, which can cause a variety of infections, including abscesses. Lipoteichoic acid is a component of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus. Interleukin-3 is a cytokine involved in the inflammatory response, but it is not directly related to the formation of abscesses. Lysosomal enzymes are involved in the breakdown of cellular components, but they are not directly responsible for the formation of abscesses in this context. Therefore, the most likely substance responsible for the formation of the drained lesion is lipoteichoic acid, which is a component of the cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of diverticulitis and abscesses.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

Postsurgical intra-abdominal abscesses can present with vague complaints of intermittent abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis, and a change in bowel habits. Depending on the type and timing of the original pro-cedure, the clinical assessment of these complaints is some-times difficult, and a CT scan is usually required.

The infant may appear systemically ill, with decreased urine output, hypotension, tachycardia, and noncardiac pulmonary edema. Hematologic evaluation reveals either leukocytosis or leukope-nia, an increase in the number of bands, and thrombocytopenia. An increase in the blood urea nitrogen and plasma creatinine level may be found, which signify the development of renal dys-function. The diagnosis of NEC may be confirmed by abdomi-nal radiography. The pathognomonic radiographic finding in NEC is pneumatosis intestinalis, which represents invasion of the ischemic mucosa by gas producing microbes (Fig. 39-19). Other findings include the presence of ileus or portal venous gas. The latter is a transient finding that indicates the presence of severe NEC with intestinal necrosis. A fixed loop of bowel may be seen on serial abdominal radiographs, which suggests the possibility"

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

However, intraoperitoneal duodenal perforations require surgical repair with pyloric exclusion and gastrojeju-nostomy or tube duodenostomy.
