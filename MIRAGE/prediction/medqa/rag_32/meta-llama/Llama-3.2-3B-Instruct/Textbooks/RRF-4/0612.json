    "question": "A 33-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with bilateral joint pain. She says that the pain has been slowly worsening over the past 3 days. Otherwise, she complains of fatigue, a subjective fever, and a sunburn on her face which she attributes to gardening. The patient is an immigrant from Spain and works as an office assistant. She is not aware of any chronic medical conditions and takes a multivitamin daily. Her temperature is 98.7\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/64 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals bilateral redness over the maxillary prominences. Which of the following is most likely to be seen in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Decreased complement levels",
        "B": "Increased anti-centromere antibodies",
        "C": "Increased anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies",

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and history: 1. The patient presents with bilateral joint pain, fatigue, subjective fever, and a sunburn on her face, which she attributes to gardening. 2. The patient is an immigrant from Spain and works as an office assistant, which may suggest exposure to certain pathogens more common in certain regions. 3. The patient has no known chronic medical conditions and takes a multivitamin daily. 4. The physical exam reveals bilateral redness over the maxillary prominences, which is a classic sign of erythema multiforme (EM). 5. EM is a skin condition characterized by target lesions, often accompanied by joint pain, fever, and other systemic symptoms. Considering these points, let's evaluate the answer choices: A. Decreased complement levels: This is not directly related to the patient's presentation of EM. B. Increased anti-centromere antibodies: These antibodies are associated with limited systemic scleroderma, not EM. C. Increased anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies: These antibodies are associated with rheumatoid arthritis, not EM. D. Increased anti-topoisomerase antibodies: These antibodies are associated with systemic sclerosis, not EM. Given the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is erythema multiforme (EM), which is often associated with infections, medications, or other triggers. The patient's recent sunburn and exposure to the sun could be a trigger for EM, although it is not the most common cause. EM is also associated with infections, but there is no clear indication of an infectious cause in this case. The patient's joint pain and fatigue may be related to the EM, but they are not the primary symptoms. In summary, the correct answer is not explicitly listed among the options. However, based on the patient's presentation, the most likely diagnosis is erythema multiforme (EM), which is often associated with infections, medications, or other triggers. The correct answer choice is not provided among the options, but if I had to choose one of the options, I would say that A is the closest related to the condition, as EM can be triggered by infections, and complement levels can be affected in some cases. However, given the options provided, I will select the closest related answer: A. Decreased complement levels is not the best choice, but it is the closest related to the condition, as complement levels can be affected in some cases of EM, although it is not a definitive marker. The correct answer is not explicitly listed, but if I had to choose one of the options, I would say A is the closest related to the condition, but please note that it's not a definitive answer. The final answer is A.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"A\"",

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"
