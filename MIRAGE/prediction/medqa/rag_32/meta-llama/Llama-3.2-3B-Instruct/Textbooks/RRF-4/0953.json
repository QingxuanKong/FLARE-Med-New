    "question": "A 70-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department after 3 days of shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower limb edema. His personal history is significant for a myocardial infarction 6 years ago that required revascularization and hypertension. His medication consists of simvastatin and lisinopril.  In the ED, he has a blood pressure of 100/80 mm Hg, a pulse of 88/min, a respiratory rate of 28/min, and a temperature of 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F). On physical examination, he has jugular vein distention, displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI), an S4-gallop, a holosystolic murmur, and 2+ pitting edema up to the mid calf.  He is started on furosemide, carvedilol, and oxygen therapy. After 6-hours of continued therapy, his blood pressure remains low, and his serum creatinine is found to be 1.9 mg/dL. Which of the following test would be more useful to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease?",

        "A": "Sulfosalicylic acid test",
        "B": "Urine sodium content",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease in this patient, we need to assess the kidney's ability to concentrate urine and its ability to filter waste products. Prerenal kidney disease is characterized by a decrease in blood flow to the kidneys, which leads to a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and a decrease in the ability to concentrate urine. Intrinsic kidney disease, on the other hand, is characterized by damage to the kidneys themselves, leading to a decrease in GFR and an inability to concentrate urine. The sulfosalicylic acid test (A) is not a commonly used test to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease. It is used to diagnose urinary tract infections. The urine sodium content (B) can be used to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease. In prerenal disease, the kidneys retain sodium and water, leading to a high urine sodium content (>20-30 mEq/L). In intrinsic kidney disease, the kidneys are unable to reabsorb sodium, leading to a low urine sodium content (<10-20 mEq/L). The fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) (C) is not a reliable test to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease. FEUrea is a measure of the percentage of urea that is excreted by the kidneys, and it is not specific to kidney function. The nitrates in urine (D) are not a relevant test to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease. Therefore, the urine sodium content (B) is the most useful test to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

His heart fail-ure must be treated first, followed by careful control of the hypertension. He was initially treated with a diuretic (furo-semide, 40 mg twice daily). On this therapy, he was less short of breath on exertion and could also lie flat without dyspnea. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhib-itor was added (enalapril, 20 mg twice daily), and over the next few weeks, he continued to feel better. Because of continued shortness of breath on exercise, digoxin at 0.25 mg/d was added with a further modest improvement in exercise tolerance. The blood pressure stabilized at 150/90 mm Hg, and the patient will be educated regarding the relation between his hypertension and heart failure and the need for better blood pressure control. Cautious addition of a \u03b2 blocker (metoprolol) will be considered. Blood lipids, which are currently in the normal range, will be monitored."

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

His physician initially prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic commonly used to treat hyper-tension. His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic. Because the patient had elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, hydrochlorothiazide was replaced with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril lowered his blood pressure to almost normotensive levels. However, after several weeks on enalapril, the patient returned complaining of a persistent cough. In addition, some signs of angioedema were detected. How does enalapril lower blood pressure? Why does it occasionally cause coughing and angioedema? What other drugs could be used to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and decrease blood pressure,"

Unless hypotension is present, therapy should be aimed at reducing cardiac contractility and systemic arterial pressure, and thus shear stress. For acute dissection, unless contraindicated, \u03b2-adrenergic blockers should be administered parenterally, using intravenous propranolol, metoprolol, or the short-acting esmolol to achieve a heart rate of approximately 60 beats/ min. This should be accompanied by sodium nitroprusside infusion to lower systolic blood pressure to \u2264120 mmHg. Labetalol (Chap. 298), a drug with both \u03b2and \u03b1-adrenergic blocking properties, also may be used as a parenteral agent in acute therapy for dissection."
