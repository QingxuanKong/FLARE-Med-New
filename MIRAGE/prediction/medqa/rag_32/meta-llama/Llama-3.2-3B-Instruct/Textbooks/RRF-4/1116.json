    "question": "A 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of severe muscle and joint pain for 5 months. The pain varies in location and intensity. She also has joint stiffness in the morning and reports fatigue throughout the day that she attributes to not sleeping well. She reports a tingling sensation in her lower limbs. Her bowel habits are unchanged but she often feels bloated. She has primary hypertension and occasional migraine headaches. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Her medications include propranolol and sumatriptan. She appears healthy. Examination shows symmetric muscular tenderness at the base of the neck, over the shoulders, and in the lumbosacral area. Strength and deep tendon reflexes are normal.

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the given question: The patient presents with severe muscle and joint pain, joint stiffness in the morning, fatigue, and tingling sensation in the lower limbs. She also reports bloating and has primary hypertension and occasional migraine headaches. Laboratory studies show elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and urinalysis. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of inflammatory arthritis, specifically rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The patient's symptoms of morning stiffness, joint pain, and fatigue are characteristic of RA. The elevated ESR is also consistent with RA, as it is a common marker of inflammation. The normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count rule out other potential causes of joint pain, such as anemia, infection, or bleeding disorders. The patient's medication list includes propranolol, which is a beta-blocker used to treat hypertension and migraine headaches. Sumatriptan is also used to treat migraine headaches. However, these medications do not address the patient's primary symptoms of joint pain and inflammation. Options A (Temazepam) and C (Amitriptyline) are medications used to treat insomnia and depression, respectively, and are not relevant to the patient's primary symptoms. Option B (Vitamin B12) is used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency, which can cause neurological symptoms such as tingling and numbness. However, the patient's laboratory results show a normal MCV, which suggests that vitamin B12 deficiency is unlikely. Option D (Methotrexate) is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) commonly used to treat RA. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, methotrexate is the most appropriate therapy for this patient. Therefore, the answer is: \"{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including morning stiffness, joint pain, fatigue, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Methotrexate is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) commonly used to treat RA, making it the most appropriate therapy for this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

This latter syndrome is characterized by pain, stiffness, and tenderness in the muscles of the neck, shoulders, and arms, and sometimes of the hips and thighs; even passive motion of the limbs causes pain because of the periarticular locus of this disease. A high sedimentation rate, usually above 65 mm/h, is a diagnostic feature, but more typically the value is close to 100 mm/h, levels higher than in myositis. Biopsy of the temporal artery frequently discloses a giant cell arteritis. CK levels\u2014and, of course, muscle biopsy\u2014are normal. Rapid disappearance of pain with administration of small doses of prednisone is also diagnostic of polymyalgia rheumatica (see Chap. 9)."

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

Muscle cramps, pain, and stiffness are common. Some patients have enlarged muscles. Features of slow muscle contraction and relaxation occur in 25% of patients; the relaxation phase of muscle stretch reflexes is characteristically prolonged and best observed at the ankle or biceps brachii reflexes. The serum CK level is often elevated (up to 10 times normal), even when there is minimal clinical evidence of muscle disease. EMG is typically normal. The cause of muscle enlargement has not been determined, and muscle biopsy shows no distinctive morphologic abnormalities."

Patients with these latter diseases often complain of soreness, stiffness, and lameness after strenuous muscular effort. The most valuable screening tests are the sedimentation rate and serum CK concentration. Some patients probably have an obscure metabolic myopathy, presently undiagnosable. In every reported series, such as that of Serratrice and coworkers, half of the cases with diffuse myalgia are of this uncertain type. This coincides with, or is more optimistic than, our own experience. Masses may be found in one or many muscles in a variety of clinical settings, and the clinical findings in each one have a different significance."

Focused History: Ten days ago, CR had her spleen removed following a bicycle accident in which she fractured her tibial eminence, necessitating immobilization of the right knee. She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."
