    "question": "A 51-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of a 3-week history of abnormal behavior. His wife reports he has been preoccupied with gambling at the local casino. He becomes restless and irritable when his wife attempts to restrict his gambling. Four months ago, he was diagnosed with Parkinson disease and treatment was initiated. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely prescribed for this patient?",

        "A": "Peripheral inhibition of DOPA decarboxylase",
        "B": "Direct activation of dopamine receptors",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to consider the symptoms described and the patient's diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The patient's behavior of being preoccupied with gambling and becoming restless and irritable when his wife attempts to restrict his gambling is indicative of impulse control disorder, which is a known side effect of dopamine agonist therapy in Parkinson's disease patients. This is a common adverse effect of dopamine agonists, particularly those targeting D2 receptors. The most commonly used dopamine agonists for Parkinson's disease are ropinirole and pramipexole, which are selective D2 receptor agonists. Therefore, the most likely prescribed drug for this patient would be a dopamine agonist that targets the D2 receptor. The correct answer is B. Direct activation of dopamine receptors.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

            "content": "Disorders of impulse control may occur either as an exaggeration of a previous tendency or as a new phenomenon and may lead to compulsive gambling, shopping, betting, sexual activity, and other behaviors (see Chapter 32). Their prevalence varies in different reports but may be as high as 15\u201325% in parkinsonian patients treated with dopamine agonists. They relate to activation of D2 or D3 dopamine receptors in the mesocorticolimbic system, may occur with one dopamine agonist and not another, and may occur at any time after the initiation of treatment. They are not dose-dependent, but in some patients, a dose reduction may ameliorate them; they resolve on withdrawal of the offending medication. Impulse control disorders are generally under-reported by patients and their families and often unrecognized by health care professionals. Risk factors include an impulsive personality, a history of drug use or other addictive behaviors, and a family history of gambling disorders."

            "content": "A 45-year-old man with no significant medical history was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 10 days ago after suffering third-degree burns over 40% of his body. He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

He complained that his face and extremities had taken on a blue color. His medical history included chronic stable angina treated with isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin. Blood obtained for analysis was brown. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A. Carboxyhemoglobinemia B. Hemoglobin SC disease C. Methemoglobinemia D.

It may be found in supersecondary structures. Correct answer = C. The \u03b2-sheet is stabilized by interchain hydrogen bonds formed between separate polypeptide chains and by intrachain hydrogen bonds formed between regions of a single polypeptide. The \u03b1-helix, however, is stabilized only by intrachain hydrogen bonds. Statements A, B, D, and E are true for both of these secondary structural elements. .4. An 80-year-old man presented with impairment of intellectual function and alterations in behavior. His family reported progressive disorientation and memory loss over the last 6 months. There is no family history of dementia. The patient was tentatively diagnosed with Alzheimer disease (AD). Which one of the following best describes AD? A. It is associated with \u03b2-amyloid, an abnormal protein with an altered amino acid sequence."

            "content": "In clinical practice, the most common cause of disinhibited sexual behavior, next to the aftermaths of head injury and cerebral hemorrhage, is the use of dopaminergic drugs in Parkinson disease. An intriguing effect of the administration of l-dopa in a few patients has been excessive or perverse sexual behavior, as in the cases described by Quinn and colleagues. Usually there are other manifestations of manic behavior. Primary mania may do the same. Hyposexuality, meaning loss of libido, is a typical accompaniment of depressive illness. However, certain medications, notably antihypertensive, antiepileptic, serotonergic antidepressant, and neuroleptic drugs may be responsible in individual patients. A variety of cerebral diseases may also have this effect, in parallel with a loss of interest and drive in a number of spheres."

He has hypertension, and during the last 8 years, he has been adequately managed with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH\u2019s problem? What information would you gather to confirm your diagnosis? What treatment steps would you initiate?"
