Although this fungus may cause aspergillomas in a previously existing cavity or may produce allergic bronchopulmonary disease in some patients, the major problem posed by this genus in neutropenic patients is invasive disease, primarily due to Aspergillus fumigatus or Aspergillus flavus. The organisms enter the host following colonization of the respiratory tract, with subsequent invasion of blood vessels. The disease is likely to present as a thrombotic or embolic event because of this ability of the fungi to invade blood vessels.

Innocent-looking macules or papules may be the first sign of bacterial or fungal sepsis in immunocompromised patients (Fig. 104-1). In the neutropenic host, a macule progresses rapidly to ecthyma gangrenosum (see Fig. 25e-35), a usually painless, round, necrotic lesion consisting of a central black or gray-black eschar with surrounding erythema. Ecthyma gangrenosum, which is located in nonpressure areas (as distinguished from necrotic lesions associated with lack of circulation), is often associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia (Chap. 189) but may be caused by other bacteria."

Invasion of pulmonary parenchyma and blood vessels by a necrotizing bronchopneumonia may be complicated by thrombosis, hemor-rhage, and then dissemination. Patients present with fever that is nonresponsive to antibiotic therapy in the setting of neutro-penia. They may also have pleuritic chest pain, cough, dys-pnea, or hemoptysis. Characteristic signs on CT scan include the halo sign and cavitary lesions. Treatment with voriconazole must be prompt and aggressive, including reversal of neutrope-nia, if there is to be any chance for recovery. Mortality ranges from 93% to 100% in bone marrow transplant recipients, to approximately 38% in kidney transplant recipients, although this improves to approximately 60% at 12 weeks with antifun-gal therapy.

This patient had a history of several bilateral pneumothoraces and had required bilateral pleurodesis in 1990. CT scan then demonstrated multiple bullae, and sputum cultures grew A. fumigatus. The patient had initially weakly and later strongly positive serum Aspergillus antibody tests (precipitins). This scan (2003) shows a mixture of thickand thin-walled cavities in both lungs (each marked with C), with a probable fungal ball (black arrow) protruding into the large cavity on the patient's right side (R). There is also considerable pleural thickening bilaterally."

Impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis, folliculitis, and simple abscess fall into this category. Impetigo is a superficial infection, typically of the face, that occurs most frequently in infants or children, resulting in honey-colored crusting. Erysip-elas is a cutaneous infection localized to the upper layers of the dermis, while cellulitis is a deeper infection, affecting the deeper dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Folliculitis describes inflammation of the hair follicle, and a furuncle describes a fol-licle with swelling and a collection of purulent material. These lesions can sometimes coalesce into a"

            "content": "The nodules that may follow primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis do not require treatment. As noted above, these nodules are not easily distinguished from pulmonary malignancies by means of radiographic imaging. Close clinical follow-up and biopsy may be required to distinguish between these two entities. Most pulmonary cavities do not require therapy. Antifungal treatment should be considered in patients with persistent cough, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis. Occasionally, pulmonary coccidioidal cavities become secondarily infected. This development is usually manifested by an air-fluid level within the cavity. Bacterial flora or Aspergillus species are commonly involved, and therapy directed at these organisms should be considered. Surgery is rarely required except in cases of persistent hemoptysis or pyopneumothorax. For chronic pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, prolonged antifungal therapy\u2014lasting for at least 1 year\u2014is usually required, with monitoring of symptoms, radiographic"
