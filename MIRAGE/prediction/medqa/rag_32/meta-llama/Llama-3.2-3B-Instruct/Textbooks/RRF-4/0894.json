    "question": "A 3-year-old refugee with increasing pitting edema and abdominal swelling over the past 2 months is brought to the physician. Her family has been displaced several times over the last few years. Nutrition and housing were frequently inadequate. At the physician\u2019s clinic, the boy appears irritated and drowsy. He is difficult to arouse. Physical examination shows pitting edema over the ankles and feet and around his eyes. Abdominal examination is positive for ascites and hepatomegaly. Oral examination shows several missing teeth. Which of the following best explains these findings?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the given symptoms and signs: increasing pitting edema and abdominal swelling over the past 2 months, irritability and drowsiness, pitting edema over the ankles and feet, ascites, hepatomegaly, and missing teeth. These symptoms are characteristic of kwashiorkor, a form of malnutrition caused by inadequate protein intake. Kwashiorkor is characterized by edema, often with a \"buffalo hump\" (a fatty deposit at the back of the neck), and can be associated with other symptoms such as irritability, fatigue, and growth retardation. The fact that the child has been displaced several times and has had inadequate nutrition and housing also supports this diagnosis. Marasmus, another form of malnutrition, is characterized by weight loss and muscle wasting, which is not consistent with this child's symptoms. Beriberi is a disease caused by thiamine deficiency, which can cause edema, but it is not typically associated with the range of symptoms seen in this child. Rickets is a disease caused by vitamin D deficiency, which can cause bone deformities, but it does not explain the child's symptoms of edema and malnutrition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

            "content": "Edema is recognized by the persistence of an indentation of the skin after pressure; this is known as \u201cpitting\u201d edema. In its more subtle form, edema may be detected by noting that after the stethoscope is removed from the chest wall, the rim of the bell leaves an indentation on the skin of the chest for a few minutes. Edema may be present when the ring on a finger fits more snugly than in the past or when a patient complains of difficulty putting on shoes, particularly in the evening. Edema may also be recognized by puffiness of the face, which is most readily apparent in the periorbital areas. The differences among the major causes of generalized edema are shown in Table 50-1. Cardiac, renal, hepatic, or nutritional disorders are responsible for a majority of patients with generalized edema. Consequently, the differential diagnosis of generalized edema should be directed toward identifying or excluding these several conditions."

On follow-up the patient had no complications. A 25-year-old man complained of significant swelling in front of his right ear before and around mealtimes. This swelling was associated with considerable pain, which was provoked by the ingestion of lemon sweets. On examination he had tenderness around the right parotid region and a hard nodule was demonstrated in the buccal mucosa adjacent to the right upper molar teeth. A diagnosis of parotid duct calculus was made."

In the treatment of schizophre-nia, what benefits do the second-generation antipsychotic drugs offer over the traditional agents such as haloperidol?

The dramatic increase in the number of serologic diagnostics, antigen tests, and molecular diagnostics available to the physician has, in fact, revolutionized medical care. However, all of these tests should be viewed as adjuncts to the history and physical examination\u2014not a replacement for them. The selection of initial tests should be based directly on the patient\u2019s history and physical exam findings. Moreover, diagnostic testing should generally be limited to those conditions that are reasonably likely and treatable, important in terms of public health considerations, and/ or capable of providing a definitive diagnosis that will consequently limit other testing."

The orifice of the parotid duct is commonly red and swollen. The submaxillary and sublingual glands are involved less often than the parotid gland and are almost never involved alone. Glandular swelling increases for a few days and then gradually subsides, disappearing within 1 week. Recurrent sialadenitis is a rare sequela of mumps parotitis. In ~6% of mumps cases, obstruction of lymphatic drainage secondary to bilateral salivary gland swelling may lead to presternal pitting edema, associated often with submandibular adenitis and rarely with the more life-threatening supraglottic edema."

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"
