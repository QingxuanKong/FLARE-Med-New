This presentation is consistent with cryptorchidism, which is the failure of the testis to descend into the scrotum. The normal descent of the testes typically occurs within the first 6-12 months of life, so the fact that the testes are not descended by 11 months of age raises concern for cryptorchidism. The presence of only 1 testicle palpable in the scrotum and 1 testicle in the inguinal canal suggests that the testes are not properly descended and may be at risk for torsion or other complications. The normal urethral meatus and penis examination findings suggest that there is no obstruction or other underlying condition affecting the genitalia. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform an exploratory laparoscopy to locate the undescended testis and assess its viability and potential for surgical correction. This will also allow for the evaluation of the inguinal canal and the presence of any potential complications such as hernias or hydroceles. Chorionic gonadotropin therapy (A) is not indicated at this stage, as it is typically used to stimulate testicular descent in cases of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Orchiectomy (C) is not indicated as it is a surgical procedure to remove a testicle, which is not necessary at this stage. Orchiopexy (D) is a surgical procedure to correct the undescended testis, but it should not be performed until the testis is located and its viability is confirmed by exploratory laparoscopy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Epispadias or hypospadias alone should not raise concern about pseudohermaphroditism. However, if no testes are present in the scrotum and hypospadias is present, problems of sexual development should be suspected.

Tanner stage 2 of genital growth begins when testicular enlargement is first evident. Testis length along the longitudinal axis ranges from 2.5 to 3.2 cm. The size of the penis increases. Pigmented, curly pubic hair is first visible around the base of the penis. In Tanner stage 3, there is further growth of the penis in both length and diameter, the scrotum develops further, and testis length increases to 3.3 to 4 cm. Thicker, curly hair extends above the penis. Tanner stage 4 involves further growth of the genitalia, with testis length ranging from 4 to 4.5 cm. Extension of pubic hair over the genital area continues, but the volume is less than in the adult. At this stage, the prostate gland is palpable by rectal examination. In Tanner stage 5, the genitalia are within the adult range in size. Average \ufb02accid penile length in adult men ranges between 8.6"

The reason for malignant degeneration is not established, but the evidence points to an inherent abnormality of the testicle that predisposes it to incomplete descent and malignancy rather than malignancy as a result of an abnormal environment.Treatment. Males with bilateral undescended testicles are often infertile. When the testicle is not present within the scrotum, it is subjected to a higher temperature, resulting in decreased spermatogenesis. Mengel and coworkers studied 515 undescended testicles by histology and demonstrated reduced spermatogonia after 2 years of age. It is now recommended that the undescended testicle be surgically repositioned by 1 year of age. Despite orchidopexy, the incidence of infertility is approx-imately two times higher in men with unilateral orchidopexy compared to men with normal testicular descent.The use of chorionic gonadotropin occasionally may be"

If there is uncer-tainty regarding location of a testis, repeated evaluations over time may be helpful.It is now established that cryptorchid testes demonstrate an increased predisposition to malignant degeneration. In addition, fertility is decreased when the testicle is not in the scrotum. For these reasons, surgical placement of the testicle in the scrotum (orchidopexy) is indicated. It should be emphasized that this procedure does improve the fertility potential, although it is never normal. Similarly, the testicle is still at risk of malignant change, although its location in the scrotum facilitates poten-tially earlier detection of a testicular malignancy. Other reasons to consider orchidopexy include the risk of trauma to the testicle located at the pubic tubercle and incidence of torsion, as well as the psychological impact of an empty scrotum in a developing male.

In such situations, gonadectomy usually is considered to prevent further androgen secretion at puberty and prevent risk of gonadoblastoma (up to 25%). Individuals raised as males usually require reconstructive surgery for hypospadias and removal of dysgenetic or streak gonads if the gonads cannot be brought down into the scrotum. Scrotal testes can be preserved but require regular examination for tumor development and sonography at the time of puberty. Biopsy for carcinoma in situ is recommended in adolescence, and testosterone supplementation may be required to support androgenization in puberty or if low testosterone is detected in adulthood. Height potential is usually attenuated; some children receive recombinant growth hormone using TS protocols. Screening for cardiac, renal, and other TS features should be considered, and psychological support"

In addition to the extent of gynecomastia, recent onset, rapid growth, tender tissue, and occurrence in a lean subject should prompt more extensive evaluation. This should include a careful drug history, measurement and examination of the testes, assessment of virilization, evaluation of liver function, and hormonal measurements including testosterone, estradiol, and androstenedione, LH, and hCG. A karyotype should be obtained in men with very small testes to exclude Klinefelter\u2019s syndrome. Despite extensive evaluation, the etiology is established in fewer than one-half of patients."

The patient should be examined in a standing position to increase intra-abdominal pressure, with the groin and scro-tum fully exposed. Inspection is performed first, with the goal of identifying an abnormal bulge along the groin or within the scrotum. If an obvious bulge is not detected, palpation is per-formed to confirm the presence of the hernia.Palpation is performed by advancing the index fin-ger through the scrotum towards the external inguinal ring (Fig. 37-11). This allows the inguinal canal to be explored. The patient is then asked to perform a Valsalva maneuver to increase intraabdominal pressure. These maneuvers will reveal an abnor-mal bulge and allow the clinician to determine whether the her-nia is reducible or not. Examination of the contralateral side affords the clinician the opportunity to compare the"
