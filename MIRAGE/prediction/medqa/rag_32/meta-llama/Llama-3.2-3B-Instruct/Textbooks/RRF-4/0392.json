    "question": "A previously healthy 60-year-old man comes to his physician because of progressively worsening shortness of breath for the past 2 months. He does not experience shortness of breath at rest. He also occasionally has a dry cough. He has not had fever, chills, or night sweats. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years. He drinks a beer daily and occasionally more on weekends. He does not use illicit drugs. He is 183 cm (6 ft 0 in) tall and weighs 66 kg (145 lbs); BMI is 19.7 kg/m2. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 136/88 mm Hg. Lung auscultation reveals a prolonged expiratory phase and end-expiratory wheezing. Spirometry shows an FEV1:FVC ratio of 62%, an FEV1 of 60% of predicted, and a total lung capacity of 125% of predicted. The diffusion capacity of the lung (DLCO) is decreased.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and test results step by step. The patient is a 60-year-old man with progressively worsening shortness of breath over the past 2 months, which is not accompanied by fever, chills, or night sweats. He has a history of smoking a pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years, which is a significant risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other lung diseases. The patient's lung auscultation reveals a prolonged expiratory phase and end-expiratory wheezing, which are classic signs of airflow limitation. The spirometry results show an FEV1:FVC ratio of 62%, an FEV1 of 60% of predicted, and a total lung capacity of 125% of predicted. The decreased DLCO suggests impaired gas exchange. Considering these findings, let's evaluate the options: A. Interstitial lung disease: While interstitial lung disease can cause impaired gas exchange and decreased DLCO, it is less likely to cause the significant airflow limitation and wheezing seen in this patient. B. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: This condition typically presents with symptoms such as fever, chills, and night sweats, which are not present in this patient. C. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient's smoking history, airflow limitation, and decreased DLCO are consistent with COPD. The fact that the patient does not experience shortness of breath at rest and has a relatively preserved total lung capacity also supports this diagnosis. D. Bronchiectasis: While bronchiectasis can cause chronic cough and wheezing, it is less likely to cause the significant airflow limitation and decreased DLCO seen in this patient. Based on the analysis, the most likely diagnosis is C. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's long history of smoking, airflow limitation, and decreased DLCO are consistent with COPD. The spirometry results show a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio and FEV1, which are characteristic of airflow limitation. The decreased DLCO also suggests impaired gas exchange. Therefore, the answer is C. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

Restriction can result from parenchymal disease, neuromuscular weakness, or chest wall or pleural diseases. Restriction with impaired gas exchange, as indicated by a decreased DLCO, suggests parenchymal lung disease. Additional testing, such as measurements of maximal expiratory pressure and maximal inspiratory pressure, can help diagnose neuromuscular weakness. Normal spirometry, normal lung volumes, and a low DLCO should prompt further evaluation for pulmonary vascular disease."

Lung Function Tests Simple spirometry confirms airflow limitation with a reduced FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, and PEF (Fig. 309-6). Reversibility is demonstrated by a >12% and 200-mL increase in FEV1 15 min after an inhaled short-acting \u03b22-agonist or in some patients by a 2to 4-week trial of oral corticosteroids (OCS) (prednisone or prednisolone 30\u201340 mg daily). Measurements of PEF twice daily may confirm the diurnal variations in airflow obstruction. Flow-volume loops show reduced peak flow and reduced maximum expiratory flow. Further lung function tests are rarely necessary, but whole-body plethysmography shows increased airway resistance and may show increased total lung capacity and residual volume. Gas diffusion is usually normal, but there may be a small increase in gas transfer in some patients."

Even more often, spirometry is used to measure airflow, which reflects the dynamic properties of the lung. During an FVC maneuver, the patient inhales to TLC and then exhales rapidly and forcefully to RV; this method ensures that flow limitation has been achieved, so that the precise effort made has little influence on actual flow. The total amount of air exhaled is the FVC, and the amount of air exhaled in the first second is the FEV1; the FEV1 is a flow rate, revealing volume change per time. Like lung volumes, an individual\u2019s maximal expiratory flows should be compared with predicted values based on height, age, and sex. While the FEV1/FVC ratio is typically reduced in airflow obstruction, this condition can also reduce FVC by raising RV, sometimes rendering the FEV1/FVC ratio \u201cartifactually normal\u201d with the erroneous implication that airflow obstruction is absent.

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

In severe exacerbations, patients may be so breathless that they are unable to complete sentences and may become cyanotic. Examination usually shows increased ventilation, hyperinflation, and tachycardia. Pulsus paradoxus may be present, but this is rarely a useful clinical sign. There is a marked fall in spirometric values and PEF. Arterial blood gases on air show hypoxemia, and PCO2 is usually low due to hyperventilation. A normal or rising PCO2 is an indication of impending respiratory failure and requires immediate monitoring and therapy.

The patient inhales to TLC and then forcibly exhales until no more air can be expelled. During the forced expiratory maneuver, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expired volume in the first second (FEV1), and forced expiratory flow (FEF) rates are measured. These are compared to predicted values based on patient age, gender, and race, but rely mostly on height. Most children above 6 years of age can perform spirometry. Infant pulmonary function testing is possible, using sedation and sophisticated equipment. Airway resistance, FRC, and RV cannot be measured with spirometry and require other techniques, such as body plethysmography. Helium dilution can also measure TLC and RV by determining the magnitude of dilution of inhaled helium in the air within the lung, but may underestimate air trapping."

Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

In addition, a passive resting point of the respiratory system is attained when alveolar gas pressure equals body surface pressure (i.e., when the transrespiratory system pressure is zero). At this volume (called the functional residual capacity [FRC]), the outward recoil of the chest wall is balanced exactly by the inward recoil of the lung. As these recoils are transmitted through the pleural fluid, the lung is pulled both outward and inward simultaneously at FRC, and thus its pressure falls below atmospheric pressure (typically, \u22125 cmH2O)."

Test results are compared with results obtained in normal individuals and vary with sex, ethnicity, age, and height. COPD is characterized by increases in lung volumes and airway resistance and by decreases in expiratory flow rates. Emphysema, a specific type of COPD, is further characterized by increased lung compliance. Restrictive lung diseases are characterized by decreases in lung volume, normal expiratory flow rates and resistance, and a marked decrease in lung compliance. 4."
