Captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic. ACE inhibitors are known to cause a decrease in aldosterone levels, which in turn can lead to a decrease in potassium excretion in the urine. This can cause an increase in potassium levels in the blood, leading to hyperkalemia.\\n\\nGiven this information, the abnormality that we would most likely find in the patient's laboratory results is hyperkalemia.\\n\\nThe other options are not directly related to the medications prescribed to the patient. Hypernatremia is an abnormality of sodium levels in the blood, thrombocytopenia is a decrease in platelet count, and anemia is a decrease in red blood cell count. None of these conditions are directly related to the effects of captopril and triamterene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

His physician initially prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic commonly used to treat hyper-tension. His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic. Because the patient had elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, hydrochlorothiazide was replaced with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril lowered his blood pressure to almost normotensive levels. However, after several weeks on enalapril, the patient returned complaining of a persistent cough. In addition, some signs of angioedema were detected. How does enalapril lower blood pressure? Why does it occasionally cause coughing and angioedema? What other drugs could be used to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and decrease blood pressure,"

Resistant or difficultto-control hypertension is more common in patients >60 years than in younger patients. Resistant hypertension may be related to \u201cpseudoresistance\u201d (high office blood pressures and lower home blood pressures), nonadherence to therapy, identifiable causes of hypertension (including obesity and excessive alcohol intake), and the use of any of a number of nonprescription and prescription drugs (Table 298-3). Rarely, in older patients, pseudohypertension may be related to the inability to measure blood pressure accurately in severely sclerotic arteries. This condition is suggested if the radial pulse remains palpable despite occlusion of the brachial artery by the cuff (Osler maneuver).

The accepted screening test is concurrent measurement of plasma renin and aldosterone with subsequent calculation of the aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) (Fig. 406-12); serum potassium needs to be normalized prior to testing. Stopping antihypertensive medication can be cumbersome, particularly in patients with severe hypertension. Thus, for practical purposes, in the first instance the patient can remain on the usual antihypertensive medications, with the exception that mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists need to be ceased at least 4 weeks prior to ARR measurement.

Screening tests are most informative when they are directed toward common diseases or disorders and when their results indicate whether other useful\u2014but often costly\u2014tests or interventions are needed. On the one hand, biochemical measurements, together with simple laboratory determinations such as blood count, urinalysis, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, often provide a major clue to the presence of a pathologic process. On the other hand, the physician must learn to evaluate occasional screening-test abnormalities that do not necessarily connote significant disease.

            "content": "Currently available ambulatory monitors are fully automated, use the oscillometric technique, and typically are programmed to take readings every 15\u201330 min. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring more reliably predicts cardiovascular disease risk than do office measurements. However, ambulatory monitoring is not used routinely in clinical practice and generally is reserved for patients in whom white coat hypertension is suspected. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) has also recommended ambulatory monitoring for treatment resistance, symptomatic hypotension, autonomic failure, and episodic hypertension."

            "content": "The blood pressure measured in an office or hospital setting may not accurately reflect the pressure in other venues. \u201cWhite coat hypertension\u201d is defined by at least three separate clinic-based measurements >140/90 mmHg and at least two non-clinic-based measurements <140/90 mmHg in the absence of any evidence of target organ damage. Individuals with white coat hypertension may not benefit from drug therapy, although they may be more likely to develop sustained hypertension over time. Masked hypertension should be suspected when normal or even low blood pressures are recorded in patients with advanced atherosclerotic disease, especially when evidence of target organ damage is present or bruits are audible."

            "content": "For years, cardiologists and nephrologists believed that chronic essential hypertension, the most common form of hypertension, was somehow related to an abnor-mality in the RAAS. However, 24-hour urine renin levels in such patients were usually normal. Not until a factor in the venom of a South American snake was shown to be a potent inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the lung did investigators have both a clue to the cause of chronic essential hypertension and a new series of drugs with which to treat this common disease. The \u201clesion\u201d in chronic essential hypertension is now be-lieved to be excessive production of angiotensin II in the lung. Development of the so-called ACE inhibitors\u2014captopril, enalapril, and related derivatives of the original snake venom factor\u2014has revolutionized the treatment of chronic essential hypertension. These antihypertensive drugs do not cause the often-dangerous side effects of the diuretics and -blockers that were previously the most"

            "content": "Reliable measurements of blood pressure depend on attention to the details of the technique and conditions of the measurement. Proper training of observers, positioning of the patient, and selection of cuff size are essential. Owing to recent regulations preventing the use of mercury because of concerns about its potential toxicity, most office measurements are made with aneroid sphygmomanometers or with oscillometric devices. These instruments should be calibrated periodically, and their accuracy confirmed. Before the blood pressure measurement is taken, the individual should be seated quietly in a chair (not the exam table) with feet on the floor for 5 min in a private, quiet setting with a comfortable room temperature. At least two measurements should be made. The center of the cuff should be at heart level, and the width of the bladder cuff Duration of hypertension Previous therapies: responses and side effects Family history of hypertension and cardiovascular disease"
