The physical examination findings of distended neck veins, bilateral basilar rales, and muffled heart sounds suggest cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition where fluid accumulates in the pericardial space, compressing the heart and impeding its function. The ECG findings of sinus tachycardia, diffuse ST segment elevation, low voltage QRS complexes, and fluctuating R wave amplitude are also consistent with cardiac tamponade. The patient's hypotension and tachycardia also suggest that the patient is in cardiac shock. Considering the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is cardiac tamponade.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

TR is more often diagnosed by examination of the neck veins than by auscultation of the heart sounds. Other findings may include marked hepatomegaly with systolic pulsations, ascites, pleural effusions, edema, and a positive hepatojugular reflex. A prominent RV pulsation along the left parasternal region and a blowing holosystolic murmur along the lower left sternal margin, which may be intensified during inspiration (Carvallo\u2019s sign) and reduced during expiration or the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver, are characteristic findings. The murmur of TR may sometimes be confused with that of MR unless attention is paid to its variation during the respiratory cycle and the extent of RV enlargement is appreciated. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is usually present in the chronic phase of the disease."

            "content": "Palpation In patients with chronic severe AR, the LV impulse is heaving and displaced laterally and inferiorly. The systolic expansion and diastolic retraction of the apex are prominent. A diastolic thrill may be palpable along the left sternal border in thin-chested individuals, and a prominent systolic thrill may be palpable in the suprasternal notch and transmitted upward along the carotid arteries. This systolic thrill and the accompanying murmur do not necessarily signify the coexistence of AS. In some patients with AR or with combined AS and AR, the carotid arterial pulse may be bisferiens, i.e., with two systolic waves separated by a trough (see Fig. 267-2D)."

            "content": "Palpation may reveal cardiac enlargement and abnormal contraction of the cardiac impulse (left ventricular dyskinesia). Auscultation can uncover arterial bruits, a third and/or fourth heart sound, and, if acute ischemia or previous infarction has impaired papillary muscle function, an apical systolic murmur due to mitral regurgitation. These auscultatory signs are best appreciated with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. Aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation (Chap. 283), pulmonary hypertension (Chap. 304), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Chap. 287) must be excluded, since these disorders may cause angina in the absence of coronary atherosclerosis. Examination during an anginal attack is useful, since ischemia can cause transient left ventricular failure with the appearance of a third 1582 and/or fourth heart sound, a dyskinetic cardiac apex, mitral regurgitation, and even pulmonary edema. Tenderness of the chest wall, localization of the discomfort with a single"

            "content": "Associated Symptoms Symptoms that accompany myocardial ischemia may include diaphoresis, dyspnea, nausea, fatigue, faintness, and eructations. In addition, these symptoms may exist in isolation as anginal equivalents (i.e., symptoms of myocardial ischemia other than typical angina), particularly in women and the elderly. Dyspnea may occur with multiple conditions considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain and thus is not discriminative, but the presence of dyspnea is important because it suggests a cardiopulmonary etiology. Sudden onset of significant respiratory distress should lead to consideration of pulmonary embolism and spontaneous pneumothorax. Hemoptysis may occur with pulmonary embolism, or as blood-tinged frothy sputum in severe heart failure but usually points toward a pulmonary parenchymal etiology of chest symptoms. Presentation with syncope or pre-syncope should prompt consideration of hemodynamically significant pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection as"

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

Graham, Centre for International Child Health, University of Melbourne, Australia; with permission.) 1110 postprimary disease. Depending on the extent of reactivity, the effusion may be small, remain unnoticed, and resolve spontaneously or may be sufficiently large to cause symptoms such as fever, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea. Physical findings are those of pleural effusion: dullness to percussion and absence of breath sounds. A chest radiograph reveals the effusion and, in up to one-third of cases, also shows a parenchymal lesion. Thoracentesis is required to ascertain the nature of the effusion and to differentiate it from manifestations of other etiologies. The fluid is straw colored and at times hemorrhagic; it is an exudate with a protein concentration >50% of that in serum (usually ~4\u20136 g/dL), a normal to low glucose concentration, a pH of ~7.3"

            "content": "In this patient, compression of the left external iliac veins by the gravid uterus was the likely cause of stasis, which led to the deep vein thrombosis. The chest pain was due to pulmonary emboli. Small emboli were thrown off from the leading edge of the thrombus through the heart to lodge in the lungs. Small emboli cause typical pleuritic chest pain, which is exacerbated by breathing. In isolation these small pulmonary emboli may affect respiratory function, but they may be the precursor to a large and potentially fatal pulmonary embolus (eFig. 6.143). Anticoagulation was instituted and the patient had an uneventful delivery. A 45-year-old man had recently taken up squash. During a game he attempted a forehand shot and noticed severe sudden pain in his heel. He thought his opponent had hit him with his racket. When he turned, though, he realized his opponent was too far away to have hit him."

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"
