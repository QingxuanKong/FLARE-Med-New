    "question": "A 55-year-old woman with papillary thyroid carcinoma underwent total thyroidectomy. She has no significant medical history. On postoperative day 1, she develops perioral numbness and a tingling sensation, along with paresthesia of the hands and feet. The physical examination reveals that she is anxious and confused. Her pulse is 90/min, the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, the respirations are 22/min, and the temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F). Latent tetany (carpal spasm) is evident in the right arm. This is observed when the sphygmomanometer cuff pressure is raised above the systolic blood pressure and held for 3 minutes. The laboratory test results are as follows:\nSerum calcium 6.7 mg/dL\nSerum sodium 143 mEq/L\nSerum potassium 4.4 mEq/L\nSerum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL\nBlood urea 16 mg/dL\nSerum magnesium 1.1 mEq/L\nWhat is the most likely cause of this condition?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 55-year-old woman who underwent total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid carcinoma. She is now experiencing symptoms of hypocalcemia, including perioral numbness, tingling sensation, paresthesia of the hands and feet, and carpal spasm. The patient's serum calcium level is 6.7 mg/dL, which is below the normal range. The physical examination reveals latent tetany, which is a classic sign of hypocalcemia. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with hypocalcemia, which can be caused by several factors. However, given the patient's recent history of thyroidectomy, the most likely cause of her hypocalcemia is hypoparathyroidism, which can occur due to damage or removal of the parathyroid glands during surgery. This is known as hungry bone syndrome. The other options are less likely causes of hypocalcemia in this context. Inadvertent surgical removal of parathyroid glands (option A) is a possible cause of hypoparathyroidism, but it is not as common as hungry bone syndrome. DiGeorge syndrome (option B) is a genetic disorder that can cause hypoparathyroidism, but it is not directly related to the patient's recent thyroidectomy. Chronic hypomagnesemia (option C) can contribute to hypocalcemia, but it is not the most likely cause in this case. Hungry bone syndrome (option D) is a common complication of thyroidectomy, where the parathyroid glands are damaged or removed, leading to hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with hungry bone syndrome, making this the most likely cause of her condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

It was not until his seventh operation, which included total thyroidectomy, that an ectopic adenoma was found substernally. Unfortunately, Captain Martell died 6 weeks later, likely due to laryngeal spasm and complications of renal stones and ureteral obstruction. The first successful para-thyroidectomy for HPT in the United States was performed on a 56-year-old woman in 1928 by Isaac Y. Olch at the Barnes Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. At operation, a parathyroid ade-noma was found attached to the left lower lobe of the thyroid gland. Postoperatively, the patient developed tetany, requiring lifelong supplemental calcium.EmbryologyIn humans, the superior parathyroid glands are derived from the fourth branchial pouch, which also gives rise to the thyroid gland.

Although characteristic disturbances of skeletal muscle are known to complicate hypothyroidism, the demonstration of a definite polyneuropathy has been infrequent. However, a number of elderly myxedematous patients complain of weakness and numbness of the feet, legs, and, to a lesser extent, hands, for which no other explanation can be found. Loss of reflexes, diminution in vibratory, joint-position, and touch-pressure sensations, and weakness in the distal parts of the limbs are the usual findings (see Dyck and Lambert). The neuropathic manifestations are seldom severe. Nerve conduction velocities are slowed and the protein content of the CSF is usually increased to more than 100 mg/dL. Possibly the latter finding is a reflection of the increased protein content of the serum in the hypothyroid state.

Parathyroid cancer accounts for approximately 1% of PHPT cases. It may be suspected preop-eratively by the presence of severe symptoms, serum calcium levels >14 mg/dL, significantly elevated PTH levels (five times normal), and a palpable parathyroid gland. Local invasion is quite common; approximately 15% of patients have lymph node metastases, and 33% have distant metastases at pre-sentation. Intraoperatively, parathyroid cancer is suggested by the presence of a large, gray-white to gray-brown parathyroid tumor that is adherent to or invasive into surrounding tissues like muscle, thyroid, RLN, trachea, or esophagus. Enlarged lymph nodes also may be present. Frozen sections"
