A detailed workup is performed, and several premalignant lesions are found in her uterus. The patient agrees to a hysterectomy. The surgical team decides to use an anesthesia protocol consisting of nitrous oxide, desflurane, and atracurium. Which of the following best describes the role of atracurium in this patient\u2019s anesthesia?",

Steady bleeding 2 to 3 hours after surgery suggests lack of hemostasis. The patient should be taken promptly to the examining room, where the operative site is viewed using a large speculum and good lighting. If bleeding is not excessive, the vaginal cuff can be inspected, and in many instances, bleeding from the cuff edge will be found. Hemostasis can easily be achieved with one or two sutures placed through the mucosa. If bleeding is excessive or appears to be coming from above the cuff, or if the patient is too uncomfortable to tolerate adequate examination, she should be taken to the operating room."

            "content": "After bimanual examination is performed to determine uterine size and orientation, a speculum is inserted, and the cervix is swabbed with povidone-iodine or equivalent solution. he anterior cervical lip is grasped with a toothed tenaculum. The cervix, vagina, and uterus are richly supplied by nerves of Frankenhauser plexus, which lies within connective tissue lateral to the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments. Thus, vacuum aspiration at minimum requires intravenously or orally administered sedatives or analgesics, and some add a paracervical or intracervical blockade with lidocaine (llen, 2009; Renner, 2012). For local blocks, 5 mL of 1-or 2-percent lidocaine is most efective if placed immediately lateral to the insertion of the uterosacral ligaments into the uterus at 4 and 8 o'clock. An intracervical block with 5-mL aliquots of I-percent lidocaine injected at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock was reported to be equally efective (Mankowski, 2009). Alternatively, general or regional anesthesia"

If the surgeon is right handed, the incision is made on the patient\u2019s left side. To decrease blood loss, the area can be infiltrated with lidocaine-containing epinephrine. The incision follows a curved line from the 4-o\u2019clock position at the hymenal margin to a point halfway between the anus and the ischial tuberosity. The incision may be continued into the vaginal vault as high as necessary to gain exposure. The depth of the incision is the medial portion of the pubococcygeus muscle, which may be divided in extreme cases. The incision must be closed in layers at the completion of the procedure."

            "content": "Anesthesia The anesthetic requirements for hysteroscopy vary greatly, depending on the patient\u2019s level of anxiety, the status of her cervical canal, the procedure, and the outside diameter of the hysteroscope or sheath. In some patients, diagnostic hysteroscopy is possible without anesthesia, especially if the patient is parous or if narrow-caliber (<3 mm in outside diameter) hysteroscopes and sheaths are used (208). In many instances the pain of cervical dilation can be avoided or minimized with the preprocedural use of oral or vaginal misoprostol (see below) or by inserting a laminaria \u201ctent\u201d in the cervix 3 to 8 hours before the procedure. Laminaria are thin rods of natural (slippery elm) or synthetic construction that, when passed through the internal os, expand over several hours thereby dilating the cervix. However, if laminaria are left in place too long (e.g., longer than 24 hours), the cervix may overdilate, which is can be counterproductive for CO2 insuf\ufb02ation."

It was noted at operation that the appendix had perforated and there was pus within the abdominal cavity. The appendix was removed and the stump tied. The abdomen was washed out with warm saline solution. The patient initially made an uneventful recovery, but by day 7 she had become unwell, with pain over her right shoulder and spiking temperatures. This patient had developed an intraabdominal abscess. Any operation on the bowel may involve peritoneal contamination with fecal contents and fecal flora. This may not be appreciated at the time of the operation. Over the postoperative period an inflammatory reaction ensued and an abscess cavity developed, filling with pus. Typically, the observation chart revealed a \u201cswinging\u201d pyrexia (fever). The most common sites for abscess to develop are the pelvis and the hepatorenal recess."

The patient had Crohn\u2019s disease and was maintained on 6-mercaptopurine and prednisone. She presented with abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, and small-bowel obstruction. The image reveals a 7to 10-cm long stricture at the terminal ileum (white arrows) causing obstruction and significant dilatation of the proximal small bowel (white asterisk). A fetus is seen in the uterus (dashed white arrows). (Courtesy of Drs. J. F. B. Chick and"
