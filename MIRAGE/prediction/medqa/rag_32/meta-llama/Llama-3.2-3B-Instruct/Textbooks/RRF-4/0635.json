He says that he finds himself out of breath after taking a few steps, and has to sit down and rest, in order to continue. He also says that, at night, he has the greatest difficulty in breathing and usually uses at least 3 pillows to sleep comfortably. He mentions a cough that appears only at night, but which is persistent enough to wake him up from sleep. He mentions that he has had a \u2018heart attack\u2019 5 years ago. He also says that he continues to consume alcohol on a regular basis even though his doctor has advised against it. He has brought his lab reports which he had recently got done on the suggestions of his family doctor. An electrocardiogram (ECG) and a chest X-ray are found.

The patient's history of a previous 'heart attack' and regular alcohol consumption also suggests coronary artery disease. The electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray may show signs of cardiac dysfunction, but are not diagnostic on their own. Given the patient's symptoms and history, the next step in management would be to investigate the cardiac cause of his symptoms further. An echocardiogram would be the most appropriate next step as it can provide information on the structure and function of the heart, including the ejection fraction, valve function, and wall motion abnormalities. This would help to confirm the diagnosis of heart failure and guide further management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

A 68-year-old man came to his family physician complaining of discomfort when swallowing (dysphagia). The physician examined the patient and noted since his last visit he had lost approximately 18 lb over 6 months. Routine blood tests revealed the patient was anemic and he was referred to the gastroenterology unit. A diagnosis of esophageal cancer was made and the patient underwent a resection, which involved a chest and abdominal incision.

Sinus tachycardia, during exertion or with emotion, or premature ventricular contractions may produce particularly uncomfortable palpitations as well as head pounding. These complaints may persist for many years before the development of exertional dyspnea, usually the first symptom of diminished cardiac reserve. The dyspnea is followed by orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and excessive diaphoresis. Anginal chest pain even in the absence of CAD may occur in patients with severe AR, even in younger patients. Anginal pain may develop at rest as well as during exertion.

There is a marked fall in spirometric values and PEF. Arterial blood gases on air show hypoxemia, and PCO2 is usually low due to hyperventilation.

Dyspnea may occur with multiple conditions considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain and thus is not discriminative, but the presence of dyspnea is important because it suggests a cardiopulmonary etiology.

He was rushed to the hospital, where he remained in a coma for 2 days before ultimately being pronounced dead. The patient\u2019s blood alcohol concentration shortly after arriving at the hospital was 510 mg/dL. What was the cause of this patient\u2019s death? If he had received medical care sooner, what treatment might have prevented his death?"

            "content": "A 65-year-old man is referred to you from his primary care physician (PCP) for evaluation and management of pos-sible osteoporosis. He saw his PCP for evaluation of low back pain. X-rays of the spine showed some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine plus several wedge deformities in the thoracic spine. The patient is a long-time smoker (up to two packs per day) and has two to four glasses of wine with dinner, more on the weekends. He has chronic bronchitis, presumably from smoking, and has been treated on numerous occasions with oral prednisone for exacerba-tions of bronchitis. He is currently on 10 mg/d prednisone. Examination shows kyphosis of the thoracic spine, with some tenderness to fist percussion over the thoracic spine. The dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measure-ment of the lumbar spine is \u201cwithin the normal limits,\u201d but the radiologist noted that the reading may be misleading because of degenerative changes. The hip measurement shows a T score (number of standard"

            "content": "A 68-year-old man presents with a complaint of light-headedness on standing that is worse after meals and in hot environments. Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian"

            "content": "http://ebooksmedicine.net Dyspnea (shortness of breath) on exertion is usually the earliest and most significant symptom of left-sided heart failure; cough is also common as a consequence of fluid transudation into air spaces. As failure progresses, patients experience dyspnea when recumbent (orthopnea); this occurs because the supine position increases venous return from the lower extremities and also elevates the diaphragm. Orthopnea typically is relieved by sitting or standing, so patients usually sleep in a semi-seated position. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea is a particularly dramatic form of breathlessness, awakening patients from sleep with extreme dyspnea bordering on feelings of suffocation."

            "content": "The patient has a low ejection fraction with systolic heart failure, probably secondary to hypertension. His heart fail-ure must be treated first, followed by careful control of the hypertension. He was initially treated with a diuretic (furo-semide, 40 mg twice daily). On this therapy, he was less short of breath on exertion and could also lie flat without dyspnea. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhib-itor was added (enalapril, 20 mg twice daily), and over the next few weeks, he continued to feel better. Because of continued shortness of breath on exercise, digoxin at 0.25 mg/d was added with a further modest improvement in exercise tolerance. The blood pressure stabilized at 150/90 mm Hg, and the patient will be educated regarding the relation between his hypertension and heart failure and the need for better blood pressure control. Cautious addition of a \u03b2 blocker (metoprolol) will be considered. Blood lipids, which are currently in the normal range, will be monitored."

            "content": "If a patient has evidence of both pulmonary and cardiac disease, a cardiopulmonary exercise test should be carried out to determine which system is responsible for the exercise limitation. If, at peak exercise, the patient achieves predicted maximal ventilation, demonstrates an increase in dead space or hypoxemia, or develops bronchospasm, the respiratory system is probably the cause of the problem. Alternatively, if the heart rate is >85% of the predicted maximum, if the anaerobic threshold occurs early, if the blood pressure becomes excessively high or decreases during exercise, if the O2 pulse (O2 consumption/heart rate, an indicator of stroke volume) falls, or if there are ischemic changes on the electrocardiogram, an abnormality of the cardiovascular system is likely the explanation for the breathing discomfort.
