She denies any sick contacts. Her temperature is 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 96/min, and respirations are 15/min. Physical exam reveals several oral mucosal petechiae, bleeding gums, bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly.

    "predict": "Based on the provided documents, let's break down the case step by step: 1. The patient presents with fever, fatigue, bleeding gums, oral mucosal petechiae, bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. These symptoms, combined with the laboratory findings, suggest a hematological malignancy. 2. The leukocyte count and differential show a left shift with an increased band count, indicating a myeloproliferative disorder. The presence of Auer rods in the bone marrow biopsy is a hallmark of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 3. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of AML characterized by the presence of Auer rods and a high risk of bleeding complications. 4. The treatment of APL typically involves the use of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide. ATRA induces differentiation of the leukemic promyelocytes, while arsenic trioxide promotes apoptosis of the malignant cells. Therefore, the best treatment option for this patient is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) based on the presence of Auer rods and a high risk of bleeding complications. The standard treatment for APL involves the use of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide. This combination therapy is effective in inducing remission and reducing the risk of bleeding complications.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"
