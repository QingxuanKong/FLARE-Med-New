He has bowel movements 10\u201312 times daily; the stool contains blood and mucus. He constantly has the urge to defecate. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the abdomen shows diffuse tenderness to palpation. Serum concentration of C-reactive protein is 20 mg/L (N<10).

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: **Step-by-Step Thinking:** 1. The patient presents with colicky abdominal pain, diarrhea, and blood and mucus in the stool, which suggests an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 2. The patient's colonoscopy shows bleeding, ulcerated rectal mucosa with several pseudopolyps, which is characteristic of ulcerative colitis (UC). 3. UC is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can lead to complications such as colorectal cancer. 4. The patient's symptoms and colonoscopy findings are consistent with UC, especially the presence of pseudopolyps, which are a hallmark of UC. 5. Therefore, the patient is at greatest risk of developing colorectal cancer due to the chronic inflammation associated with UC. **Answer:** ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and colonoscopy findings are consistent with ulcerative colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. UC is a known risk factor for colorectal cancer, so the patient is at greatest risk of developing colorectal cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" } ``` Note: The other options are less likely given the patient's symptoms and colonoscopy findings. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (A) is more commonly associated with E. coli O157:H7 infection, oral ulcers (B) are more commonly associated with Beh\u00e7et's disease or Crohn's disease, and pancreatic cancer (D) is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or colonoscopy findings.",

            "content": "The earliest radiologic change of UC seen on single-contrast barium enema is a fine mucosal granularity. With increasing severity, the mucosa becomes thickened, and superficial ulcers are seen. Deep ulcerations can appear as \u201ccollar-button\u201d ulcers, which indicate that the ulceration has penetrated the mucosa. Haustral folds may be normal in mild disease, but as activity progresses they become edematous and thickened. Loss of haustration can occur, especially in patients with long-standing disease. In addition, the colon becomes shortened and narrowed. Polyps in the colon may be postinflammatory polyps or pseudopolyps, adenomatous polyps, or carcinoma.

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

At the time of laparotomy, the entire peritoneal cavity should be examined, with thorough inspection of the liver, pelvis, and hemidiaphragm and careful palpation of the full length of the large bowel. Following recovery from a complete resection, patients should be observed carefully for 5 years by semiannual physical examinations and blood chemistry measurements. If a complete colonoscopy was not performed preoperatively, it should be carried out within the first several postoperative months. Some authorities favor measuring plasma CEA levels at 3-month intervals because of the sensitivity of this test as a marker for otherwise undetectable tumor recurrence. Subsequent endoscopic surveillance of the large bowel, probably at triennial intervals, is indicated, because patients who have been cured of one colorectal cancer have a 3\u20135% probability of developing an additional bowel cancer during their lifetime and a >15% risk for the development of adenomatous"

An acute perforation can present with a rigid abdomen, rebound tenderness, guarding, or other signs of peritoneal irritation. AXR to rule out perforation (free air under the diaphragm); CBC to assess for GI bleeding (low or \u2193 hematocrit). Upper endoscopy with biopsy to confirm PUD and to rule out active bleeding or gastric adenocarcinoma (10% of gastric ulcers); barium swallow is an alternative. H. pylori testing. In recurrent or refractory cases, serum gastrin can be used to screen for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (patients must discontinue PPI use prior to testing). Acute: Rule out active bleeding with serial hematocrits, a rectal exam with stool guaiac, and NG lavage. Monitor the patient\u2019s hematocrit and BP and treat with IV hydration, transfusion, IV PPIs, endoscopy, and surgery as needed for complications. If perforation is likely, emergent surgery is indicated."

Sometimes the initial presentation mimics acute appendicitis with 1953 pronounced right lower quadrant pain, a palpable mass, fever, and leukocytosis. Pain is usually colicky; it precedes and is relieved by defecation. A low-grade fever is usually noted. High-spiking fever suggests intraabdominal abscess formation. Weight loss is common\u2014typically 10\u201320% of body weight\u2014and develops as a consequence of diarrhea, anorexia, and fear of eating. An inflammatory mass may be palpated in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. The mass is composed of inflamed bowel, adherent and indurated mesentery, and enlarged abdominal lymph nodes."

Colonic motility is altered by inflammation with rapid transit through the inflamed intestine. When the disease is severe, patients pass a liquid stool containing blood, pus, and fecal matter. Diarrhea is often nocturnal and/or postprandial. Although severe pain is not a prominent symptom, some patients with active disease may experience vague lower abdominal discomfort or mild central abdominal cramping. Severe cramping and abdominal pain can occur with severe attacks of the disease. Other symptoms in moderate to severe disease include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, and weight loss."
