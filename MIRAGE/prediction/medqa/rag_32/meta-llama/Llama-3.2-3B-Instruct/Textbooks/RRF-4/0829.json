The patient was brought in from a nursing home with documentation stating that he has seemed confused for the past day according to the staff. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension. He is currently taking insulin, metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. His temperature is 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of cough and fatigue, fever, and confusion, which could be indicative of a respiratory infection, such as pneumonia. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension, and is currently taking several medications, which may interact with antibiotics. The physical exam reveals crackles on pulmonary exam and an S4 heart sound, which suggests heart failure. The patient's oxygen saturation is normal, but the respiratory rate is elevated, which could indicate respiratory distress. Given these findings, the next best step in management would be to start broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover a range of potential pathogens, including atypical bacteria. Azithromycin is a good choice because it is effective against atypical bacteria and can be used in patients with renal impairment, which may be the case given the patient's history of hypertension and diabetes. Admission to the medical floor may be necessary to monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment as needed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."

The patient is afebrile and normotensive but anxious, tachycardic, and markedly tachy-pneic. Auscultation of the chest reveals diffuse wheezes. The physician provisionally makes the diagnosis of bronchial asthma and administers epinephrine by intramuscular injec-tion, improving the patient\u2019s breathing over several minutes. A normal chest X-ray is subsequently obtained, and the medical history is remarkable only for mild hypertension that is being treated with propranolol. The physician instructs the patient to discontinue use of propranolol, and changes the patient\u2019s antihypertensive medication to verapamil. Why is the physician correct to discontinue propranolol? Why is verapamil a better choice for managing hypertension in this patient? What alternative treatment change might the physi-cian consider?"

Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse.

In addition, these symptoms may exist in isolation as anginal equivalents (i.e., symptoms of myocardial ischemia other than typical angina), particularly in women and the elderly. Dyspnea may occur with multiple conditions considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain and thus is not discriminative, but the presence of dyspnea is important because it suggests a cardiopulmonary etiology. Sudden onset of significant respiratory distress should lead to consideration of pulmonary embolism and spontaneous pneumothorax. Hemoptysis may occur with pulmonary embolism, or as blood-tinged frothy sputum in severe heart failure but usually points toward a pulmonary parenchymal etiology of chest symptoms. Presentation with syncope or pre-syncope should prompt consideration of hemodynamically significant pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection as"

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."
