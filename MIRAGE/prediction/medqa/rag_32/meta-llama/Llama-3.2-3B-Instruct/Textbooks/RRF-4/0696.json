    "question": "A 38-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for her yearly exam. Her only complaint is difficulty losing weight. Her BMI is 34 kg/m^2. In addition to a standard physical exam, the physician orders a glucose tolerance test. The woman's fasting blood glucose level is 120 mg/dL and two-hour post 75g glucose load blood glucose level is 190 mg/dL. The physician informs the patient that she is \"pre-diabetic\" or at risk of developing diabetes and recommends lifestyle modification with follow-up in 6 months. Which of the following endogenous signaling molecules or receptors will increase insulin sensitivity in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Catecholamines",
        "B": "Glucagon",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thought process and the final answer in JSON format: Step 1: The patient's fasting blood glucose level is 120 mg/dL, which is higher than the normal range (64-128 mg/dL), indicating impaired glucose regulation. Step 2: The two-hour post 75g glucose load blood glucose level is 190 mg/dL, which is higher than the normal range (70-140 mg/dL), indicating impaired glucose tolerance. Step 3: Based on the results, the patient is classified as having impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or prediabetes. Step 4: To increase insulin sensitivity, we need to consider the endogenous signaling molecules or receptors that can improve insulin sensitivity. Step 5: Among the options, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) is a key regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism. PPAR-\u03b3 agonists, such as thiazolidinediones, are known to increase insulin sensitivity by activating PPAR-\u03b3, which regulates glucose and lipid metabolism. Step 6: The other options are not directly related to increasing insulin sensitivity: - Catecholamines (e.g., adrenaline) are known to decrease insulin sensitivity. - Glucagon is a hormone that raises blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. - Glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol) can decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly in the liver. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is classified as having impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or prediabetes. To increase insulin sensitivity, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) is a key regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism. PPAR-\\u00b7-agonists, such as thiazolidinediones, are known to increase insulin sensitivity by activating PPAR-\\u00b7, which regulates glucose and lipid metabolism. Among the options, D. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

In obese, insulin-resistant women, caloric restriction that results in weight reduction will reduce the severity of insulin resistance (a 40% decrease in insulin level with a 10-kg weight loss) (75). This decrease in insulin levels should result in a marked decrease in androgen production (a 35% decrease in testosterone levels with a 10-kg weight loss) (76). Exercise reduces insulin resistance, independent from any associated weight loss, but data on the impact of exercise on the principal manifestations of PCOS are lacking."

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

The patient should eat nothing after midnight prior to the test day. On the morning of the test, adults are then given 75 g of glucose in 300 mL of water; children are given 1.75 g of glucose per kilogram of ideal body weight. The glucose load is consumed within 5 minutes. Blood samples for plasma glucose are obtained at 0 and 120 minutes after ingestion of glucose. An oral glucose tolerance test is normal if the fasting venous plasma glucose value is less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and the 2-hour value falls below 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L). A fasting value of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher or a 2-hour value of greater than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. Patients with 2-hour value of 140\u2013199 mg/dL (7.8\u201311.1 mmol/L) have impaired glucose tolerance."
