    "question": "Six hours after birth, a newborn boy is evaluated for tachypnea. He was delivered at 41 weeks' gestation via Caesarian section and the amniotic fluid was meconium-stained. His respiratory rate is 75/min. Physical examination shows increased work of breathing. X-rays of the abdomen and chest show no abnormalities. Echocardiography shows elevated pulmonary artery pressure. He is started on an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP, and there is immediate improvement in his tachypnea and oxygenation status. Three hours later, the newborn is tachypneic and there is blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this infant's cyanosis?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The infant was started on an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP, which is a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor such as sildenafil. This medication is used to treat pulmonary hypertension in newborns. The improvement in tachypnea and oxygenation status after administration of the medication suggests that the medication is effective. However, the development of cyanosis after 3 hours is a concerning sign that requires further evaluation. The blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes is a classic sign of cyanosis. The key to answering this question is to understand the potential side effects of sildenafil. Sildenafil can cause pulmonary hypertension, but it can also cause a condition called \"sildenafil-induced pulmonary hypertension\" or \"sildenafil toxicity.\" This condition is characterized by an increase in pulmonary artery pressure, which can lead to cyanosis. The other options are not directly related to the development of cyanosis in this scenario. Option A, increase in concentration of serum myoglobin, is not a known side effect of sildenafil. Option B, closure of the ductus arteriosus, is not related to the development of cyanosis in this scenario. Option D, allosteric alteration of heme groups, is a mechanism of action of sildenafil, but it is not directly related to the development of cyanosis. Therefore, the most likely cause of this infant's cyanosis is sildenafil-induced pulmonary hypertension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

Transient tachypnea of the newborn usually is noted in larger premature infants and in term infants born by precipitous delivery or cesarean section without prior labor. Infants of diabetic mothers and infants with poor respiratory drive as a result of placental passage of analgesic drugs are at risk. Transient tachypnea of the newborn may be caused by retained lung fluid or slow resorption of lung fluid. Chest radiographs show prominent central vascular markings, fluid in the lung fissures, overaeration, and occasionally a small pleural effusion. Air bronchograms and a reticulogranular pattern are not seen; their presence suggests another pulmonary process, such as RDS or pneumonia."

If oxygen deprivation and asphyxia persist, however, the newborn will develop deep gasping respirations, followed by seconday apnea. This latter stage is associated with a further decline in heart rate, fall in blood pressure, and loss of neuromuscular tone. Neonates in secondary apnea will not respond to stimulation and will not spontaneously resume respiratory eforts. Unless ventilation is assisted, death follows. Clinically, primary and secondary apneas are indistinguishable, and thus, secondary apnea must be assumed.

Manifestations of RDS include cyanosis, tachypnea, nasal flaring, intercostal and sternal retractions, and grunting. Grunting is caused by closure of the glottis during expiration, the effect of which is to maintain lung volume (decreasing atelectasis) and gas exchange during exhalation. Atelectasis is well documented by radiographic examination of the chest, which shows a ground-glass haze in the lung surrounding air-filled bronchi (the air bronchogram) (Fig. 61-2).

Early correction prevents complications such as arrhythmias, right ventricular dysfunction, and Eisenmenger\u2019s syndrome. Failure of the ductus arteriosus to close in the first few days of life, leading to a left-to-right shunt from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. Risk factors include maternal first-trimester rubella infection, prematurity, and female gender. Typically asymptomatic; patients with large defects may present with FTT, recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, lower extremity clubbing, and CHF. Exam reveals a wide pulse pressure; a continuous \u201cmachinery murmur\u201d at the second left intercostal space at the sternal border; a loud S2; and bounding peripheral pulses."

If the newborn is apneic or has copious secretions that it cannot clear, a bulb syringe or suction catheter may be used to clear the mouth and then the nose. Routine intubation and suctioning of meconium-stained amnionic luid is no longer recommended for the nonvigorous newborn (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2017b; Perlman, 2015). Intubation and suction are reserved for suspected airway obstruction. After completion of the initial stabilization steps, apnea, gasping respirations, or heart rate \ufffd 100 beats per minute (bpm) should prompt immediate administration of positivepressure ventilation with room air (Fig. 32-3). his should be started by 60 seconds of life, if not sooner, once the initial steps are completed."

With inspiration, there is alveolar expansion, fluid clearance, and surfactant secretion by type II pneumocytes to prevent alveolar collapse. Interference with these functions can create respiratory insuiciency with hypoxemia and compensatory tachypnea, nasal flaring, retractions, and grunting (Reuter, 2014). In preterm infants, this is caused by lung immaturity and insuicient surfactantrespiratory distress syndrome (DS}-and variants may be seen in severely ill older children and adults (Chap. 47, p. 918). All of these have some element of surfactant deiciency because the inciting agent damages alveolar epithelium. As fetuses approach term, surfactant deiciency as a cause of respiratory distress diminishes. he leading causes in term newborns are transient tachypnea of the newborn, RDS, meconium aspiration syndrome, pneumonia, persistent pulmonaY hypertension, and"

            "content": "Most normal infants require little pressure to spontaneously open the lungs after birth (5 to 10 cm H2O). With the onset of breathing, pulmonary vascular resistance decreases, partly a result of the mechanics of breathing and partly a result of the elevated arterial oxygen tensions. The increased blood flow to the lungs increases the volume of pulmonary venous blood returning to the left atrium; left atrial pressure now exceeds right atrial pressure, and the foramen ovale closes. As the flow through the pulmonary circulation increases and arterial oxygen tensions rise, the ductus arteriosus begins to constrict. In a term infant, this constriction functionally closes the ductus arteriosus within 1 day after birth. A permanent closure requires thrombosis and fibrosis, a process that may take several weeks. In a premature infant, the ductus arteriosus is less sensitive to the effects of oxygen; if circulating levels of vasodilating prostaglandins are elevated, the ductus arteriosus may"

This team readies equipment, ensures that adequate personnel are present, delegates roles and responsibilities, and considers contingency plans to stabilize the newborn. Four questions a neonatal provider will ask pertain to expected gestional age, amnionic fluid color, fetal number, and additional fetal risks. Several conditions are associated with a nonvigorous presentation. These may include immaturity, hypoxemia or acidosis from any cause, sepsis syndrome, recent drugs administered to the mother, and central nervous system developmental abnormalities. Those related to the respiratory tract are lung abnormalities, upper airway obstruction, pneumothorax, and meconium aspiration."
