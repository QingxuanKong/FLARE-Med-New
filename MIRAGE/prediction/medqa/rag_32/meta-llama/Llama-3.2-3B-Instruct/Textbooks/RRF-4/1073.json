    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which dexamethasone test result would help confirm the physician's suspicions of a pituitary adenoma, we need to understand the different types of Cushing's syndrome and how they respond to dexamethasone suppression tests. Cushing's syndrome can be caused by an ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma (Cushing's disease), an ectopic ACTH-producing tumor, or autonomous cortisol production (e.g., adrenal nodule). The dexamethasone suppression test is used to differentiate between these causes. In Cushing's disease (ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma), low-dose dexamethasone suppresses ACTH levels. However, high-dose dexamethasone suppresses cortisol levels. In ectopic ACTH-producing tumors, low-dose dexamethasone does not suppress ACTH levels, and high-dose dexamethasone also does not suppress ACTH levels. In autonomous cortisol production (e.g., adrenal nodule), ACTH levels are already suppressed, and high-dose dexamethasone has little additional effect on cortisol levels. Given these patterns, the correct answer is the one that shows no suppression of ACTH levels with low-dose dexamethasone and no change in ACTH levels with high-dose dexamethasone. The correct answer is C. Low-dose, no change in ACTH; high-dose, no change in ACTH.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Her weight is 136 lb (61.8 kg), an increase of 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the last year. Her thyroid gland is not palpable and her reflexes are delayed. Laboratory findings include a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 24.9 \u03bcIU/mL"

Adrenal hyperplasia secondary to a basophil adenoma of the pituitary (pituitary basophilia was Cushing\u2019s term) was the established pathology in Cushing\u2019s cases. It is to this pituitary form of hyperadrenalism that the term Cushing disease has been applied."

In addition, enlarging pituitary tumors may compress adjacent structures such as the optic chiasm or normal pituitary tissue, causing visual disturbances and/or hypopituitarism. In asymptomatic patients with MEN 1, periodic biochemical monitoring of serum prolactin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels, as well as MRI of the pituitary, can lead to early identification of pituitary tumors (Table 408-3). In patients with abnormal results, hypothalamic-pituitary testing should characterize the nature of the pituitary lesion and its effects on the secretion of other pituitary hormones."

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

If cortisol production is driven by an ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma, dexamethasone suppression is ineffective at low doses but usually induces suppression at high doses. If cortisol production is driven by an ectopic source of ACTH, the tumors are usually resistant to dexamethasone suppression. Thus, the dexamethasone suppression test is useful to establish the diagnosis of Cushing\u2019s syndrome and to assist with the differential diagnosis of cortisol excess."

Moon facies, buffalo hump, and truncal obesity-High insulin (due to high glucose) increases storage of fat centrally. 3. Abdominal striae-Impaired collagen synthesis results in thinning of skin 4.

At very high levels, cortisol cross-reacts with mineralocorticoid receptors (aldosterone is not increased). 5. 6. C. Diagnosis is based on 24-hour urine cortisol level (increased), late night salivary cortisol level (increased), and low-dose dexamethasone suppression test."
