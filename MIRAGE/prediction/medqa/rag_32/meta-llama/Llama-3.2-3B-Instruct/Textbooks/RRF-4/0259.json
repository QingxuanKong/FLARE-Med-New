Hereditary hemochromatosis is an inherited disorder of iron metabolism that results in a progressive increase in hepatic iron deposition, leading to liver disease and other complications. The HFE gene is the most common gene associated with hereditary hemochromatosis, particularly in populations of northern European descent. It encodes an HLA class I-like molecule that regulates the synthesis of hepcidin in hepatocytes. Mutations in the HFE gene, such as the C282Y mutation, can lead to the development of hereditary hemochromatosis. The other options, BCR-ABL, BRCA, and FA, are not directly associated with hereditary hemochromatosis. BCR-ABL is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia, BRCA is associated with breast and ovarian cancer, and FA is associated with Fanconi anemia. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

Otherwise, for practical purposes, children need not be checked before they are 18 years old. The role of population screening for hemochromatosis is controversial. Recent studies indicate that it is highly effective for primary care physicians to screen subjects using transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels. Such screening also detects iron deficiency. Genetic screening of the normal population is feasible but is probably not cost effective."

The patient has hereditary hemochromatosis, a disease of iron overload that results from inappropriately low levels of hepcidin caused primarily by mutations to the HFE (high iron) gene. Hepcidin regulates ferroportin, the only known iron export protein in humans, by increasing its degradation. The increase in iron with hepcidin deficiency causes hyperpigmentation and hyperglycemia (\u201cbronze diabetes\u201d). Phlebotomy or use of iron chelators is the treatment.

Strategies for the development of therapeutic interventions have a long history in childhood metabolic diseases; however, these principles have been applied in the diagnosis and management of adult-onset diseases as well (Table 84-2). Hereditary hemochromatosis is usually caused by mutations in HFE (although other genes have been less commonly associated) and manifests as a syndrome of iron overload, which can lead to liver disease, skin pigmentation, diabetes mellitus, arthropathy, impotence in males, and cardiac issues (Chap. 428). When identified early, the disorder can be managed effectively with therapeutic phlebotomy. Therefore, when the diagnosis of hemochromatosis has been made in a proband, it is important to counsel and offer testing to other family members in order to minimize the impact of the disorder."

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

            "content": "The most frequently mutated gene in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis is HFE, which is located on chromosome 6 close to the HLA gene cluster. HFE encodes an HLA class I\u2013like molecule that regulates the synthesis of hepcidin in hepatocytes. The most common HFE mutation is a cysteine-to-tyrosine substitution at amino acid 282 (C282Y). This mutation, which inactivates the HFE protein, is present in over 70% of patients diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis and is most common in European populations. Several other mutations can also give rise to http://ebooksmedicine.net hemochromatosis, including other mutations in HFE as well as mutations in transferrin receptor 2 and in hepcidin itself. The associated clinical condition is milder with some of these alternative mutations and more severe with others, childhood. Whatever the underlying cause, the onset of disease typically occurs after 20 gm of stored iron have accumu lated. Excessive iron appears to be directly toxic to host"

While the frequency of hemochromatosis is relatively common, with genetic susceptibility occurring in 1 in 250 individuals, the frequency of end-stage manifestations due to the disease is relatively low, and fewer than 5% of those patients who are genotypically susceptible will go on to develop severe liver disease from hemochromatosis. Diagnosis is made with serum iron studies showing an elevated transferrin saturation and an elevated ferritin level, along with abnormalities identified by HFE mutation analysis. Treatment is straightforward, with regular therapeutic phlebotomy."

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."
