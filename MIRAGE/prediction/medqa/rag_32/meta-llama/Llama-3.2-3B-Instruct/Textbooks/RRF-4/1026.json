    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care provider after feeling sad and depressed for the past several months. His wife divorced him about 6 months ago and took the kids and moved out of state. Since then he has had difficulty waking up in the morning and getting to work on time. He takes some comfort in food and has gained about 9.1 kg (20 lb). He eats out several times a week and sometimes consumes 2 whole meals in one sitting. Other than this new obsession with eating large quantities of food and excess sleeping he no longer enjoys doing things he liked doing in the past. Besides eating and sleeping he is always excited to see his children and looks forward to their visits. He says it's the one thing keeping him going. Additionally, he does not feel like he has the same drive or focuses at work. He reports that he has no interest in hurting himself or others. His blood pressure is 119/81 mm Hg, pulse rate is 85/min, respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F). His physical exam is normal. What other symptom is most likely present in this patient?",

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's analyze the given information step by step. **Step 1: Identify the key symptoms and history** The patient is a 45-year-old man who has been feeling sad and depressed for several months. His wife divorced him 6 months ago, and he has experienced significant changes in his behavior and appetite since then. He has gained weight, gained about 9.1 kg (20 lb), and has become obsessed with eating large quantities of food. He also sleeps excessively and has lost interest in activities he previously enjoyed. **Step 2: Consider the potential diagnoses** Based on the patient's symptoms, the primary diagnosis appears to be depression, specifically a type known as \"bipolar depression\" or \"depressive pseudobulbar affect.\" This condition is characterized by excessive sleepiness, weight gain, and a lack of interest in activities, which are all present in this patient. **Step 3: Analyze the options** Now, let's evaluate the options: A. **Leaden paralysis**: This is a symptom of hypothyroidism, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms or history. B. **Depressive symptoms that are worse in the morning**: While the patient does experience depressive symptoms, there is no indication that they worsen in the morning. C. **Stereotypies**: Stereotypies are repetitive, non-functional movements that are often seen in patients with schizophrenia. There is no evidence to suggest this patient has schizophrenia. D. **Mania**: Mania is characterized by excessive energy, decreased need for sleep, and increased talkativeness. This patient's symptoms, such as excessive sleepiness and lack of interest in activities, do not support a diagnosis of mania. **Step 4: Determine the most likely symptom** Based on the analysis, the most likely symptom present in this patient is **B. Depressive symptoms that are worse in the morning**. This is a common symptom of depression, particularly in bipolar depression. **Output:** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms, such as excessive sleepiness, weight gain, and lack of interest in activities, are consistent with a diagnosis of depression. Depressive symptoms that are worse in the morning are a common symptom of depression, particularly in bipolar depression. This makes option B the most likely correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Information from a bed partner or family member is often helpful because some patients may be unaware of symptoms such as heavy snoring or may underreport symptoms such as falling asleep at work or while driving. Physicians should inquire about when the patient typically goes to bed, when they fall asleep and wake up, whether they awaken during sleep, whether they feel rested in the morning, and whether they nap during the day. Depending on the primary complaint, it may be useful to ask about snoring, witnessed apneas, restless sensations in the legs, movements during sleep, depression, anxiety, and behaviors around the sleep episode.

The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy. One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC). He undergoes surgical resection and is found to have high-risk stage III CRC with five positive lymph nodes. After surgery, he feels entirely well with no symptoms. Of note, he has no other illnesses. What is this patient\u2019s overall prognosis? Based on his prognosis, what"

            "content": "The physician\u2019s task is to determine whether the patient is merely suffering from the common physical and mental effects of overwork or from personal life stresses. Overworked, overwrought people are observable everywhere in our society. In addition to fatigue, such persons frequently show irritability, restlessness, sleeplessness, and anxiety, sometimes to the point of panic attacks and a variety of somatic symptoms, particularly abdominal, thoracic, and cranial discomforts. Formerly, society accepted this state in responsible individuals and prescribed the obvious cure, a vacation. Even Charcot made time for regular \u201ccures\u201d during the year, in which he retired to a spa without family, colleagues, or the drain of work. Nowadays, the need to contain this type of stress, to which some individuals are more prone than others, has spawned an industry of meditation, yoga, and similar activities. Individuals with hobbies, nonwork interests, and athletic pursuits seem to be less subject to"

            "content": "The physical examination should be methodical and thorough, with consideration given to the patient\u2019s comfort and modesty. Although attention is often directed by the history to the diseased organ or part of the body, the examination of a new patient must extend from head to toe in an objective search for abnormalities. Unless the physical examination is systematic and is performed consistently from patient to patient, important segments may be omitted inadvertently. The results of the examination, like the details of the history, should be recorded at the time they are elicited\u2014not hours later, when they are subject to the distortions of memory. Skill in physical diagnosis is acquired with experience, but it is not merely technique that determines success in eliciting signs of disease. The detection of a few scattered petechiae, a faint diastolic murmur, or a small mass in the abdomen is not a question of keener eyes and ears or more sensitive fingers but of a mind alert to those"

Focused History: AK is known to the ED staff from previous visits. He has a 6year history of chronic, excessive alcohol consumption. He is not known to take illicit drugs. At this ED visit, AK reports that he has been drinking heavily in the past day or so. He cannot recall having eaten anything in that time. There is evidence of recent vomiting, but no blood is apparent."

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis?

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."
