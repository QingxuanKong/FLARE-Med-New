    "question": "A 38-year-old woman is being evaluated by her primary care physician for chronic, widespread pain that started around 5 months ago. This pain has been accompanied by sleeping issues. Her friend recommended that she try yoga to relieve the pain, but she says this has not helped her at all. Se says the symptoms have begun to impact her daily functions and keep her from doing things she used to enjoy. Past medical history includes generalized anxiety disorder, for which she currently takes no medication. The patient had been previously medicated with paroxetine for 5 years. On physical examination, several areas of point tenderness are found on the occipital region, elbows, and medial surface of both knees. Laboratory work up is unremarkable. What is the best treatment option for the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best treatment option for the patient, we need to consider the symptoms and history provided. The patient is experiencing chronic, widespread pain that started around 5 months ago, accompanied by sleeping issues. The pain has been impacting her daily functions and has not been relieved by yoga. She has a history of generalized anxiety disorder and was previously medicated with paroxetine. The physical examination reveals point tenderness on the occipital region, elbows, and medial surface of both knees. Given the chronic nature of the pain and its impact on daily life, it is likely that the patient has fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep, memory, and mood issues. The tender points on the occipital region, elbows, and medial surface of both knees are classic findings in fibromyalgia. The patient's history of generalized anxiety disorder and previous treatment with paroxetine also supports the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia often co-occurs with anxiety disorders, and the patient's symptoms of widespread pain, fatigue, and sleeping issues are consistent with fibromyalgia. Considering the diagnosis of fibromyalgia, the best treatment option is A. Low-dose prednisolone. Low-dose prednisolone is often used to treat fibromyalgia as it has anti-inflammatory properties and can help reduce pain and inflammation. High-dose prednisolone may be used in cases of severe inflammation, but low-dose prednisolone is generally recommended as a first-line treatment for fibromyalgia. Paroxetine is an SSRI that may be used to treat comorbid anxiety disorders, but it is not the primary treatment for fibromyalgia. Allopurinol is a medication used to treat gout and high levels of uric acid, and it is not typically used to treat fibromyalgia. Therefore, the best treatment option for the patient is A. Low-dose prednisolone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

            "content": "A 19-year-old college sophomore began to show paranoid traits. She became convinced that her roommate was listening in on her phone conversations and planning to alter her essays. She became reclusive and spent most of her time locked in her room. After much difficulty, her teachers convinced her to be seen by the student health service. It was believed she was beginning to show signs of schizophrenia and she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where she was started on antipsychotic medications. While in the hospital, she had a generalized seizure which prompted her transfer to our service. Her spinal fluid analysis showed 10 lymphocytes per mL3. She was found to have an anti-NMDA receptor antibody, which prompted an ultrasound examination of the pelvis. The left ovary was thought to show a benign cyst. Because of the neurological syndrome, the ovarian cyst was resected and revealed a microscopic ovarian teratoma. The neuropsychiatric syndrome resolved. She has since graduated and"

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

Every day, healthy persons of all ages have pains that must be taken as part of normal sensory experience. To mention a few, there are the \u201cgrowing pains\u201d of presumed bone and joint origin of children; the momentary shock-like pains over an eye or in the temporal or occipital regions (\u201cice-pick\u201d pain), which strike with such suddenness as to raise the suspicion of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm; inexplicable split-second jabs of pain elsewhere; the more persistent ache in the shoulder, hip, or extremity that subsides spontaneously or in response to a change in position; the fluctuant precordial discomfort of gastrointestinal origin, which conjures up fear of cardiac disease; and the breathtaking \u201cstitch in the side\u201d caused by intercostal or diaphragmatic cramp during exercise. These \u201cnormal pains,\u201d as they may be called, tend to be brief and to depart as obscurely as they came. Such pains come to notice only"

            "content": "Patients reacting to a medical or neurologic illness seldom express feelings of sadness or despair without mentioning physical accompaniments such as easy fatigability, anxiety, headaches, dizziness, loss of appetite, reduced interest in life and love, trouble in falling asleep, or premature awakening. It follows that whenever these symptoms become manifest in the course of medical disease, they should arouse suspicion of a depressive reaction (Table 48-1). Chronic pain is a frequent somatic manifestation of depression. The pain may be based on an attendant disease but is prolonged, disabling, sometimes vague in nature, and recalcitrant to straightforward medical and surgical approaches. Furthermore, depressed mood exacerbates and prolongs pain of any type. All patients with chronic pain syndromes should be evaluated psychiatrically, as pointed out in Chap. 7."

            "content": "In the introductory chapter on pain, reference was made to the necessity, in dealing with any painful state, of determining its quality, severity, location, duration, and time course as well as the conditions that produce, exacerbate, or relieve it. In the case of headache, a detailed history following these lines will determine the diagnosis more often than will the physical examination or imaging. Nevertheless, a few aspects of the examination are worth emphasizing. For example, auscultation of the skull may rarely disclose a bruit (with large arteriovenous malformations); palpation may disclose the tender, hardened or elevated arteries of temporal arteritis; sensitive areas overlying a cranial metastasis or an inflamed paranasal sinus may be apparent; or there may be a tender occipital nerve. Examination of neck flexion may reveal meningitis; however, apart from such special instances, examination of the head itself, although necessary, seldom discloses the diagnosis."
