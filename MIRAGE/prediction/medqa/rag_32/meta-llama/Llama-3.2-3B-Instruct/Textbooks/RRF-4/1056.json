The patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia 4 years ago and has since tried several antipsychotic medications, none of which have been able to treat his negative symptoms. He has changed to clozapine 2 weeks ago and says that he does feel better. His physical exam is unremarkable, and he is responding appropriately to questioning.

Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication that is used to treat schizophrenia, particularly in patients who have not responded to other treatments. One of the potential side effects of clozapine is agranulocytosis, a potentially life-threatening decrease in white blood cell count. To monitor for this side effect, regular blood tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), are recommended. The patient should also be monitored for other potential side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and QT interval prolongation. However, among the options provided, the most relevant laboratory test to order is a complete blood count (CBC) to monitor for agranulocytosis, which is a potential side effect of clozapine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

If symptoms are present for more than 1 month but less than 6 months, a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is made. Psychotic symptoms that do not meet full diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia but are clinically significant are diagnosed as psychotic disorder not otherwise specified. There are several disorders that have to be distinguished from schizophrenia. These include the following: Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed when a person has clear symptoms of schizophrenia for at least 2 weeks without active symptoms of depression or mania. These affective syndromes occur at other times, even when psychotic symptoms are present."

The diagnosis is principally one of exclusion, requiring the absence of significant associated mood symptoms, any relevant medical condition, and substance abuse. Drug reactions that cause hallucinations, paranoia, confusion, or bizarre behavior may be dose-related or idiosyncratic; parkinsonian medications, clonidine, quinacrine, and procaine derivatives are the most common prescription medications associated with these symptoms. Drug causes should be ruled out in any case of newly emergent psychosis.

In some systems, this has seemingly reduced the incidence of relapse. The modern era of treatment of schizophrenia began in 1952, with the incidental demonstration by the French surgeon Henri Laborit of the antipsychosis properties of chlorpromazine. Subsequently, a large number of other phenothiazines have been used to treat chronic and acute psychosis. Treatment consists essentially of the administration of one of several similar antipsychotic medications. The various classes of antipsychotic drugs, their mode of action, and neurologic (\u201cneuroleptic\u201d) side effects are discussed in Chap. 41."

            "content": "Some of the second-generation antipsychotic drugs produce more weight gain and increases in lipids than some first-generation drugs. A small percentage of patients develop diabetes mellitus, most often seen with clozapine and olanzapine. Ziprasidone is the second-generation drug causing the least weight gain. Risperidone, lurasidone, brexpiprazole, paliperidone, and aripiprazole usually produce small increases in weight and lipids. Asenapine and quetiapine have an intermediate effect. Clozapine and olanzapine frequently result in large increases in weight and lipids. Thus, these drugs should be considered as second-line drugs unless there is a specific indication. That is the case with clozapine, which at high doses (300\u2013900 mg/d) is effective in the majority of patients with schizophrenia refractory to other drugs, provided that treatment is continued for up to 6 months. Case reports and several clinical trials suggest that high-dose olanzapine, ie, doses of 30\u201345 mg/d, may also be"

            "content": "Present views of the disease now called schizophrenia originated with Emil Kraepelin, a Munich psychiatrist, who first clearly separated it from bipolar psychosis. He called it dementia praecox (adopting the term introduced earlier by Morel) to refer to a deterioration of mental function at an early age, from a previous level of normalcy. At first, Kraepelin believed that \u201ccatatonia\u201d and \u201chebephrenia,\u201d which had previously been described by Kahlbaum and by Hecker, respectively, as well as the paranoid form of schizophrenia, were separate diseases, but later, by 1898, he had concluded that several subtypes were a single disease. He emphasized an onset in adolescence or early adult life and a chronic course, often ending in marked deterioration of personality as the defining attributes of all forms of the disease. Early in the 20th century, the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler substituted the term schizophrenia for dementia praecox. This was an improvement insofar as the term dementia"

Rosenthal, MD A 29-year-old Peruvian man presents with the incidental finding of a 10 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8-cm liver cyst on an abdominal com-puted tomography (CT) scan. The patient had noted 2 days of abdominal pain and fever, and his clinical evaluation and CT scan were consistent with appendicitis. His clinical find-ings resolved after laparoscopic appendectomy. The patient immigrated to the USA 10 years ago from a rural area of Peru where his family trades in sheepskins. His father and sister have undergone resection of abdominal masses, but details of their diagnoses are unavailable. What is your differential diagnosis? What are your diagnostic and therapeutic plans?"

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

Olanzapine showed greater effectiveness than quetiapine, risperidone, perphenazine, or ziprasidone but also a higher discontinuation rate due to weight gain and metabolic effects. Surprisingly, perphenazine, a first-generation agent, showed little evidence of inferiority to newer drugs. Drug treatment of schizophrenia is by itself insufficient. Educational efforts directed toward families and relevant community resources have proved to be necessary to maintain stability and optimize outcome. A treatment model involving a multidisciplinary case-management team that seeks out and closely follows the patient in the community has proved particularly effective."
