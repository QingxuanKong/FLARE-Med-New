    "question": "An 18-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department because of a cough that her parents are worried about. She has had a runny nose and a low-grade fever for the past 2 days, with some hoarseness and a rough-sounding cough that started this afternoon. This evening she began making some high-pitched sounds when taking breaths, and she seemed to be having some trouble breathing. She is alert and does not appear to be in acute distress. She has a temperature of 38.0\u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F), with a respiratory rate of 50/min and O2 saturation of 97%. There is audible inspiratory stridor that worsens when she starts to cry during the examination. She has an occasional barking cough. Her pharynx is mildly erythematous with normal tonsils and no exudate. A frontal X-ray of the upper chest airways is obtained (shown in the image). Which of the following is the best step in management?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the symptoms and examination findings of the 18-month-old girl, the key features that suggest an acute upper airway obstruction are the inspiratory stridor, hoarseness, and a barking cough. The presence of stridor, in particular, is a red flag for epiglottitis, which is a medical emergency. The fact that the stridor worsens with crying also points towards epiglottitis. The frontal X-ray of the upper chest airways should be interpreted with caution, as it may not always show the classic 'thumbprint sign' of epiglottitis. The symptoms and signs of epiglottitis are more consistent with this diagnosis than croup, which typically presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms and is not associated with inspiratory stridor. Therefore, the best step in management is to obtain an anterior-posterior and lateral radiograph of the neck to confirm the diagnosis of epiglottitis or rule out other causes of upper airway obstruction. This will guide further management, which may include securing the airway and administering racemic epinephrine and intramuscular corticosteroids.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Stridor is a harsh, high-pitched respiratory sound produced by turbulent airflow. It is usually inspiratory, but it may be biphasic and is a sign of upper airway obstruction. Signs of upper airway obstruction, such as labored breathing and marked suprasternal, intercostal, and subcostal retractions, may be evident on examination (see Chapter 135). Wheezing may be present if there is associated lower airway involvement."

If bronchiolitis or pneumonia develops, progressive cough accompanied by wheezing, tachypnea, and intercostal retractions may occur. In this setting, sputum production increases modestly.

When the chest was percussed it was noted that the anterior aspect of the left chest was dull, compared to the resonant percussion note of the remainder of the chest. Auscultation (listening with a stethoscope) revealed decreased breath sounds, which were hoarse in nature (bronchial breathing). A diagnosis of chest infection was made. Chest infection is a common disease. In most patients the infection affects the large airways and bronchi. If the infection continues, exudates and transudates are produced, filling the alveoli and the secondary pulmonary lobules. The diffuse patchy nature of this type of infection is termed bronchial pneumonia. Given the patient\u2019s specific clinical findings, bronchial pneumonia was unlikely."

While most commonly a sign of asthma, peribronchial edema in the setting of congestive heart failure can also result in diffuse wheezes, as can any other process that causes narrowing of small airways. For this reason, clinicians must take care not to attribute all wheezing to asthma. Rhonchi are a manifestation of obstruction of medium-sized airways, most often with secretions. In the acute setting, this manifestation may be a sign of viral or bacterial bronchitis. Chronic rhonchi suggest bronchiectasis or COPD. Stridor, a high-pitched, focal inspiratory wheeze, usually heard over the neck, is a manifestation of upper airway obstruction and should prompt expedited evaluation of the patient, as it can precede complete upper airway obstruction and respiratory failure."

After an incubation period averaging 7\u201310 days, an illness develops that is indistinguishable from the common cold and is characterized by coryza, lacrimation, mild cough, low-grade fever, and malaise. After 1\u20132 weeks, this catarrhal phase evolves into the paroxysmal phase: the cough becomes more frequent and spasmodic with repetitive bursts of 5\u201310 coughs, often within a single expiration. Posttussive vomiting is frequent, with a mucous plug occasionally expelled at the end of an episode. The episode may be terminated by an audible whoop, which occurs upon rapid inspiration against a closed glottis at the end of a paroxysm. During a spasm, there may be impressive neck-vein distension, bulging eyes, tongue"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

The majority of these are related to cell damage caused by smoking and alcohol use. Certain viruses are also related to cancers in the head and neck, including human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). A 50-year-old overweight woman came to the doctor complaining of hoarseness of voice and noisy breathing. She was also concerned at the increase in size of her neck. On examination she had a slow pulse rate (45 beats per minute). She also had an irregular knobby mass in the anterior aspect of the lower neck, which deviated the trachea to the right. A clinical diagnosis of a multinodular goiter and hypothyroidism was made."

A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative."

Rales are usually not present on auscultation, and signs of consolidation and alveolar involvement are absent. During auscultation of the chest, signs of pneumonia such as fine rales, decreased breath sounds, and euphonia (\u201cE to A changes\u201d) should be sought. If the results of the physical examination are uncertain or the patient\u2019s condition appears to be in respiratory distress chest radiography should be performed to detect the presence of parenchymal disease. Paradoxically, as the initial acute syndrome subsides, sputum production may become more purulent. Sputum cultures are of limited value because of the polymicrobial nature of infections. In the absence of complications, treatment is directed to relief of symptoms. The use of antibiotics is reserved for patients in whom chest radiography findings are consistent with pneumonia. Cough is usually the most aggravating symptom and may be treated"

Respiratory signs are varied, including dullness to percussion in areas of the chest with significant consolidation, crackles on auscultation, reduced expansion of the chest in some cases as a result of splinting to reduce pain, bronchial breathing in a minority of cases, pleural rub in occasional cases, and cyanosis in cases with significant hypoxemia. Among infants with severe pneumonia, chest wall indrawing and nasal flaring are common. Nonrespiratory findings can include upper abdominal pain if the diaphragmatic pleura is involved as well as mental status changes, particularly confusion in elderly patients."

In severe exacerbations, patients may be so breathless that they are unable to complete sentences and may become cyanotic. Examination usually shows increased ventilation, hyperinflation, and tachycardia. Pulsus paradoxus may be present, but this is rarely a useful clinical sign. There is a marked fall in spirometric values and PEF. Arterial blood gases on air show hypoxemia, and PCO2 is usually low due to hyperventilation. A normal or rising PCO2 is an indication of impending respiratory failure and requires immediate monitoring and therapy. A chest roentgenogram is not usually informative but may show pneumonia or pneumothorax."
