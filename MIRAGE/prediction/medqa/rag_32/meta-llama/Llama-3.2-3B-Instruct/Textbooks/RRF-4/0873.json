    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the question: The newborn child was born to a mother with known hepatitis B, and the infant's APGAR scores are good (7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively). However, the child's blood pressure is low (80/52 mm Hg), which may indicate hypovolemia or anemia. The mother's hepatitis B status is unknown, and the infant's hepatitis B serology is not known. To determine the best course of action, we need to consider the risk of hepatitis B transmission from the mother to the infant. According to the CDC, the risk of hepatitis B transmission from an HBeAg-positive mother to her infant is approximately 90%, while the risk is approximately 5% if the mother is HBsAg-positive but HBeAg-negative. Since the mother's hepatitis B status is unknown, it is essential to administer hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) to the infant as a precautionary measure to prevent hepatitis B transmission. Additionally, the infant should receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible, as recommended by the CDC. Administering hepatitis B vaccine alone (option A) may not provide adequate protection against hepatitis B transmission from the mother, as the risk is higher if the mother is HBeAg-positive. Administering hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG together (option C) is the recommended course of action to provide both immediate and long-term protection against hepatitis B transmission. Options B (administering HBIG alone) and D (checking hepatitis B serology) are not the best choices, as they do not address the risk of hepatitis B transmission from the mother to the infant. Therefore, the best course of action is to administer hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG to the infant.

Persistence of HBeAg in serum beyond the first 3 months of acute infection may be predictive of the development of chronic infection, and the presence of HBeAg during chronic hepatitis B tends to be associated with ongoing viral replication, infectivity, and inflammatory liver injury (except during the early decades after perinatally acquired HBV infection; see below)."

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

Initial blood tests include a complete blood count, a determination of blood type with h status, and an antibody screen. The Institute of Medicine recommends universal human immunodeiciency virus (HIV) testing, with patient notiication and right of refusal, as a routine part of prenatal care. The CDC (Branson, 2006) as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (20 16f, 2017) continue to support this practice. If a woman declines testing, this is recorded in the prenatal record. All pregnant women are also screened for hepatitis B virus infection, syphilis, and immunity to rubella at the initial visit. Based on their prospective investigation of 1000 women, Murray and coworkers (2002) concluded that in the absence of hypertension, routine urinalysis beyond the irst prenatal visit was not necessary. A urine culture is recommended by most because"

Anti-HBs may persist for life and confers protection, which is the rationale for current vaccines containing HBsAg. HBeAg and HBV DNA appear in serum soon after HBsAg and signify ongoing viral replication. Persistence of HBeAg is an indicator of progression to chronic hepatitis. The appearance of anti-HBe antibodies implies that an acute infection has peaked and is on the wane. IgM anti-HBc becomes detectable in serum shortly before the onset of symptoms, concurrent with the onset of elevated serum aminotransferase levels (indicative of hepatocyte destruction). Over a period of months, the IgM anti-HBc antibody is replaced by IgG anti-HBc. As in the case of anti-HAV, there is no direct assay for IgG anti-HBc; its presence is inferred from decline of IgM anti-HBc in the face of rising total anti-HBc."
