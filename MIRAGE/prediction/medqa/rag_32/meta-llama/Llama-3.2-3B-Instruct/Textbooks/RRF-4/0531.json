    "question": "A 24-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room (ER) by her co-workers after they found her unconscious in her cubicle when they returned from lunch. They tell you that she has diabetes but do not know anything more about her condition. The woman\u2019s vital signs include: pulse 110/min, respiratory rate 24/min, temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), and blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is breathing heavily and gives irrelevant responses to questions. The skin and mucous membranes appear dry. Examination of the abdomen reveals mild diffuse tenderness to palpation. Deep tendon reflexes in the extremities are 1+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:\nFinger stick glucose 630 mg/dL\nArterial blood gas analysis:\npH 7.1\nPO2 90 mm Hg\nPCO2 33 mm Hg\nHCO3 8 mEq/L\nSerum:\nSodium 135 mEq/L\nPotassium 3.1 mEq/L\nChloride 136 mEq/L\nBlood urea nitrogen 20 mg/dL\nSerum creatinine 1.2 mg/dL\nUrine examination shows:\nGlucose Positive\nKetones Positive\nLeukocytes Negative\nNitrite Negative\nRBCs Negative\nCasts Negative\nThe patient is immediately started on a bolus of intravenous (IV) 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl). Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is a serious complication of diabetes. The key findings include hyperglycemia (630 mg/dL), acidosis (pH 7.1), and the presence of ketones in the urine. The patient is also showing signs of dehydration (dry skin and mucous membranes) and is hypotensive (blood pressure 90/60 mmHg).\\n\\nThe initial management of DKA involves correcting the dehydration, acidosis, and hyperglycemia. The patient has been started on a bolus of 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl), which is a good initial step in correcting dehydration. However, the next best step is to correct the acidosis and hyperglycemia.\\n\\nThe patient has severe acidosis (pH 7.1) and hyperglycemia (630 mg/dL), which requires immediate attention. The use of IV insulin is the most appropriate next step in management, as it will help to lower the blood glucose levels and correct the acidosis. Insulin therapy should be started as soon as possible, ideally within 30-60 minutes of presentation.\\n\\nThe other options are not the best next step in management. Switching fluids to 0.45% NaCl may be considered later, but it is not the immediate priority. Administering sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) may be considered if the patient has severe metabolic acidosis, but it is not the first line of treatment. Replacing potassium intravenously is not necessary at this time, as the patient's potassium level is not critically low.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Start IV insulin infusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

Results on blood tests performed by the clinical laboratory are shown below: H=High;L=Low. Microscopic examination of her urine revealed a urinary tract infection (UTI). Diagnosis: MW is in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) that was precipitated by a UTI. [Note: Diabetes increases the risk for infections such as UTI.] Immediate Treatment: MW was rehydrated with normal saline given intravenously (IV). She also was given insulin IV. Blood glucose, ketone bodies, and electrolytes were measured periodically. Antibiotic treatment of her UTI was started. Long-Term Treatment: Diabetes increases the risk for macrovascular complications (such as coronary artery disease and stroke) and microvascular complications (such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy). Ongoing monitoring for these complications will be continued."

The main constituents of CSF in the lumbar cistern are listed in Table 4.2. For comparison the concentrations of the same constituents in blood are also given. CSF has a lower concentration of K+ , glucose, and protein but a greater concentration of Na+ and Cl\u2212 than blood does. Furthermore, CSF contains practically no blood cells. The increased concentration of Na+ and Cl\u2212 enables CSF to be isotonic to blood. The pressure in the CSF column is about 120 to 180 mm H2O when a person is recumbent.
