    "question": "A 14-year-old girl comes to the physician with her father for evaluation of her short stature. She feels well overall, but is concerned because all of her friends are taller than her. Her birth weight was normal. Her father reports he had a short stature during his teenage years; he is currently 177 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall. She is at the 2ndpercentile for height and 35th percentile for weight. Breast development is Tanner stage 2. Pubic and axillary hair is absent. An x-ray of the left hand and wrist shows a bone age of 11 years. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?",

Her bone age is delayed at 11 years, which suggests that her growth rate is not keeping up with her peers. The patient's Tanner stage is 2, indicating early breast development but no pubic or axillary hair. The patient's family history of short stature is also noteworthy, as her father had a similar experience during his teenage years. The delayed bone age and family history suggest that the patient may have a constitutional delay in growth and puberty, rather than a pathological cause for her short stature. The next best step in management would be to reassure the patient and follow up with regular monitoring of her growth and development, as most children with constitutional delay reach their full height by adulthood.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Mean growth velocity is ~6 cm/year in later childhood and usually is maintained within a given range on a standardized percentile chart. Peak growth rates occur during midpuberty when bone age is 12 (girls) or 13 (boys). Secondary sexual development is associated with elevated sex steroids that cause progressive epiphyseal growth plate closure. Bone age is delayed in patients with all forms of true GH deficiency or GH receptor defects that result in attenuated GH action. Short stature may occur as a result of constitutive intrinsic growth defects or because of acquired extrinsic factors that impair growth. In general, delayed bone age in a child with short stature is suggestive of a hormonal or systemic disorder, whereas normal bone age in a short child is more likely to be caused by a genetic cartilage dysplasia or growth plate disorder (Chap. 427)."

The bone age is delayed, but the growth rate remains mostly within the lower limits of normal. Constitutional delay usually leads to a delay in secondary sexual development. Genetic or familial short stature (Table 173-3) refers to the stature of a child of short parents, who is expected to reach a lower than average height and yet normal for these parents. If the parents were malnourished as children, grew up in a zone of war, or suffered famine, the heights of the parents are less predictive. Although there are differences in height associated with ethnicity, the most significant difference in stature between ethnic groups is the result of nutrition."

She has many freckles on her face, neck, arms, and hands, and the parents report that she is unusually sensitive to sunlight. Two basal cell carcinomas are identified on her face. Based on the clinical picture, which of the following processes is most likely to be defective in this patient? A. Repair of double-strand breaks by error-prone homologous recombination B. Removal of mismatched bases from the 3\u2032-end of Okazaki fragments by a methyl-directed process C. Removal of pyrimidine dimers from DNA by nucleotide excision repair D. Removal of uracil from DNA by base excision repair"

The interval from the initiation of thelarche to the onset of menses (menarche) is 2.3 \u00b1 1 years. Pubertal changes before 6 years of Stage 2 Breast bud stage. A small mound is formed by the elevation of the breast and papilla. The areolar diameter enlarges. Stage 3 There is further enlargement of breast and areola with no separation of their contours. Stage 4 There is a projection of the areola and papilla to form a secondary mound above the level of the breast. Stage 5 The breasts resemble those of a mature female as the areola has recessed to the general contour of the breast. Stage 2 There is sparse growth of long, slightly pigmented, downy hair, straight or only slightly curled, primarily along the labia."

Mucosal tags of the labia majora arecommon. Distention of an imperforate hymen may produce hydrometrocolpos and a lower midline abdominalmass as a result of an enlarged uterus. Clitoral enlargementwith fusion of the labial-scrotal folds (labia majora) suggests adrenogenital syndrome or exposure to masculinizingmaternal hormones. Examination of the extremities should involve assessment of length, symmetry, and presence of hemihypertrophy, atrophy, polydactyly, syndactyly, simian creases, absent fingers, overlapping fingers, rocker-bottom feet, clubfoot, congenital bands, fractures, and amputations. The spine should be examined for evidence of sacral hair tufts, a dermal sinus tract above the gluteal folds, congenital scoliosis (a result of hemivertebra), and soft tissue masses such as lipomas or meningomyeloceles."
