During the game, he was about to kick the ball when another player collided with his leg from the front. He was unable to stand up after this collision and reported severe knee pain. On presentation, he was found to have a mild knee effusion.

The patient was involved in a collision during a soccer game, which suggests a high-energy trauma. He was unable to stand up after the collision and reported severe knee pain. The physical exam showed a mild knee effusion and a positive posterior drawer test (ability to push the knee posteriorly but not anteriorly). This suggests a posteriorly directed force on the knee joint. The posterior drawer test is typically positive in cases of posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries. Given the mechanism of injury and the physical exam findings, the most likely injured anatomic structure is the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). Now, let's review the options to determine which one matches the characteristics of the PCL. The PCL runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle, making option D the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

            "content": "Although this injury is most common in baseball players who throw frequently (pitcher, catcher, third base, and shortstop), it also occurs in football quarterbacks and tennis players. Patients will usually complain of pain over the medial elbow with throwing that may last for a few days afterward. There may be associated swelling and lateral or posterior elbow pain. Radiation of pain may be secondary to ulnar neuropathy. There is often a flexion contracture of the elbow when compared to the opposite side. Palpation of the medial epicondyle, radial head, capitellum, lateral epicondyle, and olecranon process often reveals tenderness. Ulnar (medial) collateral ligament stability should be assessed. Radiographs should include the contralateral elbow for comparison. Radiographic findings in Little Leaguer\u2019s elbow can vary and may include normal anatomy, medial humeral epicondyle apophyseal avulsion fracture, osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum, radial head abnormalities, and"

            "content": "Because this injury occurred many years ago and the patient has been asymptomatic, it is unlikely that the patient will come to any harm and was discharged. A medical student was asked to inspect the abdomen of two patients. On the first patient he noted irregular veins radiating from the umbilicus. On the second patient he noted irregular veins, coursing in a caudal to cranial direction, over the anterior abdominal wall from the groin to the chest. He was asked to explain his findings and determine the significance of these features."

            "content": "The diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasound scan. The patient was seated on a stool and her right shoulder was uncovered. The patient\u2019s hand was placed over her right buttock, a position that acts to externally rotate and extend the shoulder, exposing the supraspinatus tendon for ultrasound scan examination. The ultrasound revealed a completely torn tendon with fluid in the subacromial subdeltoid bursa (eFig. 7.128). The patient underwent a surgical repair and made a good recovery. A 35-year-old baseball pitcher came to the clinic with a history of a recurrent dislocation of the shoulder (eFig. 7.129). An MRI scan was performed to assess the shoulder joint prior to any treatment. The MRI demonstrates the anatomical structures in multiple planes, allowing the physician to obtain an overview of the shoulder and to assess any intraarticular or extraarticular structures that may have been damaged and require surgical repair."

On examination there was absence of dorsiflexion, a sensory disturbance over the lateral aspect of the leg and foot, and obvious wasting of the fibular muscles. As the patient walked, the foot was dragged between steps. A clinical diagnosis of footdrop was made and a common fibular nerve injury was diagnosed. The injury occurred at the time of surgery."
