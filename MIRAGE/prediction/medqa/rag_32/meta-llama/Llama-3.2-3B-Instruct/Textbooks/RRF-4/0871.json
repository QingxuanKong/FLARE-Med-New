He has been evaluated by several practitioners, who have all prescribed antimicrobial therapy, including ciprofloxacin, with no improvement and leading to emotional distress and sleep disturbances. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for a mildly tender prostate, without masses or nodules. There are no testicular masses, hernias, or hemorrhoids.

The patient has been evaluated by several practitioners, who have all prescribed antimicrobial therapy, including ciprofloxacin, with no improvement. This suggests that the patient may not have a typical bacterial infection. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for a mildly tender prostate, without masses or nodules. The absence of testicular masses, hernias, or hemorrhoids helps to rule out other possible causes of pelvic pain. The patient's symptoms of pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms, and painful ejaculation are common in chronic prostatitis. The positive expressed prostatic secretion culture with no bacterial growth in mid-stream urine culture suggests that the patient may have chronic bacterial prostatitis. The lack of response to antimicrobial therapy and the presence of chronic symptoms also support this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms of constipation, diarrhea, and fatigability may be related to chronic pelvic pain syndrome, which is a common comorbidity with chronic prostatitis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Bacterial prostatitis is usually caused by E. coli or another gram-negative rod, with one of two presentations. Acute bacterial prostatitis presents with fever and chills; prostate examination should be gentle or not performed at all, as massage may result in a wave of bacteremia. Chronic bacterial prostatitis presents as recurrent episodes of bacterial cystitis; prostate examination with massage demonstrates prostatic bacteria and leukocytes. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) can obstruct urine flow, with consequent symptoms of weak stream, hesitancy, and dribbling. If a bacterial infection develops behind the obstructing prostate, dysuria and other symptoms of cystitis will occur. Men whose symptoms are consistent with bacterial cystitis should be evaluated with urinalysis and urine"

The clinical presentation is usually that of a patient who undergoes a screening urine culture for a reason unrelated to the genitourinary tract and is incidentally found to have bacteriuria. The presence of systemic signs or symptoms such as fever, altered mental status, and leukocytosis in the setting of a positive urine culture does not merit a diagnosis of symptomatic UTI unless other potential etiologies have been considered. The typical symptoms of cystitis are dysuria, urinary frequency, and urgency. Nocturia, hesitancy, suprapubic discomfort, and gross hematuria are often noted as well. Unilateral back or flank pain is generally an indication that the upper urinary tract is involved. Fever also is an indication of invasive infection of either the kidney or the prostate."

Chronic bacterial prostatitis usually is associated with recurrent urinary tract infections bracketed by asymptomatic periods. Presenting manifestations include low back pain, dysuria, and perineal and suprapubic discomfort. Both acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis is treated with antibiotics. Chronic pelvic pain syndrome is characterized by chronic pain localized to the perineum, suprapubic area, and penis. Pain during or after ejaculation is a prominent finding. The etiology is uncertain, and it is a diagnosis of exclusion; indeed, it is not even clear if the pain is related to an abnormality of the prostate.

On physical examination, a large fluctuant area is usually readily visible. Routine laboratory evaluation shows an elevated white blood cell count. Diagnostic procedures are rarely necessary unless evaluating a recurrent abscess. A CT scan or MRI has an accuracy of 80% in determining incomplete drainage. If there is a concern about the presence of inflammatory bowel disease, a rigid or flexible sigmoidoscopic examination may be done at the time of drainage to evaluate for inflammation within the rectosigmoid region.

Symptoms include pain and swelling of the epi-didymis and testis. Some men may report nausea or vomiting, which arises as a result of irritation of the spermatic cord. Uri-nary symptoms may be present, but absence of symptoms does not rule out bacterial epididymo-orchitis. Physical exam gen-erally reveals a tender, swollen epididymis and testis. Scrotal skin erythema or reactive hydrocele may be present as well. A complete blood count should be performed to rule out leukocy-tosis, and urinalysis with urine culture should be collected prior to initiation of antibiotics. Urethral swab should be performed if sexually transmitted infection is a possible etiology. The clini-cal presentation of testicular torsion can be quite similar to that of Brunicardi_Ch40_p1759-p1782.indd 176101/03/19 6:34 PM 1762SPECIFIC"

            "content": "Among women presenting with dysuria, the probability of bacterial cystitis is \u223c50%. This figure rises to >90% if four criteria are fulfilled: dysuria and frequency without vaginal discharge or irritation. Present standards suggest that women meeting these four criteria, if they are otherwise healthy, are not pregnant, and have an apparently normal urinary tract, can be diagnosed with uncomplicated bacterial cystitis and treated empirically with appropriate antibiotics. Other women with dysuria should be further evaluated by urine dipstick, urine culture, and a pelvic examination. Dysuria is less common among men. The syndromes presenting as dysuria are similar to those in women but with some important distinctions."

Urinalysis with microscopy assists with diagnosis by confirming the presence of pyuria, hematuria, and bacteriuria. Office dipstick may be helpful, as the presence of nitrites reflects bacterial colonization and the presence of leukocyte esterase reflects pyuria. Risk factors for the development of uncompli-cated cystitis include female gender, sexual activity, and use of spermicides.1 Three days of antibiotics are generally sufficient for treatment of uncomplicated cystitis. Fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are well tolerated and are eas-ily available. Nitrofurantoin, which is also commonly used for uncomplicated cystitis, requires 5 days of treatment. Men with uncomplicated cystitis should undergo 7 days of treatment.Complicated cystitis may arise in the setting of structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities, recent urinary tract"

These symptoms frequently are accompanied by urinary urgency, frequency, and nocturia, all indicative of bladder irritation. Clinical manifestations of prostatic hyperplasia occur in only about 10% of men with pathologic evidence of BPH. The presence of residual urine in the bladder due to chronic obstruction increases the risk for urinary tract infections. In some affected men, BPH leads to complete urinary obstruction, with resultant painful distention of the bladder and, in the absence of appropriate treatment, hydronephrosis (Chapter 14). Initial treatment is pharmacologic, using targeted therapeutic agents that inhibit the formation of DHT from testosterone (such as 5-alpha reductase inhibitors) or that relax prostatic smooth muscle by blocking \u03b11-adrenergic receptors. Various surgical techniques are reserved for severely symptomatic cases that are recalcitrant to medical therapy."

It is estimated that 50\u201370% of cases of acute epididymitis are caused by C. trachomatis. The condition usually presents as unilateral scrotal pain with tenderness, swelling, and fever in a young man, often occurring in association with chlamydial urethritis. The illness may be mild enough to treat with oral antibiotics on an outpatient basis or severe enough to require hospitalization and parenteral therapy. Testicular torsion should be excluded promptly by radionuclide scan, Doppler flow study, or surgical exploration in a teenager or young adult who presents with acute unilateral testicular pain without urethritis. The possibility of testicular tumor or chronic infection (e.g., tuberculosis)"
