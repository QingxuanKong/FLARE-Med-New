The patient presents with a 2-month history of small amounts of blood in his stools, pale conjunctivae, low hemoglobin concentration, and a 2.3-cm polypoid mass in the ascending colon. The photomicrograph of a biopsy specimen of the lesion is not provided, but the options suggest a relationship between the colon polyp and the pathogenesis of the patient's condition. We need to consider the characteristics of the colon polyp and the options provided to determine the most likely process involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition.\\n\\nThe options provided are related to the Wnt/\\u00f0-catenin signaling pathway, which is involved in the development and progression of colorectal cancer. The options can be analyzed as follows:\\n\\nA. Underexpression of COX-2: COX-2 is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins, which can promote tumor growth and angiogenesis. However, its underexpression is not typically associated with the development of colorectal polyps.\\n\\nB. Increased phosphorylation of serine and threonine: This option refers to the activation of the Wnt/\\u00f0-catenin signaling pathway, which is a key regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. Increased phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues on \\u00f0-catenin can lead to its nuclear translocation and activation of transcription of target genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. This process is often dysregulated in colorectal cancer.\\n\\nC. Impaired degradation of \\u00f0-catenin: Impaired degradation of \\u00f0-catenin can lead to its accumulation and activation of transcription of target genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. This process is also involved in the development of colorectal cancer.\\n\\nD. Abnormal transfer of phosphate to cellular proteins: This option is not directly related to the Wnt/\\u00f0-catenin signaling pathway and is not a characteristic of colorectal polyps.\\n\\nBased on the analysis of the options, the most likely process involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition is the impaired degradation of \\u00f0-catenin (option C). This process is a key regulator of the Wnt/\\u00f0-catenin signaling pathway, which is often dysregulated in colorectal cancer. The patient's colon polypoid mass and the characteristics of the biopsy specimen suggest that the patient has a colorectal adenoma, which is a precursor to colorectal cancer.\\n\\nThe final answer is C.

Either sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy may be used for cancer screening in asymptomatic average-risk individuals. The use of sigmoidoscopy was based on the historical finding that the majority of colorectal cancers occurred in the rectum and left colon and that patients with right-sided colon cancers had left-sided polyps. Over the past several decades, however, the distribution of colon cancers has changed in the United States, with proportionally fewer rectal and left-sided cancers than in the past.

Because stool is relatively liquid as it passes through the ileocecal valve into the right colon, cancers arising in the cecum and ascending colon may become quite large without resulting in any obstructive symptoms or noticeable alterations in bowel habits. Lesions of the right colon commonly ulcerate, leading to chronic, insidious blood loss without a change in the appearance of the stool.

Because of the caliber of the bowel and the consistency of the stool, left-sided tumors are more likely to cause obstruction than are right-sided tumors. Rectal tumors may cause bleeding, tenesmus, and pain. How-ever, it is important to note that many patients may be asymp-tomatic and/or present with unexplained anemia, weight loss, or poor appetite.Staging.

In patients with persistent diarrhea not responding to simple antidiarrheal agents, a sigmoid colon biopsy should be performed to rule out microscopic colitis. In those age >40 years, an air-contrast barium enema or colonoscopy should also be performed. If the main symptoms are diarrhea and increased gas, the possibility of lactase deficiency should be ruled out with a hydrogen breath test or with evaluation after a 3-week lactose-free diet. Some patients with IBS-D may have undiagnosed celiac sprue. Because the symptoms of celiac sprue respond to a gluten-free diet, testing for celiac sprue in IBS may prevent years of morbidity and attendant expense. Decision-analysis studies show that serology testing for celiac sprue in patients with IBS-D has an acceptable cost when the prevalence of celiac sprue is >1% and is the dominant"

Thus, a colorectal neoplasm will not be found in most asymptomatic individuals with occult blood in their stool. Nonetheless, persons found to have fecal occult blood-positive stool routinely undergo further medical evaluation, including sigmoidoscopy and/or colonoscopy\u2014procedures that are not only uncomfortable and expensive but also associated with a small risk for significant complications. The added cost of these studies would appear justifiable if the small number of patients found to have occult neoplasms because of fecal occult blood screening could be shown to have an improved prognosis and prolonged survival. Prospectively controlled trials have shown a statistically significant reduction in mortality rate from colorectal cancer for individuals undergoing annual stool guaiac screening. However, this benefit only emerged after >13 years of follow-up and was extremely expensive to achieve, because all positive tests"

The patient had noted 2 days of abdominal pain and fever, and his clinical evaluation and CT scan were consistent with appendicitis. His clinical find-ings resolved after laparoscopic appendectomy. The patient immigrated to the USA 10 years ago from a rural area of Peru where his family trades in sheepskins. His father and sister have undergone resection of abdominal masses, but details of their diagnoses are unavailable. What is your differential diagnosis? What are your diagnostic and therapeutic plans?"

The patient reported prior episodes of a similar nature following ingestion of a significant amount of dairy products. This clinical picture is most probably due to a deficiency in the activity of: A. isomaltase. B. lactase. C. pancreatic \u03b1-amylase. D. salivary \u03b1-amylase. E. sucrase. Correct answer = B. The physical symptoms suggest a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for carbohydrate degradation. The symptoms observed following the ingestion of dairy products suggest that the patient is deficient in lactase as a result of the age-dependent reduction in expression of the enzyme."
