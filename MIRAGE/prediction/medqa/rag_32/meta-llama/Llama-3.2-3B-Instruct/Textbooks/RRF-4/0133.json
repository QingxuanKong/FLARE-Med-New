He states that for the past month he has been unable to engage in sexual intercourse with his wife despite having appropriate sexual desire. He also endorses deep and burning buttock and hip pain when walking, which is relieved by rest. The patient states that he does not have erections at night or in the morning. His past medical history is notable for diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hypertension, and he has a 40 pack-year smoking history. Physical exam is notable for weak lower extremity and femoral pulses. Which of the following is the most specific etiology of this patient\u2019s symptoms?",

The patient's history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hypertension increases the likelihood of vascular disease. The physical exam finding of weak lower extremity and femoral pulses further supports this diagnosis. The most specific etiology of this patient's symptoms is aortoiliac atherosclerosis, which is a type of peripheral artery disease (PAD) that affects the aorta and iliac arteries.

For this reason, a primary care provider is often ideally suited to initiate the evaluation. However, a significant percentage of men experience ED and remain undiagnosed unless specifically questioned about this issue. By far the two most common reasons for underreporting of ED are patient embarrassment and perceptions of physicians\u2019 inattention to the disease.

This patient had no long-standing neurological deficit. A 65-year-old man was examined by a surgical intern because he had a history of buttock pain and impotence. On examination he had a reduced peripheral pulse on the left foot compared to the right. On direct questioning, the patient revealed that he experienced severe left-sided buttock pain after walking 100 yards. After a short period of rest, he could walk another 100 yards before the same symptoms recurred. He also noticed that over the past year he was unable to obtain an erection. He smoked heavily and was on no other drugs or treatment."

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

The history should note whether the patient has experienced pelvic trauma, surgery, or radiation. In light of the increasing recognition of the relationship between lower urinary tract symptoms and ED, it is advisable to evaluate for the presence of symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction. Questions should focus on the onset of symptoms, the presence and duration of partial erections, and the progression of ED. A history of nocturnal or early morning erections is useful for distinguishing physiologic ED from psychogenic ED. Nocturnal erections occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and require intact neurologic and circulatory systems. Organic causes of ED generally are characterized by a gradual and persistent change in rigidity or the inability to sustain nocturnal, coital, or self-stimulated erections.

Therefore, ED in an otherwise asymptomatic male warrants consideration of other vascular disorders, including CAD. The physical examination is an essential element in the assessment of ED. Signs of hypertension as well as evidence of thyroid, hepatic, hematologic, cardiovascular, or renal diseases should be sought. An assessment should be made of the endocrine and vascular systems, the external genitalia, and the prostate gland. The penis should be palpated carefully along the corpora to detect fibrotic plaques. Reduced testicular size and loss of secondary sexual characteristics are suggestive of hypogonadism. Neurologic examination should include assessment of anal sphincter tone, investigation of the bulbocavernosus reflex, and testing for peripheral neuropathy."

He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

Following a sleepless night with significant dyspnea, the patient develops nausea and vomiting and collapses. He presents to the emergency department in cardiac arrest and is unable to be resuscitated. His autopsy shows a posterior wall myocardial infarction and a fresh thrombus in an atherosclerotic right coronary artery. What went wrong? The clinician had decided, based on the patient\u2019s appearance, even before starting the history, that the patient\u2019s complaints were not serious. Therefore, he felt confident that he could perform an abbreviated and focused examination by using the URI assessment protocol rather than considering the broader range of possibilities and performing appropriate tests to confirm or refute his initial hypotheses. In particular, by concentrating on the URI, the clinician failed to elicit the full dyspnea history, which would have"

A 50-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with severe lower back pain that had started several days ago. In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

The most difficult aspect of the differential diagnosis of erec- tile disorder is ruling out erectile problems that are fully explained by medical factors. Such cases would not receive a diagnosis of a mental disorder. The distinction between erectile disorder as a mental disorder and erectile dysfunction as the result of another medical con- dition is usually unclear, and many cases will have complex, interactive biological and psy- chiatric etiologies. If the individual is older than 40\u201450 years and/ or has concomitant medical problems, the differential diagnosis should include medical etiologies, especially vascular disease. The presence of an organic disease known to cause erectile problems does not confirm a causal relationship. For example, a man with diabetes mellitus can develop erectile disorder in response to psychological stress. In general, erectile dysfunction due to organic factors is generalized and gradual in onset. An exception would be"
