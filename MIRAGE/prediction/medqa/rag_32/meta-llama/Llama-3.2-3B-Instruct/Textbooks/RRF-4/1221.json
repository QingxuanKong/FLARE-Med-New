She complains of intense bilateral flank pain and a recent decrease in urination. Urine microscopy demonstrates abundant square crystals of calcium oxalate that look like 'folded envelopes.'\\n\\nThe description of the urine crystals as 'folded envelopes' is a classic description of calcium oxalate crystals, which are often seen in ethylene glycol poisoning. Ethylene glycol is a common ingredient in antifreeze and can cause severe metabolic acidosis, renal failure, and other systemic effects when ingested.\\n\\nGiven this information, let's review the potential answers:\\n\\nA. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: This is a common finding in ethylene glycol poisoning due to the accumulation of organic acids such as glycolic acid and oxalic acid.\\n\\nB. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: This type of acidosis is not typically associated with ethylene glycol poisoning.\\n\\nC. Respiratory acidosis: This type of acidosis is not directly related to ethylene glycol poisoning.\\n\\nD. Respiratory alkalosis: This type of acid-base disturbance is also not directly related to ethylene glycol poisoning.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely finding in this patient is anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is a hallmark of ethylene glycol poisoning.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Circulating oxalate can also complex with plasma calcium, reducing the ionized calcium as in this case. Although ethylene glycol intoxication should be verified by measuring ethylene glycol levels, therapy must be initiated immediately in this life-threatening situation. Although therapy can be initiated with confidence in cases with known or witnessed ingestions, such histories are rarely available. Therapy should thus be initiated in patients with severe metabolic acidosis and elevated anion and osmolar gaps. Other diagnostic features, such as hypocalcemia or acute renal failure with crystalluria, can provide important confirmation for urgent, empiric therapy."

A urine dipstick was positive for blood (hematuria). A diagnosis of a ureteric stone (calculus) was made. The patient\u2019s initial infrascapular pain, which later radiated to the left groin, relates to passage of the ureteric stone along the ureter. The origin of the pain relates to ureteral distention. A series of peristaltic waves along the ureter transport urine along the length of the ureter from the kidney to the bladder. As the ureteric stone obstructs the kidney, the ureter becomes distended, resulting in an exacerbation of the pain. The peristaltic waves are superimposed upon the distention, resulting in periods of exacerbation and periods of relief."

Because of differences in insensible fluid losses and fluid intake from food sources, the required total fluid intake will vary from person to person. Rather than specify how much to drink, it is more helpful to educate patients about how much more they need to drink in light of their 24-h urine volume. For example, if the daily urine volume is 1.5 L, then the patient should be advised to drink at least 0.5 L more per day in order to increase the urine volume to the goal of 2 L/day.

Primary hyperoxaluria is an autosomal recessive disorder that causes excessive endogenous oxalate generation by the liver, with consequent calcium oxalate stone formation and crystal deposition in organs. Intraparenchymal calcium oxalate deposition in the kidney can eventually lead to renal failure. Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive disorder that causes abnormal reabsorption of filtered dibasic amino acids. The excessive urinary excretion of cystine, which is poorly soluble, leads to cystine stone formation. Cystine stones are visible on plain radiographs and often manifest as staghorn calculi or multiple bilateral stones. Repeat episodes of obstruction and instrumentation can cause chronic renal impairment. APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:"

            "content": "1.2. A 50-year-old man presented with painful blisters on the backs of his hands. He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."

            "content": "The presentation of perinephric and renal abscesses is quite nonspecific. Flank pain and abdominal pain are common. At least 50% of patients are febrile. Pain may be referred to the groin or leg, particularly with extension of infection. The diagnosis of perinephric abscess, like that of splenic abscess, is frequently delayed, and the mortality rate in some series is appreciable, although lower than in the past. Perinephric or renal abscess should be most seriously considered when a patient presents with symptoms and signs of pyelonephritis and remains febrile after 4 or 5 days of treatment. Moreover, when a urine culture yields a polymicrobial flora, when a patient is known to have renal stones, or when fever and pyuria coexist with a sterile urine culture, these diagnoses should be entertained."

            "content": "Acute obstruction of urine flow is the cause of renal colic, a severe sharp intermittent pain in the flank or lower abdomen often radiating to the groin. Vomiting, distress, and inability to relieve pain with position changes are characteristic. In younger children, classic symptoms may not be apparent; fussiness and vomiting may be the only symptoms. Hematuria may be gross or microscopic and typically clears rapidly with passage of gravel or stone material."
