    "question": "A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with severe dyspnea and a productive cough containing streaks of blood since the day before. He had a sudden pruritic papular rash on his right thigh when he was in the southwestern USA hiking in northern Arizona and New Mexico. The next day he developed severely painful inguinal swelling on the same side; however, he did not see a physician and controlled the pain with painkillers. There is no other history of serious illness. He does not take any other medications. He appears confused. The temperature is 39.5\u2103 (103.1\u2109), the pulse is 105/min, the respiration rate is 32/min, and the blood pressure is 95/45 mm Hg. Rales are heard in the lower lobe of the left lung on auscultation. The right inguinal lymph nodes are enlarged with a spongy consistency and an underlying hard core.

The patient has severe dyspnea, productive cough containing streaks of blood, fever, confusion, and a pruritic papular rash on the right thigh.

The patient appears confused, has rales in the lower lobe of the left lung, and the right inguinal lymph nodes are enlarged with a spongy consistency and an underlying hard core. The surrounding area is edematous without overlying erythema or cellulitis. The CT scan findings are not explicitly described, but the combination of symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a severe bacterial infection. The patient's travel history to the southwestern USA hiking in northern Arizona and New Mexico is also a crucial clue. Among the options provided, plague is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's exposure to the southwestern USA and the symptoms of severe bacterial infection, including fever, confusion, and the characteristic \"bubonic\" swelling of the inguinal lymph nodes (buboes).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

A chest radiograph demonstrated translucent notches along the inferior border of ribs III to VI (eFig. 3.119). He was referred to a cardiologist and a diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta was made. The rib notching was caused by dilated collateral intercostal arteries. Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. This narrowing can markedly reduce blood flow to the lower body. Many of the vessels above the narrowing therefore enlarge due to the increased pressure so that blood can reach the aorta below the level of the narrowing. Commonly, the internal thoracic, superior epigastric, and musculophrenic arteries enlarge anteriorly. These arteries supply the anterior intercostal arteries, which anastomose with the posterior intercostal arteries that allow blood to flow retrogradely into the aorta. Enlargement of the intertcostal vessels results in notching of the ribs."

Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

            "content": "PE should undergo initial diagnostic evaluation with d-dimer testing alone (see \u201cBlood Tests\u201d) without obligatory imaging tests (Fig. 300-3). However, patients with a high clinical likelihood of VTE should skip d-dimer testing and undergo imaging as the next step in the diagnostic algorithm. Clinical Pearls Not all leg pain is due to DVT, and not all dyspnea is due to PE (Table 300-2). Sudden, severe calf discomfort suggests a ruptured Baker\u2019s cyst. Fever and chills usually herald cellulitis rather than DVT. Physical findings, if present, may consist only of mild palpation discomfort in the lower calf. However, massive DVT often presents with marked thigh swelling, tenderness, and erythema. If the leg is diffusely edematous, DVT is unlikely. More probable is an acute exacerbation of venous insufficiency due to postthrombotic syndrome. Upper extremity venous thrombosis may present with asymmetry in the supraclavicular fossa or in the circumference of the upper arms."

He is then switched to celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily, and on this regimen his joint symptoms and heartburn resolve. Two years later, he returns with increased joint symptoms. His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor. With the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, he is started on a regimen"

A 33-year-old man was playing cricket for his local Sunday team. As the new bowler pitched the ball short, it bounced higher than he anticipated and hit him on the side of his head. He immediately fell to the ground unconscious, but after about 30 seconds he was helped to his feet and felt otherwise well. It was noted he had some bruising around his temple. He decided not to continue playing and went to watch the match from the side. Over the next hour he became extremely sleepy and was eventually unrousable. He was rushed to hospital. When he was admitted to hospital, the patient\u2019s breathing was shallow and irregular and it was necessary to intubate him. A skull radiograph demonstrated a fracture in the region of the pterion. No other abnormality was demonstrated other than minor soft tissue bruising over the left temporal fossa. A CT scan was performed."

A 35-year-old man had a soft mass approximately 3 cm in diameter in the right scrotum. The diagnosis was a right indirect inguinal hernia. What were the examination findings? The mass was not tender and the physician was not able to \u201cget above it.\u201d The testes were felt separate from the mass, and a transillumination test (in which a bright light is placed behind the scrotum and the scrotal sac is viewed from the front) was negative. (A positive test occurs when the light penetrates through the scrotum.) When the patient stood up, a positive cough \u201cimpulse\u201d was felt within the mass. After careful and delicate maneuvering, the mass could be massaged into the inguinal canal, so emptying from the scrotum. When the massaging hand was removed, the mass recurred in the scrotum."

He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

Unfortunately, a complication of a vertical incision in the midclavicular line is division of the segmental nerve supply to the rectus abdominis muscle. This produces muscle atrophy and asymmetrical proportions of the anterior abdominal wall. A 45-year-old man had mild epigastric pain, and a diagnosis of esophageal reflux was made. He was given appropriate medication, which worked well. However, at the time of the initial consultation, the family practitioner requested a chest radiograph, which demonstrated a prominent hump on the left side of the diaphragm and old rib fractures. The patient was recalled for further questioning."

            "content": "In this patient, compression of the left external iliac veins by the gravid uterus was the likely cause of stasis, which led to the deep vein thrombosis. The chest pain was due to pulmonary emboli. Small emboli were thrown off from the leading edge of the thrombus through the heart to lodge in the lungs. Small emboli cause typical pleuritic chest pain, which is exacerbated by breathing. In isolation these small pulmonary emboli may affect respiratory function, but they may be the precursor to a large and potentially fatal pulmonary embolus (eFig. 6.143). Anticoagulation was instituted and the patient had an uneventful delivery. A 45-year-old man had recently taken up squash. During a game he attempted a forehand shot and noticed severe sudden pain in his heel. He thought his opponent had hit him with his racket. When he turned, though, he realized his opponent was too far away to have hit him."
