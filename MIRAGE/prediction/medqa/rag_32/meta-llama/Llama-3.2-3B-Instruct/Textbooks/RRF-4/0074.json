    "question": "A 21-year-old man comes to the physician because of pruritus and a hypopigmented rash on his upper body for 5 days. He first noticed the symptoms after returning from a business trip last week in the Bahamas. While he was there, he visited a couple of beaches and went hiking with some coworkers. The rash initially started as a single lesion on his upper back but since then has extended to his shoulders. He has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus controlled with an insulin pump. He works as an office manager and has no known exposure to melanocytotoxic chemicals. He has been sexually active with three female partners over the past year and uses condoms inconsistently. He is 183 cm (6 ft) tall and weighs 80 kg (176 lb); BMI is 23.9 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. A photograph of the rash is shown. One month ago, his hemoglobin A1C was 7.8%. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and history. The patient presents with pruritus (itching) and a hypopigmented rash on his upper body, which started after returning from a business trip to the Bahamas. The rash initially began as a single lesion on his upper back but has since extended to his shoulders. The patient has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, which is controlled with an insulin pump. He has no known exposure to melanocytotoxic chemicals, and his sexual history is inconsistent. Given these details, we should consider dermatological conditions that can cause hypopigmentation and are associated with travel or other potential exposures. One possibility is cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), caused by hookworm larvae. CLM typically presents with a linear, serpiginous, itchy rash that can appear after exposure to contaminated soil or sand, often after travel to endemic areas. The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with CLM, and a skin biopsy is often used to confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating the presence of hookworm larvae in the skin. Therefore, the most appropriate choice to confirm the diagnosis is a skin biopsy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Focused History: This was IR\u2019s first occurrence of severe joint pain. In the ED, he was given an anti-inflammatory medication. Fluid aspirated from the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb was negative for organisms but positive for needle-shaped monosodium urate (MSU) crystals (see image at right). The inflammatory symptoms have since resolved. IR reports he is in good health otherwise, with no significant past medical history. His body mass index (BMI) is 31. No tophi (deposits of MSU crystals under the skin) were detected in the physical examination."

            "content": "During a routine check and on two follow-up visits, a 45-year-old man was found to have high blood pressure (160\u2013165/95\u2013100 mm Hg). His physician initially prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic commonly used to treat hyper-tension. His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic. Because the patient had elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, hydrochlorothiazide was replaced with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril lowered his blood pressure to almost normotensive levels. However, after several weeks on enalapril, the patient returned complaining of a persistent cough. In addition, some signs of angioedema were detected. How does enalapril lower blood pressure? Why does it occasionally cause coughing and angioedema? What other drugs could be used to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and decrease blood pressure,"

Case 4: Hypoglycemia, Hyperketonemia, and Liver Dysfunction Patient Presentation: AK, a 59-year-old male with slurred speech, ataxia (loss of skeletal muscle coordination), and abdominal pain, was dropped off at the Emergency Department (ED). Focused History: AK is known to the ED staff from previous visits. He has a 6year history of chronic, excessive alcohol consumption. He is not known to take illicit drugs. At this ED visit, AK reports that he has been drinking heavily in the past day or so. He cannot recall having eaten anything in that time. There is evidence of recent vomiting, but no blood is apparent."

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

            "content": "Pertinent Findings: Results on a 24-hour urine specimen and blood tests requested in advance of this visit reveal that IR is not an undersecretor of uric acid. His blood urate was 8.5 mg/dl (reference = 2.5\u20138.0). The unusually young age of presentation is suggestive of an enzymopathy of purine metabolism, and additional blood tests are ordered. Diagnosis: IR has gout (MSU crystal deposition disease), a type of inflammatory arthritis. Treatment: IR was given prescriptions for allopurinol and colchicine. The treatment goals are to reduce his blood urate levels to <6.0 mg/dl and prevent additional attacks. He was advised to lose weight because being overweight or obese is a risk factor for gout. His BMI of 31 puts him in the obese category. He was also given written information on the association between diet and gout. Prognosis: Gout increases the risk of developing renal stones. It is also associated with hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease."
