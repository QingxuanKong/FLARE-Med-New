    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which anatomical structure prevents normal ascension of the kidney during embryological development, we need to consider the normal path of kidney development and the structures that may interfere with it. The kidneys develop from the intermediate mesoderm and ascend from the pelvis to their final position in the upper abdomen. The inferior mesenteric artery is a key structure that can interfere with kidney development. It arises from the aorta and passes under the kidneys as they ascend, potentially causing them to become fused or abnormal in position. The other options, such as the superior mesenteric artery, celiac artery, and splenic artery, do not have the same level of interaction with the kidneys during their ascent. Therefore, the inferior mesenteric artery is the most likely structure to prevent normal ascension of the kidney and cause fusion of the poles.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

            "content": "A pelvic kidney can be explained by the embryology. The kidneys develop from a complex series of structures that originate adjacent to the bladder within the fetal pelvis. As development proceeds and the functions of the various parts of the developing kidneys change, they attain a superior position in the upper abdomen adjacent to the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava, on the posterior abdominal wall. A developmental arrest or complication may prevent the kidney from obtaining its usual position. Fortunately, it is unusual for patients to have any symptoms relating to a pelvic kidney. This patient had no symptoms attributable to the pelvic kidney and she was discharged."

            "content": "Forms of Gonadal Failure Turner Syndrome The diagnosis of Turner syndrome requires the presence of characteristic features in phenotypic females coupled with complete or partial absence of the second sex chromosome, with or without cell line mosaicism. Most affected individuals have a 45,X karyotype, while others have mosaic karyotypes (i.e., 45,X/46,XX; 45,X/46,XY). Intrauterine growth restriction is common in infants with a 45,X karyotype. After birth, these patients generally grow slowly, beginning in the second or third year of life. They typically have many of the associated stigmata, including lymphedema and sometimes large cystic hygromas of the neck at birth; a webbed neck; multiple pigmented nevi; disorders of the heart, kidneys (most commonly horseshoe), and great vessels (most commonly coarctation of the aorta); and small hyperconvex fingernails (35) (Fig. 29.10). Diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders, essential hypertension, and other autoimmune disorders are often present"

            "content": "Diagnosis Ultrasonography, CT, and MRI all can be used for diagnosis. Ultrasonography reveals large, echogenic kidneys with poor corticomedullary differentiation. The diagnosis can be made in utero after 24 weeks of gestation in severe cases. Macrocysts generally are not common at birth in ARPKD patients. The absence of renal cysts in either parent, particularly if they are more than 40 years of age on ultrasonography, helps distinguish ARPKD from ADPKD in older patients. Clinical, laboratory, or radiographic evidence of hepatic fibrosis, hepatic pathology demonstrating characteristic ductal plate abnormalities, family history of affected siblings, or parental consanguinity suggestive of autosomal recessive inheritance is helpful. The lack of mutational hotspots and the large and complex genomic structure of PKHD1 make molecular diagnosis difficult; however, presymptomatic screening of other at-risk members in a family with already identified ARPKD mutations is straightforward and"

            "content": "Table 5.6 Development of Genital and Urinary Tracts by Embryologic Age This process gives rise to three successive sets of increasingly advanced urinary structures, each developing more caudal to its predecessor. The pronephros, or \u201cfirst kidney,\u201d is rudimentary and nonfunctional; it is succeeded by the \u201cmiddle kidney,\u201d or mesonephros, which is believed to function brie\ufb02y before regressing. Although the mesonephros is transitory as an excretory organ, its duct, the mesonephric (wolffian) duct,is of singular importance for the following reasons: 1. It grows caudally in the developing embryo to open, for the first time, an excretory channel into the primitive cloaca and the \u201coutside world.\u201d 2. It serves as the starting point for development of the metanephros, which becomes the definitive kidney. 3. It ultimately differentiates into the sexual duct system in the male. 4."
