The patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, and the symptoms started 1 week after the treatment. The pure tone audiometry shows a sensorineural hearing loss of 45 dB. The expected beneficial effect of the drug is most likely related to its mechanism of action. The options provided are: A. Inhibition of proteasome, B. Hyperstabilization of microtubules, C. Generation of free radicals, and D. Cross-linking of DNA. We need to consider the drugs commonly used in chemotherapy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and their mechanisms of action. Carmustine, a platinum-based drug, is commonly used in this context. It is known to cause ototoxicity, which is a dose-dependent effect. The ototoxicity of platinum-based drugs is thought to be related to the generation of free radicals. Therefore, the expected beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms is most likely due to the generation of free radicals.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Vinca alkaloids may sometimes be associated with jaw claudication, autonomic neuropathy, ileus, cranial nerve palsies, and, in severe cases, encephalopathy, seizures, and coma.

The common high-frequency sensorineural type of hearing loss in the aged (presbycusis) is probably a result of neuronal degeneration, that is, progressive loss of spiral ganglion neurons (Suga and Lindsay). Explosions or intense, sustained noise in certain industrial settings or from gun blasts or even rock music may result in a high-tone sensorineural hearing loss from cochlear damage. Certain antimicrobial drugs (namely, the aminoglycoside group and vancomycin) damage cochlear hair cells and, after prolonged use, can result in severe hearing loss. If these drugs have been used to treat bacterial meningitis, it may be difficult to determine whether the antibiotic or the infection is the cause. A variety of other commonly used drugs are ototoxic, including certain neurotoxic cancer chemotherapies, especially platinum containing drugs, usually in a dose-dependent fashion (see Nadol).

He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?"

Most cases are idiopathic or are secondary to viral infections of the endolymphatic space. The patient experiences vertigo together with sensorineural hearing loss, and symptoms may smolder over several weeks. Labyrinthitis associated with middle ear infection may be serous or suppurative. In the former case, bac-terial products and/or inflammatory mediators transudate into the inner ear via the round window membrane, establishing an inflammatory process therein. Total recovery is eventually pos-sible after the middle ear is adequately treated.Suppurative labyrinthitis, however, is a much more toxic condition in which the acute purulent bacterial infection extends into the inner ear and causes marked destruction of the sensory hair cells and neurons of the eighth-nerve ganglion. This con-dition may be a harbinger for meningitis and must be treated rapidly. The"

Intravesical treatments are advised for patients with diffuse CIS, recurrent disease, >40% involvement of the bladder surface by tumor, or T1 disease. The standard therapy, based on randomized comparisons, is Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) in six weekly instillations, often followed by maintenance administrations for \u22651 year. Other agents with activity include mitomycin C, interferon, and gemcitabine. The side effects of intravesical therapies include dysuria, urinary frequency, and, depending on the drug, myelosuppression or contact dermatitis. Rarely, intravesical BCG may produce a systemic illness associated with granulomatous infections in multiple sites requiring antituberculin therapy."

This toxic manifestation appears to be related to the total amount of drug administered, and it usually improves slowly after it has been discontinued. Biopsies of peripheral nerve have shown a primary axonal degeneration. Approximately one-third of patients receiving this drug also experience tinnitus or high-frequency hearing loss or both. Ototoxicity is also dose related, cumulative, and only occasionally reversible. Retrobulbar neuritis occurs rarely. Seizures associated with drug-induced hyponatremia and hypomagnesemia have been reported."
