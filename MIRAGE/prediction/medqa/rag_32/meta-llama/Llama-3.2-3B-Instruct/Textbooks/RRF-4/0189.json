She states that menses began at age of 13 and has been regular until two months ago. She denies sexual activity, and urine pregnancy test is negative. On exam, she appears well-nourished with a BMI of 21 kg/m^2, but you note that she has enlarged cheeks bilaterally and has calluses on the dorsum of her hands. She says that she has been very stressed with school and has recently been binge eating. What other finding do you expect to see in this patient?",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the symptoms and signs presented by the 17-year-old woman. She has not had her menstrual period for 4 months, but her BMI is within the normal range (21 kg/m^2), and she denies sexual activity. The presence of enlarged cheeks and calluses on the dorsum of her hands suggests binge eating behavior. Given these clues, we can consider the possibility of bulimia nervosa, a condition characterized by binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting, laxative abuse, or diuretic use to prevent weight gain. The absence of signs of pregnancy, menstrual irregularities, or other endocrine disorders makes this diagnosis more plausible. The correct answer can be deduced by eliminating options that are not directly related to the symptoms of bulimia nervosa. Malar rash (A) is more commonly associated with other conditions, such as acne or lupus. Increased blood glucose level (B) is not directly related to the symptoms presented. Erosion of tooth enamel (C) can be a consequence of frequent vomiting, which is a common behavior in individuals with bulimia nervosa. Elevated estrogen levels (D) are not expected in this patient, as she is not pregnant and does not have any signs of estrogen excess. Therefore, the expected finding in this patient is erosion of tooth enamel due to frequent vomiting.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Some of the patients were overweight in childhood, especially in the prepubertal period. Dieting is much talked about and may have been encouraged, especially by mothers who want their daughters to be more attractive. In epochs such as the current one, where dieting and female thinness are considered normative and desirable, the illness seems to be more common and lesser but transient forms of the disorder are rampant in high school-and college-age young women. Sometimes there appears to be a precipitating event, such as leaving home, disruption of family life, or other stress. Whatever the provocation, it leads to an obsessive refusal to eat. What is more important, the abnormal eating habits persist even when the patient has become painfully thin, and when counseled to eat normally she will use every artifice to starve herself.

Androgen levels should be assessed in any hirsute patient to ensure that adrenal and ovarian tumors are not present and to aid in the diagnosis of PCOS. 2. Acromegaly is suggested by coarse facial features, large doughy hands, and hyperhidrosis and may be confirmed by measuring IGF-1 levels. 3. In patients with truncal obesity, hirsutism, hypertension, and erythematous striae, Cushing syndrome should be ruled out by assessing 24-hour urinary cortisol levels or performing a 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test or late night salivary cortisol (126).

            "content": "For all women, the evaluation of excessive and abnormal menses includes a thorough medical and gynecologic history, the exclusion of pregnancy, the consideration of possible malignancy, and a careful gynecologic examination. For women of normal weight between the ages of approximately 20 and 35 years who do not have clear risk factors for STDs, who have no signs of androgen excess, who are not using exogenous hormones, and who have no other findings on examination, management may be based on a clinical diagnosis. Additional laboratory or imaging studies may be indicated if the diagnosis is not apparent on the basis of examination and history."

The patient had no significant adverse effects from this dosage. At age 21, she had a second tonic-clonic seizure while in college; further discussion with her room-mate at that time revealed a history of two recent episodes of 1\u20132 minutes of altered consciousness with lip smacking (focal impaired awareness seizure, formerly complex partial seizure). A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid. Four days later, electroencephalography (EEG)"

Pubertal delay is much more common in boys than in girls. It is important to remember that puberty may be delayed in any child suffering from any severe chronic disease, including celiac disease, Crohn disease, sickle cell anemia, and cystic fibrosis. Chronic illness should be reviewed during the history and physical examination. One possible approach to evaluation is depicted in Figure 29.8. Check T4, TSH"

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

During the year before presentation, her scholastic performance in school deteriorated, she gained 25 lb, she became increasingly lethargic, and nocturia and polydypsia were noted. Initial evaluation documented low follicle-stimulating hormone, elevated prolactin, and a bone age of 10.5 years. Computed tomography scanning documented a large hypothalamic neoplasm that proved to be an ectopic germinoma. The patient was also documented to be hypothyroid and hypoadrenal and to have diabetes insipidus. Despite the elevated prolactin, she had no galactorrhea because of the minimal breast development.
