    "question": "A 31-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia is brought to the emergency department by police after being found agitated and attempting to steal from a grocery store. His past medical history is only notable for a recent office note from his primary care doctor for treatment of seasonal allergies. His temperature is 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 173/97 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a man who is very irritable and restless. He is not cooperative with exam or history and becomes combative requiring intramuscular medications and security restraining him. After this event, the rest of his exam is notable for 7 mm pupils which are equal and reactive to light, spontaneous movement of all limbs, normal sensation, and warm and sweaty skin. The patient is answering questions and states he wants to kill himself. Which of the following substances was most likely used by this patient?",

    "predict": "To solve this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and behavior in the emergency department. Here's a step-by-step breakdown: 1. **Temperature**: 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C) - This is a high fever, indicating an infectious or inflammatory process. 2. **Blood pressure**: 173/97 mmHg - This is significantly elevated, indicating hypertension. 3. **Pulse**: 105/min - This is a rapid heart rate, indicating tachycardia. 4. **Respirations**: 16/min - This is a decreased respiratory rate, indicating bradypnea. 5. **Oxygen saturation**: 98% on room air - This is within normal limits, indicating adequate oxygenation. 6. **Physical exam**: * **Irritability and restlessness**: These are signs of agitation and aggression. * **7 mm pupils which are equal and reactive to light**: This is a normal pupillary response, indicating no significant neurological impairment. * **Spontaneous movement of all limbs**: This suggests that the patient's motor function is intact. * **Normal sensation**: This indicates no significant sensory impairment. * **Warm and sweaty skin**: This could be a sign of agitation or anxiety. 7. **Behavior**: * **Agitated and combative**: This indicates a high level of agitation and aggression. * **Not cooperative with exam or history**: This suggests that the patient is not in a receptive state for questioning. * **States he wants to kill himself**: This is a significant indicator of suicidal ideation. Considering these symptoms and behavior, we need to find a substance that can cause these effects. **Analysis of options**: A. **Alcohol**: While alcohol can cause agitation and hypertension, the patient's fever, tachycardia, and suicidal ideation are not typical effects of acute alcohol intoxication. B. **Cocaine**: Cocaine use can cause agitation, hypertension, tachycardia, and suicidal ideation due to its stimulant effects. These symptoms match the patient's presentation. C. **Diphenhydramine**: This is an antihistamine that can cause sedation, not agitation. D. **Haloperidol**: This is an antipsychotic medication that can cause agitation, but it would not typically cause hypertension or tachycardia. **Conclusion**: Based on the patient's symptoms and behavior, the most likely substance used is **B. Cocaine**. Cocaine use can lead to agitation, hypertension, tachycardia, and suicidal ideation, which match the patient's presentation.",

If the patient is unobservant or imprecise in descriptions, a helpful tactic is to provoke sensations by rapid rotation, or by asking the patient to stoop for a minute and straighten up; having him stand relaxed for 3 min and checking his blood pressure for orthostatic effect; and, particularly, having him hyperventilate for 3 min. Should the patient be unable to distinguish among these several types of induced dizziness or to ascertain the similarity of one of the types to his own condition, the history is probably too inaccurate for purposes of diagnosis."

The patient had noted progressive weakness over several days, to the point that he was unable to rise from bed. Past medical history was notable for small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, liver, and adrenals. The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced. Blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, increasing to 160/98 mmHg after 1 L of saline, with a JVP at 8 cm. There was generalized muscle weakness.

Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

Questions regarding the chief complaint usually elicit a narration of a series of incidents or problems, many of which prove to have little or no relevance to the question. Memory defects (amnesic gaps) are apparent while the history is being taken; the patient appears to have forgotten important segments of the history, some of which he had clearly described in the past and are part of the medical record. The description of symptoms is dramatic and not in accord with the facts as elicited from other members of the family. Often, a rather casual demeanor is manifest, the patient insisting that everything in her life is quite normal and controlled, when, in fact, her medical record is checkered with instances of dramatic and unexplained illness. This calm attitude toward a turbulent illness and seemingly disabling physical signs is so common that it has been"

They are initiated by autophosphorylation of select tyrosine residues in their receptors. C. They are mediated by binding to adrenergic receptors, which are a class of nuclear receptors. D. They result in the activation of glycogen and triacylglycerol synthesis. Q3. NE bound to certain receptors causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. Why might NE be used clinically in the treatment of septic shock?

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day.

Other important objectives are to quiet the agitated patient and protect him from injury. A nurse, attendant, or member of the family should be with a seriously confused patient if this can be arranged. A room with adequate natural lighting will aid in creating a diurnal rhythm of activity and reduce \u201csundowning.\u201d It is often better to let an agitated patient walk about the room than to restrain him in bed, which may increase his fright or excitement and cause him to struggle to the point of exhaustion, collapse, or self-harm.
