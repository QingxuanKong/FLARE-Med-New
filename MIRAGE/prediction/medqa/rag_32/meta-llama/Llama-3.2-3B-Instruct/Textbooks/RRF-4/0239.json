    "question": "A 48-year-old Caucasian female presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of progressive weakness and shortness of breath. She has had progressive shortness of breath over the last year with an intermittent non-productive cough. In addition, she complains of difficulty raising her arms to brush her hair. Her temperature is 99.6\u00b0F (37.6\u00b0C), pulse is 80/min, blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Neurologic exam shows 4/5 strength in the deltoid muscles bilaterally. Diffuse dry crackles are heard on lung auscultation. A faint erythematous rash is noted on the malar cheeks, periorbital areas, lateral proximal thighs, and the elbows. Which of the following tests is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",

The patient also has difficulty raising her arms to brush her hair, which suggests proximal muscle weakness. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as diffuse dry crackles on lung auscultation and a non-productive cough, suggest a systemic illness. The presence of a rash and proximal muscle weakness are characteristic of dermatomyositis, an inflammatory myopathy. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is dermatomyositis. To confirm this diagnosis, a skin biopsy is the most appropriate test. A muscle biopsy may also be performed to evaluate muscle damage, but it is not as specific for dermatomyositis. A CT scan may be useful to evaluate lung involvement, but it is not diagnostic for dermatomyositis. A serum ANA titer may be elevated in various autoimmune diseases, but it is not specific for dermatomyositis. \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The major clinical manifestation is weakness that evolves more or less symmetrically over a period of several days to a week or two, or somewhat longer. The proximal as well as distal muscles of the limbs are involved, usually the lower extremities before the upper (thus the older term Landry ascending paralysis); the trunk, intercostal, neck, and cranial muscles may be affected later. Weakness progresses in approximately 5 percent of patients to total motor paralysis with respiratory failure within a few days.

Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

At an early stage, the arm muscles are usually stronger than the leg muscles, and in a few cases, they are spared almost entirely. Facial diplegia occurs in more than half, sometimes bilaterally at the same time or sequentially over days. Other cranial nerve palsies, if they occur, usually come later, after the arms and face are affected; they are the initial signs in a variant pattern of disease as described further on. At the onset, there is no fever, and if lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly occurs, they are related to a preceding viral infection."

Myasthenic crisis is rare but includes the potentially lethal complications of respiratory compromise and aspiration. Edrophonium (Tensilon test): Anticholinesterase leads to rapid amelioration of symptoms. Rarely used today owing to the risk of bradycardia. Ice test: Place a pack of ice on one eye for five minutes; ptosis resolves transiently. An abnormal single-f ber EMG and/or a decremental response to repetitive nerve stimulation can yield additional confirmation.

Reflex activity may therefore occur below the injury, but communication with the brain is lost. A 25-year-old woman complained of increasing lumbar back pain. Over the ensuing weeks she was noted to have an enlarging lump in the right groin, which was mildly tender to touch. On direct questioning, the patient also complained of a productive cough with sputum containing mucus and blood, and she had a mild temperature. The chest radiograph revealed a cavitating apical lung mass, which explains the pulmonary history."
