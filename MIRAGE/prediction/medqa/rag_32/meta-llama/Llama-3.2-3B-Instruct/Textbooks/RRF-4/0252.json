    "question": "A 30-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of drowsiness at work for the past several months. He finds his work as a computer programmer rewarding and looks forward to coming into the office every day. However, he often falls asleep during meetings even though he usually gets a good night sleep and has limited his exposure to alcohol and caffeine in the evening. His past medical history is noncontributory. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. The primary care provider recommends keeping a sleep journal and provides a questionnaire for the patient\u2019s wife. The patient returns one month later to report no changes to his condition. The sleep journal reveals that the patient is getting sufficient sleep and wakes up rested. The questionnaire reveals that the patient does not snore nor does he stop breathing during his sleep. A sleep study reveals mean sleep latency of 6 minutes. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient\u2019s condition?",

The sleep journal and questionnaire reveal no signs of sleep apnea or other sleep disorders. The sleep study shows a mean sleep latency of 6 minutes, which is within the normal range.\\n\\nGiven the lack of evidence for sleep apnea, narcolepsy, or other sleep disorders, the patient's symptoms are likely related to excessive daytime sleepiness without a clear cause. The patient's profession as a computer programmer suggests that he may be experiencing sleep inertia, which is the feeling of grogginess and disorientation upon waking.\\n\\nThe recommended treatments for excessive daytime sleepiness without a clear cause include lifestyle modifications, such as establishing a regular sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and increasing physical activity. However, the patient has already implemented these measures.\\n\\nGiven the patient's age, profession, and lack of other symptoms, the most appropriate course of action would be to consider stimulant medications, such as methylphenidate, which is commonly used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and excessive daytime sleepiness.\\n\\nThe other options are not supported by the information provided. Sodium oxybate is typically used to treat narcolepsy and cataplexy, which are not indicated in this case. Imipramine is an antidepressant that may be used to treat insomnia, but it is not the best choice for this patient's condition. Increasing daytime naps may actually exacerbate the problem, as the patient is already experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness.\\n\\nTherefore, the best course of treatment for this patient's condition is methylphenidate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

In particular, the duration, severity, and consistency of the symptoms are important, along with the patient\u2019s estimate of the consequences of the sleep disorder on waking function. Information from a bed partner or family member is often helpful because some patients may be unaware of symptoms such as heavy snoring or may underreport symptoms such as falling asleep at work or while driving. Physicians should inquire about when the patient typically goes to bed, when they fall asleep and wake up, whether they awaken during sleep, whether they feel rested in the morning, and whether they nap during the day. Depending on the primary complaint, it may be useful to ask about snoring, witnessed apneas, restless sensations in the legs, movements during sleep, depression, anxiety, and behaviors around the sleep episode. The physical exam may provide evidence of a small airway, large tonsils, or a neurologic or medical disorder that contributes to the"

The MSLT measures a patient\u2019s propensity to sleep under quiet conditions. The test is performed after an overnight polysomnogram to establish that the patient has had an adequate amount of good-quality nighttime sleep. The MSLT consists of five 20-min nap opportunities every 2 h across the day. The patient is instructed to try to fall asleep, and the major endpoints are the average latency to sleep and the occurrence of REM sleep during the naps. An average sleep latency across the naps of less than 8 min is considered objective evidence of excessive daytime sleepiness. REM sleep normally occurs only during the nighttime sleep episode, and the occurrence of REM sleep in two or more of the MSLT naps provides support for the diagnosis of narcolepsy."

As is typical with any disorder that causes sleepiness, individuals with chronically insufficient sleep may feel inattentive, irritable, unmotivated, and depressed, and have difficulty with school, work, and driving. Individuals differ in their optimal amount of sleep, and it can be helpful to ask how much sleep the patient obtains on a quiet vacation when he or she can sleep without restrictions. Some patients may think that a short amount of sleep is normal or advantageous, and they may not appreciate their biological need for more sleep, especially if coffee and other stimulants mask the sleepiness. A 2-week sleep log documenting the timing of sleep and daily level of alertness is diagnostically useful and provides helpful feedback for the patient. Extending sleep to the optimal amount on a regular basis can resolve the sleepiness and other symptoms. As with any lifestyle change, extending sleep requires commitment and adjustments, but the improvements"

Patients should be asked about previous sleep problems, screened for depression and anxiety, and asked about symptoms of thyroid disease. Caffeine and alcohol are prominent causes of sleep problems, and a careful history of the use of these substances should be obtained. Both excessive use and withdrawal from alcohol can be causes of sleep problems."

            "content": "Physicians are frequently consulted by patients who suffer from some derangement of sleep. Most often, the problem is one of sleeplessness, but sometimes it concerns excessive sleepiness or some peculiar phenomenon occurring in connection with sleep. Certain points concerning normal sleep and the sleep\u2013wake mechanisms are worth reviewing, as familiarity with them is necessary for an understanding of disorders of sleep. A great deal of information about sleep and sleep abnormalities is now available as a result of the development of the subspecialty of sleep medicine and the existence of centers for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. Most disorders of sleep can be readily recognized if one attends closely to the patient\u2019s description of the disturbance. Cases requiring the documentation of apneic episodes or those with more complex disorders such as seizures and other motor symptoms during sleep, benefit from attention in sleep laboratories."

Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min).

Sleepy students often have trouble staying alert and performing well in school, and sleepy adults struggle to stay awake and focused on their work. More than half of Americans have fallen asleep while driving. An estimated 1.2 million motor vehicle crashes per year are due to drowsy drivers, causing about 20% of all serious crash injuries and deaths. One needn\u2019t fall asleep to have an accident, as the inattention and slowed responses of drowsy drivers are a major contributor. Reaction time is equally impaired by 24 h of sleep loss as by a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10 g/dL."

One should search out and correct, if possible, any underlying situational or psychologic difficulty, using medication only as a temporary measure. Patients should be encouraged to regularize their daily schedules, including their bedtimes, and to be physically active during the day but to avoid strenuous physical and mental activity before bedtime. It has been suggested that illumination from broad-spectrum light (television) in the late evening is detrimental. Dietary excesses must be corrected, and all nonessential medications interdicted. Coffee and alcohol should be avoided at night, if not throughout the day. A number of simple behavioral modifications may be useful, such as using the bedroom only for sleeping, arising at the same time each morning regardless of the duration of sleep, avoiding daytime naps, and"
