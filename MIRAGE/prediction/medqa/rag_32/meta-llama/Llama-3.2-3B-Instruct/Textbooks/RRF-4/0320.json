The patient's condition has worsened over the past 24 hours, indicating a need for urgent evaluation and treatment. Given the patient's history of ulcerative colitis and the severity of her symptoms, a colonoscopy is the most appropriate next step in management to evaluate for ischemic colitis, assess for any signs of bleeding or perforation, and guide further treatment. Abdominal CT scan with contrast or CT angiography may be useful in evaluating for alternative causes of ischemia, but they are not as sensitive as colonoscopy in detecting ischemic changes in the colon. An abdominal x-ray may show signs of bowel obstruction or perforation, but it is not specific for ischemic colitis. Complete bowel rest is already initiated, and fluid resuscitation is underway, so the next step is to evaluate the colon directly to guide further management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}}",

Peristaltic sounds diminish or disappear, and muscular spasm creates boardlike rigidity of the abdominal wall. Because these physical signs overlap with those of other abdominal emergencies, including acute appendicitis, perforated ulcer, and acute cholecystitis, the diagnosis of intestinal infarction may be delayed or missed, with disastrous consequences.

He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?"

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"
