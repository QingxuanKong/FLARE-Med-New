    "question": "Accurate and rapid identification of individuals with tuberculosis (TB) is crucial to accomplishing the goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) to eliminate this disease. One of the key strategies for the detection of TB is the use of tuberculin skin testing as a globally pertinent screening method, due to its low cost and technical simplicity. A study from Brazil demonstrated 76.7% accuracy, 67.9% sensitivity, 84.4% specificity, 79.1% positive predictive value, and 75% negative predictive value when using 5-mm skin elevation as a threshold, or cut-off, point for the screening test (following intradermal injection). Lowering the cut-off point to 4 mm would also result in an increase in which test property?",

    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Understanding the context**: The question is about tuberculin skin testing as a screening method for tuberculosis (TB) and the effect of lowering the cut-off point on its properties. 2. **Key terms**: - **Cut-off point**: The value used to define a positive result in a screening test. In this case, the 5-mm skin elevation is the current cut-off point. - **Accuracy**: How close the test results are to the true values. - **Sensitivity**: The proportion of true positive results (i.e., correctly identifying those with the disease). - **Specificity**: The proportion of true negative results (i.e., correctly identifying those without the disease). - **Positive predictive value (PPV)**: The proportion of true positive results among all positive test results. - **Negative predictive value (NPV)**: The proportion of true negative results among all negative test results. 3. **Effect of lowering the cut-off point**: Lowering the cut-off point means that more people will be classified as having TB because they will meet the new threshold. This should increase the number of true positive results, thus increasing sensitivity. 4. **Analyzing the options**: - **A. Convergent validity**: This refers to the ability of two different measures to indicate the same thing. Lowering the cut-off point does not directly affect convergent validity. - **B. Discriminant validity**: This refers to the ability of a test to distinguish between different groups. Lowering the cut-off point might make the test less discriminant because more people will be classified as having TB, which could lead to false positives. - **C. Negative predictive value**: Lowering the cut-off point would decrease the negative predictive value because more people will be classified as negative but actually have TB. - **D. Test specificity**: Lowering the cut-off point would likely decrease specificity because more people will be classified as having TB who actually do not have it. 5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, lowering the cut-off point from 5 mm to 4 mm would likely increase the **sensitivity** of the test, as more people will be classified as having TB who actually do have it. The final answer in JSON format is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the effect of lowering the cut-off point on the test properties. Lowering the cut-off point increases sensitivity as more people will be classified as having TB who actually do have it. The correct answer is related to this concept.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

In 1932, Seibert and Munday purified this product by ammonium sulfate precipitation to produce an active protein fraction known as tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD). In 1941, PPD-S, developed by Seibert and Glenn, was chosen as the international standard. Later, the WHO and UNICEF sponsored large-scale production of a master batch of PPD (RT23) and made it available for general use. The greatest limitation of PPD is its lack of mycobacterial species specificity, a property due to the large number of proteins in this product that are highly conserved in the various species.

False-negative reactions are common in immunosuppressed patients and in those with overwhelming TB.

Recent studies, however, suggest that IGRAs may not perform well in serial testing (e.g., among health care workers) and that interpretation of test results is dependent on cutoff values used to define positivity. Potential advantages of IGRAs include logistical convenience, the need for fewer patient visits to complete testing, and the avoidance of somewhat subjective measurements such as skin induration. However, IGRAs require that blood be drawn from the individual and then delivered to the laboratory in a timely fashion. IGRAs also require that testing be performed in a laboratory setting.

There, they proliferate and produce cytokines. Although DTH is associated with protective immunity (TST-positive persons are less susceptible to a new M. tuberculosis infection than TST-negative persons), it by no means guarantees protection against reactivation. In fact, cases of active TB are often accompanied by strongly positive skin-test reactions.

Although M. tuberculosis may be identified presumptively on the basis of growth time and colony pigmentation and morphology, a variety of biochemical tests have traditionally been used to speciate mycobacterial isolates. In modern, well-equipped laboratories, liquid culture for isolation and species identification by molecular methods or high-pressure liquid chromatography of mycolic acids has replaced isolation on solid media and identification by biochemical tests. A widely used technology is the mycobacterial growth indicator tube (BBL\u2122 MGIT\u2122; BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ), which uses a fluorescent compound sensitive to the presence of oxygen dissolved in the liquid medium. The appearance of fluorescence detected by fluorometric technology indicates active growth of mycobacteria. A low-cost, rapid immunochromatographic lateral-flow assay based on detection of MTP64 antigen may also be used for species"

            "content": "The earliest recorded human case of TB dates back 9000 years. Early treatment modalities, such as bloodletting, were replaced by sanatorium regimens in the late nineteenth century. The discovery of streptomycin in 1943 launched the era of antibiotic treatment for TB. Over subsequent decades, the discovery of additional agents and the use of multiple-drug regimens allowed progressive shortening of the treatment course from years to as little as 6 months with the regimen for drug-susceptible TB. Latent TB infection (LTBI) and active TB disease are diagnosed by history, physical examination, radiographic imaging, tuberculin skin test, interferon \u03b3 release assays, acid-fast staining, mycobacterial cultures, and/or new molecular diagnostics. LTBI is treated with isoniazid (optimally given daily or twice weekly for 9 months), rifampin (daily for 4 months), or isoniazid plus rifapentine (weekly for 3 months) (Table 205e-1)."

This dynamic trade-off between more accurate identification of subjects with disease versus those without disease is often displayed graphically as a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Fig. 3-1) by plotting sensitivity (y axis) versus 1 \u2013 specificity (x axis). Each point on the curve represents a potential cut point with an associated sensitivity and specificity value. The area under the ROC curve often is used as a quantitative measure of the information content of a test. Values range from 0.5 (no diagnostic information from testing at all; the test is equivalent to flipping a coin) to 1.0 (perfect test). The choice of cut point should depend on the"

Once an appropriate clinical evaluation has excluded active TB, infants and children who have come into contact with infectious cases should be treated for presumed LTBI. HIV-infected persons who have been exposed to an infectious TB patient should receive treatment regardless of the TST result. Any HIV-infected candidate for LTBI treatment must be screened carefully to exclude active TB, which would necessitate full treatment. The use of a clinical algorithm based on four symptoms (current cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats) helps to define which HIV-infected person is a candidate for LTBI treatment. The absence of all four symptoms tends to exclude active TB. The presence of one of the four symptoms, on the other hand, warrants further investigation for active TB before treatment of LTBI is started. Although administering a TST is prudent, this test is not an absolute requirement\u2014given the logistical"

A common platform is the ELISA, also referred to as an enzyme immunoassay (EIA). This solid-phase assay is an extremely good screening test with a sensitivity of >99.5%. Most diagnostic laboratories use commercial kits that contain antigens from both HIV-1 and HIV-2 and thus are able to detect antibodies to either. These kits use both natural and recombinant antigens and are continuously updated to increase their sensitivity to newly discovered species, such as group O viruses (Fig. 226-1). The fourth-generation EIA tests combine detection of antibodies to HIV with detection of the p24 antigen of HIV. EIA tests are generally scored as positive (highly reactive), negative (nonreactive), or indeterminate (partially reactive). While the EIA is an extremely sensitive test, it is not optimal with regard to specificity. This is particularly true in studies of low-risk individuals, such as"
