    "question": "A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?",

        "A": "Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report",

The etiology of this condition is often obscure, though in some instances the nerve injury may be a direct effect of increased pressure on the median nerve caused by overuse, swelling of the tendons and tendon sheaths (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), and cysts arising from the carpal joints. Increased pressure in the carpal tunnel is thought to cause venous congestion that produces nerve edema and anoxic damage to the capillary endothelium of the median nerve itself. Patients typically report pain and pins-and-needles sensations in the distribution of the median nerve. Weakness and loss of muscle bulk of the thenar muscles may also occur.

In fact, culture (col-lective attitudes and beliefs of caregivers) is increasingly being recognized to be the fourth measurable component to the structure-process-outcome model. This recognition is based on growing evidence that local culture is linked to a variety of important clinical outcomes.10 For any new patient safety initiative to be deemed successful, any change in structure or process must lead to a corresponding positive change in patient outcomes.11CREATING A CULTURE OF SAFETYCulture is to"

The anesthesiology residency, whose annual matriculation ranged from zero to three residents, now routinely admits 10 new residents yearly. The surgery residency has divided into the four specialties of general surgery, orthopedics, urology, and neurosurgery. Annual matriculation across all for programs now ranges from 15 to 20 compared to 3 to 6, prior to the HRH program\u2019s support of the surgery department. In July 2016, UR graduated eight new general surgeons and one new urologist, the largest output to date. Similar training output is noted across the other disciplines and specialties as well. As a result, Rwanda is now on track to achieve most of its targets for the health workforce. Most graduates are deployed across provincial hospitals to provide specialty level care in a decentralized fashion, while a portion are maintained at the teaching hospitals to be recruited as new"

            "content": "The nerve conduction studies indicated that the compression site was at the elbow joint. The clinical findings are not consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome. The clinician should have been alerted to this problem given that the patient experienced numbness over the thenar eminence of the hand. This clue indicates an understanding of the anatomy. Compression of the nerve within the carpal tunnel does not produce this numbness, because the small cutaneous branch that supplies this region is proximal to the flexor retinaculum. The nerve compromise was caused by the ligament of Struthers, which is an embryological remnant of the coracobrachialis muscle. It is an extremely rare finding. Occasionally it may ossify and cross the nerve, artery, and vein to produce compression in arm extension. Although this is very rare and unusual, it illustrates the complex course of the median nerve."

For both pro-cedures, the remaining distal ulna must be stabilized. Multiple techniques have been described using portions of FCU, ECU, wrist capsule, and combinations thereof.The ruptured extensor tendons are typically degenerated over a significant length. Primary repair is almost never pos-sible, and the frequent occurrence of multiple tendon ruptures makes repair with graft less desirable due to the need for mul-tiple graft donors.Strict compliance with postoperative therapy is essential to maximizing the surgical result. Due to the chronic inflam-mation associated with RA, tendon and ligament repairs will be slower to achieve maximal tensile strength. Prolonged night-time splinting, usually"

As symptoms progress a joint replacement may be necessary, but although joint replacement appears to be the panacea for degenerative joint disease, it is not without risks and complications, which include infection and failure in the short and long term. In the clinic Examination of the knee joint It is important to establish the nature of the patient\u2019s complaint before any examination. The history should include information about the complaint, the signs and symptoms, and the patient\u2019s lifestyle (level of activity). This history may give a significant clue to the type of injury and the likely findings on clinical examination, for example, if the patient was kicked around the medial aspect of the knee, a valgus deformity injury to the tibial collateral ligament might be suspected."

This mechanism func-tions to extend the knee. Injuries can result after a fall directly onto the knee or from forcible contraction of the quadriceps. It is important to examine the knee for the ability to actively extend the knee. Quadriceps tendon ruptures, patella fractures, or patella ligament ruptures can result in a loss of active knee extension requiring surgery. Nondisplaced patella fractures with intact active knee extension can be treated nonoperatively with a cast or knee immobilizer,"

Errors or critical inci-dents are regarded as learning opportunities rather than cause for punishment.
