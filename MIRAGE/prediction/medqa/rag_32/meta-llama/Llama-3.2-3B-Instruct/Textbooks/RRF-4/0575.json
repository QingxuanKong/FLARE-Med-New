She first noticed her symptoms after she got off a rollercoaster ride 2 months ago. Physical examination shows weakness when extending the right wrist against resistance. An MRI of the head and neck is shown. This patient's condition is most likely the result of nerve root compression by a structure derived from which of the following embryologic layers?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the embryologic layer from which the structure derived from is responsible for the patient's condition, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and the structure involved. The patient's symptoms include intermittent pain in the neck, right shoulder, and arm, as well as a tingling sensation in the right hand, and weakness when extending the right wrist against resistance. These symptoms suggest compression of a nerve root, which is a common cause of neck and shoulder pain. The MRI of the head and neck is mentioned, but the specific findings are not provided. Based on the symptoms, we can infer that the structure involved is likely a nerve root, which is derived from the neural tube. The neural tube forms the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord, and gives rise to the nerve roots that innervate the neck and shoulder region. The other options are not directly related to the development of the nervous system. Neural crest cells give rise to the peripheral nervous system, notochord is a precursor to the central nervous system, and surface ectoderm gives rise to the epidermis and other external tissues. Therefore, the structure derived from the neural tube is the most likely cause of the patient's condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

Lesions may be recognized by the presence of atrophy of these muscles and weakness of the first 15 degrees of abduction (supraspinatus) and of external rotation of the arm at the shoulder joint (infraspinatus). The latter muscle is tested by having the patient flex the forearm and then, pinning the elbow to the side, asking him to swing the forearm backward against resistance. This nerve is often involved as a result of a herniated C5-C6 disc (see Chap. 10), or as part of a brachial plexus neuropathy of either the sporadic or inherited type. It may be affected during infectious illnesses and may be injured in gymnasts, or as a result of local pressure from carrying heavy objects on the shoulder (\u201cmeatpacker\u2019s neuropathy\u201d).

Neck pain, stiffness, and a range of motion limited by pain are the usual manifestations. Herniated cervical disks are responsible for ~25% of cervical radiculopathies. Extension and lateral rotation of the neck narrow the ipsilateral intervertebral foramen and may reproduce radicular symptoms (Spurling\u2019s sign). In young adults, acute nerve root compression from a ruptured cervical disk is often due to trauma. Cervical disk herniations are usually posterolateral near the lateral recess. Typical patterns of reflex, sensory, and motor changes that accompany cervical nerve root lesions are summarized in Table 22-4. Although the classic patterns are clinically helpful, there are numerous exceptions because there is overlap in sensory function between adjacent nerve roots, symptoms and signs may be evident in only part of the injured nerve root territory, and (3) the location of"

Weakness of the flexor muscles of the forearm may be present in advanced cases. Tendon reflexes are usually preserved. In addition, most patients complain of an intermittent aching of the arm, particularly of the ulnar side, and about half of them complain also of numbness and tingling along the ulnar border of the forearm and hand. A loss of superficial sensation in these areas is variable. It may be possible to reproduce the sensory symptoms by firm pressure just above the clavicle or by traction on the arm.

She drinks decaffeinated coffee but only one cup in the morning; however, she drinks as many as six cans per day of diet cola. She drinks a glass of wine with her evening meal but does not like stronger spirits. What other aspects of this patient\u2019s history would you like to know? What therapeutic measures are appropriate for this patient? What drug, or drugs, (if any) would you prescribe? At her annual physical examination, a 53-year-old middle school teacher complains that she has been having difficulty falling asleep, and after falling asleep, she awakens several times during the night. These episodes now occur almost nightly and are interfering with her ability to teach. She has tried various over-the-counter sleep remedies, but they were of little help and she experienced \u201changover\u201d effects on the day following their use. Her general health is good, she is"

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

            "content": "Over the years, the authors have encountered young men with localized and asymmetrical amyotrophy of the forearm that became arrested and did not advance over a decade or two, typical of Hirayama disease. Reports of such a partial cervical spinal amyotrophy have appeared (Hirayama et al; Moreno Martinez et al). In the type described by Hirayama and associates, young men are affected with progressive and asymmetrical amyotrophy of the forearm and hand that has been traced to ligamentous hypertrophy and buckling in the ventral spinal canal. This causes a compression of the cervical spinal cord gray matter, presumably by a chronic ischemic effect as discussed in detail in Chap. 42. In a familial variety of pure restricted amyotrophy, only the vocal cords became paralyzed over a period of years in adult life; only later were the hands affected."

Signs suggesting radial nerve damage with humeral fracture. A young child presents with proximal muscle weakness, waddling gait, and pronounced calf muscles. A first-born female who was born in breech position is found to have asymmetric skin folds on her newborn exam. Diagnosis? Treatment? An 11-year-old obese African-American boy presents with sudden onset of limp. Diagnosis? Workup? The most common 1\u00b0 malignant tumor of bone. Pseudogout. Polymyalgia rheumatica. Osgood-Schlatter disease. Distal radius (Colles\u2019 fracture). Avascular necrosis. Wrist drop, loss of thumb abduction. Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Developmental dysplasia of the hip. If severe, consider a Pavlik harness to maintain abduction. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis. AP and frog-leg lateral view. Multiple myeloma."

            "content": "Compression of the eighth cervical root (by a C7-T1 disc) may mimic ulnar nerve palsy. The pain is along the medial side of the forearm and the sensory loss is in the distribution of the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm and of the ulnar nerve in the hand. The weakness largely involves the intrinsic muscles supplied by the ulnar nerve (see \u201cUlnar Nerve\u201d in Chap. 43). The reflexes may be unaffected but the triceps jerk is often slightly reduced."
