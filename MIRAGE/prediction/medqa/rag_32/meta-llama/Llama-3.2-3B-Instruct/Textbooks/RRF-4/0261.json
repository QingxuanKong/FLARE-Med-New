    "question": "A 30-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a complaint of abdominal pain. The patient states he was at a barbecue around noon. Lunch was arranged as a buffet without refrigeration. Within 2 to 3 hours, he had abdominal pain with 3 episodes of watery diarrhea. On exam, vital signs are T 99.1, HR 103, BP 110/55, RR 14. Abdominal exam is significant for pain to deep palpation without any rebounding or guarding. There is no blood on fecal occult testing (FOBT). What is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation?",

        "A": "Salmonella enteritidis",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely cause of the patient's presentation, let's analyze the key points from the history and physical examination. The patient consumed a buffet lunch without refrigeration, which increases the risk of foodborne illness. The onset of symptoms occurred within 2-3 hours, and the patient reports watery diarrhea, which is a key feature of certain foodborne pathogens. The absence of blood on fecal occult testing (FOBT) and the lack of rebounding or guarding on abdominal exam suggest a non-inflammatory cause. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension, which could indicate dehydration and possible sepsis. Given these points, let's evaluate the options. Option A, Salmonella enteritidis, is a common cause of foodborne illness, but it typically presents with fever, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea, which is not the primary complaint in this case. Option B, Listeria monocytogenes, is also a foodborne pathogen, but it more commonly affects immunocompromised individuals and is not typically associated with watery diarrhea. Option C, Staphylococcus aureus, is a common cause of foodborne illness, particularly in foods handled at room temperature, such as buffets. Staphylococcal food poisoning typically presents within 1-6 hours after ingestion, with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps, which matches the patient's presentation. Option D, Vibrio cholerae, is a cause of cholera, which presents with profuse, watery diarrhea, but it is typically associated with travel to endemic areas and is less likely given the patient's presentation. Based on the analysis, the most likely cause of this patient's presentation is Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning, given the rapid onset of symptoms after consuming a buffet lunch without refrigeration and the presence of watery diarrhea without blood or rebounding on abdominal exam.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Auscultation can detect bruits or friction rubs from vascular disease or hepatic tumors. Loss of bowel sounds signifies ileus, whereas high-pitched, hyperactive sounds characterize intestinal obstruction. Percussion assesses liver size and can detect shifting dullness from ascites. Palpation assesses for hepatosplenomegaly as well as neoplastic or inflammatory masses. Abdominal exam is helpful in evaluating unexplained pain. Intestinal ischemia elicits severe pain but little tenderness. Patients with visceral pain may exhibit generalized discomfort, whereas those with parietal pain or peritonitis have directed pain, often with involuntary guarding, rigidity, or rebound. Patients with musculoskeletal abdominal wall pain may note tenderness exacerbated by Valsalva or straight-leg lift maneuvers."

The examination should begin with a careful external inspection for abdominal distention, bruising or discoloration, abnormal veins, jaundice, surgical scars, and ostomies. Abnormalities of intensity and pitch of bowel sounds can occur with bowel obstruction. When palpating for tenderness, the examiner should note location, facial expression, guarding, and rebound tenderness. Palpation can also detect enlargement of the liver or spleen as well as feces and masses. If detected, organomegaly should be measured (with a tape measure), noting abnormal firmness or contour.

Inflammation of the visceral peritoneum usually progresses to the parietal perito-neum, presenting with migratory pain, which is a classic sign of appendicitis (likelihood ratio+, 2.06 [1.63\u20132.60]).14 Inflam-mation can often result in anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and fever (Table 30-1). Regional inflammation can also present with an ileus, diarrhea, small bowel obstruction, and hematuria. Perti-nent negative history (including menstrual) must be obtained to rule out other etiologies of abdominal pain.Physical ExaminationMost patients lay quite still due to parietal peritonitis.

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

Although often asymptomatic, patients may present with unexplained anemia or vague abdominal pain. Other features depend on location: Right-sided lesions: Often bulky, ulcerating masses that lead to anemia from chronic occult blood loss. Patients may complain of weight loss, anorexia, diarrhea, weakness, or vague abdominal pain. Obstruction is rare. Left-sided lesions: Typically \u201capple-core\u201d obstructing masses (see Figure 2.6-5). Patients complain of a change in bowel habits (e.g., \u2193 stool caliber, constipation, obstipation), colicky abdominal pain, and/or blood-streaked stools. Obstruction is common."

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

Few clinical situations require greater judgment, because the most catastrophic of events may be forecast by the subtlest of symptoms and signs. In every instance, the clinician must distinguish those conditions 20 that require urgent intervention from those that do not and can best be managed nonoperatively. A meticulously executed, detailed history and physical examination are critically important for focusing the differential diagnosis, where necessary, and allowing the diagnostic evaluation to proceed expeditiously (Table 20-1). The etiologic classification in Table 20-2, although not complete, provides a useful framework for evaluating patients with abdominal pain."

The entire abdomen should be examined systematically starting in an area where the patient does not report discomfort if possible. Classically, maximal tenderness is identified in the right lower quadrant at or near McBurney\u2019s point, which is located approximately one-third of the way along a line originating at the anterior iliac spine and running to the umbilicus. Gentle pressure in the left lower quadrant may elicit pain in the right lower quadrant if the appendix is located there. This is Rovsing\u2019s sign (Table 356-4). Evidence of parietal peritoneal irritation is often best elicited by gentle abdominal percussion, jiggling the patient\u2019s gurney or bed, or mildly bumping the feet."
