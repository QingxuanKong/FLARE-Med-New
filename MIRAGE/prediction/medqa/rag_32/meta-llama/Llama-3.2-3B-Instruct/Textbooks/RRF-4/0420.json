    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question requires us to analyze the symptoms and molecular analysis of a 15-year-old boy with a learning disability, which suggests Fragile X syndrome. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by an expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the FMR1 gene. The symptoms described, such as hyperactivity, difficulties with social interaction, and poor scores on reading and writing assessments, are consistent with Fragile X syndrome. To determine the physical examination findings, we need to look for characteristics associated with Fragile X syndrome. The correct answer can be inferred from the description of Fragile X syndrome in Document [12]. According to Document [12], Fragile X syndrome is characterized by a narrow face with a large jaw, prominent ears, connective tissue abnormalities, and macroorchidism in postpubertal males. Based on the options provided, the most likely physical examination findings are almond-shaped eyes and downturned mouth, which are consistent with Fragile X syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

These problems usually come to light in the school-age child (hence the term school dysfunction), whose aptitude for classroom learning is poorer than the child\u2019s general intelligence. The medical referral may be from a parent, teacher, or psychologist. The clinician\u2019s objective is to determine by history and examination whether there is (1) a general congenital developmental abnormality impairing intelligence; (2) a specific deficit in reading, writing, arithmetic, or attention, any one of which may interfere with the child\u2019s ability to learn; (3) a primary sensory defect, particularly in audition; or (4) neither of these\u2014for example, a behavior disorder or home situation that interferes with schooling."

The question often asked is whether they have an identifiable brain disease. According to Barlow, when a large number of such cases are analyzed, fully 85 percent prove to have no major signs of neurologic disease. Perhaps 5 percent are mentally subnormal and another 5 to 10 percent show some evidence of a minimal brain disorder. Many are clumsy. In the larger group without neurologic signs, the IQ is normal, although there are also cases of borderline intelligence. Boys are more often found to be hyperactive and inattentive than girls, just as they often have more trouble in learning to read and write. Dyslexia is frequently associated, as noted earlier. Girls with ADHD may have more trouble with numbers and arithmetic."

However, the onset of the disability may not always be present from the newborn period; many inborn errors of metabolism, including storage disorders, cause developmental manifestations after a period of normal development (see Chapters 7 and 8). Some adult-onset disorders have no symptoms until the teens or later. Assessing school problems is important. The type of learning problem, age at onset, and whether there is improvement with intervention or continued decline all are important for proper assessment. A careful and thorough physical examination is necessary for all patients with signs, symptoms, or suspicion of genetic disease. Sometimes subtle clues may lead to an unsuspected diagnosis. Features suggestive of a syndrome are discussed in more detail in Chapter 50."

For example, in fragile X syndrome, prototypical of this category of disorders, there are 200 to 4000 tandem repeats of the sequence CGG within a gene called FMR1. In normal populations, the number of repeats is small, averaging 29. The expansions of the trinucleotide sequences prevent normal expression of the FMR1 gene, thus giving rise to mental retardation. Another distinguishing feature of trinucleotide repeat mutations is that they are dynamic (i.e., the degree of amplification increases during gametogenesis).

Hx/PE: Academic functioning is substantially lower than expected for age, intelligence, and education as measured by standardized test achievement in reading, mathematics, or written expression. Learning problems signifcantly interfere with schooling and daily activities. Always rule out physical disorders (e.g., deafness) and social factors (e.g., non\u2013English speakers). Tx: Interventions include remedial classes or individualized learning strategies. Associated with male gender, chromosomal abnormalities, congenital infections, teratogens, inborn errors of metabolism, and alcohol/illicit substances during pregnancy. Hx/PE: Patients have signifcantly subaverage intellectual functioning (an IQ of < 70) with deficits in adaptive functioning (e.g., hygiene, social skills); onset is before the age of 18."

MR is defined statistically as cognitive performance that is two standard deviations below the mean (roughly below the 3rd percentile) of the general population as measured on standardized intelligence testing. The last known estimate of the prevalence of MR is that about 2% of the U.S. population is affected. Levels of MR from IQ scores derived from two typical tests are shown in Table 10-6. Caution must be exercised in interpretation because these categories do not reflect actual functional level of the tested individual. The etiology of the central nervous system insult resultingin MR may involve genetic disorders, teratogenic influences, Mild 50\u201369 50\u201355 to 70 Educable mentally retarded (EMR)"

A hearing test (may account for the language deficits), chromosomal testing (to identify fragile X syndrome, tubular sclerosis, and genetic polymorphisms), congenital viral infections, and metabolic disorders (phenylketonuria) should be performed. Electroencephalography abnormalities may be seen in 20% to 25% of children with autism but are not diagnostic. Psychological tests in children with autism often show strengths in nonverbal tasks (e.g., puzzles) and marked deficiency in verbal cognitive abilities. IQ is usually low, though savant skills and hyperlexia (a precocious interest in letters and numbers) are sometimes observed. Speech pathology consultation can be helpful in evaluating the communication difficulties."

Specific learning disorder can only be diagnosed after formal education starts but can be diagnosed at any point afterward in children, adoles- cents, or adults, providing there is evidence of onset during the years of formal schooling (i.e., the developmental period). No single data source is sufficient for a diagnosis of specific leam- ing disorder. Rather, specific learning disorder is a clinical diagnosis based on a synthesis of the individual\u2019s medical, developmental, educational, and family history; the history of the learning difficulty, including its previous and current manifestation; the impact of the diffi- culty on academic, occupational, or social functioning; previous or current school reports; portfolios of work requiring academic skills; curriculum-based assessments; and previous or current scores from individual standardized tests of academic achievement.

            "content": "Specific learning disorder disrupts the normal pattern of learning academic skills; it is not sirn- ply a consequence of lack of opportunity of learning or inadequate instruction. Difficulties mastering these key academic skills may also impede learning in other academic subjects (e.g., history, science, social studies), but those problems are attributable to difficulties learning the underlying academic skills. Difficulties learning to map letters with the sounds of one\u2019s lan- guage\u2014to read printed words (often called dyslexia)\u2014is one of the most common manifesta- tions of specific learning disorder. The learning difficulties manifest as a range of observable, descriptive behaviors or symptoms (as listed in Criteria A1\u2014A6). These clinical symptoms may be observed, probed by means of the clinical interview, or ascertained from school reports, rat- ing scales, or descriptions in previous educational or psychological assessments. The learning difficulties are persistent, not transitory."

Children with selective mutism of- ten refuse to speak at school, leading to academic or educational impairment, as teachers often find it difficult to assess skills such as reading. The lack of speech may interfere with social communication, although children with this disorder sometimes use nonspoken or nonverbal means (e.g., grunting, pointing, writing) to communicate and may be willing or eager to perform or engage in social encounters when speech is not required (e.g., nonver- bal parts in school plays)."
