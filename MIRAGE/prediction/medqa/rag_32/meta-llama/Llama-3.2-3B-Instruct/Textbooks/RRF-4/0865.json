    "question": "A 74-year-old man undergoes an open cholecystectomy. Surgery is performed under general anesthesia for which the patient is intubated with an endotracheal tube. Directly following the procedure, his temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. He is extubated as soon as he showed signs of alertness. Five minutes later, he becomes unresponsive. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. He underwent stenting of the right coronary artery 10 years ago. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 2 weeks ago for surgery. He drinks one to two beers daily. His current medications include metformin, enalapril, aspirin, atorvastatin, and a multivitamin. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 73%. He is put on a non-rebreather mask with an FiO2 of 100%. Three minutes later, he is still unresponsive. His arterial blood gas analysis shows:\npH 7.32\nPCO2 33 mm Hg\nPO2 73 mm Hg\nHCO3 22 mEq/L\nO2 saturation 73%\nWhich of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?\"",

Diagnosis remains challenging, and most of the patients will undergo an extensive and expensive gastro-intestinal tract workup for the above symptoms prior to referral to a vascular service.The typical patient who develops nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is an elderly patient who has multiple comorbidities, such as congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock, hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock, sepsis, pancreatitis, and administration of digitalis or vasocon-strictor agents such as epinephrine. Abdominal pain is only present in approximately 70% of these patients. When present, the pain is usually severe but may vary in location, character, and intensity. In the absence of abdominal pain, progressive abdominal distention with acidosis may be an early sign of isch-emia and impending bowel"

Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image).

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Thus, the relative concentrations of the types of hemoglobin can be determined by measuring the change in light inten-sity as it passes through the tissue. Since"
