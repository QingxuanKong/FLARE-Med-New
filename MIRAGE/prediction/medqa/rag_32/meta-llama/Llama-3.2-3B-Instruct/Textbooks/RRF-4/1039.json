    "question": "A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician because of difficulty falling asleep for the past 2 months. She wakes up frequently during the night and gets up earlier than desired. She experiences discomfort in her legs when lying down at night and feels the urge to move her legs. The discomfort resolves when she gets up and walks around or moves her legs. She has tried an over-the-counter sleep aid that contains diphenhydramine, which worsened her symptoms. She exercises regularly and eats a well-balanced diet. She admits that she has been under a lot of stress lately. Her brother has similar symptoms. The patient appears anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and iron studies are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of restless legs syndrome (RLS), which is characterized by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations such as itching, burning, or creeping, typically in the evening or at night. The symptoms are usually relieved by movement. The patient has tried an over-the-counter sleep aid containing diphenhydramine, which worsened her symptoms, indicating that she may have a hypersensitivity to antihistamines. The patient's symptoms are also exacerbated by stress, which is a common trigger for RLS. The patient's brother also experiences similar symptoms, suggesting a possible genetic component. Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms is Pramipexole, a dopamine agonist that is commonly used to treat RLS. Pramipexole works by stimulating dopamine receptors in the brain, which helps to regulate movement and reduce the symptoms of RLS. Amitryptiline is an antidepressant that can be used to treat RLS, but it is not the first-line treatment. Codeine is an opioid that can be used to treat pain, but it is not typically used to treat RLS. Escitalopram is an SSRI that is used to treat depression, but it is not typically used to treat RLS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause.

An urge to move the legs can be suppressed voluntarily for a brief period but is ultimately irresistible. Moving the limbs alleviates the sensation briefly.

Physicians should inquire about when the patient typically goes to bed, when they fall asleep and wake up, whether they awaken during sleep, whether they feel rested in the morning, and whether they nap during the day. Depending on the primary complaint, it may be useful to ask about snoring, witnessed apneas, restless sensations in the legs, movements during sleep, depression, anxiety, and behaviors around the sleep episode.

In contrast, depressive illness produces early morning waking and inability to return to sleep; the quantity of sleep is reduced, and nocturnal motility is increased. REM sleep in depression, although not always reduced, comes earlier in the night. If anxiety is combined with depression, there is a tendency for both the above patterns to be observed. Yet another common pattern of disturbed sleep can be discerned in individuals who are under great tension and worry or are overworked and tired out.

It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and rear-ranging the table cutlery or in picking at his clothes. To what is his condition due, and how should it be managed? Would you recommend surgical treatment?"

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

She became convinced that her roommate was listening in on her phone conversations and planning to alter her essays. She became reclusive and spent most of her time locked in her room. After much difficulty, her teachers convinced her to be seen by the student health service. It was believed she was beginning to show signs of schizophrenia and she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where she was started on antipsychotic medications. While in the hospital, she had a generalized seizure which prompted her transfer to our service. Her spinal fluid analysis showed 10 lymphocytes per mL3. She was found to have an anti-NMDA receptor antibody, which prompted an ultrasound examination of the pelvis. The left ovary was thought to show a benign cyst. Because of the neurological syndrome, the ovarian cyst was resected and revealed a microscopic ovarian teratoma. The neuropsychiatric syndrome resolved. She has since graduated and"
