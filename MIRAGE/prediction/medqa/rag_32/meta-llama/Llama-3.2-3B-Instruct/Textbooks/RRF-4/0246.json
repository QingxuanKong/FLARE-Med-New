    "question": "A 43-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C and current intravenous drug use presents with 5 days of fever, chills, headache, and severe back pain. On physical exam, temperature is 100.6 deg F (38.1 deg C), blood pressure is 109/56 mmHg, pulse is 94/min, and respirations are 18/min. He is thin and diaphoretic with pinpoint pupils, poor dentition, and track marks on his arms and legs. A high-pitched systolic murmur is heard, loudest in the left sternal border and with inspiration. He is admitted to the hospital and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. One of the blood cultures drawn 12 hours ago returns positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Repeat blood cultures now",
        "B": "Repeat blood cultures 24 hours after initial cultures were drawn",
        "C": "Repeat blood cultures 48 hours after initial cultures were drawn",
        "D": "Do not repeat blood cultures"

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of sepsis, including fever, chills, headache, severe back pain, low blood pressure, tachycardia, and diaphoresis. The patient's history of intravenous drug use and hepatitis C increases the risk of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. The patient's blood cultures have already returned positive for Staphylococcus aureus, but it is essential to confirm the diagnosis by repeating the blood cultures to ensure that the organism is still present. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends repeating blood cultures 12 hours after the initial cultures were drawn for patients with suspected bacteremia. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to repeat blood cultures 12 hours after the initial cultures were drawn.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" } ``` The reasoning behind this answer is as follows: * The patient's symptoms and history suggest sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. * The patient's blood cultures have already returned positive for Staphylococcus aureus, but it is essential to confirm the diagnosis by repeating the blood cultures to ensure that the organism is still present. * The CDC recommends repeating blood cultures 12 hours after the initial cultures were drawn for patients with suspected bacteremia. * Repeating blood cultures 12 hours after the initial cultures were drawn allows for the detection of any transient bacteremia that may have occurred during the initial sampling period. * Repeating blood cultures 12 hours after the initial cultures were drawn is a standard practice in clinical microbiology laboratories to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment of bacteremia.",

Symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, neurologic, or pulmonary disease help focus the differential diagnosis, as do findings relevant to the jugular venous pressure and waveforms, the arterial pulses, other heart sounds, the lungs, the abdomen, the skin, and the extremities. In many instances, laboratory studies, an ECG, and/or a chest x-ray may have been obtained earlier and may contain valuable information. A patient with suspected infective endocarditis, for example, may have a murmur in the setting of fever, chills, anorexia, fatigue, dyspnea, splenomegaly, petechiae, and positive blood cultures. A new systolic murmur in a patient with a marked fall in blood pressure after a recent MI suggests myocardial rupture.

Rheumatic fever is the most common cause of MS (Fig. 51e-6). In younger patients with pliable valves, S1 is loud and the murmur begins after an opening snap, which is a high-pitched sound that occurs shortly after S2. The interval between the pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P2) and the opening snap is inversely related to the magnitude of the left atrial\u2013left ventricular pressure gradient. The murmur of MS is low-pitched and thus is best heard with the bell of the stethoscope. It is loudest at the left ventricular apex and often is appreciated only when the patient is turned in the left lateral decubitus position.

He has been generally healthy, is sedentary, drinks several cocktails per day, and does not smoke cigarettes. He has a family history of hypertension, and his father died of a myocardial infarction at age 55. Physical examination is remarkable only for moderate obesity. Total cholesterol is 220, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level is 40 mg/dL. Fasting glucose is 105 mg/dL. Chest X-ray is normal. Electrocardiogram shows left ven-tricular enlargement.

Comorbid conditions that are frequently seen in association with S. aureus bacteremia and that increase the risk of complications include diabetes, HIV infection, and renal insufficiency. Other host factors associated with an increased risk of complications include presentation with community-acquired S. aureus bacteremia (except in injection drug users), lack of an identifiable primary focus of infection, and the presence of prosthetic devices or material. Clinically, S. aureus sepsis presents in a manner similar to that documented for sepsis due to other bacteria. The well-described progression of hemodynamic changes\u2014beginning with respiratory alkalosis and clinical findings of hypotension and fever\u2014is commonly seen. The microbiologic diagnosis is established by positive blood cultures."

            "content": "Acute right-sided tricuspid valvular S. aureus endocarditis is most often seen in injection drug users. The classic presentation includes a high fever, a toxic clinical appearance, pleuritic chest pain, and the production of purulent (sometimes bloody) sputum. Chest x-rays or CT scans reveal evidence of septic pulmonary emboli (small, peripheral, circular lesions that may cavitate with time) (Fig. 172-3). A high percentage of affected patients have no history of antecedent valvular damage. At the outset of their illness, patients may present with fever alone, without cardiac or other localizing findings. As a result, a high index of clinical suspicion is essential for diagnosis."

He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."
