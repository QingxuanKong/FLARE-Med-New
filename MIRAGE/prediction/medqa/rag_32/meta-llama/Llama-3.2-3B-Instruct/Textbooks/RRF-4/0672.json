    "question": "A 6-week-old girl is brought to the pediatrician for a post-natal visit. She was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 25-year-old woman via an uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery. The mother reports that prenatal screening revealed no developmental abnormalities and that the baby has been gaining weight, feeding, stooling, and urinating appropriately. Physical exam of the infant is unremarkable. The mother has a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome and is curious about the development of her daughter's ovaries. Which of the following is true regarding the baby\u2019s reproductive system at this time?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the development of the reproductive system in infants. At birth, the ovaries are not fully developed, and the oocytes (eggs) are not yet mature. The ovaries start to produce estrogen and progesterone after birth, but the oocytes are not yet released from the ovaries. The development of the reproductive system in infants is as follows: the ovaries are present at birth, but the oocytes are arrested in prophase of meiosis I, and the development of the uterus, vagina, and other reproductive organs continues after birth. The ovaries start to produce estrogen and progesterone after birth, but the oocytes are not yet released from the ovaries. Therefore, the correct answer is that the baby's oocytes are arrested in prophase of meiosis I, which is option B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

There are no other signs of puberty and no evidence of excessive estrogen effect (vaginal bleeding, thickening of the vaginal secretions, increased height velocity, or bone age acceleration). Ingestion or dermal application of estrogen-containing compounds must be excluded. Laboratory investigations are not usually necessary, but a pelvic ultrasound study rarely may be indicated to exclude ovarian disease. Girls with this condition should be re-evaluated at intervals of 6 to 12 months to ensure that apparent premature thelarche is not the beginning of progression into precocious puberty.

Nursing, however, is not a reliable method of family planning for women whose infants are on a daytime-only feeding schedule. Moreover, waiting for first menses involves a risk of pregnancy, because ovulation usually antedates menstruation. Certainly, after the first menses, contraception is essential unless the woman desires pregnancy. As shown in Table 38-2, all methods may be suitable for nursing mothers after the initial weeks, during which thromboembolism risks are still great. With all hormonal methods, very small quantities are excreted in breast milk, but no adverse efects on infants have been reported (Phillips, 2015; World Health Organization, 1988). Although not robust, some older studies link decreased infant weight gain or milk volume with early initiation of combination oral contraceptives before 6 weeks postpartum (Lopez, 2015c; Tepper, 2016a)."

Prenatally, a diagnosis of TS usually is made incidentally after chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis for unrelated reasons such as advanced maternal age. Prenatal ultrasound findings include increased nuchal translucency. The postnatal diagnosis of TS should be considered in female neonates or infants with lymphedema, nuchal folds, low hairline, or left-sided cardiac defects and in girls with unexplained growth failure or pubertal delay. Although limited spontaneous pubertal development occurs in up to 30% of girls with TS (10%, 45,X; 30\u201340%, 45,X/46,XX) and ~2% reach menarche, the vast majority of women with TS develop complete ovarian insufficiency.

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

Frequently pregnant adolescents delay seeking a diagnosis until several periods have been missed and initially may deny having intercourse. Early adolescents often present with other symptoms, such as vomiting, vague pains, or deteriorating behavior and may report normal periods. Because of the varied presentations of adolescent pregnancy, a thorough menstrual history should be obtained in all menstruating adolescents. Urine pregnancy tests are sensitive approximately 7 to 10 days after conception. Rape or incest should be ruled out in all cases of adolescent pregnancy."

An outflow tract obstruction should be ruled outin adolescents with primary amenorrhea, abdominal pain, andsecondary sexual characteristics. An abdominal mass resulting from accumulated blood may be present. Low outflowtract obstructions, such as an imperforate hymen, are visibleon examination. An endocrine evaluation is indicated for girlswith primary amenorrhea without secondary sexual characteristics and an unremarkable history and physical examination.Elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizinghormone (LH) indicate primary ovarian insufficiency, whichmay reflect ovarian dysgenesis or ovarian agenesis and warrantsa karyotype. Turner syndrome is a common cause, but other chromosomal anomalies, fragile X premutation carriers, andautoimmune etiologies should be ruled out. Low levels of FSHand LH suggest hypothalamic dysfunction, which may be dueto physiologic immaturity (often familial), isolated"
