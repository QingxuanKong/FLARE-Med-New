    "question": "A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of difficulty sleeping and fatigue. Menses occur at irregular 35- to 50-day intervals and last 3\u20137 days. Her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. She has had an unintentional 10-kg (22-lb) weight gain over this period. She also reports decreased sexual desire and increased hair growth on her face and arms. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She appears lethargic. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows central obesity, increased pigmented hair over the chin and upper lip, and purple stretch marks on the abdomen. She has a prominent hump of fat over the base of the dorsum of her neck and decreased proximal muscle tone and strength. Serum studies show:\nNa+ 154 mEq/L\nK+ 2.8 mEq/L\nCl- 103 mEq/L\nHCO3- 30 mEq/L\nCreatinine 0.9 mg/dL\nGlucose 236 mg/dL\nACTH 2 pg/mL (N = 7\u201350)\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?\"",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of Cushing\\u2019s syndrome, including weight gain, irregular menses, hirsutism, and decreased sexual desire. The physical examination reveals central obesity, increased pigmented hair on the face and arms, purple stretch marks on the abdomen, and a prominent hump of fat over the base of the dorsum of the neck. The serum studies show elevated cortisol levels (ACTH 2 pg/mL, which is within the normal range) and low glucose and high HCO3- levels. These findings are consistent with Cushing\\u2019s syndrome due to an adrenal gland disorder. The most likely diagnosis is Cushing\\u2019s syndrome caused by an adrenal adenoma or hyperplasia. The treatment options for Cushing\\u2019s syndrome due to an adrenal gland disorder are surgical removal of the tumor, which can be done through transsphenoidal hypophysectomy or adrenalectomy. However, transsphenoidal hypophysectomy is a more minimally invasive procedure and is often the preferred treatment option for Cushing\\u2019s syndrome caused by an adrenal adenoma or hyperplasia. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient is transsphenoidal hypophysectomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient.

He has been generally healthy, is sedentary, drinks several cocktails per day, and does not smoke cigarettes. He has a family history of hypertension, and his father died of a myocardial infarction at age 55. Physical examination is remarkable only for moderate obesity. Total cholesterol is 220, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level is 40 mg/dL. Fasting glucose is 105 mg/dL. Chest X-ray is normal. Electrocardiogram shows left ven-tricular enlargement.

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

A fine lanugo covers the face, body, and limbs. The skin is thin and dry, without its normal elasticity, and the nails are brittle. The dental enamel is eroded. Pubic hair and breast tissue (except for loss of fat) are normal, and, in this respect, anorexia nervosa is unlike hypopituitary cachexia (Simmonds disease). Surprisingly, however, there are no neurologic signs of nutritional deficiency. The patient is alert and cheerfully indifferent to her condition. Any suggestion that she is unattractively thin or seriously depleted is rejected."

The patient\u2019s history of weight changes, exercise, eating habits, and body image is an important factor in determining whether anorexia nervosa, malnutrition, obesity, exercise, or stress may be responsible for amenorrhea. Patients with certain specific clinical findings should undergo screening for other hormonal alterations: 1. Androgen levels should be assessed in any hirsute patient to ensure that adrenal and ovarian tumors are not present and to aid in the diagnosis of PCOS. 2. Acromegaly is suggested by coarse facial features, large doughy hands, and hyperhidrosis and may be confirmed by measuring IGF-1 levels. 3. In patients with truncal obesity, hirsutism, hypertension, and erythematous striae, Cushing syndrome should be ruled out by assessing 24-hour urinary cortisol levels or performing a 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test or late night salivary cortisol (126). It is important to confirm that the patient is not taking exogenous glucocorticoid."

This is a life-threatening disorder with a mortality rate as high as 9%. Amenorrhea may precede, coincide, or follow the weight loss. Multiple hormonal patterns are altered. The 24-hour patterns of FSH and LH may show constantly low levels as seen in childhood or increased LH pulsatility during sleep consistent with the pattern seen in early puberty. Hypercortisolism is present despite normal ACTH levels, and the ACTH response to CRH administration is blunted. Circulating triiodothyronine (T3) is low, yet circulating inactive reverse T3 concentrations are high (118). Patients may develop cold and heat intolerance, lanugo hair, hypotension, bradycardia, and diabetes insipidus. They may have yellowish discoloration of the skin resulting from elevated levels of serum carotene caused by altered vitamin A metabolism."
