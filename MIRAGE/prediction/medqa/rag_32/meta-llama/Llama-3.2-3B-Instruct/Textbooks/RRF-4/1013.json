    "question": "A 46-year-old man presents with worsening pain in multiple joints for the past 2 weeks. He says the pain is most severe in the proximal parts of his fingers and his wrists, but it has now spread to his elbows, and, occasionally, his knees. He says the joint involvement is symmetric. He also complains of morning joint stiffness that improves with activity and reports feeling fatigued during the day. He started taking ibuprofen 2 months ago for the pain which initially subsided, but, over the last few weeks, it has worsened despite the medication. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 1 year ago and has had difficulty controlling his blood glucose levels. The patient denies any smoking history, alcohol, or recreational drug use. A review of systems is significant for a weight loss of 3.0 kg (6.6 lb) over the last 3 months despite no change in diet or activity level. Which of the following is the most likely 1st-line medication in this patient?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with worsening joint pain in multiple joints, primarily in the proximal parts of his fingers, wrists, elbows, and knees, with symmetric joint involvement. The morning joint stiffness improves with activity, and he feels fatigued during the day. He has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which can be associated with inflammatory arthritis. The patient has tried ibuprofen, which initially subsided but worsened over time. The patient's symptoms and history suggest a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by symmetric joint inflammation, morning stiffness, and fatigue. The first-line treatment for RA typically involves disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which can be divided into two categories: traditional DMARDs (tDMARDs) and biologic DMARDs.\\n\\nThe patient's symptoms and history make Methotrexate (C) a suitable option as a first-line treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate is a tDMARD that has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms and improving function in patients with RA. It is often used as a first-line treatment due to its efficacy and safety profile.\\n\\nInfliximab (A) is a biologic DMARD that is typically used as an add-on therapy to tDMARDs or in patients who have had an inadequate response to tDMARDs. Anakinra (B) is also a biologic DMARD, but it is typically used in patients with a specific genetic mutation that makes them resistant to tDMARDs. High-dose prednisone (D) is a corticosteroid that can be used for short-term treatment of acute flares in RA, but it is not a first-line treatment for chronic management of the disease.\\n\\nTherefore, the most appropriate first-line medication for this patient is Methotrexate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

This subject is mentioned briefly in other sections of this book in relation to back and extremity pain (see Chap. 10) and to temporal arteritis, to which it is closely connected (see Chap. 9). The muscular soreness may be diffuse or asymmetrical, particularly in the proximal arms and shoulders. Every movement is reported as stiff and painful. The periarticular tissues and their muscular attachments are affected primarily and may be tender, but this is difficult to interpret, because tenderness in these regions may be found in healthy individuals. The sedimentation rate is elevated in the majority of patients, and a 48-h trial of prednisone, by completely alleviating muscle pain, confirms the diagnosis. In the context of muscle pain, systemic symptoms such as weight loss, headache, and fatigue, as well as mild anemia, are particularly suggestive of"

Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

It most frequently presents with distal sensory loss and pain, but up to 50% of patients do not have symptoms of neuropathy. Hyperesthesia, paresthesia, and dysesthesia also may occur. Any combination of these symptoms may develop as neuropathy progresses. Symptoms may include a sensation of numbness, tingling, sharpness, or burning that begins in the feet and spreads proximally. Neuropathic pain develops in some of these individuals, occasionally preceded by improvement in their glycemic control. Pain typically involves the lower extremities, is usually present at rest, and worsens at night. Both an acute (lasting <12 months) and a chronic form of painful diabetic neuropathy have been described. The acute form is sometimes treatment-related, occurring in the context of improved glycemic control. As diabetic neuropathy progresses, the pain subsides and eventually disappears,"

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."
