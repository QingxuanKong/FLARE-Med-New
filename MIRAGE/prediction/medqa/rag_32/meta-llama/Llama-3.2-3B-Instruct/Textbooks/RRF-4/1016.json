Upon arrival to the trauma bay, the patient has a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 6. He is rapidly intubated, and vitals are a temperature of 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), pulse of 130 bpm, and blood pressure of 83/64 mmHg. He is noted to have multiple ecchymoses over his body, as well as petechiae and purpura. He has a laceration over his clavicle that continues to bleed despite a pressure bandage. Radiographs of his lower extremity show multiple long bone fractures. Two large bore IV lines are placed, and the patient oozes from around the sites of venepuncture. Labs are notable for a WBC of 20,000/mm^3, Hb of 10.1g/dL, platelets of 48,000/mm^3, and prolongation of the PT and aPTT.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's presentation and lab results. The patient is a 18-year-old male who was in a motor vehicle crash and was ejected from the vehicle. He has a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 6, indicating severe head injury. He has multiple ecchymoses, petechiae, and purpura, which suggest a bleeding disorder. The laceration over his clavicle continues to bleed despite a pressure bandage, and he has multiple long bone fractures. The patient also has a low hemoglobin level (10.1g/dL) and thrombocytopenia (48,000/mm^3), which further supports the presence of a bleeding disorder. The prolonged PT and aPTT also suggest coagulopathy. The patient's presentation of multiple injuries, bleeding, and coagulopathy is most consistent with Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC). DIC is a condition where the blood clotting system is activated, leading to the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, which can cause bleeding and organ failure. Air embolization (A) is unlikely, as there is no mention of air in the patient's lungs or any other signs of air embolism. Tension pneumothorax (B) is also unlikely, as there is no indication of a tension pneumothorax on the radiographs. Coagulopathy of trauma (D) is a possible cause of the patient's bleeding, but it does not fully explain the coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

During this period of observation, the extremity should be positioned at approximately heart level. Measures applied in the field (such as bandages or wraps) should be removed once IV access has been obtained, with cognizance that the release of such ligatures may result in hypotension or dysrhythmias when stagnant acidotic blood containing venom is released into the systemic circulation.

Patients with chest trauma and shock may have cardiac tamponade. The relevant signs are JVD, hypotension, and muf\ufb02ed heart sounds. This can be diagnosed with bedside ultrasound. If tamponade is diagnosed, an immediate pericardiocentesis is necessary. Disability/Exposure: Disability (CNS dysfunction) is assessed and quantified with the GCS. Exposure requires that the patient be completely disrobed and assessed for injury and temperature status on both the front and back of the body. Hypothermia is a common problem in trauma and can worsen bleeding; once the exam is done, the patient should be covered with warm blankets."

First it must be determined whether the patient is breathing and has a clear airway and obtainable pulse and blood pressure, and whether there is hemorrhage from a scalp laceration or injured viscera. Severe head injuries that arrest respiration are soon followed by cessation of cardiac function. Injuries of this magnitude are often fatal; if resuscitative measures do not restore and sustain cardiopulmonary function within 4 to 5 min, the brain is usually irreparably damaged. Bleeding from the scalp can usually be controlled by a pressure bandage unless an artery is divided; then a suture becomes necessary. Resuscitative measures (artificial respiration and cardiac compression) should be continued until they are taken over by ambulance personnel. Oxygen should then be administered."

Peripheral neuropathy results in reduced sensation, and therefore minor injuries can often go unnoticed.

Diagnostic and therapeutic tube thoracostomy may be indicated in unstable patients based on clinical findings and clinical suspicion. In a more stable patient, a chest radiograph may be obtained to look for evidence of hemothorax. Major retroperitoneal hem-orrhage typically occurs in association with pelvic fractures, which is confirmed by pelvic radiography in the resuscitation bay. Intraperitoneal hemorrhage is probably the most common source of blood loss that induces shock. The physical exam for detection of substantial blood loss or injury is insensitive and unreliable; large volumes of intraperitoneal blood may be present before physical examination findings are apparent. Findings with intra-abdominal hemorrhage include abdominal distension, abdominal tenderness, or visible abdominal wounds. Hemodynamic abnormalities generally stimulate a search"

He underwent an abdominoperineal resection of the tumor and was left with a left lower abdominal colostomy (see below). Unfortunately, the man\u2019s wife left him for a number of reasons, including lack of sexual desire. He \u201cturned to drink\u201d and over the ensuing years developed cirrhosis. He was brought into the emergency room with severe bleeding from enlarged veins around his colostomy. An emergency transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt was created, which stopped all bleeding (eFigs. 4.189 and 4.190). He is now doing well in a rehabilitation program. A colostomy was necessary because of the low site of the tumor."

For automobile collisions, the speed of the vehicles involved, angle of impact, location of the patient within the vehicle, use of restraints, airbag deployment, condition of the steer-ing wheel and windshield, amount of intrusion, ejection of the patient from the vehicle, and fate of other passengers should be ascertained. For other injury mechanisms, critical information includes such things as height of a fall, surface impact, helmet use, and weight of an object by which the patient was crushed. In patients sustaining gunshot wounds, bullet characteris-tics, distance, and presumed path of the bullet are important, if known. For patients with stab wounds, the length and type of object is helpful. Finally, some patients experience a com-bination of blunt and penetrating trauma.

All extremities that are suspicious for fracture should also be evaluated by X-ray.

In patients with per-sistent hypotension and tachycardia, cardiogenic or hemorrhagic shock are the likely causes. Ultrasound evaluation of the pericar-dium, pleural cavities, and abdomen in combination with plain radiographs of the chest and pelvis will usually identify the source of shock. In patients with persistent hypotension follow-ing blunt trauma, the pelvis should be wrapped with a sheet for stabilization until radiography can be done; external blood loss should be controlled, and extremity fractures should be splinted to minimize further blood loss. Evaluation of the CVP or ultra-sound of the IVC may further assist in distinguishing between cardiogenic and hypovolemic shock. Base deficit measurement is critical; a base deficit of >8 mmol/L implies ongoing cellular shock.21,22 Serum lactate also is used to monitor the patient\u2019s physiologic response to resuscitation.23 Evolving technology, such as"

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

Mucous membrane pemphigoid and pemphigus vulgaris are the major acquired disorders. While their clinical features are often distinctive, a biopsy or immunohistochemical examination should be performed to diagnose these entities and to 237 distinguish them from lichen planus and drug reactions. Hematologic and Nutritional Disease Internists are more likely to encounter patients with acquired, rather than congenital, bleeding disorders. Bleeding should stop 15 min after minor trauma and within an hour after tooth extraction if local pressure is applied. More prolonged bleeding, if not due to continued injury or rupture of a large vessel, should lead to investigation for a clotting abnormality. In addition to bleeding, petechiae and ecchymoses are prone to occur at the vibrating line between the soft and hard palates in patients with platelet dysfunction or thrombocytopenia."
