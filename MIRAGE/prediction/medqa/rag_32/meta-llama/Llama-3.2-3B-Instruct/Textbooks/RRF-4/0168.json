    "question": "A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency department. He was found unconscious on the street. The staff recognizes him as a local homeless man with a long history of alcoholism. At the hospital, his pulse is 95/min, the blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, the respirations are 20/min, and the oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, the unconscious man is covered in bloody vomit with small clots and food particles. He smells of alcohol. A digital exam reveals black tarry stool in the rectal vault. The patient is given oxygen, IV fluids, and an NG-tube is placed and set to intermittent suction. Labs are sent and the patient is prepared for a procedure. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in his management?",

The patient is also a known alcoholic with a history of alcoholism, which increases the risk of peptic ulcer disease. However, the presence of black tarry stool is more suggestive of upper gastrointestinal bleeding rather than peptic ulcer disease. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is not in shock, which makes surgical intervention less urgent. The most appropriate next step is to perform an upper GI endoscopy to identify and treat the source of bleeding.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Between 8:30 and approximately midnight, he and several other pledges consumed beer and a bottle of whiskey, and then he consumed most of a bottle of rum at the urging of upperclassmen. The young man complained of feeling nau-seated, lay down on a couch, and began to lose conscious-ness. Two upperclassmen carried him to a bedroom, placed him on his stomach, and positioned a trash can nearby. Approximately 10 minutes later, the freshman was found unconscious and covered with vomit. There was a delay in treatment because the upperclassmen called the college police instead of calling 911. After the call was transferred to 911, emergency medical technicians responded quickly and discovered that the young man was not breathing and that he had choked on his vomit. He was rushed to the hospital, where he remained in a coma for 2 days before ultimately being pronounced dead. The"

            "content": "A 65-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe central chest pain that radiated to the neck and predominantly to the left arm. He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian"

In the remainder, certain points are useful: (1) the circumstances and rapidity with which neurologic symptoms developed; (2) the antecedent symptoms (confusion, weakness, headache, fever, seizures, dizziness, double vision, or vomiting); (3) the use of medications, drugs, or alcohol; and (4) chronic liver, kidney, lung, heart, or other medical disease. Direct interrogation of family, observers, and ambulance technicians on the scene, in person or by telephone, is an important part of the evaluation when possible."

On return to the surgeon in the outpatient clinic some weeks later, the patient did not wish to continue with his colostomy and bag. Further to discussion, surgery was planned to \u201crejoin\u201d the patient. At operation the colostomy was \u201ctaken down\u201d and the rectal stump was identified. There was, however, a significant gap between the bowel ends. To enable the bowel to be sutured, the descending colon was mobilized from the posterior abdominal wall. An anastomosis was performed and the patient left the hospital 1 week later and currently remains well. A 72-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (an expansion of the infrarenal abdominal aorta). The aneurysm measured 10 cm, and after discussion with the patient it was scheduled for repair. The surgical and endovascular treatment options were explained to the patient."

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

In determining the need for surgical evacuation, we have been guided by the patient\u2019s state of consciousness, the mass effect caused by the clot as visualized on imaging (particularly the degree of compression of the quadrigeminal cistern, as pointed out by Taneda and colleagues), and the presence or absence of hydrocephalus. Assessment may require daily or even more frequent CT. The patient who is stuporous or displays arrhythmic breathing is best intubated and brought to the operating room within hours or sooner. Once coma and pupillary changes supervene, few patients survive, even with surgery; however, rapid medical intervention with mannitol and hyperventilation, followed by surgical evacuation of the clot and drainage of the ventricles within hours of the onset of coma has been successful in some cases. Patients who are drowsy and those with hematomas of 2 to 4 cm in diameter in the cerebellar hemisphere pose the greatest difficulty in determining if, and when,"
