She does not have any issues with liquids. She has no coughing or nasal regurgitation. She has no hoarseness or weight loss. She reports occasional heartburn that has lasted for about a year. Her past medical history is significant for asthma and eczema. She has no history of any serious illness and takes no medications. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormal findings. An endoscopic image of the esophagus is shown. Mucosal biopsy shows eosinophilic infiltration.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and history to determine the underlying cause of her difficulty swallowing. The patient reports episodes of solid food getting stuck in her chest behind the sternum, which suggests a mechanical obstruction. However, she does not have any issues with liquids, coughing, or nasal regurgitation, which makes conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or esophagitis less likely. The patient's past medical history of asthma and eczema is also relevant, as these conditions are associated with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a condition characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal mucosa. The endoscopic image and mucosal biopsy showing eosinophilic infiltration further support this diagnosis. EoE is a common cause of dysphagia in adults and is often associated with food allergies and atopic diseases like asthma and eczema. The patient's symptoms and test results are consistent with EoE, which requires a different treatment approach than conditions like GERD or esophagitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

In preadolescent children, symptom presentations of EoE include chest or abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and food aversion. Other symptoms in adults may include atypical chest pain and heartburn, particularly heartburn that is refractory to PPI therapy. An atopic history of food allergy, asthma, eczema, or allergic rhinitis is present in the majority of patients. Peripheral blood eosinophilia is demonstrable in up to 50% of patients, but the specificity of this finding is problematic in the setting of concomitant atopy. The characteristic endoscopic esophageal findings are loss of vascular markings (edema), multiple esophageal rings, longitudinally oriented furrows, and punctate exudate (Fig. 347-11).

Careful history-taking often points to a presumptive diagnosis and leads to the appropriate use of diagnostic tests. Esophageal strictures (Fig. 345-39) typically cause progressive dysphagia, first for solids, then for liquids; motility disorders often cause intermittent dysphagia for both solids and liquids. Some underlying disorders have characteristic historic features: Schatzki\u2019s ring (Fig. 345-40) causes episodic dysphagia for solids, typically at the beginning of a meal; oropharyngeal motor disorders typically present with difficulty initiating deglutition (transfer dysphagia) and nasal reflux or coughing with swallowing; and achalasia may cause nocturnal regurgitation of undigested food."

Endoscopy is indicated in patients with reflux symptoms refractory to antisecretory therapy; in those with alarm symptoms, such as dysphagia, weight loss, or gastrointestinal bleeding; and in those with recurrent dyspepsia after treatment that is not clearly due to reflux on clinical grounds alone.

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

The condi-tion is characterized by a constellation of symptoms, endoscopic and radiologic findings, and distinctive pathology. The etiology of eosinophilic esophagitis is not entirely known but its simi-larities, immunologically, to asthma suggest that it is a form of \u201callergic esophagitis.\u201dSymptomsThe presentation of eosinophilic esophagitis is chest pain (often postprandial) and dysphagia. Dysphagia may occur with liquids or solids, but solid food dysphagia is most common. Because dysphagia and chest pain are characteristic of GERD, EE is often confused with GERD; however, EE does not respond to proton pump inhibitors. The evaluation of the patient with EE and dysphagia and chest pain with esophagram and endoscopy usually reveals the diagnosis.SignsA barium swallow should be the first test obtained in the patient with dysphagia. EE has a characteristic finding often called the \u201cringed esophagus\u201d or the \u201cfeline esophagus,\u201d as the"

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases.

The frenulum of the tongue may be shortened. Most patients have symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): heartburn, regurgitation, and dysphagia. A combination of reduced lower esophageal sphincter pressure resulting in gastroesophageal reflux, impaired esophageal clearance of refluxed gastric contents due to diminished motility in the distal two-thirds of the esophagus, and delayed gastric emptying accounts for GERD. Manometry shows abnormal upper intestinal motility in most patients with SSc. Extraesophageal manifestations of GERD include hoarseness, chronic cough, and aspiration pneumonitis, which may aggravate underlying ILD. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan characteristically shows a dilated esophagus with intraluminal air. Endoscopy may be"

The presence of linear furrows and multiple corrugated rings throughout a narrowed esophagus (feline esophagus) should raise suspicion for eosinophilic esophagitis, an increasingly recognized cause for recurrent dysphagia and food impaction (Fig. 345-41). Blind or forceful passage of an endoscope may lead to perforation in a patient with stenosis of the cervical esophagus or a Zenker\u2019s diverticulum, but gentle passage of an endoscope under direct visual guidance is reasonably safe. Endoscopy can miss a subtle stricture or ring in some patients. When transfer dysphagia is evident or an esophageal motility disorder is suspected, esophageal radiography and/or a video-swallow study"
