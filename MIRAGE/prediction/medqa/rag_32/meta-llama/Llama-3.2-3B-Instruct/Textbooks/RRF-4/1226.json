    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To determine the best answer, let's break down the scenario step by step: 1. The patient has a history of thyroidectomy and primary hyperparathyroidism, which indicates that she has had surgery to remove part or all of her parathyroid glands to treat hyperparathyroidism. 2. She is now presenting for surgical evaluation for a right adrenal mass. 3. The patient has primary hyperparathyroidism, which means that her calcium levels are likely to be elevated due to the absence or underactivity of parathyroid glands that regulate calcium levels in the blood. 4. The presence of an adrenal mass, particularly in the context of primary hyperparathyroidism, raises the suspicion for a pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that can cause hypertension. 5. Pheochromocytomas are known to cause hypertensive crises, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly. Given these considerations, the goal of preoperative medication in this scenario is to prevent a hypertensive emergency intraoperatively. The preferred medication should: - Block alpha-adrenergic receptors to prevent the release of catecholamines (e.g., norepinephrine) from the adrenal gland, which can cause hypertension. - Be effective in blocking alpha-adrenergic receptors to prevent hypertensive crises during surgery. Considering the options: A. Atenolol is a beta-blocker, which is not the preferred choice for this scenario because it only blocks beta-adrenergic receptors and will not prevent the release of catecholamines from the adrenal gland. B. Labetolol is a beta-blocker with some alpha-blocking activity, but it is not the best choice for this scenario because it is not as effective as a pure alpha-blocker in preventing hypertensive crises. C. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker, which is not the preferred choice for this scenario because it does not directly address the alpha-adrenergic receptors and can cause reflex tachycardia. D. Phenoxybenzamine is a non-selective alpha-blocker, which is the preferred choice for this scenario because it effectively blocks alpha-adrenergic receptors and prevents the release of catecholamines from the adrenal gland, thereby preventing hypertensive crises during surgery. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient requires an alpha-blocker to prevent hypertensive crises during surgery due to the presence of a suspected pheochromocytoma. Phenoxybenzamine is the most effective alpha-blocker for this purpose, making it the best choice for preoperative medication.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Consequently, selective adrenal vein sampling (AVS) should only be carried out in surgical candidates with either no obvious lesion on CT or evidence of a unilateral lesion in patients older than 40 years, because the latter patients have a high likelihood of harboring a coincidental, endocrine-inactive adrenal adenoma (Fig. 406-12).

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

Recent studies suggest that postresection hyperkalemia may be more common and last longer than previously appreciated; therefore, it should be screened for in patients who are older and who have had a longer duration of hypertension, impaired kidney function, and higher preoperative aldosterone levels, making them a high-risk group.102 Rarely, acute Addison\u2019s disease may occur 2 to 3 days after adrenalectomy. Adrenalectomy is >90% successful in improving hypokalemia and about 70% successful in cor-recting hypertension.

In several centers, a combination of preoperative sestamibi imaging, cervical block anesthesia, minimal surgical incision, and intraoperative PTH measurements has allowed successful outpatient surgical management with a clear-cut cost benefit compared to general anesthesia and more extensive neck surgery. The use of these minimally invasive approaches requires clinical judgment to select patients unlikely to have multiple gland disease (e.g., MEN or secondary hyperparathyroidism). The growing acceptance of the technique and its relative ease for the patient has lowered the threshold for surgery. Severe hypercalcemia may provide a preoperative clue to the presence of parathyroid carcinoma. In such cases, when neck exploration is undertaken, the tissue should be widely excised; care is taken to avoid rupture of the capsule to prevent local seeding of"
