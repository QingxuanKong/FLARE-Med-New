    "question": "A 30-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a recent episode of chest pain. She says she was previously well and denies any history of similar symptoms. She reports that, at onset, she felt as if she was going to die and says her heart beating has been beating really fast. There was also profuse sweating, and she says she feels short of breath. She could not recall how long the event lasted but can remember that the symptoms did go away on their own by the time she arrived at the emergency department. Her vitals rapidly returned to normal while giving her medical history and she begins to look and act more calm. No significant past medical history or current medications.  Physical examination is unremarkable. Her electrocardiogram and initial cardiac enzymes are normal. Which the following is necessary to confirm the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: **Step 1: Analyze the patient's symptoms** The patient presents with a recent episode of chest pain, feeling as if she was going to die, rapid heartbeat, profuse sweating, and shortness of breath. These symptoms are suggestive of a cardiac event, but the duration of the event is unknown. **Step 2: Consider the differential diagnosis** Given the patient's symptoms and normal vital signs, the differential diagnosis includes cardiac causes such as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction (MI), or arrhythmias. However, the absence of typical angina symptoms (e.g., radiation to the left arm, jaw, or neck) and normal cardiac enzymes makes MI less likely. **Step 3: Evaluate the options** The options provided are: A. 1 month of associated symptoms B. Disruptive events lasting > 30 minutes on 2 separate occasions C. Family history D. Agoraphobia **Step 4: Choose the most relevant option** Option B, \"Disruptive events lasting > 30 minutes on 2 separate occasions,\" is the most relevant option. This is because the patient's symptoms are suggestive of palpitations, which can be a symptom of arrhythmias, and the duration of the event is unknown. According to the documentation, \"Symptoms that accompany myocardial ischemia may include diaphoresis, dyspnea, nausea, fatigue, faintness, and eructations. In addition, these symptoms may exist in isolation as anginal equivalents (i.e., symptoms of myocardial ischemia other than typical angina), particularly in women and the elderly.\" **Answer in JSON format:** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are suggestive of a cardiac event, but the duration of the event is unknown. The differential diagnosis includes cardiac causes such as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction (MI), or arrhythmias.

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg.

The evaluation of nontraumatic chest discomfort is inherently challenging owing to the broad variety 19 of possible causes, a minority of which are life-threatening conditions that should not be missed. It is helpful to frame the initial diagnostic assessment and triage of patients with acute chest discomfort around three categories: (1) myocardial ischemia; (2) other cardiopulmonary causes (pericardial disease, aortic emergencies, and pulmonary conditions); and (3) non-cardiopulmonary causes. Although rapid identification of high-risk conditions is a priority of the initial assessment, strategies that incorporate routine liberal use of testing carry the potential for adverse effects of unnecessary investigations."

For example, clinicians are taught to consider aortic dissection routinely as a possible cause of acute severe chest discomfort. Even though the typical history of dissection differs from that of MI, dissection is far less prevalent, so diagnosing dissection remains challenging unless it is explicitly and routinely considered as a diagnostic imperative (Chap. 301). If the clinician fails to elicit any of the characteristic features of dissection by history and finds equivalent blood pressures in both arms and no pulse deficits, he may feel comfortable discarding the aortic dissection hypothesis. If, however, the chest x-ray shows a possible widened mediastinum, the hypothesis may be reinstated and an appropriate imaging test ordered"

Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

            "content": "Chest discomfort is the third most common reason for visits to the ED in the United States, resulting in 6 to 7 million emergency visits each year. More than 60% of patients with this presentation are hospitalized for further testing, and the rest undergo additional investigation in the ED. Fewer than 25% of evaluated patients are eventually diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with rates of 5\u201315% in most series of unselected populations. In the remainder, the most common diagnoses are gastrointestinal causes (Fig. 19-1), and fewer than 10% are other life-threatening cardiopulmonary conditions. In a large proportion of patients with transient acute chest discomfort, ACS or another acute cardiopulmonary cause is excluded but the cause is not determined. Therefore, the resources and time devoted to the evaluation of chest discomfort in the absence of a severe cause are substantial. Nevertheless, a disconcerting 2\u20136% of patients with chest discomfort of presumed non-ischemic"

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

In a study of more than 350,000 patients with unspecified presumed non-cardiopulmonary chest discomfort, the mortality rate 1 year after discharge was <2% and did not differ significantly from age-adjusted mortality in the general population. The estimated rate of major cardiovascular events through 30 days in patients with acute chest pain who had been stratified as low risk was 2.5% in a large population-based study that excluded patients with ST-segment elevation or definite noncardiac chest pain. The major etiologies of chest discomfort are discussed in this section and summarized in Table 19-1. Additional elements of the history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing that aid in distinguishing these causes are discussed in a later section (see \u201cApproach to the Patient\u201d)."

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"
