    "question": "A 74-year-old man was admitted to the hospital after falling down several stairs. He is a known alcoholic. He was started on IV fluids and received a head CT, which was negative. It was decided that he would be watched for one day before being discharged, after a negative work-up. Suddenly, he is unable to move his arms and legs in addition to experiencing difficulty chewing, swallowing, moving his face, and speaking. Which of the following electrolyte imbalances was most likely corrected too aggressively?",

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer: Step 1: The patient is a 74-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital after falling down several stairs. He is a known alcoholic and has been started on IV fluids. Step 2: The patient suddenly develops weakness in his arms and legs, difficulty chewing, swallowing, moving his face, and speaking. Step 3: The patient's symptoms suggest a Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is a complication of thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency, commonly seen in alcoholics. Step 4: Thiamine deficiency can lead to an imbalance of electrolytes, particularly potassium (K+). Step 5: The symptoms of Wernicke's encephalopathy include confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia (difficulty moving the eyes), which can be caused by hypokalemia (low potassium levels). Step 6: The patient's symptoms are consistent with hypokalemia, which can cause muscle weakness, fatigue, and difficulty swallowing. Step 7: The patient's history of alcoholism and recent hospitalization increase the risk of thiamine deficiency and hypokalemia. Step 8: The correct answer is C. Hypokalemia, as it is the most likely electrolyte imbalance that was corrected too aggressively, leading to the patient's symptoms. The final answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms suggest a Wernicke's encephalopathy, which is a complication of thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency, commonly seen in alcoholics.

Severe degrees of agitation and perspiration may require the administration of up to 5 L of fluid daily, of which at least 1,500 to 2,000 mL should be normal saline. The specific electrolytes and the amounts that must be administered are governed by the laboratory values for these electrolytes. If the serum sodium is extremely low, one must be cautious in raising the level lest a central pontine myelinolysis be induced (see Chap. 39). In the rare case of hypoglycemia, the administration of glucose is an urgent matter. Patients who present with severe alcoholic ketoacidosis and normal or only slightly elevated blood glucose concentrations usually recover promptly, without the use of insulin."

Cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis is a common but not invariable feature. The metabolic acidosis is a result of the conversion of ethylene glycol by ADH into glycolic acid, thus producing an anion gap that reflects the presence of this additional substance in the blood. (The anion gap has been defined in different ways, but the most convenient is the difference between the positive ion Na+ and the sum of negative ions, Cl\u2212 plus HCO3\u2212 [venous CO2 is used for the latter]; a value greater than 12 is considered a gap.)

Although more costly, lurasidone is then prescribed, which, over the course of several weeks of treatment, improves his symptoms and is tolerated by the patient. What signs and symptoms would support an initial diagnosis of schizophrenia? In the treatment of schizophre-nia, what benefits do the second-generation antipsychotic drugs offer over the traditional agents such as haloperidol? In addition to the management of schizophrenia, what other clinical indications warrant consideration of the use of drugs nominally classified as antipsychotics?

Further examination of his left eye reveals rupture of his globe. The ophthalmolo-gist requests emergency surgery to repair and save his eye. Because the patient has suffered a recent trauma, you decide to perform a rapid sequence intubation in preparation for the surgical procedure.

All tight clothing and other constrictions should be loosened and the head and body positioned so that the tongue does not fall back into the throat and the possible aspiration of vomitus is avoided. Nothing should be given by mouth until the patient has regained consciousness. The patient should not be permitted to rise until the sense of physical weakness and the appearance of pallor have passed and he should be watched carefully for a few minutes after arising."

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension.

            "content": "How should this patient be treated? What are the major pitfalls of therapy? This patient developed severe hypernatremia due to a water diuresis from lithium-associated NDI. Treatment of hypernatremia must include both replacement of the existing free water deficit and daily replacement of ongoing free water loss. The first step is to estimate total-body water (TBW), typically estimated as 50% of the body weight in women and 60% in men. The free water deficit is then calculated as ([Na+ \u2212 140]/140) \u00d7 TBW. In this patient, the free water deficit was 4.2 L at a weight of 97.5 kg and plasma Na+ concentration of 150 meq/L. This free water deficit should be replaced slowly over 48\u201372 h to avoid increasing the plasma Na+ concentration by >10 meq/L per 24 h. A common mistake is to replace this deficit while neglecting to replace ongoing losses of free water, such that plasma Na+ concentration either fails to correct or, in fact, increases."
