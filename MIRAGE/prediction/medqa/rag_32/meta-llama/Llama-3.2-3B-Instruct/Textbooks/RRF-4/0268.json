    "question": "A 76-year-old man is brought to his physician's office by his wife due to progressively worsening hearing loss. The patient reports that he noticed a decrease in his hearing approximately 10 years ago. His wife says that he watches television at an elevated volume and appears to have trouble understanding what is being said to him, especially when there is background noise. He states that he also experiences constant ear ringing and episodes of unsteadiness. On physical examination, the outer ears are normal and otoscopic findings are unremarkable. The patient is unable to repeat the sentence said to him on whisper testing. When a vibrating tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead, it is heard equally on both ears. When the vibrating tuning fork is placed by the ear and then on the mastoid process, air conduction is greater than bone conduction. Which of the following structures is most likely impaired in this patient?",

The patient has a 10-year history of progressively worsening hearing loss, particularly in noisy environments. He also experiences tinnitus (ear ringing) and episodes of unsteadiness. The patient's wife reports difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments, which suggests a sensorineural component to the hearing loss. The patient's inability to repeat a whispered sentence on physical examination further supports this. The Weber test, which compares air conduction and bone conduction, shows equal hearing in both ears, indicating that the issue is not with the middle ear (which would affect bone conduction more significantly). The Rinne test, which compares air conduction and bone conduction, shows air conduction greater than bone conduction, which is normal and suggests that the patient does not have conductive hearing loss. With these results, we can rule out options A (tympanic membrane) and B (malleus) as the most likely structures impaired, as they are involved in conductive hearing loss. The patient's symptoms and test results suggest a sensorineural component, which points to option D (cochlea) as the most likely structure impaired. The cochlea is responsible for sound processing and is a part of the inner ear, which aligns with the patient's symptoms and test results. Therefore, the most likely structure impaired in this patient is the cochlea.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

In the Weber test, the vibrating fork is applied to the forehead in the midline (or to a central incisor). A normal person hears the bone-conducted sound equally in both ears. In nerve deafness, the sound is localized to the normal ear for the reasons noted previously; in conductive deafness, the sound is perceived as louder in the affected ear because interference from ambient sounds is muted on the affected side. In the Rinne test, the fork is applied to the mastoid process. At the moment the patient indicates that the sound ceases, the fork is held at the auditory meatus. In middle ear deafness, the sound cannot be heard by air conduction after bone conduction has ceased (abnormal Rinne test). In nerve deafness, the reverse may be true (normal Rinne test), but more saliently, both air and bone conduction are quantitatively decreased.

An additional test of impaired bone or air conduction is performed by placing a high-frequency tuning fork in the center of the forehead and having the patient report any asymmetry in the sound. Audiograms and other special tests of auditory and vestibular function are needed if there is any suspicion of disease of the vestibulocochlear nerve or of the cochlea or labyrinths (see Chap. 14)."

In differentiating them, the tuning-fork tests are often of value. When a vibrating fork, preferably of 512-Hz frequency, is held about 2.5 cm from the ear (test for air conduction), sound waves can be appreciated only as they are transmitted through the middle ear; they will be reduced with disease in this location. When the vibrating fork is applied to the skull (test for bone conduction), the sound waves are conveyed directly to the cochlea, without intervention of the sound-transmission apparatus of the middle ear, and will therefore not be reduced or lost in outer or middle ear disease. Normally air conduction is better than bone conduction, and the sound transmitted though the air is appreciated for about twice as long as that passing through the bone."

            "content": "Clinical examination is carried out to assess hearing and balance. Further examination involves use of an otoscope or other imaging techniques. The external ear is easily examined. The external acoustic meatus and the tympanic membrane require otoscopic examination (Fig. 8.118B). An otoscope is a device through which light can be shone and the image magnified to inspect the external acoustic meatus and the tympanic membrane. The examination begins by grasping the posterosuperior aspect of the ear and gently retracting it to straighten the external auditory meatus. The normal tympanic membrane is relatively translucent and has a gray\u2013reddish tinge. The handle of the malleus is visible near the center of the membrane. In the 5 o\u2019clock position a cone of light is always demonstrated. The middle ear is investigated by CT and MRI to visualize the malleus, incus, and stapes. The relationship of these bones to the middle ear cavity is determined and any masses identified."

            "content": "It is possible to distinguish hysterical and feigned deafness from that caused by structural disease in several ways. In the case of bilateral deafness, the distinction can be made by observing a blink (cochleo-orbicular reflex) or an alteration in skin sweating (psychogalvanic skin reflex) in response to loud sound. Unilateral hysterical deafness may be detected by an audiometer, with both ears connected, or by whispering into the bell of a stethoscope attached to the patient\u2019s ears, closing first one and then the other tube without the patient\u2019s knowledge. The elicitation of the first two waves of the brainstem auditory evoked potentials provides indisputable evidence that sounds are reaching the receptive auditory structures and that the patient should be capable of hearing sounds. A brief episode of deafness with fully preserved consciousness may rarely be caused by seizure activity in one temporal lobe (epileptic suppression of hearing)."

            "content": "The treatment of conductive hearing loss (largely due tootitis media and middle ear effusions) is discussed in Chapter 105. Treatment of sensorineural hearing impairment may bemedical or surgical. If amplification is indicated, hearing aidscan be tuned preferentially to amplify the frequency ranges inwhich the patient has decreased acuity. Educational intervention typically includes speech-language therapy and teachingAmerican Sign Language. Even with amplification, many hear-ing-impaired children show deficits in processing auditoryinformation, requiring special educational services for helpingto read and for other academic skills. Cochlear implants are surgically implantable devices that provide hearing sensation toindividuals with severe to profound hearing loss. The implantsare designed to substitute for the function of the middle ear,cochlear mechanical motion, and sensory cells, transformingsound energy into electrical energy that initiates impulses inthe auditory nerve."

            "content": "Disorders that lead to the formation of a pathologic \u201cthird window\u201d in the inner ear can be associated with conductive hearing loss. There are normally two major openings, or windows, that connect the inner ear with the middle ear and serve as conduits for transmission of sound; these are, respectively, the oval and round windows. A third window is formed where the normally hard otic bone surrounding the inner ear is eroded; dissipation of the acoustic energy at the third window is responsible for the \u201cinner ear conductive hearing loss.\u201d The superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome resulting from erosion of the otic bone over the superior circular canal can present with conductive hearing loss that mimics otosclerosis. A common symptom is vertigo evoked by loud sounds (Tullio phenomenon), by Valsalva maneuvers that change middle ear pressure, or by applying positive pressure on the tragus (the cartilage anterior to the external opening of the ear canal). Patients with this"

            "content": "Patients with mild, moderate, and severe sensorineural hearing losses are regularly rehabilitated with hearing aids of varying configuration and strength. Hearing aids have been improved to provide greater fidelity and have been miniaturized. The current generation of hearing aids can be placed entirely within the ear canal, thus reducing any stigma associated with their use. In general, the more severe the hearing impairment, the larger the hearing aid required for auditory rehabilitation. Digital hearing aids lend themselves to individual programming, and multiple and directional microphones at the ear level may be helpful in noisy surroundings. Because all hearing aids amplify noise as well as speech, the only absolute solution to the problem of noise is to place the microphone closer to the speaker than the noise source. This arrangement is not possible with a self-contained, cosmetically acceptable device. A significant limitation of rehabilitation with a hearing aid is that"
