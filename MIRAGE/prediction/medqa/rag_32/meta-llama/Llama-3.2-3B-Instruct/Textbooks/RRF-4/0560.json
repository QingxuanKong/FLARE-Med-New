The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation and is currently taking warfarin, insulin, lisinopril, and metoprolol. The patient\u2019s brother recently died from a heart attack and he has switched to an all vegetarian diet in order to improve his health. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C), blood pressure is 167/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient\u2019s physical exam is unremarkable. His laboratory values are ordered as seen below.\n\nHemoglobin: 12 g/dL\nHematocrit: 36%\nLeukocyte count: 7,550/mm^3 with normal differential\nPlatelet count: 197,000/mm^3\nINR: 1.0\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 4.3 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 25 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 99 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.1 mg/dL\nCa2+: 10.2 mg/dL\n\nWhich of the following is the best explanation for this patient\u2019s laboratory values?",

This suggests that the patient is likely taking warfarin as directed.\\n\\nThe patient's electrolyte panel shows a slightly elevated potassium level (4.3 mEq/L), which could be due to several factors. However, given the patient's history of diabetes and hypertension, it is possible that the elevated potassium level is related to the patient's renal function.\\n\\nThe patient's renal function is assessed by the creatinine level, which is 1.1 mg/dL. This value is within the normal range (0.6-1.2 mg/dL), suggesting that the patient's renal function is likely intact.\\n\\nThe patient's liver function is not directly assessed, but the INR value suggests that the patient's warfarin levels are likely within the therapeutic range.\\n\\nGiven the patient's history of diabetes, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation, the most likely explanation for the patient's laboratory values is increased renal clearance of potassium. This is because patients with diabetes and hypertension are more likely to have increased renal clearance of potassium, which can lead to elevated potassium levels.\\n\\nTherefore, the best explanation for the patient's laboratory values is C. Increased renal clearance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" } ``` The final answer is C. Increased renal clearance.",

The urine should be examined for evidence of diabetes mellitus and renal disease (including microalbuminuria) since these conditions accelerate atherosclerosis. Similarly, examination of the blood should include measurements of lipids (cholesterol\u2014total, LDL, HDL\u2014and triglycerides), glucose (hemoglobin ), creatinine, hematocrit, and, if indicated based on the physical examination, thyroid function. A chest x-ray is important as it may show the consequences of IHD, i.e., cardiac enlargement, ventricular aneurysm, or signs of heart failure. These signs can support the diagnosis of IHD and are important in assessing the degree of cardiac damage. Evidence exists that an elevated level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) (specifically, between 0 and 3 mg/dL) is an independent risk factor for IHD and may be useful"

On physical examination, the patient was alert, extubated, and thirsty. Weight was 97.5 kg. Urine output for the previous 24 h had been 3.4 L, with an IV intake of 2 L/d of D5W."

            "content": "Despite the value of invasive tests in certain circumstances, they entail some small risk to the patient, involve discomfort and substantial cost, and place a strain on medical facilities. Therefore, they should be carried out only if the results can be expected to modify the patient\u2019s management. The prevention of heart disease, especially of CAD, is one of the most important tasks of primary care health givers as well as cardiologists. Prevention begins with risk assessment, followed by attention to lifestyle, such as achieving optimal weight, physical activity, and smoking cessation, and then aggressive treatment of all abnormal risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (Chap. 417). After a complete diagnosis has been established in patients with known heart disease, a number of management options are usually available. Several examples may be used to demonstrate some of the 1441 principles of cardiovascular therapeutics: 1."

As the resuscitation proceeds, the prognosis is grave if there is evidence of widespread cell lysis, as reflected by potassium levels >10\u201312 mmol/L (10\u201312meq/L). Other findings that may preclude continuing resuscitation include a core temperature <10\u201312\u00b0C (<50\u201354\u00b0F), a pH <6.5, and evidence of intravascular thrombosis with a fibrinogen value <0.5 g/L (<50 mg/ dL). The decision to terminate resuscitation before rewarming the patient past 33\u00b0C (91\u00b0F) should be predicated on the type and severity of the precipitants of hypothermia. There are no validated prognostic indicators for recovery from hypothermia. A history of asphyxia with secondary cooling is the most important negative predictor of survival."
