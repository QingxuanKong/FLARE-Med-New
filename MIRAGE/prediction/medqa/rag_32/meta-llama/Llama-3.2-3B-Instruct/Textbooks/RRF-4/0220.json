    "question": "A 48-year-old man seeks evaluation at a clinic with a complaint of breathlessness for the past couple of weeks. He says that he finds it difficult to walk a few blocks and has to rest. He also complains of a cough for the past 3 months, which is dry and hacking in nature. The medical history is relevant for an idiopathic arrhythmia for which he takes amiodarone daily. He is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol. He denies any use of illicit drugs. The vital signs are as follows: heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.6\u00b0C (99.68\u00b0F), and blood pressure 132/70 mm Hg. The physical examination is significant for inspiratory crackles over the lung bases. An echocardiogram shows a normal ejection fraction. A chest radiograph is performed and shown below. Which of the following findings will most likely be noted on spirometry?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the information provided: 1. **Chief Complaints and History:** The patient complains of breathlessness, which has been ongoing for a couple of weeks, and difficulty walking a few blocks, necessitating rest. He also has a dry and hacking cough for the past 3 months. 2. **Medical History:** The patient has an idiopathic arrhythmia for which he takes amiodarone daily. Amiodarone is known to cause pulmonary fibrosis as a side effect, especially with long-term use. 3. **Vital Signs and Physical Examination:** The patient has a heart rate of 98/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, normal temperature, and normal blood pressure. Physical examination is significant for inspiratory crackles over the lung bases. 4. **Diagnostic Tests:** An echocardiogram shows a normal ejection fraction, indicating that the heart's pumping ability is preserved. However, this does not rule out pulmonary issues. 5. **Radiographic Findings:** Although the actual findings of the chest radiograph are not described, given the clinical context, it is likely to show evidence of pulmonary fibrosis. Given this information, let's analyze the potential choices: A. Decreased FEV1 and normal FVC - This is not the most likely outcome since the patient's symptoms and the known side effects of amiodarone suggest a more severe pulmonary issue. B. Decreased FEV1 and FVC with decreased FEV1/FVC ratio - This option is consistent with obstructive lung disease, which could be caused by pulmonary fibrosis secondary to amiodarone use. The FEV1/FVC ratio is particularly sensitive to airway obstruction, and a decreased ratio would indicate a restrictive lung process, such as pulmonary fibrosis. C. Decreased FEV1 and FVC with normal FEV1/FVC ratio - This would be more indicative of obstructive lung disease, which is less likely given the patient's symptoms and the known side effects of amiodarone. D. Increased FEV1 and FVC - This is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and the likely diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, considering the patient's symptoms, medical history, and the known side effects of amiodarone, the most likely finding on spirometry is: **\"B. Decreased FEV1 and FVC with decreased FEV1/FVC ratio\"** This is because pulmonary fibrosis, likely caused by long-term amiodarone use, would lead to a restrictive lung process, characterized by decreased lung volumes (FVC) and a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio due to impaired lung expansion and reduced lung volumes. Here is the answer in the requested format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of breathlessness, cough, and inspiratory crackles over the lung bases, combined with the patient's long-term use of amiodarone, suggest a diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis. Spirometry would most likely show decreased lung volumes (FVC) and a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio due to the restrictive lung process caused by pulmonary fibrosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Most commonly, physical examination reveals tachypnea and bibasilar end-inspiratory dry crackles, which are common in most forms of ILD associated with inflammation but are less likely to be heard in the granulomatous lung diseases. Crackles may be present in the absence of radiographic abnormalities on the chest radiograph. Scattered late inspiratory high-pitched rhonchi\u2014so-called inspiratory squeaks\u2014are heard in patients with bronchiolitis. The cardiac examination is usually normal except in the middle or late stages of the disease, when findings of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale may become evident (Chap. 304). Cyanosis and clubbing of the digits occur in some patients with advanced disease."

The physical examination in cardiogenic pulmonary edema is notable for evidence of increased intracardiac pressures (S3 gallop, elevated jugular venous pulse, peripheral edema) and rales and/or wheezes on auscultation of the chest. In contrast, the physical examination in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is dominated by the findings of the precipitating condition; pulmonary findings may be relatively normal in the early stages. The chest radiograph in cardiogenic pulmonary edema typically shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette, vascular redistribution, interstitial thickening, and perihilar alveolar infiltrates; pleural effusions are common. In noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, heart size is normal, alveolar infiltrates are distributed more uniformly throughout the lungs, and pleural effusions are uncommon."

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

            "content": "The physical examination should begin during the interview of the patient. Inability of the patient to speak in full sentences before stopping to get a deep breath suggests a condition that leads to stimulation of the controller or impairment of the ventilatory pump with reduced vital capacity. Evidence of increased work of breathing (supraclavicular retractions; use of accessory muscles of ventilation; and the tripod position, characterized by sitting with the hands braced on the knees) is indicative of increased airway resistance or stiffness of the lungs and the chest wall. When measuring the vital signs, the physician should accurately assess the respiratory rate and measure the pulsus paradoxus (Chap. 288); if the systolic pressure decreases by >10 mmHg, the presence of COPD, acute asthma, or pericardial disease should be considered. During the general examination, signs of anemia (pale conjunctivae), cyanosis, and cirrhosis (spider angiomata, gynecomastia) should be sought."

            "content": "Clinical Features Patients are aware of increasing chest tightness, wheezing, and dyspnea that are often not or poorly relieved by their usual reliever inhaler. In severe exacerbations, patients may be so breathless that they are unable to complete sentences and may become cyanotic. Examination usually shows increased ventilation, hyperinflation, and tachycardia. Pulsus paradoxus may be present, but this is rarely a useful clinical sign. There is a marked fall in spirometric values and PEF. Arterial blood gases on air show hypoxemia, and PCO2 is usually low due to hyperventilation. A normal or rising PCO2 is an indication of impending respiratory failure and requires immediate monitoring and therapy. A chest roentgenogram is not usually informative but may show pneumonia or pneumothorax."

He was recently incarcerated near Bakersfield, California and returned to Oakland about 3 months ago. He is currently experiencing one month of severe headache and double vision. He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

            "content": "Associated Symptoms Symptoms that accompany myocardial ischemia may include diaphoresis, dyspnea, nausea, fatigue, faintness, and eructations. In addition, these symptoms may exist in isolation as anginal equivalents (i.e., symptoms of myocardial ischemia other than typical angina), particularly in women and the elderly. Dyspnea may occur with multiple conditions considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain and thus is not discriminative, but the presence of dyspnea is important because it suggests a cardiopulmonary etiology. Sudden onset of significant respiratory distress should lead to consideration of pulmonary embolism and spontaneous pneumothorax. Hemoptysis may occur with pulmonary embolism, or as blood-tinged frothy sputum in severe heart failure but usually points toward a pulmonary parenchymal etiology of chest symptoms. Presentation with syncope or pre-syncope should prompt consideration of hemodynamically significant pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection as"

            "content": "Chronic severe AR may have a long latent period, and patients may remain relatively asymptomatic for as long as 10\u201315 years. However, uncomfortable awareness of the heartbeat, especially on lying down, may be an early complaint. Sinus tachycardia, during exertion or with emotion, or premature ventricular contractions may produce particularly uncomfortable palpitations as well as head pounding. These complaints may persist for many years before the development of exertional dyspnea, usually the first symptom of diminished cardiac reserve. The dyspnea is followed by orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and excessive diaphoresis. Anginal chest pain even in the absence of CAD may occur in patients with severe AR, even in younger patients. Anginal pain may develop at rest as well as during exertion. Nocturnal angina may be a particularly troublesome symptom, and it may be accompanied by marked diaphoresis. The anginal episodes can be prolonged and often do not respond satisfactorily to"

Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."
