    "question": "A 74-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus is brought to her primary care doctor by her son who is concerned about the patient's ability to manage her activities of daily living. She has been living alone since her husband passed away 2 years ago. She has remained an active member of her retirement community's wine club; however, she stopped attending the meetings 3 weeks ago. She is generally able to her maintain her house, but her house appears more disorganized over the past 2 weeks. She generally drives short distances but avoids driving long distances as she occasionally gets lost when navigating new areas. She feels like her balance is getting worse, but she has not fallen. She has noticed increased urinary urgency over the past 8 months and has had 2 episodes of incontinence. Despite these changes, she reports feeling well. She drinks 4-6 glasses of wine per day. She was started on multiple medications for worsening anxiety by her psychiatrist 1 month ago. Her BMI is 31 kg/m^2. Her temperature is 99.8\u00b0F (37.7\u00b0C), blood pressure is 115/65 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 17/min. On examination, she is oriented to person and time but not place or situation. She does not seem to recognize her doctor despite knowing him for many years. She becomes somnolent intermittently throughout the interview. She can recall 0/3 words after 5 minutes. She has a low-frequency tremor in her right arm that increases in severity with deliberate movement. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

She has been living alone since her husband passed away 2 years ago, which could contribute to feelings of loneliness and isolation.\\n\\nShe has noticed changes in her daily functioning, including disorganization of her house, difficulty navigating new areas, and increased urinary urgency and incontinence. These changes have occurred over the past 2-8 months.\\n\\nThe patient reports feeling well despite these changes and consumes 4-6 glasses of wine per day, which could be contributing to her cognitive decline.\\n\\nHer physical examination reveals signs of cognitive impairment, including disorientation (not place or situation), somnolence, and a low-frequency tremor in her right arm that increases in severity with deliberate movement. These findings suggest a possible neurodegenerative disorder.\\n\\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\\n\\nA. Alzheimer dementia: While possible, Alzheimer's typically presents with a more gradual decline in cognitive function over a longer period.\\n\\nB. Delirium: Delirium is characterized by acute onset of confusion, disorientation, and fluctuating consciousness, which doesn't seem to fit this patient's presentation.\\n\\nC. Lewy body dementia: This condition often presents with visual hallucinations, fluctuations in cognitive function, and motor symptoms like parkinsonism, which are not mentioned in the patient's history.\\n\\nD. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH): NPH is characterized by the triad of gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence, which matches this patient's symptoms.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is D. Normal pressure hydrocephalus.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"D\"}}",

One of our patients, functioning normally in every other way, carried the unshakable idea that people were sneaking into her house at night when she was away and rearranging the furniture. She functioned extremely well through her eighties but had a schizophrenic sister. Also, several physicians under our care have woven extensive delusional ideas around tenuous scientific theories; these ideas have applied to personal life events as well as physical and psychologic symptoms and in some cases have resulted in bizarre regimens of self-medication. Rarely, a patient comes to the hospital for some other medical reason and it is found that he or she has been living quietly in the community, preoccupied with a bizarre delusional system yet appearing neither depressed nor schizophrenic. Certainly one often sees delusions in depressed patients who decompensate as their depression deepens."

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

This is obvious in most cases but, as pointed out earlier, the mildest forms, particularly when some other alteration of personality is prominent, may be overlooked. Sometimes, the patient\u2019s attention can be best engaged by speaking softly or whispering rather than shouting or using a conversational amplitude of voice. A subtle disorder of orientation may be betrayed by an incorrect response regarding dates (off by more than one day of the month or day of the week), or in misnaming the hospital. The ability to retain a span of digits forward (normally 7) and backward (normally 5), spelling a word such as \u201cworld\u201d or \u201cearth\u201d forward and then backward, reciting the months of the year in their reverse order, and serial subtraction of 3s from 30 or 7s from 100 are useful bedside tests of the patient\u2019s capacity for attentiveness and sustained mental activity, though some of these presuppose that the patient is"

Consider, for example, a woman whose chief concern is that once a month, while leading a business seminar, she has a sudden, overwhelming urge to void followed by complete bladder emptying. She finds this leakage devastating and is considering quitting her job because of her acute embarrassment. On occasion, she leaks a few drops of urine during exercise, but this minor leakage does not bother her. During the evaluation, urodynamics reveal minimal stress"
