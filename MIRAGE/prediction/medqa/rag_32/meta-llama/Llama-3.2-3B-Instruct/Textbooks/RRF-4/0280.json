    "question": "A 32-year-old man arrives to his primary care physician to discuss his fear of flying. The patient reports that he has had a fear of flying since being a teenager. He went on a family vacation 15 years ago, and during the flight there was turbulence and a \u201crough landing\u201d. Since then he has avoided flying. He did not go to his cousin\u2019s wedding because it was out of the country. He also was unable to visit his grandmother for her 80th birthday. The last time his job asked him to meet a client out of state, he drove 18 hours instead of flying. Two years ago he promised his fianc\u00e9 they could fly to Florida. Upon arrival at the airport, he began to feel dizzy, lightheaded, and refused to go through security. During the clinic visit, the patient appears anxious and distressed. He recognizes that his fear is irrational. He is upset that it is affecting his relationship with his wife. Additionally, his current job may soon require employees in his sales position to fly to meet potential clients. He is embarrassed to have a conversation with his manager about his fear of flying. Which of the following is the best therapy for the patient\u2019s condition?",

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best therapy for the patient's condition, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and behavior. The patient has a well-documented fear of flying, which has been present since his teenage years. He has avoided flying due to past traumatic experiences, such as turbulence and a rough landing, and has also avoided flying for social and professional reasons. The patient recognizes that his fear is irrational and is affecting his relationship with his wife and his job. This suggests that the patient is motivated to overcome his fear and is willing to seek help. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. It is commonly used to treat anxiety disorders, including specific phobias like aerophobia (fear of flying). CBT can help the patient identify and challenge their irrational thoughts and behaviors, and learn new coping skills to manage their anxiety. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine that can be used to treat acute anxiety, but it is not a long-term solution and can be habit-forming. Fluoxetine is an SSRI antidepressant that can be used to treat anxiety disorders, but it is not specifically indicated for specific phobias. Psychodynamic psychotherapy may not be as effective for treating specific phobias, as it focuses on unconscious motivations and past experiences. Therefore, the best therapy for the patient's condition is cognitive behavioral therapy (B).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Fear or anxiety is evoked nearly every time the individual comes into contact with the feared situation (Criterion C).

The patient\u2019s temperature was normal. He explained that the episode had occurred following a birthday party at which he had participated in an ice cream\u2013eating contest. The patient reported prior episodes of a similar nature following ingestion of a significant amount of dairy products. This clinical picture is most probably due to a deficiency in the activity of: A. isomaltase. B. lactase. C. pancreatic \u03b1-amylase. D. salivary \u03b1-amylase. E. sucrase. Correct answer = B. The physical symptoms suggest a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for carbohydrate degradation. The symptoms observed following the ingestion of dairy products suggest that the patient is deficient in lactase as a result of the age-dependent reduction in expression of the enzyme."

            "content": "The essential feature of a panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and during which time four or more of 13 physical and cog- nitive symptoms occur. Eleven of these 13 symptoms are physical (e.g., palpitations, sweat- ing), while two are cognitive (i.e., fear of losing control or going crazy, fear of dying). \u201dFear of going crazy\u201d is a colloquialism often used by individuals with panic attacks and is not in- tended as a pejorative or diagnostic term. The term within minutes means that the time to peak intensity is literally only a few minutes. A panic attack can arise from either a calm state or an anxious state, and time to peak intensity should be assessed independently of any preceding anxiety. That is, the start of the panic attack is the point at which there is an abrupt increase in discomfort rather than the point at which anxiety first developed. Likewise, a panic attack can return to either an anxious state or a"

This is usually in the form of monetary compensation, which, surprisingly, is sometimes less than that which the patient could earn if he returned to work. Most such patients are actively engaged in litigation when first seen. Another interesting feature is the frequency with which the patient expresses extreme dissatisfaction with the medical care given him; he is often hostile toward the physicians and nurses. Many of these patients have already been subjected to an excessive number of hospitalizations and rather dramatic mishaps have allegedly occurred in carrying out diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The majority of these patients were previously suspected of malingering."

Eliciting the patient\u2019s concerns and provid-ing optimal communication and education can allay much of this fear and anxiety.

For example, it might help to explain that the primary goal of referral to a mental health professional is to improve sleep and reduce physiologic hyperarousal, which in turn will help with treatment of war-related chronic headaches, concentration problems, or chronic fatigue. If, however, the primary care professional conveys the message that the cause of headaches or concentration problems is anxiety or depression, and this conflicts with the patient\u2019s own viewpoint, then this could damage therapeutic rapport and in turn exacerbate the symptoms."

Despite the preservation of all essential memory functions, the patient cannot learn from experience and continues to display inappropriate behaviors without appearing to feel emotional pain, guilt, or regret when those behaviors repeatedly lead to disastrous consequences. The impairments may emerge only in real-life situations when behavior is under minimal external control and may not be apparent within the structured environment of the medical office. Testing judgment by asking patients what they would do if they detected a fire in a theater or found a stamped and addressed envelope on the road is not very informative because patients who answer these questions wisely in the office may still act very foolishly in real-life settings. The physician must therefore be prepared to make a diagnosis of frontal lobe disease based on historic information alone even when the mental state is quite intact in the office examination."

First, one observes the actions of the patient as he engages in simulated tasks as dressing, washing, shaving, and using eating utensils. Second, the patient is asked to carry out familiar symbolic acts\u2014wave goodbye, salute the flag, shake a fist as though angry, or blow a kiss. If he fails, he is asked to imitate such acts made by the examiner. Finally, he is asked to show how he would hammer a nail, brush his teeth, take a comb out of his pocket and comb his hair, or to execute a more complex act, such as lighting and smoking a cigarette or opening a bottle of soda, pouring some into a glass, and drinking it. These latter actions, involving more complex sequences, are said to be tests of ideational apraxia; the simpler and familiar acts are considered tests of ideomotor apraxia. To perform these tasks in the absence of the tool or utensil is always more demanding because the patient must mentally formulate a plan of action rather"
