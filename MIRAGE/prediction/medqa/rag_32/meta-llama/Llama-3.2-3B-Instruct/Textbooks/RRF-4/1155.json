NTM are also important causes of infections in surgical settings. The two major classes of NTM are the slow-growing and rapidly growing species; subcultures of the latter grow within 1 week. The growth characteristics of NTM have diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic implications. The rate of growth can provide useful preliminary information within a specific clinical context, in that growth within 2\u20133 weeks is much more likely to indicate an NTM than M. tuberculosis.

            "content": "The basic goals of a clinical microbiology laboratory are to establish the presence of a pathogen in a clinical sample, to identify the pathogen, and, when possible, to provide other information that can help guide clinical management and even prognosis, such as antibiotic susceptibility profiles or the presence of virulence factors. To date, clinical microbiology laboratories have largely approached these goals phenotypically by growth-based assays and biochemical testing. Bacteria, for instance, are algorithmically grouped into species by their characteristic microscopic appearance, nutrient requirements for growth, and ability to catalyze certain reactions. Antibiotic susceptibility is determined in most cases by assessing growth in the presence of antibiotic."

Specific species are identified using Gram stain and growth characteristics on specific media. The Gram stain is an important evaluation that allows rapid classification of bacteria by color. This color is related to the staining characteristics of the bacterial cell wall: gram-positive bacteria stain blue and gram-negative bacteria stain red. Bacteria are classified based upon a num-ber of additional characteristics, including morphology (cocci and bacilli), the pattern of division (single organisms, groups of organisms in pairs [diplococci], clusters [staphylococci], and chains [streptococci]), and the presence and location of spores.Gram-positive bacteria that frequently cause infections in surgical"

            "content": "All patients with fever and evidence of inflammatory disease acquired outside the hospital should have stool cultured for Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter. Salmonella and Shigella can be selected on MacConkey agar as non-lactose-fermenting (colorless) colonies or can be grown on Salmonella-Shigella agar or in selenite enrichment broth, both of which inhibit most organisms except these pathogens. Evaluation of nosocomial diarrhea should initially focus on C. difficile; stool culture for other pathogens in this setting has an extremely low yield and is not cost-effective. Toxins A and B produced by pathogenic strains of C. difficile can be detected by rapid enzyme immunoassays, latex agglutination tests, or PCR (Chap. 161). Isolation of C. jejuni requires inoculation of fresh stool onto selective growth medium and incubation at 42\u00b0C in a microaerophilic atmosphere. In many laboratories in the United States, E. coli O157:H7 is among the most common pathogens isolated from visibly"
