    "question": "A 56-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination 1 week after a temporal artery biopsy was performed to evaluate headache and blurry vision. He has a 12-year history of hypertension treated with lisinopril. Results of the testing show decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this finding?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Increased binding of calcium to calmodulin",

        "C": "Increased production of nitric oxide",
        "D": "Decreased concentration of bradykinin"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the relationship between the symptoms described and the potential effects of the medications listed in the options. The patient has a history of hypertension and has been taking lisinopril, which is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. ACE inhibitors are known to cause a decrease in the production of bradykinin, a peptide that promotes vasodilation and inhibits platelet aggregation. The patient's symptoms of headache and blurry vision could be related to decreased bradykinin levels. The key finding of decreased arginine concentrations in vascular endothelial cells suggests a link to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is affected by ACE inhibitors. Therefore, we need to find the option that is most closely related to the RAAS and bradykinin production. Option A, increased binding of calcium to calmodulin, is not directly related to the RAAS or bradykinin production. Option B, increased phosphorylation of myosin, is a process that can be affected by various signaling pathways, but it is not directly related to the RAAS or bradykinin production. Option C, increased production of nitric oxide, is actually the opposite of what would be expected with ACE inhibitor therapy, as ACE inhibitors decrease the production of nitric oxide. Option D, decreased concentration of bradykinin, is the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms, as bradykinin is a key component of the RAAS that is affected by ACE inhibitors. The patient's symptoms of headache and blurry vision are consistent with the effects of decreased bradykinin levels, which can lead to vasoconstriction and decreased blood flow to the eyes. The decreased arginine concentrations in vascular endothelial cells also support this conclusion, as arginine is a precursor to nitric oxide and bradykinin. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Decreased concentration of bradykinin.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",

In addition, acute hypertension may produce visual loss from ischemic swelling of the optic disc. Patients with acute hypertensive retinopathy should be treated by lowering the blood pressure.

In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

The patient is afebrile and normotensive but anxious, tachycardic, and markedly tachy-pneic. Auscultation of the chest reveals diffuse wheezes. The physician provisionally makes the diagnosis of bronchial asthma and administers epinephrine by intramuscular injec-tion, improving the patient\u2019s breathing over several minutes. A normal chest X-ray is subsequently obtained, and the medical history is remarkable only for mild hypertension that is being treated with propranolol. The physician instructs the patient to discontinue use of propranolol, and changes the patient\u2019s antihypertensive medication to verapamil. Why is the physician correct to discontinue propranolol? Why is verapamil a better choice for managing hypertension in this patient? What alternative treatment change might the physi-cian consider?"

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet.

She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy.

On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."
