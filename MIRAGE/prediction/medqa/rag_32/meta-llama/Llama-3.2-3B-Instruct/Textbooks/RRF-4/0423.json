    "question": "A 27-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with acute onset bloody diarrhea. The patient has had severe abdominal pain throughout her entire life with occasional episodes of bloody diarrhea. She has recently lost 7 pounds and has felt generally ill for the past 2 days. She has a past medical history of generalized seizures with her most recent one having occurred 5 days ago. One month ago, the patient was treated for impetigo. The patient admits to occasional cocaine use and binge drinking. Her temperature is 98.7\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 127/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air.

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with acute onset bloody diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, and a history of generalized seizures and occasional episodes of bloody diarrhea. The patient's laboratory values show anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and a positive guaiac test for blood in the stool. The patient's history of cocaine use and binge drinking is also noted. The patient's laboratory values also show a positive urine test for cocaine and marijuana. Given the patient's history and laboratory values, the best explanation for the patient's laboratory findings is an immune response to a streptococcal infection, which is likely causing the patient's bloody diarrhea. The patient's history of generalized seizures may be related to the patient's immune response to the infection. The patient's anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia may be related to the patient's immune response to the infection, as these are common findings in infectious diseases. The positive guaiac test for blood in the stool further supports the diagnosis of a bacterial infection, which is consistent with a streptococcal infection. The patient's history of cocaine use and binge drinking may also contribute to the patient's immune suppression, making the patient more susceptible to infection. The other options are not supported by the patient's history and laboratory values. Alcohol-induced liver injury (A) is not supported by the patient's laboratory values, which do not show evidence of liver injury. Intestinal IgA deficiency (C) is not supported by the patient's history, as there is no indication of a primary immunodeficiency. Protein deposition (D) is not supported by the patient's laboratory values, which do not show evidence of proteinuria or kidney damage.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Patients also have associated nausea, emesis, fever, tachycardia, and abnormal findings on abdominal examination. Laboratory studies may reveal leukocytosis, hypocalcemia, and hyperglycemia.

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

As such, the diagnostic evaluation must be rationally directed by a careful history, including medications, and physical examination (Fig. 55-3A). When this strategy is unrevealing, simple triage tests are often warranted to direct the choice of more complex investigations (Fig. 55-3B). The history, physical examination (Table 55-4), and routine blood studies should attempt to characterize the mechanism of diarrhea, identify diagnostically helpful associations, and assess the patient\u2019s fluid/electrolyte and nutritional status. Patients should be questioned about the onset, duration, pattern, aggravating (especially diet) and relieving factors, and stool characteristics of their diarrhea.

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."
