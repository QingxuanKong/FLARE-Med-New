The reticulocyte count is also low at 0.2%, which suggests a possible issue with erythropoiesis. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is elevated at 90 fL, which indicates macrocytic anemia. Given the patient's pregnancy status, it is essential to investigate the cause of the anemia to ensure the well-being of both the mother and the fetus. The patient is taking folic acid, iron, and vitamin D supplementation, which are essential for fetal development and erythropoiesis. However, the patient's anemia persists, suggesting a possible underlying issue. The options provided include serum iron level, serum B12 level, and transferrin. Serum iron level (A) may not be directly related to the patient's anemia, as it is more relevant to iron deficiency anemia. Serum B12 level (B) is a crucial test, as macrocytic anemia can be caused by vitamin B12 deficiency, which is a common cause of anemia during pregnancy. Transferrin (C) is not a relevant test for this patient, as it is more related to iron metabolism. Therefore, the most appropriate test to investigate the cause of the patient's laboratory findings is serum B12 level.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

During pregnancy, requirements are increased, and 400 \ufffdg/ d is recommended. he earliest biochemical evidence is low plasma folic acid concentrations (Appendix, p. 1255). Early morphological changes usually include neutrophils that are hypersegmented and newly formed erythrocytes that are macrocytic. With preexisting iron deiciency, macrocytic erythrocytes cannot be detected by measurement of the mean corpuscular volume. Careful examination of a peripheral blood smear, however, usually demonstrates some macrocytes. As the anemia becomes more intense, peripheral nucleated erythrocytes appear, and bone marrow examination discloses megaloblastic erythropoiesis. Anemia may then become severe, and thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, or both may develop. he fetus and placenta extract folate from maternal circulation so efectively that the fetus is not anemic despite severe maternal anemia."

Beyond a few standard screening tests, laboratory evaluation should be guided by the history and physical examination; extensive testing is more likely to lead to false-positive results that require explanation and unnecessary investigation and should be avoided in lieu of frequent clinical follow-up. A reasonable approach to screening includes a complete blood count with differential (to screen for anemia, infection, and malignancy), electrolytes (including sodium, potassium, and calcium), glucose, renal function, liver function, and thyroid function. Testing for HIV and adrenal function can also be considered. Published guidelines defining chronic fatigue syndrome also recommend an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) as part of the evaluation for mimics, but unless the value is very high, such nonspecific testing in the absence of other features is unlikely to clarify the situation."

            "content": "In addition to a thorough history, a systematic physical examination is warranted to exclude disorders causing fatigue (e.g., endocrine disorders, neoplasms, heart failure). The heart rate of CFS patients is often slightly above normal. Laboratory tests serve primarily to exclude other diagnoses; no test can diagnose CFS. The following laboratory screen usually suffices: complete blood count; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; C-reactive protein; serum creatinine, electrolytes, calcium, and iron; blood glucose; creatine kinase; liver function tests; thyroid-stimulating hormone; anti-gliadin antibodies; and urinalysis. Serology for viral or bacterial infections usually is not helpful. No specific abnormalities have been identified on MRI or CT scans. The decrease in gray matter volume observed at a population level by MRI is not useful for diagnosis in the individual patient. Extensive, unfocused, and expensive testing in a search for the \u201chidden\u201d cause of the fatigue is not productive."

This provides an estimate of the reticulocyte count corrected for anemia. To convert the corrected reticulocyte count to an index of marrow production, a further correction is required, depending on whether some of the reticulocytes in circulation have been released from the marrow pre maturely. For this second correction, the peripheral blood smear is examined to see if there are polychromatophilic macrocytes present. These cells, representing prematurely released reticulocytes, are referred to as \u201cshift\u201d cells, and the relationship between the degree of shift and the necessary shift correction factor is shown in"

In some patients, there is an enlarged spleen, polycythemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or myelosclerosis. In several of our patients, no explanation of the thrombocytosis was found. They presented with recurrent cerebral and systemic thrombotic episodes, often of minor degree and transient. Cytapheresis, to reduce the platelets, and antiplatelet drugs (hydroxyurea anagrelide) to suppress megakaryocyte formation, are helpful in ameliorating the neurologic symptoms. In one of the cases we followed, several small lesions, presumably infarctions, were situated in the white matter and simulated multiple sclerosis. Another patient with essential thrombocytosis developed dramatic new migraine with aura when her platelet counts exceeded 1,000,000/mm3, a phenomenon commented on in the literature."

The stimulated erythropoiesis is reflected in the blood smear by the appearance of increased numbers of polychromatophilic macrocytes. A marrow examination is rarely indicated if the reticulocyte production index is increased appropriately. The red cell indices are typically normocytic or slightly macrocytic, reflecting the increased number of reticulocytes. Acute blood loss is not associated with an increased reticulocyte production index because of the time required to increase EPO production and, subsequently, marrow proliferation. Subacute blood loss may be associated with modest reticulocytosis. Anemia from chronic blood loss presents more often as iron deficiency than with the picture of increased red cell production."

The risk of bleeding correlates imperfectly with the platelet count. Children with platelet counts greater than 80,000/mm3 are able to withstand all but the most extreme hemostatic challenges, such as surgery or major trauma. Children with platelet counts less than 20,000/mm3 are at risk for spontaneous bleeding. These generalizations are modified by factors such as the age of the platelets (young, large platelets usually function better than old ones) and the presence of inhibitors of platelet function, such as antibodies, drugs (especially aspirin), fibrin degradation products, and toxins formed in the presence of hepatic or renal disease. The size of platelets is routinely measured as the mean platelet volume (MPV). The etiology of thrombocytopenia (Fig. 151-4) may be organized into three mechanisms: 1. 2. 3."

In general, if the EPO and erythroid marrow responses to moderate anemia [hemoglobin <100 g/L (10 g/dL)] are intact, the red cell production rate increases to two to three times normal within 10 days following the onset of anemia. In the face of established anemia, a reticulocyte response less than two to three times normal indicates an inadequate marrow response. To use the reticulocyte count to estimate marrow response, two corrections are necessary. The first correction adjusts the reticulocyte count based on the reduced number of circulating red cells. With anemia, the percentage of reticulocytes may be increased while the absolute number is unchanged. To correct for this effect, the reticulocyte percentage is multiplied by the ratio of the patient\u2019s hemoglobin or hematocrit to the expected hemoglobin/hematocrit"

One danger is that a symptomatic woman may categorically be considered to be sufering from a \"sickle-cell crisis.\" As a result, serious obstetrical or medical problems that cause pain, anemia, or both may be overlooked. Examples are ectopic pregnancy, placental abruption, pyelonephritis, or appendicitis. Thus, a diagnosis of sickle-cell crisis should be applied"

Usually the increase will be reflected in both the percentage of reticulocytes (the more commonly quoted figure) and the absolute reticulocyte count (the more definitive parameter). The increased number of reticulocytes is associated with an increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in the blood count. On the blood smear, this is reflected in the presence of macrocytes; there is also polychromasia, and sometimes one sees nucleated red cells. In most cases, a bone marrow aspirate is not necessary in the diagnostic workup; if it is done, it will show erythroid hyperplasia. In practice, once an HA is suspected, specific tests will usually be required for a definitive diagnosis of a specific type of HA."
