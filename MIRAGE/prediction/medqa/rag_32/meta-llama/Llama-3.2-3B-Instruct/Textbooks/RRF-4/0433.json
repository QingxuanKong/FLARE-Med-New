    "question": "An 18-year-old woman makes an appointment with a gynecologist for her first gynecologic examination. She did not disclose her past medical history, but her sexual debut occurred with her boyfriend 3 weeks ago. She is now complaining of a yellow-green, diffuse, malodorous vaginal discharge that she noticed 1 week ago for the first time. She also reported mild pelvic and abdominal pain. cervical motion tenderness was noted during the pelvic examination. The gynecologist also noticed a pink and inflamed nulliparous cervix with a preponderance of small red punctate spots. There was a frothy white discharge with a malodorous odor in the vaginal vault. A wet mount was prepared for a light microscopic examination, which revealed numerous squamous cells and motile organisms. The gynecologist concluded that this was a sexually-transmitted infection. What is the causative organism?",

The gynecologist noticed a pink and inflamed nulliparous cervix with small red punctate spots, and a frothy white discharge with a malodorous odor in the vaginal vault.\\n\\nThe wet mount examination revealed numerous squamous cells and motile organisms.

Ureaplasma urealyticum: This is a type of bacteria that can cause urethritis, but it is not typically associated with the symptoms and findings described in this case.\\n\\nC. Trichomonas vaginalis: This is a flagellated protozoan that causes trichomoniasis, a sexually-transmitted infection characterized by a yellow-green, diffuse, malodorous vaginal discharge, accompanied by mild pelvic and abdominal pain and cervical motion tenderness. The presence of motile organisms in the wet mount and the description of the discharge match this condition.\\n\\nD.

            "content": "The patient gave no history of these disorders. Upon further questioning, however, the patient revealed that her last menstrual period was 6 weeks before this examination. The senior physician realized that a potential cause of the abdominal pain was a pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). The patient was rushed for an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed no fetus or sac in the uterus. She was also noted to have a positive pregnancy test. The patient underwent surgery and was found to have a ruptured fallopian tube caused by an ectopic pregnancy. Whenever a patient has apparent pelvic pain, it is important to consider the gender-related anatomical differences. Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age."

It is often helpful to ask the patient if the gynecologic examination was difficult for her in the past; this may be true for women with a history of sexual abuse. For women who are undergoing their first gynecologic examination, it may be useful to ask what they have heard about the gynecologic examination or to state: \u201cMost women are nervous before their first exam, but afterward, most describe it as \u2018uncomfortable.\u2019\u201d"

The pH of vaginal fluid\u2014normally <4.7\u2014usually rises to \u22655. In women with typical symptoms and signs of trichomoniasis, microscopic examination of vaginal discharge mixed with saline reveals motile trichomonads in most culture-positive cases. However, saline microscopy probably detects only one-half of all cases, and, especially in the absence of symptoms or signs, culture or NAAT is usually required for detection of the organism. NAAT for T. vaginalis is as sensitive as or more sensitive than culture, and NAAT of urine has disclosed surprisingly high prevalences of this pathogen among men at several STD clinics in the United"

            "content": "Speculum examination shows evidence of MPC (yellow endocervical discharge, easily induced endocervical bleeding) in the majority of women with gonococcal or chlamydial PID. Cervical motion tenderness is produced by stretching of the adnexal attachments on the side toward which the cervix is pushed. Bimanual examination reveals uterine fundal tenderness due to endometritis and abnormal adnexal tenderness due to salpingitis that is usually, but not necessarily, bilateral. Adnexal swelling is palpable in about one-half of women with acute salpingitis, but evaluation of the adnexae in a patient with marked tenderness is not reliable. The initial temperature is >38\u00b0C in only about one-third of patients with acute salpingitis. Laboratory findings include elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in 75% of patients with acute salpingitis and elevation of the peripheral white blood cell count in up to 60%."

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"
