    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to analyze the given clinical presentation and investigation findings to determine the most likely cause of the patient's condition. The patient presents with increased tiredness and lethargy, low hemoglobin level (8.6 gm/dL), elevated serum creatinine (4.6 mg/dL), and 3+ proteinuria. The serum is negative for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), but positive for C3 nephritic factor. The urinalysis shows hypercellular glomerulus with electron dense deposits along the glomerular basement membrane on renal biopsy. Based on these findings, we can rule out some options. First, minimal change disease (C) is unlikely because it typically presents with nephrotic-range proteinuria and normal renal function, which is not the case here. RPGN (B) is also unlikely because it is characterized by rapid deterioration of renal function, which is not evident in this patient's presentation. Membranous glomerulonephritis (D) is possible, but the presence of C3 nephritic factor and the specific findings on biopsy make it less likely. The key finding of C3 nephritic factor positivity and the presence of electron-dense deposits along the glomerular basement membrane on biopsy is highly suggestive of MPGN (A). MPGN is a disease characterized by the deposition of immune complexes in the glomeruli, which can lead to inflammation and renal damage. The presence of C3 nephritic factor is a hallmark of MPGN, as it stabilizes the alternative complement pathway, leading to overactivation of complement and subsequent inflammation. Furthermore, the clinical presentation of fatigue, anemia, and proteinuria is consistent with MPGN. The biopsy findings of hypercellular glomerulus with electron-dense deposits along the glomerular basement membrane also support this diagnosis. Therefore, based on the analysis of the clinical presentation and investigation findings, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

In this Mallory trichome-stained specimen obtained from a kidney biopsy, the collagen molecules in the mesangial matrix and glomerular capillaries are stained dark blue. The bright red stain within the renal corpuscle represents fibrin, which leaked out of the glomerular capillary loops into the urinary space. A cellular crescent (outlined in dashed line) is formed by deposition of fibrin infiltrated by macrophages and proliferated parietal cells of the Bowman capsule. The light blue color surrounding the glomerulus is reflective of edematous reaction containing cells mediating inflammatory reactions. Note the basal lamina of a parietal layer of the Bowman capsule. 320. b. This immunofluorescence image of the renal corpuscle shows the glomerular basement membrane labeled with antibodies directed against human IgG and visualized with secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescent dye.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)andC-reactiveprotein (CRP) are often,but notalways, elevated. Mildanemia maybe present. Patients with severe disease may show an elevatedalkalinephosphataselevel.ElevatedserumIgAlevelsarecommon. Rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), and antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are largely absent unless caused by a coexistentdisease, although ANAs may appear with anti-TNF therapy. Circulating levels of CD8+ T cells tend to be low, and serum matrix metalloproteinase 3 levels correlate with disease activity. Synovial fluid from peripheral joints in AS is nonspecifically inflammatory. In cases with restriction of chest wall motion, decreased vital capacity and increased functional residual capacity are common, but airflow is normal and ventilatory function is usually well maintained."

FIGuRE 340-2 Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) in a patient who presented with acute iritis, low-grade fever, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 103, pyuria and cellular casts on urinalysis, and a newly elevated serum creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL. Both the iritis and AIN improved after intravenous methylprednisolone. This PAS-stained renal biopsy shows a mononuclear cell interstitial infiltrate (asterisks) and edema separating the tubules (T) and a normal glomerulus (G). Some of the tubules contain cellular debris and infiltrating inflammatory cells. The findings in this biopsy are indistinguishable from those that would be seen in a case of drug-induced AIN.
