    "question": "A 22-year-old woman comes to the physician because of yellow vaginal discharge, pruritus, and pain with urination for the past 6 days. Three weeks ago, she had an episode of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis that was treated with a 10-day course of amoxicillin. She has been sexually active with multiple male partners over the past year and uses condoms inconsistently; she has been taking an oral contraceptive for the past 2 years. She has no previous history of serious illness or sexually transmitted diseases. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 75/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 122/82 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows erythema of the vulva and vagina and foul-smelling, frothy, yellow-green vaginal discharge. The pH of the discharge is 5.8. Bimanual examination is unremarkable. Further evaluation of this patient's vaginal discharge is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

She has a history of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis treated with amoxicillin 3 weeks ago, and she is sexually active with multiple male partners. The physical examination reveals erythema of the vulva and vagina and foul-smelling, frothy, yellow-green vaginal discharge with a pH of 5.8.\\n\\nThe patient's symptoms and signs are suggestive of trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted infection caused by the flagellated protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. The yellow-green vaginal discharge and foul odor are characteristic of this infection. The positive pH of the discharge (5.8) also supports this diagnosis, as the normal vaginal pH is typically less than 4.7.\\n\\nThe whiff test is not explicitly mentioned as a diagnostic tool in the provided documents, but it is often used to detect the presence of a fishy odor in vaginal discharge, which is consistent with bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis. However, the primary diagnostic clue in this case is the presence of flagellated protozoa in the vaginal discharge, which is a hallmark of trichomoniasis.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely finding in further evaluation of this patient's vaginal discharge is flagellated protozoa.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"D\"}",

            "content": "Speculum examination shows evidence of MPC (yellow endocervical discharge, easily induced endocervical bleeding) in the majority of women with gonococcal or chlamydial PID. Cervical motion tenderness is produced by stretching of the adnexal attachments on the side toward which the cervix is pushed. Bimanual examination reveals uterine fundal tenderness due to endometritis and abnormal adnexal tenderness due to salpingitis that is usually, but not necessarily, bilateral. Adnexal swelling is palpable in about one-half of women with acute salpingitis, but evaluation of the adnexae in a patient with marked tenderness is not reliable. The initial temperature is >38\u00b0C in only about one-third of patients with acute salpingitis. Laboratory findings include elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in 75% of patients with acute salpingitis and elevation of the peripheral white blood cell count in up to 60%."

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

Treatment is etiology specifc (see Table 2.12-7). Infammation of the uterine cervix. Because the female genital tract is contiguous from the vulva to the fallopian tubes, there is some overlap between vulvovaginitis and cervicitis.

The cause of in\ufb02ammatory vaginitis is unknown, but Gram stain findings reveal a relative absence of normal long gram-positive bacilli (lactobacilli) and their replacement with gram-positive cocci, usually streptococci. Women with this disorder have a purulent vaginal discharge, vulvovaginal burning or irritation, and dyspareunia. A less frequent symptom is vulvar pruritus. Vaginal erythema is present, and there may be an associated vulvar erythema, vulvovaginal ecchymotic spots, and colpitis macularis. The pH of the vaginal secretions is uniformly higher than 4.5 in these patients."

A large variety of organisms have been implicated, including bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Many are normal commensals that become pathogenic only in the setting of diabetes, systemic antibiotic therapy (which causes disruption of normal microbial flora), immunodeficiency, pregnancy, or recent abortion. In adults, primary gonorrheal infection of the vagina is uncommon. The other organisms worthy of mention, because they are frequent offenders, are Candida albicans and Trichomonas vaginalis. Candidal (monilial) vaginitis is characterized by a curdy white discharge. This organism is part of the normal vaginal flora in about 5% of women, so the appearance of symptomatic infection almost always involves one of the predisposing influences listed above or superinfection by a new, more aggressive strain. T. vaginalis is sexually"
