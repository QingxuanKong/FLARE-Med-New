The patient presents with shortness of breath with moderate exertion and a slightly productive cough. This is a common presentation for several respiratory conditions, including asthma, COPD, and pulmonary fibrosis. 2. The patient has a medical history of 25 years of heavy smoking, which is a significant risk factor for COPD and lung cancer. 3. The physical exam shows increased resonance to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and crackles at the lung base, which are indicative of hyperinflation and possible air trapping, characteristic of COPD. 4. The chest radiography shows signs of pulmonary hyperinflation, further supporting the diagnosis of COPD. 5. The spirometry results show a reduced FEV1 (48%) and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 56%, indicating airflow limitation. The FVC is normal (85%), which is consistent with COPD. 6. Considering the patient's smoking history, symptoms, physical exam, and spirometry results, the most likely diagnosis is COPD. 7. The other options can be ruled out: - Asthma (A) typically presents with variable and episodic symptoms, and the FEV1/FVC ratio is usually >70%. - Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (B) is a rare condition characterized by cystic lung disease, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms and radiography. - Heart failure (D) is not supported by the patient's physical exam and spirometry results, which do not indicate left-sided heart failure or significant pulmonary congestion. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

This study is an effort-dependent test used to assess for obstructive pathophysiology as seen in asthma, COPD, and bronchiectasis. A diminished-forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) (often defined as <70% of the predicted value) is diagnostic of obstruction. In addition to measuring FEV1 and FVC, the clinician should examine the flow-volume loop (which is effort-independent). A plateau of the inspiratory and expiratory curves suggests large-airway obstruction in extrathoracic and intrathoracic locations, respectively."

Key parameters obtained from spirometry include the volume of air exhaled within the first second of the forced expiratory maneuver (FEV1) and the total volume of air exhaled during the entire spirometric maneuver (forced vital capacity [FVC]). Patients with airflow obstruction related to COPD have a chronically reduced ratio of FEV1/FVC. In contrast to asthma, the reduced FEV1 in COPD seldom shows large responses to inhaled bronchodilators, although improvements up to 15% are common.

Under normal conditions, maximal expiratory flow falls with lung volume (Fig. 306e-4), primarily because of the dependence of lung recoil pressure on lung volume (Fig. 306e-1). In pulmonary fibrosis, lung recoil pressure is increased at any lung volume, and thus the maximal expiratory flow is elevated when considered in relation to lung volume.

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

            "content": "The findings are usually not specific. Most commonly, physical examination reveals tachypnea and bibasilar end-inspiratory dry crackles, which are common in most forms of ILD associated with inflammation but are less likely to be heard in the granulomatous lung diseases. Crackles may be present in the absence of radiographic abnormalities on the chest radiograph. Scattered late inspiratory high-pitched rhonchi\u2014so-called inspiratory squeaks\u2014are heard in patients with bronchiolitis. The cardiac examination is usually normal except in the middle or late stages of the disease, when findings of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale may become evident (Chap. 304). Cyanosis and clubbing of the digits occur in some patients with advanced disease."

In contrast, clinically significant ILD develops in 16\u201343%; the frequency varies depending on the detection method used. Risk factors include male gender, African-American race, diffuse skin involvement, severe gastroesophageal reflux, and the presence of topoisomerase I autoantibodies, as well as a low forced vital capacity (FVC) or single-breath diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco) at initial presentation. In these patients, the most rapid progression in lung disease occurs early in FIGUrE 382-7 Calcinosis cutis.

            "content": "Diffuse pulmonary diseases can be classified into two categories: (1) obstructive (airway) disease, characterized by an increase in resistance to air flow caused by partial or complete obstruction at any level; and (2) restrictive disease, characterized by reduced expansion of lung parenchyma and decreased total lung capacity. The major diffuse obstructive disorders are emphysema, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and asthma. In patients with these diseases, forced vital capacity (FVC) is either normal or slightly decreased, while the expiratory flow rate, usually measured as the forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1), is significantly decreased. Thus, the ratio of FEV to FVC is characteristically decreased. Expiratory obstruction may result from anatomic airway narrowing, classically observed in asthma, or from loss of elastic recoil, characteristic of emphysema."

Inquire about a history of COPD, interstitial lung disease, heart disease, sickle cell anemia, emphysema, and pulmonary emboli. Exam reveals a loud, palpable S2 (often split), a systolic ejection murmur, an S4, or a parasternal heave. CXR shows enlargement of central pulmonary arteries. ECG demonstrates RVH. Echocardiogram and right heart catheterization may show signs of right ventricular overload and may aid in the diagnosis of the underlying cause. Supplemental O2, anticoagulation, vasodilators, and diuretics if symptoms of right-sided CHF are present. Treat underlying causes of 2\u00b0 pulmonary hypertension.

He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?"

In patients with underlying chronic bronchitis or chronic asthmatic bronchitis, cough and wheezing may be the initial complaints. Weight loss is common and may be severe enough to suggest an occult malignant tumor. Pulmonary function tests reveal reduced FEV1 with normal or near-normal FVC. Hence, the FEV1 to FVC ratio is reduced."
