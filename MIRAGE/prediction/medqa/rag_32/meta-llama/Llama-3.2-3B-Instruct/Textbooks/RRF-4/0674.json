    "question": "An experimental new drug in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 was found to increase the levels of incretins by preventing their degradation at the endothelium.

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to understand the mechanism of action of the new experimental drug and the drugs listed in the options. The new experimental drug prevents the degradation of incretins at the endothelium, which increases glucose-dependent insulin production. This is similar to the mechanism of DPP-4 inhibitors, which also prevent the degradation of incretins (GLP-1 and GIP) at the endothelium. DPP-4 inhibitors are used to treat type 2 diabetes and work by inhibiting the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), which breaks down GLP-1 and GIP. By inhibiting DPP-4, these drugs increase the levels of active incretins in the body, which in turn stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Therefore, the mechanism of action of the new experimental drug is most similar to that of DPP-4 inhibitors. The other options do not have a similar mechanism of action. Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, but it is not the only one. Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea, which stimulates insulin secretion by closing ATP-dependent potassium channels in the pancreatic beta cells. Canagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor, which increases glucose excretion in the urine. Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione, which increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. \", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

            "content": "An oral glucose load provokes a higher insulin response compared with an equivalent dose of glucose given intravenously. This is because the oral glucose causes a release of gut hormones (\u201cincretins\u201d), principally GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), that amplify the glucose-induced insulin secretion. When GLP-1 is infused in patients with type 2 diabetes, it stimulates insulin release and lowers glucose levels. The GLP-1 effect is glucose dependent in that the insulin release is more pronounced when glucose levels are elevated but less so when glucose levels are normal. For this reason, GLP-1 has a lower risk for hypoglycemia than the sulfonylureas. In addition to its insulin stimulatory effect, GLP-1 has a number of other biologic effects. It suppresses glucagon secretion, delays gastric emptying, and reduces apoptosis of human islets in culture. In animals, GLP-1 inhibits feeding by a central nervous system mechanism.

For example, a single dose of long-acting insulin at bedtime is often effective in combination with metformin. In contrast, insulin secretagogues have little utility once insulin therapy is started. Experience using incretin therapies and insulin is limited. As endogenous insulin production falls further, multiple injections of long-acting and short-acting insulin regimens are necessary to control postprandial glucose excursions.

Oral intake of food leads to secretion of multiple hormones, notably the incretins produced by cells in the intestines. These hormones stimulate insulin secretion from beta cells, and also reduce glucagon secretion and delay gastric emptying, which promotes satiety. The incretin effect is significantly blunted in patients with type 2 diabetes, and restoring incretin function can lead to improved glycemic control and loss of weight (through restoration of satiety).

Beta cell function actually increases early in the disease process in most patients with type 2 diabetes, mainly as a compensatory measure to counter insulin resistance and maintain euglycemia. Eventually, however, beta cells are unable to adapt to the long-term demands of peripheral insulin resistance, and the hyperinsulinemic state gives way to a state of relative insulin deficiency. Several mechanisms have been implicated in causing beta cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes, including the following: Abnormal incretin effect, leading to reduced secretion of hormones that promote insulin release (discussed earlier) Amyloid replacement of islets, present in more than 90% of diabetic islets (see ). It is unclear whether the amyloid is a cause or effect of beta cell \u201cburnout.\u201d"

            "content": "Ingested glucose has a greater effect on insulin secretion than injected glucose. This phenomenon, called the incretin effect, is due to stimulation by glucose of incretin hormones from the gastrointestinal tract. One clinically relevant incretin hormone is glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which is released by L cells of the ileum in response to glucose in the ileal lumen ( Fig. 39.9 ). As a hormone, GLP-1 enters the circulation and ultimately binds to the Gs-coupled GLP1 receptor (GLP1R) on beta cells. This GLP1R/Gs/adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway amplifies the intracellular effects of Ca++ on insulin secretion. GLP-1 is rapidly degraded in the circulation by dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4)."

Although each class of oral glucose-lowering agents has advantages and disadvantages (Table 418-5), certain generalizations apply: (1) insulin secretagogues, biguanides, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and thiazolidinediones improve glycemic control to a similar degree (1\u20132% reduction in HbA1c) and are more effective than \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, DPP-IV inhibitors, and SLGT2 inhibitors; (2) assuming a similar degree of glycemic improvement, no clinical advantage to one class of drugs has been demonstrated; any therapy that improves glycemic control is likely beneficial; (3) insulin secretagogues, GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-IV inhibitors, \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, and SLGT2 inhibitors begin to lower the plasma glucose immediately, whereas the glucose-lowering effects of the biguanides and"

In the resting cell with normal (low) ATP levels, potassium diffuses down its concentration gradient through ATP-gated potassium channels, maintaining the intracellular potential at a fully polarized, negative level. Insulin release is minimal. If glucose concentration rises, ATP production increases, potassium channels close, and depolarization of the cell results. As in muscle and nerve, voltage-gated calcium channels open in response to depolarization, allowing more calcium to enter the cell. Increased intracellular calcium results in increased insulin secretion. Insulin secretagogues close the ATP-dependent potassium channel, thereby depolarizing the membrane and causing increased insulin release by the same mechanism."

The DCCT study, in addition, introduced the concept of glycemic memory, which comprises the long-term benefits of any significant period of glycemic control. During a 6-year follow-up period, both the intensively and conventionally treated groups had similar levels of glycemic control, and both had progression of carotid intimal-medial thickness. However, the intensively treated cohort had significantly less progression of intimal thickness. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) was a very large randomized prospective study carried out to study the effects of intensive glycemic control with several types of therapies and the effects of blood pressure control in type 2 diabetic patients. A total of 3867 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients were studied over 10 years. A significant frac-tion of these were overweight and hypertensive. Patients were given dietary treatment alone or intensive therapy with insulin,"
