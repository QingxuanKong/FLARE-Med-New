    "question": "A 45-year-old woman presents with sudden-onset dyspnea. Her past medical history is significant for varicose veins in her lower extremities, well-controlled diabetes mellitus type 2, and a 25 pack-year smoking history. The patient currently takes metformin and pioglitazone. Family history is significant for her sister who died at the age of 35 because of a pulmonary embolism. Her temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100.0\u00b0F), the pulse is 111/min, the respirations are 18/min, and the blood pressure is 130/60 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is pale and diaphoretic. Cardiac exam is significant for an S3 gallop. There is erythema and swelling over multiple varicose veins in her left leg. Ultrasound of her left leg is positive for a deep vein thrombosis. The patient is admitted, and anticoagulation is started with a vitamin K inhibitor. However, despite these interventions, she dies shortly after admission. Which of the following was the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",

Necrotizing fasciitis: There is no indication of skin or soft tissue infection in the provided information.\\n\\nC. Protein S deficiency: This is a risk factor for DVT, and the patient's family history of pulmonary embolism (her sister died at the age of 35) suggests a possible genetic component.

            "content": "Patient Presentation: BE is a 45-year-old woman who presents with concerns about sudden (paroxysmal), intense, brief episodes of headache, sweating (diaphoresis), and a racing heart (palpitations). Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

            "content": "Associated Symptoms Symptoms that accompany myocardial ischemia may include diaphoresis, dyspnea, nausea, fatigue, faintness, and eructations. In addition, these symptoms may exist in isolation as anginal equivalents (i.e., symptoms of myocardial ischemia other than typical angina), particularly in women and the elderly. Dyspnea may occur with multiple conditions considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain and thus is not discriminative, but the presence of dyspnea is important because it suggests a cardiopulmonary etiology. Sudden onset of significant respiratory distress should lead to consideration of pulmonary embolism and spontaneous pneumothorax. Hemoptysis may occur with pulmonary embolism, or as blood-tinged frothy sputum in severe heart failure but usually points toward a pulmonary parenchymal etiology of chest symptoms. Presentation with syncope or pre-syncope should prompt consideration of hemodynamically significant pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection as"

            "content": "The patient has a low ejection fraction with systolic heart failure, probably secondary to hypertension. His heart fail-ure must be treated first, followed by careful control of the hypertension. He was initially treated with a diuretic (furo-semide, 40 mg twice daily). On this therapy, he was less short of breath on exertion and could also lie flat without dyspnea. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhib-itor was added (enalapril, 20 mg twice daily), and over the next few weeks, he continued to feel better. Because of continued shortness of breath on exercise, digoxin at 0.25 mg/d was added with a further modest improvement in exercise tolerance. The blood pressure stabilized at 150/90 mm Hg, and the patient will be educated regarding the relation between his hypertension and heart failure and the need for better blood pressure control. Cautious addition of a \u03b2 blocker (metoprolol) will be considered. Blood lipids, which are currently in the normal range, will be monitored."

Her hyperlipidemia should be treated vigorously to slow progression of, and if pos-sible reverse, the coronary lesions that are present (see Chapter 35). Coronary angiography is not indicated unless symptoms become much more frequent and severe; revas-cularization may then be considered. Medical treatment of her acute episodes of angina should include sublingual tab-lets or sublingual nitroglycerin spray 0.4\u20130.6 mg. Relief of discomfort within 2\u20134 minutes can be expected. To prevent episodes of angina, a \u03b2blocker such as metoprolol should be tried first. If contraindications to the use of a \u03b2 blocker are present, a mediumto long-acting calcium channel blocker such as verapamil, diltiazem, or amlodipine is likely to be effective. Because of this patient\u2019s family history, an antiplatelet drug such as low-dose aspirin is indicated. Care-ful follow-up is mandatory with repeat lipid panels, repeat"

These anastomose with the superior, superficial, and deep epigastric venous systems to drain into the internal thoracic veins, which in turn drain into the brachiocephalic veins and the superior vena cava. After the initial inferior vena cava thrombosis, the veins of the anterior abdominal wall and other collateral pathways hypertrophy to accommodate the increase in blood flow. A 52-year-old woman visited her family physician with complaints of increasing lethargy and vomiting. The physician examined her and noted that compared to previous visits she had lost significant weight. She was also jaundiced, and on examination of the abdomen a well-defined 10-cm rounded mass was palpable below the liver edge in the right upper quadrant (Fig. 4.185)."

Examination of patients experiencing stable angina is generally unremarkable. Look for carotid and peripheral bruits suggesting atherosclerosis and hypertension. Rule out pulmonary, GI, or other cardiac causes of chest pain. Angina may be diagnosed from the history alone, but significant ST-segment changes on exercise stress test with ECG monitoring is diagnostic of CAD. Women and diabetics classically experience \u201csilent\u201d ischemic events and present \u201catypically\u201d; for this reason, it is necessary to maintain a high index of suspicion in this patient population. Treat acute symptoms with ASA, O2 and/or IV nitroglycerin, and IV morphine, and consider IV \u03b2-blockers. The efficacy of nondihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem, verapamil) and ACEIs has also been validated."

However, the alert physician may recognize the patient at risk for these complications long before they occur and often can take measures to prevent their occurrence. For example, a patient with acute myocardial infarction will often have had risk factors for athero-sclerosis for many years. Had these risk factors been recognized, their elimination or reduction might have delayed or even prevented the infarction. Similarly, a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may have had a heart murmur for years and a family history of this disor-der. These findings could have led to an echocardiographic examina-tion, recognition of the condition, and appropriate therapy long before the occurrence of a serious acute manifestation. Patients with valvular heart disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomy-opathy, by contrast, may have a prolonged course of gradually increas-ing dyspnea and other manifestations of chronic heart failure that is punctuated by episodes of acute deterioration"
