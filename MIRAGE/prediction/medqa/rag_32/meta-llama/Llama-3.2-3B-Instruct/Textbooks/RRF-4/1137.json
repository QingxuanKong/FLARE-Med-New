These symptoms and signs suggest a diagnosis of Whipple's disease, a rare, systemic bacterial infection caused by Tropheryma whipplei. The patient's personal history of allergic rhinitis may be related to the presence of celiac disease, which is often associated with Whipple's disease. The characteristic skin lesions, known as \"butterfly lesions,\" are a common finding in patients with Whipple's disease. Therefore, the most appropriate approach for the management of this patient is a gluten-free diet, which is the only treatment for Whipple's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The resulting Rome III criteria are: recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort for at least 3 days per month for 3 months associated with two or more of the following: Improvement with defecation Onset associated with a change in frequency of stool Onset associated with a change in the appearance of the stool IBS should be a diagnosis of exclusion with consideration initially given to other causes for the dominant symptom. If that is diarrhea, considerations of lactose intolerance, infectious etiology, malabsorption, or celiac disease should be entertained. Symptoms that result in weight loss, rectal bleeding, anemia, or that are noctural or progressive could indicate something other than IBS unless proven otherwise."

Sigmoidoscopy is an appropriate initial test in most patients. Conversely, patients with symptoms and findings suggesting small-bowel disease, such as large-volume watery stools, substantial weight loss, and malabsorption of iron, calcium, or fat, may undergo upper endoscopy with duodenal aspirates for assessment of bacterial overgrowth and biopsies for assessment of mucosal diseases, such as celiac sprue."

Affected individuals will often have circulating eosinophilia with clinical manifestation of systemic allergy. Involvement may 1932 range from isolated gastric disease to diffuse eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Antral involvement predominates, with prominent edematous folds being observed on endoscopy. These prominent antral folds can lead to outlet obstruction. Patients can present with epigastric discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Treatment with glucocorticoids has been successful. Several systemic disorders may be associated with granulomatous gastritis. Gastric involvement has been observed in Crohn\u2019s disease. Involvement may range from granulomatous infiltrates noted only on gastric biopsies to frank ulceration and stricture formation. Gastric Crohn\u2019s disease usually occurs in the presence of small-intestinal disease. Several rare"

Recurrent urticaria, often 1415 involving the buttocks and wrists, is the most common cutaneous manifestation. Migrating larvae can elicit a pathognomonic serpiginous eruption, larva currens (\u201crunning larva\u201d). This pruritic, raised, erythematous lesion advances as rapidly as 10 cm/h along the course of larval migration. Adult parasites burrow into the duodenojejunal mucosa and can cause abdominal (usually midepigastric) pain, which resembles peptic ulcer pain except that it is aggravated by food ingestion. Nausea, diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding, mild chronic colitis, and weight loss can occur. Small-bowel obstruction may develop with early, heavy infection. Pulmonary symptoms are rare in uncomplicated strongyloidiasis. Eosinophilia is common, with levels fluctuating over time."

Primary lesions in this disorder consist of papules, papulovesicles, or urticarial plaques. Because pruritus is prominent, patients may present with excoriations and crusted papules but no observable primary lesions. Patients sometimes report that their pruritus has a distinctive burning or stinging component; the onset of such local symptoms reliably heralds the development of distinct clinical lesions 12\u201324 h later. Almost all DH patients have associated, usually subclinical, gluten-sensitive enteropathy (Chap. 349), and >90% express the HLA-B8/DRw3 and HLA-DQw2 haplotypes. DH may present at any age, including in childhood; onset in the second to fourth decades is most common. The disease is typically chronic."
