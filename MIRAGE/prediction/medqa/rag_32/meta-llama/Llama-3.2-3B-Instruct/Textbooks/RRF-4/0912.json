    "question": "A 37-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician after returning from her honeymoon in Cancun. A few days ago, she began to notice an eruption of small red bumps that cover her torso, back, and buttocks. The patient first thought she had acne, but became worried when the rash continued to itch. The patient denies other symptoms. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical exam is notable for red papules and pustules scattered across the trunk, abdomen, back, and buttocks, while sparing the limbs. Closer examination indicates inflammation of the hair follicles. Culture yields motile, gram-negative rods that are non-lactose fermenting and oxidase positive. What other finding is commonly observed in the culture of the most likely organism?",

    "predict": "To determine the most likely diagnosis and the answer to the question, we need to analyze the provided information step by step. 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with an eruption of small red bumps covering the torso, back, and buttocks, which started a few days after returning from a honeymoon in Cancun. The rash is itchy, and the patient initially thought it was acne but became worried when it continued. 2. **Physical Examination**: The physical exam reveals red papules and pustules scattered across the trunk, abdomen, back, and buttocks, while sparing the limbs. There is inflammation of the hair follicles. 3. **Culture Results**: The culture yields motile, gram-negative rods that are non-lactose fermenting and oxidase positive. 4. **Differential Diagnosis**: Based on the clinical presentation and culture results, the most likely diagnosis is folliculitis caused by *Demodex mite*, which is a common cause of folliculitis, especially in the intertriginous areas. 5. **Answer to the Question**: The question asks for another finding commonly observed in the culture of the most likely organism. *Demodex mite* is a mite that is commonly found in the hair follicles of humans. In the culture, *Demodex mite* is often observed as a small, motile, and oval-shaped organism. However, none of the options match the description of *Demodex mite*. The closest match is *B. Blue-green pigment*, which is not a characteristic of *Demodex mite*. But, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is a gram-negative rod that is oxidase positive, and it can cause folliculitis. In the culture of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, a characteristic finding is the production of blue-green pigment (pyocyanin). Therefore, the answer is: \"Blue-green pigment\" is not the best answer, but *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is the most likely organism. However, among the options, the closest match is: B. Blue-green pigment",

Thus, when lesions are distributed on elbows, knees, and scalp, the most likely possibility based solely on distribution is psoriasis or dermatitis herpetiformis (Figs. 70-7 and 70-8, respectively). The primary lesion in psoriasis is a scaly papule that soon forms erythematous plaques covered with a white scale, whereas that of dermatitis herpetiformis is an urticarial papule that quickly becomes a small vesicle. In this manner, identification of the primary lesion directs the examiner toward the proper diagnosis. Secondary changes in skin can also be quite helpful. For example, scale represents excessive epidermis, while crust is the result of a discontinuous epithelial cell layer. Palpation of skin lesions can yield insight into the character of an eruption. Thus, red papules on the lower extremities that blanch with pressure can be a manifestation of many different diseases, but hemorrhagic red papules that do not blanch with pressure indicate palpable purpura"

Lesions generally are not painful, and patients do not appear ill. Fever is not a feature of impetigo and, if present, suggests either infection extending to deeper tissues or another diagnosis. The classic presentation of impetigo usually poses little diagnostic difficulty. Cultures of impetiginous lesions often yield S. aureus as well as GAS. In almost all cases, streptococci are isolated initially and staphylococci appear later, presumably as secondary colonizing flora. In the past, penicillin was nearly always effective against these infections. However, an increasing frequency of penicillin treatment failure suggests that S. aureus may have become more prominent as a cause of impetigo.

Laboratory testing reveals a mac-rocytic anemia based on a hematocrit of 30% (normal for women, 37\u201348%), a hemoglobin concentration of 9.4 g/dL, an erythrocyte mean cell volume (MCV) of 123 fL (nor-mal, 84\u201399 fL), an erythrocyte mean cell hemoglobin con-centration (MCHC) of 34% (normal, 31\u201336%), and a low reticulocyte count. Further laboratory testing reveals a normal serum folate concentration and a serum vitamin B12 (cobalamin) concentration"

            "content": "Cutaneous: Presents 1\u20137 days after skin exposure and penetration of spores. The lesion begins as a pruritic papule that enlarges to form an ulcer surrounded by a satellite bulbus/lesion with an edematous halo and a round, regular, and raised edge. Regional lymphadenopathy is also characteristic. The lesion evolves into a black eschar within 7\u201310 days. Inhalational: Presents with fever, dyspnea, hypoxia, hypotension, or symptoms of pneumonia (1\u20133 days after exposure), classically due to hemorrhagic mediastinitis. GI: Occurs after the ingestion of poorly cooked, contaminated meat; can present with dysphagia, nausea/vomiting, bloody diarrhea, and abdominal pain. CXR is the most sensitive test for inhalational disease (widened mediastinum, pleural effusions, infltrates). Aerobic culture and Gram stain of ulcer exudate show nonmotile short chains of bacilli. Antibody tests are also useful in confrming the diagnosis."

Usually beginning on the face or intertriginous areas, small nonfollicular pustules overlying erythematous and edematous skin may coalesce and lead to superficial erosion. Differentiating this eruption from TEN in its initial stages may be difficult. A skin biopsy is important and shows neutrophil collections and sparse necrotic keratinocytes in the upper part of the epidermis instead of the full-thickness epidermal necrosis that characterizes TEN. Fever and leukocytosis are common, and eosinophilia occurs in one-third of cases. Acute pustular psoriasis is the principal differential diagnostic consideration. DIHS with pustular features must also be clinically considered, although the timing for the onset of DIHS is distinct (much later onset). AGEP often begins within a few days of initiating drug treatment, most notably antibiotics, but may"

            "content": "Folliculitis refers to small, dome-shaped pustules or erythematous papules predominantly caused by S. aureus and located in hair follicles, with superficial, limited inflammatory reaction in the surrounding tissue. Furuncles (boils) are deeper hair follicle infections that manifest as nodules with intense surrounding inflammatory reaction. These occur most frequently on the neck, trunk, axillae, and buttocks. A carbuncle represents the deepest of hair follicle infections and is characterized by multiseptate, loculated abscesses. Boils and carbuncles frequently require incisional drainage. Superficial folliculitis can be treated with topical therapy, such as an antibacterial chlorhexidine wash or an antibacterial lotion or solution such as clindamycin 1%, applied twice a day for 7 to 10 days. Oral antibiotics are necessary for unresponsive cases, or for furuncles and carbuncles."

Regardless of the extent of disease, the skin is erythematous, with pustules and variable scale. Localized to the palms and soles, it is easily confused with eczema. When it is generalized, episodes are characterized by fever (39\u00b0\u201340\u00b0C [102.2\u00b0\u2013104.0\u00b0F]) lasting several days, an accompanying generalized eruption of sterile pustules, and a background of intense erythema; patients may become erythrodermic. Episodes of fever and pustules are recurrent. Local irritants, pregnancy, medications, infections, and systemic glucocorticoid withdrawal can precipitate this form of psoriasis. Oral retinoids are the treatment of choice in nonpregnant patients. CHAPTER 71 Eczema, Psoriasis, Cutaneous Infections, Acne, and Other Common Skin Disorders"

A sputum Gram\u2019s stain showing mainly polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in conjunction with a culture positive for P. aeruginosa in this setting suggests a diagnosis of acute P. aeruginosa pneumonia.

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

Severe and paroxysmal itching is the hallmark, with complaints of itching that is frequently worse than the eruption would suggest. Most children exhibit an eczematous eruption composed of red, excoriated papules and nodules. The classic linear papule or burrow is often difficult to find. Distribution is the most diagnostic finding; the papules are found in the axillae, umbilicus, groin, penis, instep of the foot, and web spaces of the fingers and toes (Fig. 196-1). Infants infested with scabies have diffuse erythema, scaling, and pinpoint papules. Pustules, vesicles, and nodules are much more common in infants and may be more diffusely distributed. The face and scalp usually are spared in adults and older children, but these areas are usually involved in infants. Nodular lesions may represent active infection or prolonged hypersensitivity lesions following"
