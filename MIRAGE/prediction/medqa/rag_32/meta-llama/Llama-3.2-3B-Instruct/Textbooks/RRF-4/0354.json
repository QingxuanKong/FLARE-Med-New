    "question": "A 35-year-old man returns to the clinic to follow up for his chronic stomach pain. At the last visit a few months ago, he explained that he had been experiencing discomfort in his upper abdomen for awhile. He had never vomited up any blood and had not had any substantial weight loss. He did not take any medications, did not smoke, and had no family history of gastric cancer. At that time, the doctor empirically started him on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Today, despite the PPI, the patient says he is still experiencing discomfort. Hearing this, the doctor decides to order a urease breath test. What is the most likely cause of this patient's chronic stomach pain?",

        "A": "Gastroesophgeal sphincter dysfunction",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely cause of the patient's chronic stomach pain, we need to consider the symptoms and medical history provided. The patient has been experiencing chronic stomach pain for a while, but has not vomited up any blood and has not had any substantial weight loss. He is taking a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), which is typically used to treat conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or peptic ulcer disease (PUD). However, the patient's symptoms persist despite the PPI treatment. The doctor decides to order a urease breath test to further investigate the cause of the patient's symptoms. The urease breath test is a diagnostic tool used to detect the presence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, which is a common cause of PUD. Given the patient's symptoms and the fact that the PPI treatment has not been effective, H. pylori infection is a strong possibility. The other options, gastroesophageal sphincter dysfunction, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and excessive gastrin, are less likely causes of chronic stomach pain in this patient. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's chronic stomach pain is H. pylori infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

After admission a bronchoscopy was carried out and sputum was aspirated from the left upper lobe bronchus. This was cultured in the laboratory and also viewed under the microscope and tuberculous bacilli (TB) were identified. A 68-year-old man came to his family physician complaining of discomfort when swallowing (dysphagia). The physician examined the patient and noted since his last visit he had lost approximately 18 lb over 6 months. Routine blood tests revealed the patient was anemic and he was referred to the gastroenterology unit. A diagnosis of esophageal cancer was made and the patient underwent a resection, which involved a chest and abdominal incision. After 4 years the patient remains well though still subject to follow-up."

On average, gastric ulcer patients are older than duodenal ulcer patients, and the incidence is increasing in the elderly, perhaps because of increasing NSAID and aspirin.DiagnosisIn the young patient with dyspepsia and without alarm symp-toms, it may be appropriate to initiate empirical PPI therapy for PUD without upper endoscopy or upper GI series. NSAIDs and aspirin should be stopped if the patient is taking these drugs, and Helicobacter should be ruled out with testing and treated if pres-ent.

The typical pain pattern in DU occurs 90 minutes to 3 hours after a meal and is frequently relieved by antacids or food. Pain that awakes the patient from sleep (between midnight and 3 A.M.) is the most discriminating symptom, with two-thirds of DU patients describing this complaint. Unfortunately, this symptom is also present in one-third of patients with NUD (see below). Elderly patients are less likely to have abdominal pain as a manifestation of PUD and may instead present with a complication such as ulcer bleeding or perforation. The pain pattern in GU patients may be different from that in DU patients, where discomfort may actually be precipitated by food. Nausea and weight loss occur more commonly in GU patients.

At the time of surgery, the initial dissection mobilized the kidney on its vascular pedicle; however, a large portion of tumor became detached in the inferior vena cava. The tumor embolus passed through the right atrium and right ventricle and occluded the pulmonary artery. This could not be cleared at the time of surgery, and the patient succumbed. A 65-year-old businessman came to the emergency department with severe lower abdominal pain that was predominantly central and left sided. He had pain radiating into the left loin, and he also noticed he was passing gas and fecal debris as he urinated. A CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis was performed (eFig. 4.191)."

He had had limited instruction on how to manage his dia-betes. He had peripheral neuropathy, proteinuria, low HDL cholesterol levels, and hypertension. The patient underwent multifactorial intervention targeting his weight, glucose levels, and blood pressure. He was advised to stop smoking. He attended structured diabetes classes and received indi-vidualized instruction from a diabetes educator and a dieti-tian. Metformin therapy was reinitiated and his insulin doses were reduced. The patient was then given the GLP1 receptor agonist, exenatide. The patient lost about 8 kg in weight over the next 3 years and was able to stop his insulin. He had excellent control with an HbA1c of 6.5 % on a combination of metformin, exenatide, and glimepiride. His antihyperten-sive therapy was optimized and his urine albumin excretion declined to 1569 mg/g creatinine. This case"

Rule out Zollinger-Ellison syndrome with serum gastrin levels in cases of GERD and PUD that are refractory to medical management. Misoprostol can help patients with PUD who require NSAID therapy (e.g., for arthritis). Patients may also complain of nausea, hematemesis (\u201ccoffee-ground\u201d emesis), or blood in the stool (melena or hematochezia). Exam may reveal varying degrees of epigastric tenderness and, if there is active bleeding, a stool guaiac."

A 33-year-old man was playing cricket for his local Sunday team. As the new bowler pitched the ball short, it bounced higher than he anticipated and hit him on the side of his head. He immediately fell to the ground unconscious, but after about 30 seconds he was helped to his feet and felt otherwise well. It was noted he had some bruising around his temple. He decided not to continue playing and went to watch the match from the side. Over the next hour he became extremely sleepy and was eventually unrousable. He was rushed to hospital. When he was admitted to hospital, the patient\u2019s breathing was shallow and irregular and it was necessary to intubate him. A skull radiograph demonstrated a fracture in the region of the pterion. No other abnormality was demonstrated other than minor soft tissue bruising over the left temporal fossa. A CT scan was performed."

A 50-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with severe lower back pain that had started several days ago. In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."

Endoscopy can be used to diagnose the underlying condition.Empiric therapy with H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitorscan be used but may delay diagnosis of conditions such as H. pylori. For patients with chronic epigastric pain, the possibilities of inflammatory bowel disease, anatomic abnormalitysuch as malrotation, pancreatitis, and biliary disease should beruled out by appropriate testing when suspected (see Chapter126 and Table 128-3 for recommended studies). Testing for H. pylori can be performed by biopsy during endoscopy with useof a urease test or presence histologically on tissue. If endoscopyis not done, noninvasive tests for infection can be done with reasonable accuracy with H. pylori fecal antigen and 13C urea breath tests (urea is metabolized into 13CO2 by the organism)."

Documentation of an ulcer requires either a radiographic (barium study) or an endoscopic procedure. However, a large percentage of patients with symptoms suggestive of an ulcer have NUD; testing for H. pylori and antibiotic therapy (see below) is appropriate for individuals who are otherwise healthy and <45 years of age, before embarking on a diagnostic evaluation (Chap. 54).
