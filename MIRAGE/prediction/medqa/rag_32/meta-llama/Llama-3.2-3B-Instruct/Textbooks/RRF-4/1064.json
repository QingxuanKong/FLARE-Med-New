She has had these swelling events her whole life; however, they have become more debilitating recently. Last week she had an event that restricted her ability to eat and swallow.  Past medical history is noncontributory. Her father is alive and well with no significant medical history. Her mother and her maternal aunt have a similar condition. Today, her physical exam is within normal limits. She brought a picture of her swollen hand as seen in the picture. The treating physician has a strong suspicion of an inherited disorder. C1-inhibitor levels are ordered and found to be extremely low. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?",

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

            "content": "History and Physical Examination The chest discomfort, often severe enough to be described as frank pain, is typically located in the sub-sternal region or sometimes in the epigastrium, and radiates to the left arm, left shoulder, and/or neck. Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."

In this example, the proband, a 36-year-old woman (IV-1), has a strong history of breast and ovarian cancer on the paternal side of her family. The early age of onset and the co-occurrence of breast and ovarian cancer in this family suggest the possibility of an inherited mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. It is unclear however, without genetic testing, whether her father harbors such a mutation and transmitted it to her. After appropriate genetic counseling of the pro-band and her family, the most informative and cost-effective approach to DNA analysis in this family is to test the cancer-affected 42-year-old living cousin for the presence of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. If a mutation is found, then it is possible to test for this particular alteration in other family members, if they so desire. In the example shown, if the proband\u2019s father has a BRCA1 mutation, there is a 50:50 probability that the"

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

A 60-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department with acute right-sided weakness, predominantly in the upper limb, which lasted for 24 hours. She made an uneventful recovery, but was extremely concerned about the nature of her illness and went to see her local doctor. A diagnosis of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) was made. A TIA is a neurological deficit resolving within 24 hours. It is a type of stroke. Neurological deficits may be permanent or transient. Most transient events resolve within 21 days; any failure of resolution beyond 21 days is an established stroke. An investigation into the cause of the TIA was undertaken. Eighty-five percent of all strokes result from cerebral infarction, of which most are due to embolization. A duplex Doppler scan of the carotid vessels was performed."
