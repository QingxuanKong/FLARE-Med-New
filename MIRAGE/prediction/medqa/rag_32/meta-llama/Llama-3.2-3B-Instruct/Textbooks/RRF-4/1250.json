Six months ago, combined antiretroviral therapy consisting of dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine was initiated. Laboratory studies show a decrease in the CD4 count and an increase in the viral load despite ongoing treatment. The patient is switched to a new treatment regimen, including a drug that acts by preventing viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation.

The patient was initially treated with dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine for six months, but the CD4 count decreased and the viral load increased despite ongoing treatment. This suggests that the current regimen is not effective, and a change is needed. The patient is switched to a new treatment regimen that includes a drug that acts by preventing viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation. This means we are looking for a drug that is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). NNRTIs are known to be effective in treating HIV-1 infection and can be used in combination with other drugs to prevent resistance. Given the options, the most likely drug is Raltegravir, which is an NNRTI that works by binding to the reverse transcriptase enzyme and preventing viral DNA synthesis without undergoing phosphorylation. This makes it a good candidate for the new treatment regimen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

            "content": "Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, an acyclic nucleotide analogue and potent antiretroviral agent used to treat HIV infection, is similar to adefovir but more potent in suppressing HBV DNA and inducing HBeAg responses; it is highly active against both wild-type and lamivudineresistant HBV and active in patients whose response to adefovir is slow and/or limited. At an oral once-daily dose of 300 mg for 48 weeks, tenofovir suppressed HBV DNA by 6.2 log10 (to undetectable levels [<400 copies/mL] in 76%) in HBeAg-positive patients and by 4.6 log10 (to undetectable levels in 93%) in HBeAg-negative patients; reduced ALT to normal in 68% of HBeAg-positive and 76% of HBeAg-negative patients; and improved histology in 74% of HBeAg-positive and 72% of HBeAg-negative patients. In HBeAg-positive patients, HBeAg seroconversions occurred in 21% by the end of year 1, 27% by year 2, 34% by year 3, and 40% by year 5 of tenofovir treatment; HBsAg loss occurred in 3% by the end of year 1 and 6% at year 2,"

For this reason, the CDC case definition of AIDS includes all HIV-infected individuals over 5 years of age with CD4+ T cell counts below this level (Table 226-2). Patients may experience constitutional signs and symptoms or may develop an opportunistic disease abruptly without any prior symptoms, although the latter scenario is unusual. The depletion of CD4+ T cells continues to be progressive and unrelenting in this phase. It is not CD4+ lymphocytes infected with defective viruses"

            "content": "Patients with HBV-HIV co-infection can have progressive HBV-associated liver disease and, occasionally, a severe exacerbation of hepatitis B resulting from immunologic reconstitution following ART. Lamivudine should never be used as monotherapy in patients with HBV-HIV infection because HIV resistance emerges rapidly to both viruses. Adefovir has been used successfully to treat chronic hepatitis B in HBV-HIV co-infected patients but is no longer considered a first-line agent for HBV. Entecavir has low-level activity against HIV and can result in selection of HIV resistance; therefore, it should be avoided in HBV-HIV co-infection. Tenofovir and the combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine in one pill are approved therapies for HIV and represent excellent choices for treating HBV infection in HBV-HIV co-infected patients. Generally, even for HBVHIV co-infected patients who do not yet meet treatment criteria for HIV infection, treating for both HBV and HIV is recommended."

Small but statistically significant decreases in bone mineral density have been noted in patients receiving tenofovir. Coadministration of tenofovir with didanosine leads to a 60% increase in didanosine levels, and thus doses of didanosine need to be adjusted and patients monitored carefully if these two drugs are used in combination. In addition, CD4+ T cell increases may be blunted in patients on this combination. Coadministration of tenofovir with atazanavir leads to a decrease in atazanavir levels, and thus low-dose ritonavir (see below) needs to be added when these drugs are used in combination. Tenofovir is available alone and coformulated with emtricitabine, emtricitabine and efavirenz, emtricitabine and rilpivirine, or emtricitabine, elvitegravir and cobicistat. Nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, etravirine, and rilpivirine are nonnucleoside inhibitors of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and are"

Liver function and renal function were normal. After 1 year of treatment, the patient experienced visible yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes. Blood samples were drawn, and grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia was documented. When atazanavir was discontinued and the antiretroviral regimen was modified to include lopinavir, the plasma levels of bilirubin returned to the normal range, and skin and eye color were cleared. Could a UGT1A1*28polymorphism have led to the adverse effects?"

Following the initiation of therapy one should expect a rapid, at least 1-log (tenfold) reduction in plasma HIV RNA levels within 1\u20132 months and then a slower decline in plasma HIV RNA levels to <50 copies/mL within 6 months. During this same time there should be a rise in the CD4+ T cell count of 100\u2013150/\u03bcL that is also particularly brisk during the first month of therapy. Subsequently, one should anticipate a CD4+ T cell count increase of 50\u2013100 cells/year until numbers approach normal. Many clinicians feel that failure to achieve these endpoints is an indication for a change in therapy. Other reasons for a change in therapy include a persistently declining CD4+ T cell count, a consistent increase in HIV RNA levels to >200 copies/mL, clinical deterioration, or drug toxicity (Table 226-25). As in the case of initiating therapy, changing therapy may have a lasting impact on future therapeutic options. When changing therapy because of"

Drug resistance testing is also indicated in the setting of virologic failure and should be performed while the patient is still on the failing regimen because of the propensity for the pool of HIV quasispecies to rapidly revert to wild-type in the absence of the selective pressures of cART. In the hands of experts, resistance testing enhances the short-term ability to decrease viral load by ~0.5 log compared with changing drugs merely on the basis of drug history. In addition to the use of resistance testing to help in the selection of new drugs in patients with virologic failure, it may also be of value in selecting an initial regimen for treatment of therapy-na\u00efve individuals. This is particularly true in geographic areas with a high level of background resistance. The patient needs to have an HIV-1 RNA level above 500\u2013 1000 copies/mL for an"
