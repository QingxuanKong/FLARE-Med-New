The investigator is studying bacterial adaptations to the environment in an infectious isolate and a noninfectious isolate of Hemophilus influenzae type B. The noninfectious isolate is cultivated in a culture with lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate, and some of the animals exposed to these bacteria develop symptoms of infection. This suggests that the noninfectious isolate has acquired some virulence factors from the infectious isolate, allowing it to cause infection in some animals.\\n\\nThe key concept here is the transfer of genetic material between bacteria, which can result in the acquisition of new traits. The options provided are conjugation, reassortment, transformation, and recombination.\\n\\nConjugation (A) is a process by which bacteria share genetic material through direct cell-to-cell contact. While conjugation can transfer virulence factors, it is not the most likely explanation in this case, as the noninfectious isolate was cultivated in a culture with lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate, suggesting a different mechanism.\\n\\nReassortment (B) is a process that occurs in viruses, not bacteria, so it is not relevant to this scenario.\\n\\nTransformation (C) is the process by which bacteria take up free DNA from their environment. This is a possible explanation, as the noninfectious isolate was cultivated in a culture with lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate, which could have transferred DNA to the noninfectious isolate.\\n\\nRecombination (D) is a process by which bacteria exchange genetic material through recombination of existing genetic material. While recombination can occur in bacteria, it is not the most likely explanation in this case, as the scenario suggests a more direct transfer of genetic material.\\n\\nBased on the information provided, the most likely process responsible for the described findings is transformation.

Specimens can be injected into transport bottles containing a reduced medium or taken immediately in syringes to the laboratory for direct culture on anaerobic media.

Thus, for Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus), and Streptococcus pyogenes, isogenic mutants or variants lacking capsules enter epithelial cells better than the wild-type, encapsulated parental forms that cause disseminated disease. These observations have led to the proposal that epithelial cell entry may be primarily a manifestation of host defense, resulting in bacterial clearance by both shedding of epithelial cells containing internalized bacteria and initiation of a protective and nonpathogenic inflammatory response.

            "content": "of patients, determining whether culture results are clinically meaningful or represent contamination (e.g., a non-aureus, non-lugdunensis staphylococcal species growing in a blood culture) can sometimes be challenging and requires an understanding of the patient\u2019s immune status, exposure history, and microbiota. In some cases, serial cultures to demonstrate clearance of the organism may be helpful."

            "content": "Two basic strategies are used to isolate pathogenic bacteria. The first is to employ enriched media that support the growth of any bacteria that may be present at a site that is normally sterile, such as blood or CSF. The second strategy is to use selective media to isolate specific bacterial species from samples that contain many bacteria under normal conditions (e.g., stool or genital tract secretions). Antimicrobial agents or other substances are incorporated into the agar medium to inhibit growth of all but the bacteria of interest. After incubation, organisms that grow on such media are characterized further to determine whether they are pathogens (Fig. 150e-1)."

            "content": "Like most other aspects of infectious disease, human behavior has exacerbated the problem of drug resistance. Many patients take antibiotics for symptoms that are typically caused by viruses (flu-like illnesses, colds, sore throats, and earaches) and these drugs have no effects. Persistent and chronic misuse of antibiotics can eventually result in antibiotic-resistant normal flora, which can then transfer the resistance to pathogens. Antibiotics are also misused in agriculture, where they are commonly employed as food additives to promote the growth and health of farm animals. An antibiotic closely related to vancomycin was commonly added to cattle feed in Europe; the resulting resistance in the normal flora of these animals is widely believed to be one of the original sources for vancomycin-resistant bacteria that now threaten the lives of hospitalized patients."

Studies with knockout mice have been instrumental in dissecting the roles played by chemokines and cytokines during infection. For example, interferon \u03b3, tumor necrosis factor, and CCR2 are essential in controlling infection. While innate immunity is sufficient to control infection, the acquired immune response is required for sterile immunity. Immunity is cell mediated; antibody plays no measurable role. The critical effector cells are cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells that recognize and lyse infected cells; the resulting extracellular bacteria are killed by circulating activated phagocytes."
