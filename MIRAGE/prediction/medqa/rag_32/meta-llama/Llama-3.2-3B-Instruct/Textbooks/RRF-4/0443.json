    "question": "A 65-year-old woman presents to a physician with painful ankles for 2 days. Her symptoms began 1 week ago with a severe fever (40\u2103 (104\u2109)) for 3 days. When the fever subsided, she developed a maculopapular rash over the trunk and extremities with painful wrists and fingers. She also reports abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and headaches. Last week she returned from a trip to Africa where she spent several weeks, mostly in rural areas. Her temperature is 37.5\u2103 (99.5\u2109); pulse is 75/min; respiratory rate is 13/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. A maculopapular rash is observed over the trunk and limbs. Both ankles are swollen and painful to active and passive motion. The abdomen is soft without organomegaly. Laboratory studies show the following:\nLaboratory test\nHemoglobin 11.4 g/d\nMean corpuscular volume 90 \u00b5m3\nLeukocyte count 4,500/mm3\nSegmented neutrophils 70%\nLymphocytes 15%\nPlatelet count 250,000/mm3\nRing-form trophozoites are absent on the peripheral blood smear.

The patient's symptoms began 1 week ago, and the fever subsided, followed by the development of a maculopapular rash. This pattern of symptoms is consistent with a tick-borne illness. The patient's travel history and symptoms are consistent with several tick-borne illnesses, but the presence of a maculopapular rash and the patient's symptoms are most consistent with Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF) or Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF). However, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with TBRF. TBRF is caused by Borrelia species, which are transmitted by ticks. The patient's laboratory results show a low leukocyte count and the absence of ring-form trophozoites on the peripheral blood smear, which is consistent with TBRF. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are most consistent with TBRF caused by Borrelia rossii or Borrelia parkeri.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Initially, this rash is macular; without treatment, it becomes maculopapular, petechial, and confluent. The rash often goes undetected in black skin; 60% of African patients have spotless epidemic typhus. Photophobia, with considerable conjunctival injection and eye pain, is common. The tongue may be dry, brown, and furred. Confusion and coma are common. Skin necrosis and gangrene of the digits as well as interstitial pneumonia may occur in severe cases.

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes.

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

Chest pain is more common in adults, and abdominal pain is more common in children. Paroxysms of severe, knifelike pain usually last 15\u201330 min and are associated with diaphoresis and tachypnea. Fever peaks within an hour after the onset of paroxysms and subsides when pain resolves. The involved muscles are tender to palpation, and a pleural rub may be detected. The white blood cell count and chest x-ray results are usually normal. Most cases are due to coxsackievirus B and occur during epidemics. Symptoms resolve in a few days, and recurrences are rare. Treatment includes the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or the application of heat to the affected muscles."

The febrile stage lasts 3 or 4 days and is identified by the abrupt onset of fever, headache, severe myalgia, thirst, anorexia, and often nausea and vomiting. Photophobia, retroorbital pain, and pain on ocular movement are common, and the vision may become blurred with ciliary body inflammation. Flushing over the face, the V area of the neck, and the back is characteristic, as are pharyngeal injection, periorbital edema, and conjunctival suffusion. Petechiae often develop in areas of pressure, the conjunctivae, and the axillae. Back pain and tenderness to percussion at the costovertebral angle reflect massive retroperitoneal edema. Laboratory evidence of mild to moderate DIC is present. Other laboratory findings of HFRS include proteinuria and active urinary sediment. The hypotensive stage lasts from a few hours to 48 h and begins with falling blood pressure and sometimes shock. The relative bradycardia typical of the febrile"
