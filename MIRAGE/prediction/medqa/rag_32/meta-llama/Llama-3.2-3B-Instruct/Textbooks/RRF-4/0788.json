Betamethasone is a corticosteroid used to stimulate fetal lung maturation in preterm labor. To answer this question, we need to identify which fetal cells are stimulated by betamethasone. The correct answer can be deduced by understanding the mechanism of action of corticosteroids and their effects on fetal development. Corticosteroids, including betamethasone, stimulate the production of surfactant in the lungs, which is essential for preventing respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants. Surfactant is produced by type II pneumocytes in the lungs. Therefore, the correct answer is related to lung development and the cells responsible for producing surfactant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Labor is defined as cervical dilation of 3 to 4 cm or more in the presence of uterine contractions. Management guidelines direct that a pelvic examination be performed approximately every 2 hours. Inefective labor is suspected when the cervix does not dilate within approximately 2 hours of admission. Amniotomy is then performed, and labor progress determined at the next 2-hour evaluation. In women whose labors do not progress, an intrauterine pressure catheter is placed to assess uterine function. Hypotonic contractions and no cervical dilation after an additional 2 to 3 hours result in stimulation of labor using the high-dose oxytocin regimen described in Chapter 26 (p. 509).

Their overall cesarean delivery rate was 5 percent in the 1970s and 1980s with such management. The approach is now referred to as active management of labor. Two of its components-amniotomy and oxytocinhave been widely used, especially in English-speaking countries outside the United States. With this protocol, labor is diagnosed when painful contractions are accompanied by complete cervical efacement, bloody \"show,\" or ruptured membranes. Women with such indings are committed to delivery within 12 hours. Pelvic examination is performed each hour for the next 3 hours, and thereafter at 2-hour intervals. When dilation has not increased by at least 1 cm/hr, amniotomy is performed. Progress is again assessed at 2 hours, and high-dose oxytocin infusion, described in Chapter 26 (p. 509),"

Uterine activity alone can be misleading because of Braxton Hicks contractions. These irregular, nonrhythmical contractions can cause considerable confusion in the diagnosis of true labor. Not infrequently, women who deliver before term have uterine activity that is attributed to Braxton Hicks contractions that prompt an incorrect diagnosis of false labor. Accordingly, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2016b) defines preterm labor to be regular contractions before 37 weeks that are associated with cervical change. In addition to contractions, pelvic pressure, menstrual-like cramps, watery vaginal discharge, and lower back pain have been empirically associated with impending preterm birth. Such complaints are thought by some to be common in normal pregnancy and are therefore often minimized by patients and obstetrical care providers."

These two drugs are comparable in reducing rates of major neonatal morbidities in preterm newborns (Elimian, 2007). A treatment course may be two 12-mg doses of betamethasone, and each dose is given intramuscularly 24 hours apart. With dexamethasone, 6-mg doses are given intramuscularly every 12 hours for four doses. Because treatment for less than 24 hours may be beneicial and reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality rates, a first dose of antenatal corticosteroids is administered regardless of the ability to complete additional doses before delivery (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 20e1e7a). The MFMU Network conducted a randomized trial to assess whether administration of antenatal betamethasone to women who were likely to deliver in the late-pre term period would"

            "content": "B. Corticosteroids and Stimulation of Lung Maturation in the Fetus Lung maturation in the fetus is regulated by the fetal secretion of cortisol. Treatment of the mother with large doses of glucocorticoid reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in infants delivered prematurely. When delivery is anticipated before 34 weeks of gestation, intramuscular betamethasone, 12 mg, followed by an additional dose of 12 mg 18\u201324 hours later, is commonly used. Betamethasone is chosen because maternal protein binding and placental metabolism of this corticosteroid is less than that of cortisol, allowing increased transfer across the placenta to the fetus. A study of more than 10,000 infants born at 23\u201325 weeks of gestation indicated that exposure to exogenous corticosteroids before birth reduced the death rate and evidence of neurodevelopmental impairment.

            "content": "Because uterine contractions are not afected by spinal cord lesions, labor is usually easy-even precipitous, and comparatively painless. If the lesion is below T12' uterine contractions are felt normally. For lesions above T 2, the risk of out-of 1rhospital delivery is substantial and can be minimized by teaching women to palpate for uterine contractions. This is especially important because up to 20 percent of women deliver preterm (Westgren, 1993). Some recommend tocodynamometry and weekly cervical examinations beginning at 28 to 30 weeks. Another reasonable option that we frequently employ at Park land Hospital is elective hospitalization after 36 to 37 weeks' gestation (Hughes, 1991)."

During second-stage labor, these contractions are then reinforced by voluntary or involuntary muscular action of the abdominal wall-\"pushing.\" The diagnosis of uterine dysfunction in the latent phase is diicult and sometimes can be made only in retrospect. Women who are not yet in active labor commonly are erroneously treated for this dysfunction. Beginning in the 1960s, at least three significant advances have aided treatment of uterine dysfunction. First is the realization that undue labor prolongation may contribute to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality rates. Second, dilute intravenous infusion of oxytocin is administered to treat certain types of uterine dysfunction. Last, cesarean delivery is selected rather than diicult midforceps delivery when oxytocin fails or its use is inappropriate. \u2022 Types of Uterine Dysfunction"

            "content": "Despite their diversity, these processes culminate in a common end point-premature cervical dilation and efacement and premature activation of uterine contractions. Importantly, the actual process of preterm labor should be considered a final step stemming from progressive or acute changes that could be initiated days or even weeks before labor onset. Indeed, many forms of spontaneous preterm labor that result from premature initiation of phase 2 of parturition may be viewed in this light (Chap. 21, p. 408). Although the end result in preterm birth is the same as at term with cervical ripening and myometrial activation, recent studies in animal models support the idea that preterm birth is not always an acceleration of the normal process. Diverse pathways to instigate parturition exist and are dependent on the etiology of preterm birth. Four major causes include uterine distention, maternal-fetal stress, premature cervical changes, and infection."

Women with BV are at increased risk for pelvic in\ufb02ammatory disease (PID), postabortal PID, postoperative cuff infections after hysterectomy, and abnormal cervical cytology (6\u20139). Pregnant women with BV are at risk for premature rupture of the membranes, preterm labor and delivery, chorioamnionitis, and postcesarean endometritis (10,11). In women with BV who are undergoing surgical abortion or hysterectomy, perioperative treatment with metronidazole eliminates this increased risk (12,13). Diagnosis Office-based testing is required to diagnose BV. It is diagnosed on the basis of the following findings (14): 1. A fishy vaginal odor, which is particularly noticeable following coitus, and vaginal discharge are present. 2. Vaginal secretions are gray and thinly coat the vaginal walls. 3. The pH of these secretions is higher than 4.5 (usually 4.7 to 5.7). 4."
