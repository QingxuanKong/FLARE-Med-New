    "question": "A 5-year-old female presents to the pediatrician for a routine office visit. The patient is in kindergarten and doing well in school. She is learning to read and is able to write her first name. Her teacher has no concerns. The patient\u2019s mother is concerned that the patient is a picky eater and often returns home from school with most of her packed lunch uneaten. The patient\u2019s past medical history is significant for moderate persistent asthma, which has required three separate week-long courses of prednisone over the last year and recently diagnosed myopia. The patient\u2019s mother is 5\u20197\u201d, and the patient\u2019s father is 5\u201910\u201d. The patient\u2019s weight and height are in the 55th and 5th percentile, respectively, which is consistent with her growth curve. On physical exam, the patient has a low hairline and a broad chest. Her lungs are clear with a mild expiratory wheeze. The patient\u2019s abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. She has Tanner stage I breast development and pubic hair.\n\nThis patient is most likely to have which of the following additional findings?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and history: 1. **Age and Developmental Stage**: The patient is 5 years old, in kindergarten, and learning to read and write her first name. Her teacher has no concerns, indicating that her development is on track. 2. **Growth and Height**: The patient's weight and height are in the 55th and 5th percentile, respectively, which is consistent with her growth curve. This suggests that she is at or below the expected height for her age, but her weight is within the expected range. 3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The patient has a low hairline and a broad chest. These features are suggestive of Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects females. 4. **Asthma and Medication History**: The patient has moderate persistent asthma, which has required multiple courses of prednisone. However, her asthma is well-controlled, and her lung exam is clear with a mild expiratory wheeze. 5. **Family History**: The patient's mother is 5'7\", and the patient's father is 5'10\". This suggests a possible genetic component to her growth and development. Given these points, let's evaluate the options: A. **Absent Barr bodies on buccal smear**: This is a characteristic feature of Turner syndrome, which is consistent with the patient's physical examination findings and growth pattern. B. **Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level**: This is not specifically associated with Turner syndrome or the other conditions listed. C. **Elevated serum TSH level**: This would be more indicative of hypothyroidism, which is not suggested by the patient's growth pattern or physical examination. D. **Mass in the sella turcica**: This would be more suggestive of a pituitary tumor, which is not indicated by the patient's presentation. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient is absent Barr bodies on buccal smear, which is a characteristic feature of Turner syndrome. Here is the output in the requested JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's physical examination findings, growth pattern, and family history suggest Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects females, characterized by short stature, low-set ears, and a broad chest, among other features. The presence of absent Barr bodies on buccal smear is a diagnostic feature of Turner syndrome. This condition is also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, hearing loss, and infertility, but not with asthma or hypothyroidism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The height of the patient should remain close to the genetic potential, based on the parental heights, when reinterpreted for bone age (see Chapter 173). Usuallyheight gain is below, although fairly parallel to, the normal percentiles on the growth curve. The prepubertal nadir, or deceleration before their pubertal growth spurt, is prolonged or protracted. A family history of delayed puberty in a parent or sibling is reassuring. Spontaneous puberty usually begins in these patients by the time the bone age reaches 12 years in boys and 11 years in girls. Other causes of delayed puberty must be eliminated before a diagnosis of constitutional delay in puberty is made. Observation and reassurance are appropriate. Adult height normal for the genetic potential is generally attained. In some"

During the year before presentation, her scholastic performance in school deteriorated, she gained 25 lb, she became increasingly lethargic, and nocturia and polydypsia were noted. Initial evaluation documented low follicle-stimulating hormone, elevated prolactin, and a bone age of 10.5 years. Computed tomography scanning documented a large hypothalamic neoplasm that proved to be an ectopic germinoma. The patient was also documented to be hypothyroid and hypoadrenal and to have diabetes insipidus. Despite the elevated prolactin, she had no galactorrhea because of the minimal breast development.

A fine lanugo covers the face, body, and limbs. The skin is thin and dry, without its normal elasticity, and the nails are brittle. The dental enamel is eroded. Pubic hair and breast tissue (except for loss of fat) are normal, and, in this respect, anorexia nervosa is unlike hypopituitary cachexia (Simmonds disease). Surprisingly, however, there are no neurologic signs of nutritional deficiency. The patient is alert and cheerfully indifferent to her condition. Any suggestion that she is unattractively thin or seriously depleted is rejected."

Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

The senior physician realized that a potential cause of the abdominal pain was a pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). The patient was rushed for an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed no fetus or sac in the uterus. She was also noted to have a positive pregnancy test. The patient underwent surgery and was found to have a ruptured fallopian tube caused by an ectopic pregnancy. Whenever a patient has apparent pelvic pain, it is important to consider the gender-related anatomical differences. Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age."

The surgical note reported that all of the breast tissue had been removed, including the axillary process. In addition, the surgeon had dissected all lymph nodes within the axilla with their surrounding fat. The patient made an uneventful recovery. At the first follow-up appointment, the patient\u2019s husband told the surgeon that she had now developed a bony \u201cspike\u201d on her back. The surgeon was intrigued and asked the patient to reveal this spike. At examination, the spike was the inferior angle of the scapula, which appeared to be sticking out posteriorly (\u201cwinged\u201d). Raising the arms accentuated this structure."
