She reports that she and her husband had been trying to have a child for the past three months. She has no history of sexually transmitted disease, intravenous drug use, or blood transfusions, and she has never traveled outside of the United States. She was up-to-date on all immunizations before her pregnancy. Ultrasound is consistent with an 8-week gestational sac.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend routine screening for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B in all pregnant women. Hepatitis C screening is not routinely recommended, but it may be offered to women at high risk. Gonorrhea and chlamydia screening are not routinely recommended for all pregnant women, but may be offered to women at high risk. Considering the patient's history and preferences, the most appropriate options are HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B screening.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

The pelvic examination occasionally may be deferred in young teenagers who have a classic history of irregular cycles soon after menarche, who have normal hematocrit levels, who deny sexual activity, and who will reliably return for follow-up.

Hematocrit or hemoglobin determination, along with serology for syphilis if it is prevalent in the population, is repeated at 28 to 32 weeks (Hollier, 2003; Kiss, 2004). For women at increased risk for HIV acquisition during pregnancy, repeat testing is recommended in the third trimester, preferably before 36 weeks (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 20 16). Similarly, women who engage in behaviors that place them at high risk for hepatitis B virus infection are retested at the time of hospitalization for delivery. Women who are D (h) negative and are unsensitized should have an antibody screening test repeated at 28 to 29 weeks, and anti-D immunoglobulin is given if they remain unsensitized (Chap. 15, p. 305)."

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

Neither the patient nor the family physician had any concerns about the pregnancy. However, the patient did complain of unilateral swelling of her left leg, which had gradually increased over the previous 2 days. Furthermore, the evening before her visit she developed some sharp chest pain, which was exacerbated by deep breaths. The family physician ordered a duplex ultrasound scan of the left leg venous system. Ultrasound scanning of the vascular tree can demonstrate flow and occlusion of arteries and veins."

True or false: Withdrawing a nonbeneficial treatment is ethically similar to withholding a nonindicated one. When can a physician refuse to continue treating a patient on the grounds of futility? An eight-year-old child is in a serious accident. She requires emergent transfusion, but her parents are not present. Conditions in which confidentiality must be overridden. Involuntary commitment or isolation for medical treatment may be undertaken for what reason? A 10-year-old child presents in status epilepticus, but her parents refuse treatment on religious grounds. A son asks that his mother not be told about her recently discovered cancer. False. Patients may change their minds at any time. Exceptions to the requirement of informed consent include emergency situations and patients without decision-making capacity."

            "content": "Historically, serum screening has required the use of invasive testing follow-up to confirm findings. Because invasive testing carries a small but real risk of pregnancy loss, many women were not willing to submit to an amniocentesis or CVS. What has been needed is a noninvasive definitive test, one in which fetal risk is negligible. Recently, the search for such a noninvasive test has been successful. Prenatal diagnosis using cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood offers the ability to detect trisomies in fetuses using nothing more than a sample of the mother\u2019s blood. Although still in the research stage, this technique is being piloted in high-risk pregnancies. It is common for pregnant women to have a screening sonogram at 18 weeks\u2019 gestation. An anatomy scan is done to look for congenital anomalies. Brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and spine are examined."

According to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the safest part of pregnancy in which to travel is between 18 and 24 weeks, when there is the least danger of spontaneous abortion or premature labor. Some obstetricians prefer that women stay within a few hundred miles of home after the 28th week of pregnancy in case problems arise. In general, however, healthy women may be advised that it is acceptable to travel."

The patient had no significant adverse effects from this dosage. At age 21, she had a second tonic-clonic seizure while in college; further discussion with her room-mate at that time revealed a history of two recent episodes of 1\u20132 minutes of altered consciousness with lip smacking (focal impaired awareness seizure, formerly complex partial seizure). A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid. Four days later, electroencephalography (EEG)"
