Her last menstrual period was 7 weeks ago. She has a history of a seizure disorder treated with carbamazepine. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is positive.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key components of the scenario provided: the patient's symptoms (fatigue, breast tenderness, increased urinary frequency, and intermittent nausea) and her medical history (seizure disorder treated with carbamazepine and a positive urine pregnancy test). The patient's symptoms could be indicative of several conditions, but the combination of fatigue, breast tenderness, and increased urinary frequency, particularly in the context of a positive pregnancy test, raises a concern for gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD), which can occur in women with a history of seizure disorders. GTD includes conditions such as hydatidiform mole, invasive mole, choriocarcinoma, placental-site trophoblastic tumor, and epithelioid trophoblastic tumor. The child of a mother with GTD is at increased risk for certain complications. The options provided include renal dysplasia, meningocele, sensorineural hearing loss, and vaginal clear cell carcinoma. Among these, the most significant risk to the child of a mother with GTD is renal dysplasia, particularly if the mother has an invasive mole. Invasive moles are associated with a higher risk of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, which can lead to renal dysplasia in the fetus. Therefore, the child is at greatest risk of developing renal dysplasia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

            "content": "If a woman with epilepsy has not required medications for a time before getting pregnant and has a seizure during pregnancy, the best choice of medication may be phenytoin for its advantage in rapid seizure control, or levetiracetam. Exposure of the fetus late in gestation poses few teratogenic risks. If a woman discovers she is pregnant while on an antiepileptic drug, changing medications is unlikely to reduce the chances of birth defects, even for valproate, but this drug retains the risk of lower IQ in the child. The special case of eclamptic seizures is managed by infusion of magnesium as noted below."

Seizure frequency during pregnancy will remain unchanged in ~50% of women, increase in 30%, and decrease in 20%. Changes in seizure frequency are attributed to endocrine effects on the CNS, variations in antiepileptic drug pharmacokinetics (such as acceleration of hepatic drug metabolism or effects on plasma protein binding), and changes in medication compliance. It is useful to see patients at frequent intervals during pregnancy and monitor serum antiepileptic drug levels. Measurement of the unbound drug concentrations may be useful if there is an increase in seizure frequency or worsening of side effects of antiepileptic drugs."

            "content": "In the evaluation of acute pelvic pain, early diagnosis is critical because significant delay increases morbidity and mortality. Central to correct diagnosis is an accurate history. The date and character of the last and previous menstrual periods and the presence of abnormal bleeding or discharge should be ascertained. The menstrual, sexual, and contraceptive history and any history of sexually transmitted conditions and previous gynecologic disorders are relevant. Pain history should include how and when the pain started, pregnancy-related symptoms (amenorrhea, irregular bleeding, nausea, breast tenderness), GI symptoms (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, obstipation, absence of \ufb02atus, hematochezia), urinary symptoms (dysuria, urgency frequency, hesitancy, hematuria), signs of infection (fever, chills, purulent vaginal discharge), and symptoms attributable to a hemoperitoneum (orthostasis, abdominal distention, and right upper quadrant or shoulder pain).

Which of the eicosanoid agonists have been demonstrated to reduce both morbidity and mortality in patients with such a diagnosis? What are the modes of action? A 40-year-old woman presented to her doctor with a 6-month history of increasing shortness of breath. This was associated with poor appetite and ankle swell-ing.

The examining physician discovers postural hypotension and moderate vitiligo (depigmented areas of skin) and obtains routine blood tests. She finds hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis and suspects Addison\u2019s disease. She performs a standard ACTH 1\u201324 stimulation test, which reveals an insufficient plasma cortisol response compatible with primary adrenal insuf-ficiency. The diagnosis of autoimmune Addison\u2019s disease is made, and the patient must start replacement of the hormones he cannot produce himself. How should this patient be treated? What precautions should he take?"

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

            "content": "Several endocrine and menstrual abnormalities (particularly amenorrhea), as well as the use of oral contraceptives, have been postulated as causative factors, but none has been substantiated. Cases have been reported during pregnancy, both those who have symptoms for the first time during pregnancy and a larger group with ongoing pseudotumor who become pregnant. Despite the theoretical appeal of relating the endocrine and other changes of pregnancy to the increased ICP, no suitable connection has been found, and there is no evidence that premature delivery or termination of the pregnancy ameliorates the pseudotumor. Nevertheless, our obstetric colleagues have often recommended delivery when safe for the fetus if the mother\u2019s vision is threatened. Most of the standard medical treatments detailed below have been used with some benefit during pregnancy, as in the series reported by Huna-Baron and Kupersmith."

The more general chronic form that does not include epileptic-like attacks usually has its onset in the teens or early twenties, almost exclusively in young women; a very few cases begin before puberty. Once established, the symptoms recur intermittently, although with reduced frequency, throughout the adult years even to an advanced age. No doubt there are cases of lesser severity in which symptoms occur only a few times or perhaps only once, just as there are mild forms of other diseases. The patient may be seen for the first time during middle life or later, and the earlier history may not at first be forthcoming. Careful probing almost invariably reveals that the earliest manifestations of the chronic form of"
