    "question": "An 18-month-old boy is brought to his pediatrician because his mother is concerned about his walking. The boy was born at 37 weeks\u2019 gestation and spent 1 night in the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress. He otherwise has been healthy and started walking independently at 12 months. However, his mother reports that he has stopped walking and appears weaker than he was a few months ago. He also has started having brief convulsive episodes over the past week. His parents are both healthy with no medical conditions. On exam, the child demonstrates muscle rigidity and diffuse muscle wasting. He is unable to stand or sit up straight. His patellar, Achilles, and brachioradialis reflexes are absent. Fundoscopic examination is unremarkable. A urine sample demonstrates metachromic granules. This patient\u2019s condition is caused by a defect in which of the following enzymes?",

The boy has stopped walking, appears weaker, and has brief convulsive episodes, along with muscle rigidity and diffuse muscle wasting. He also has absent patellar, Achilles, and brachioradialis reflexes. The presence of metachromic granules in the urine is a key finding. Based on these symptoms, we need to consider disorders that affect muscle function and cause muscle wasting and weakness. The absence of reflexes and muscle wasting is suggestive of a lower motor neuron disorder. The presence of metachromic granules in the urine is a hallmark of Tay-Sachs disease, a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase A. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down gangliosides in the brain and nervous system. Without it, these substances accumulate and cause neurodegeneration. The other options are not supported by the clinical presentation and laboratory findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

At about 2 to 3 years of age, boys develop an awkward gait and an inability to run properly. Some have an antecedent history of mild slowness in attaining motor milestones or poor head control during infancy. Examination shows firm calf hypertrophy and mild to moderate proximal leg weakness with a hyperlordotic, waddling gait. The child typically arises from a lying position on the floor by using his arms to climb up his legs and body (Gower sign). Arm weakness is evident by age 6 years, and most boys are wheelchair dependent by age 12 years. Other manifestations include cardiomyopathy, scoliosis, respiratory decline, and, in some boys, cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. Many boys with Duchenne live into adulthood. Most die in their 20s or early 30s, usually as a result of progressive respiratory decline or cardiac dysfunction."

Loss of muscle strength is progressive, with predilection for proximal limb muscles and the neck flexors; leg involvement is more severe than arm involvement.

The pain began after a fall on his outstretched hand approximately 6 months previously. The patient recalled having some minor shoulder tenderness but no other specific symptoms. He was otherwise fit and well. On examination of the shoulder, there was marked wasting of the muscles in the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae. The patient found initiation of abduction difficult and there was a weakness of lateral rotation of the humerus. The wasted muscles were the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The cause of the muscle wasting was disuse. Muscle atrophy (wasting) occurs through a variety of disorders. Disuse atrophy is one of the most common causes. Examples of disuse atrophy include the loss of muscle bulk after fracture immobilization in a plaster cast. The opposite effect can also be demonstrated\u2014when muscles are overused they become bulkier (hypertrophy)."

Moreover, heritability (typically autosomal recessive) is suggested by familial occurrence of the disorders among siblings. The most important clue to the disease in the neonate is an increase in ptosis and in bulbar and respiratory weakness with crying. Later in infancy these symptoms, as well as fluctuating ocular palsies and abnormal fatigability, are brought out by other types of sustained activities. Motor milestones may be delayed. In some cases, the myasthenic weakness and fatigability do not become evident until the second and third decades of life. Testing with anticholinesterase drugs is inconsistently positive in a few forms of congenital myasthenia as mentioned further on, but it usually is negative."

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian"

The functional difference between the two sides may be noticed soon after birth, but more often it is not perceived by the mother until after the first 4 to 6 months of life. In a second group, the child is in excellent health for a year or longer before the abrupt onset of hemiplegia (see below). In hemiplegia that dates from earliest infancy\u2014that is, congenital hemiplegia\u2014the parents first notice that movements of prehension and exploration are carried out with only one arm. A manifest hand preference at an early age should always raise the suspicion of a unilateral motor defect. The affection of the leg is usually recognized later, that is, during the first attempts to stand and walk. Sitting and walking are usually delayed by a few months. In the older child, there is evident hyperactivity of tendon reflexes and usually a Babinski sign. The arm is held flexed, adducted, and"

They are unable to sit, creep, or crawl, but have good verbal, social, and manipulative skills. Strength appears normal, and the infants can kick arms and legs briskly and bring their toes to their mouths. The children often display head lag, slip-through in ventral suspension, and floppiness of passive tone. The infant seems floppy from birth. The differential diagnosis includes upper and motor neuron disorders and connective tissue diseases. Extensive laboratory investigation is often unrevealing. Most of these children catch up to peers and Severe brain illness* Structural (hydrocephalus) Infectious Metabolic (e.g., anoxia or hypoglycemia) Intoxication through mother Connective tissue disorder Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Marfan syndrome Congenital laxity of ligaments *Common."

Perceptive mothers may be aware of a paucity of fetal movements in utero; in most cases the motor defect becomes evident soon after birth or the infant is born with arthrogrypotic deformities. Several other types of familial progressive muscular atrophies have been described in which the onset is in early or late childhood, adolescence, or early adult life. Weakness, atrophy, and reflex loss without sensory change are the main features and are discussed in detail in Chap. 38. A few patients suspected of having infantile or childhood muscular atrophy prove, with the passage of time, to be merely inactive \u201cslack\u201d children, whose motor development has proceeded at a slower rate than normal. Others may remain weak throughout life, with thin musculature. These and several other congenital myopathies\u2014central core, rod-body, nemaline,"

The youngest was 2 years old; the oldest, 65 years. In each there was weakness and hypotonia soon after birth (again, \u201cfloppy infant\u201d) and a general delay in motor development, particularly in walking, which was not achieved until the age of 4 to 5 years. These patients had difficulty in rising from a chair, climbing stairs, and running. The weakness was greater in proximal than in distal muscles, although the latter did not escape, and shoulder-girdle muscles were affected less than those of the pelvic girdle. Facial, bulbar, and ocular muscles were spared. The tendon reflexes were hypoactive and symmetrical. Muscle atrophy was not a prominent feature, although poor muscular development was present in 1 patient and has since been reported in others. There were no fasciculations, cramps, or myotonia, but cramps"

            "content": "Muscles of the pelvic girdle, lumbosacral spine, and shoulders become weak and wasted, accounting for certain clinical peculiarities. Weakness of abdominal and paravertebral muscles accounts for a lordotic posture and protuberant abdomen when standing and the rounded back when sitting. Weakness of the extensors of the knees and hips interferes with equilibrium and with activities such as climbing stairs or rising from a chair or from a stooped posture. In standing and walking, the patient places his feet wide apart so as to increase his base of support. To rise from a sitting position, he first flexes his trunk at the hips, puts his hands on his knees, and pushes the trunk upward by working the hands up the thighs. In rising from the ground, the child first assumes a four-point position by extending the arms and legs to the fullest possible extent and then works each hand alternately up the corresponding thigh (the sign traditionally attached to Gowers\u2019 name).

The child may have kissing kneecaps due to increased internal rotation of the femur. While walking, the entire leg will appear internally rotated, and with running the child may appear to have an egg-beatergait where the legs flip laterally. The flexed hip will have internal rotation increased to 80\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 (normal 60\u00b0 to 70\u00b0) and external rotation limited to about 10\u00b0.
