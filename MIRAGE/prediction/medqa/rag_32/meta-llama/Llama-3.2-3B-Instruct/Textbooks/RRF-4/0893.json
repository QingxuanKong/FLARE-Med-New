The patient has no past medical history and takes no prescription medications. He does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. The patient\u2019s vitals are currently within normal limits. On examination, the physician notices 2 clean puncture wounds with localized cellulitis. Capillary refill is 2 seconds. Sensorimotor evaluation of the hand is without deficits.

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate treatment choice for this patient, we need to consider the following factors: the type of wound, the presence of cellulitis, and the patient's medical history. The patient has two clean puncture wounds with localized cellulitis, which indicates a bacterial infection. The patient does not have any past medical history or take any prescription medications, and does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. This suggests that the patient is generally healthy and can tolerate most antibiotics. The sensorimotor evaluation of the hand is without deficits, which indicates that the nerve damage is minimal. The capillary refill is 2 seconds, which is slightly prolonged, but not excessively so. Based on these factors, we can consider the following antibiotic options: Amoxicillin (A) is a good choice for treating bacterial infections, but it may not be effective against certain types of bacteria such as MRSA. Amoxicillin-clavulanate (B) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including MRSA. Clindamycin (C) is also a broad-spectrum antibiotic, but it may have gastrointestinal side effects. Doxycycline (D) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, but it may not be suitable for patients with a history of clostridioides difficile infection. Given the patient's clean puncture wounds and localized cellulitis, Amoxicillin-clavulanate (B) is the most appropriate treatment choice. This antibiotic combination is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including MRSA, and has a good safety profile for this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Ultrasound reveals a deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity; chest computed tomography scan confirms the presence of pulmonary emboli. Laboratory blood tests indicate elevated d-dimer levels. What therapy is indicated acutely? What are the long-term therapy options? How long should she be treated? Should this indi-vidual use oral contraceptives? A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency depart-ment complaining of acute onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic pain. She had been in her usual state of health until 2 days prior when she noted that her left leg was swollen and red. Her only medication was oral contraceptives. Family history was significant for a history of \u201cblood clots\u201d in mul-tiple members of the maternal side of her family. Physical examination demonstrates an anxious woman with stable vital signs. The left"

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."

The workup proceeds in an orderly fashion until a diagnosis is obtained. Once a benign diagnosis is secured (by strong clinical suspicion in an experienced hand surgeon, radiographic evidence, or tissue biopsy), further workup is not needed; this may occur at any point in the workup of a mass.Most hand masses are benign and can be readily diagnosed"

A 35-year-old man had a soft mass approximately 3 cm in diameter in the right scrotum. The diagnosis was a right indirect inguinal hernia. What were the examination findings? The mass was not tender and the physician was not able to \u201cget above it.\u201d The testes were felt separate from the mass, and a transillumination test (in which a bright light is placed behind the scrotum and the scrotal sac is viewed from the front) was negative. (A positive test occurs when the light penetrates through the scrotum.) When the patient stood up, a positive cough \u201cimpulse\u201d was felt within the mass. After careful and delicate maneuvering, the mass could be massaged into the inguinal canal, so emptying from the scrotum. When the massaging hand was removed, the mass recurred in the scrotum."

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"
