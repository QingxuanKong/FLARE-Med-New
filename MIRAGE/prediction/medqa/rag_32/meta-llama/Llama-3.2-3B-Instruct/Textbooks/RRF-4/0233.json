The patient complains of a loss of sensation in his toes and fingertips, which has caused him to injure himself often. This symptom suggests a condition that affects the peripheral nerves. The patient is also described as having thick skin with many lesions, which could be indicative of a condition that affects the skin and potentially has a systemic component. The most likely condition that comes to mind is leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease. Leprosy is a chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae that primarily affects the skin, nerves, and mucous membranes. It can cause nerve damage, leading to loss of sensation, and skin lesions. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with leprosy. The bacteria that are likely to be found in the skin biopsy are acid-fast, which means they resist decolorization with acid alcohol, a characteristic feature of Mycobacterium leprae, the causative agent of leprosy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Specific rashes are often extremely helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis of an infection (Chaps. 24 and 25e).

Peripheral neuropathy results in reduced sensation, and therefore minor injuries can often go unnoticed. This patient has developed an ulcer on his heel, which is a pressure point and likely to be under repeated strain. The nurse examined the ulcer and found that the ulcer was looking infected with pus at the base of the ulcer and asked for a specialist orthopedic opinion, who requested an x-ray and an MRI.

            "content": "Leprosy most commonly presents with both characteristic skin lesions and skin histopathology. Thus the disease should be suspected when a patient from an endemic area has suggestive skin lesions or peripheral neuropathy. The diagnosis should be confirmed by histopathology. In tuberculoid leprosy, lesional areas\u2014preferably the advancing edge\u2014 must be biopsied because normal-appearing skin does not have pathologic features. In lepromatous leprosy, nodules, plaques, and indurated areas are optimal biopsy sites, but biopsies of normal-appearing skin also are generally diagnostic. Lepromatous leprosy is associated with diffuse hyperglobulinemia, which may result in false-positive serologic tests (e.g., Venereal Disease Research Laboratory, rheumatoid arthritis, and antinuclear antibody tests) and therefore may cause diagnostic confusion. On occasion, tuberculoid lesions may not (1) appear typical, (2) be hypesthetic, and (3) contain granulomas (instead containing only nonspecific"

            "content": "(see below). In patients with localized disease, AD may be suspected because of a typical personal or family history or the presence of cutaneous stigmata of AD such as perioral pallor, an extra fold of skin beneath the lower eyelid (Dennie-Morgan folds), increased palmar skin markings, and an increased incidence of cutaneous infections, particularly with Staphylococcus aureus. Regardless of other manifestations, pruritus is a prominent characteristic of AD in all age groups and is exacerbated by dry skin. Many of the cutaneous findings in affected patients, such as lichenification, are secondary to rubbing and scratching."

It has been observed especially often in elderly women. The skin lesions, which are usually 1151 found on the acral surface of an arm or leg, begin insidiously with reddish-violaceous discoloration; they become sclerotic or atrophic over a period of years."

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."
