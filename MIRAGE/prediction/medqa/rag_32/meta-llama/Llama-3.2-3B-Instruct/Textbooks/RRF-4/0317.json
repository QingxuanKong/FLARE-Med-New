He reports that his vision has progressively improved over the past 6 months and he no longer needs the glasses he used while driving. He has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include glyburide, hydrochlorothiazide, and enalapril. Examination shows 20/20 vision bilaterally. Fundoscopy shows a few microaneurysms of retinal vessels. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's improved vision?",

Option B, liquefication of the vitreous body, is a sign of age-related macular degeneration, not directly related to diabetic retinopathy. Option C, increased ciliary muscle tone, is not a known effect of diabetes on vision. Option D, increased lens elasticity, is a plausible explanation for improved vision in a diabetic patient. As diabetes is managed and blood glucose levels are controlled, the lens becomes less rigid and more elastic, allowing for improved vision.\\n\\nGiven the patient's diabetes and improvement in vision, the most likely explanation for his improved vision is related to the effects of diabetes on the lens of the eye.\\n\\nAnswer: D\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The gravity of this problem is highlighted by the finding that individuals with DM are 25 times more likely to become legally blind than individuals without DM. Severe vision loss is primarily the result of progressive diabetic retinopathy and clinically significant macular edema. Diabetic retinopathy is classified into two stages: nonproliferative and proliferative. Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy usually appears late in the first decade or early in the second decade of the disease and is marked by retinal vascular microaneurysms, blot hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots (Fig. 419-2). Mild nonproliferative retinopathy may progress to more extensive disease, characterized by changes in venous vessel caliber, intraretinal microvascular"

The earliest changes are of microaneurysms, and tiny intraretinal hemorrhages; these are present in almost all diabetics who have had type 1 disease for more than 20 years. Cotton-wool spots and small hemorrhages appear as the retina becomes ischemic. Subsequently, there is a more threatening proliferative retinopathy that consists of the formation of new blood vessels, and consequent leakage of proteins and blood. The proliferative feature occurs in half of type 1 diabetics, and 10 percent of those who have had type 2 disease for 15 to 20 years. The new vessels can grow into the vitreous, and hemorrhages from them may cause traction on the retina, which results in detachment. Visual loss may also be the result of macular edema. Reabsorption of the edema leads to the deposition of"

            "content": "In the investigation of a disturbance of vision, one inquires as to what the patient means when he claims that he cannot see properly, for the disturbance in question may vary from nearor farsightedness to diplopia, partial syncope, dizziness, or a hemianopia. Fortunately, the patient\u2019s statement can be checked by the measurement of visual acuity, which is an essential part of the ocular examination. Inspection of the refractive media and the optic fundi, the testing of pupillary reflexes, color vision, and the plotting of visual fields complete this part of the examination. Examination of the eye movements is also essential, particularly if amblyopia predicated on an early life strabismus is suspected, as discussed in Chap. 13."

For convenience, a scale version of the Snellen chart called the Rosenbaum card is held at 36 cm (14 in.) from the patient (Fig. 39-1). All subjects should be able to read the 6/6 m (20/20 ft) line with each eye using their refractive correction, if any. Patients who need reading glasses because of presbyopia must wear them for accurate testing with the Rosenbaum card. If 6/6 (20/20) acuity is not present in each eye, the deficiency in vision must be explained. If it is worse than 6/240 (20/800), acuity should be recorded in terms of counting fingers, hand motions, light perception, or no light perception. Legal blindness is defined by the Internal Revenue Service as a best corrected acuity of 6/60 (20/200) or less in the better eye or a binocular visual field subtending 20\u00b0 or less. For driving the laws vary by state, but most states require a corrected acuity of 6/12 (20/40) in at least one eye for unrestricted"

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

            "content": "With the onset of middle age, presbyopia develops as the lens within the eye becomes unable to increase its refractive power to accommodate on near objects. To compensate for presbyopia an emmetropic patient must use reading glasses. A patient already wearing glasses for distance correction usually switches to bifocals. The only exception is a myopic patient, who may achieve clear vision at near simply by removing glasses containing the distance prescription. Refractive errors usually develop slowly and remain stable after adolescence, except in unusual circumstances. For example, the acute onset of diabetes mellitus can produce sudden myopia because of lens edema induced by hyperglycemia. Testing vision through a pinhole aperture is a useful way to screen quickly for refractive error. If visual acuity is better through a pinhole than it is with the unaided eye, the patient needs refraction to obtain best corrected visual acuity."
