    "question": "A 12-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of persistent bleeding from his nose over the past hour. The bleeding started spontaneously. He has no history of a similar episode. He takes no medications. There is no history of abnormal bleeding in the family. His vital signs are within normal limits. On examination, he is pressing a gauze against his left nostril while hyperextending his head. The gauze is stained with blood and upon withdrawal of the gauze blood slowly drips out of his left nostrils. There is no bleeding from the right nostril. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial therapy?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the given information and the potential choices step by step.\\n\\nThe patient is a 12-year-old boy presenting with spontaneous nosebleeds that have been ongoing for the past hour. The bleeding is unilateral, with the left nostril being affected and the right nostril not bleeding. The patient is applying pressure to the left nostril with a gauze, which is stained with blood. This suggests that the bleeding is coming from the left nostril.\\n\\nThe key points to consider in this scenario are the unilateral nature of the bleeding, the spontaneous onset, and the presence of blood in the nostril upon withdrawal of the gauze. These findings are suggestive of a nasal septal hematoma or a Kiesselbach's plexus hematoma, which is a common cause of anterior epistaxis (nosebleeds) in children.\\n\\nNow, let's evaluate the potential choices:\\n\\nA. Anterior packing and topical antibiotics: This is a common treatment for nasal septal hematomas or Kiesselbach's plexus hematomas. The packing helps to apply pressure to the affected area and promote clotting, while topical antibiotics help to prevent infection.\\n\\nB. Oxymetazoline nasal spray: This is a vasoconstrictor that can help to reduce bleeding by constricting the blood vessels in the nose. However, it may not be as effective as anterior packing in this scenario.\\n\\nC. Placement of an epinephrine gauze in the left nostril: Epinephrine can also constrict blood vessels and may help to reduce bleeding. However, it is not as commonly used as anterior packing in this scenario.\\n\\nD. Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated: This method can help to apply pressure to the affected area, but it may not be as effective as anterior packing and may not provide adequate pressure to the nasal septum.\\n\\nConsidering the above points, the most appropriate initial therapy for this patient would be anterior packing and topical antibiotics. This approach addresses the underlying cause of the bleeding (nasal septal hematoma or Kiesselbach's plexus hematoma) and helps to promote clotting and prevent infection.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

However, the bleeding was profuse and on two occasions required hospital admission and nasal packing. On inspection an indurated area was noted. The typical findings are an indurated area in the anterior inferior aspect of the nasal septum (Kiesselbach\u2019s area). This is a very vascular area that has a considerable number of veins, which are often traumatized during nose picking. The patient underwent treatment. Typical treatment is cauterization of these prominent veins in Kiesselbach\u2019s area, which is usually performed by a simple local analgesia and the application of silver nitrate. Unfortunately, the boy was involved in a fight the next day and again developed severe epistaxis, which again was difficult to control."

If the bleeding is GI, it is important to determine the source as high in the GI tract ordistal to the ligament of Treitz. Vomited blood is always proximal. Rectal bleeding may be coming from anywhere in the gut.When dark clots or melena are seen mixed with stool, a higherlocation is suspected, whereas bright red blood on the surface ofstool probably is coming from lower in the colon.

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis.

In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

First, it is difficult for the patient or caregivers to quantify the volume of blood being lost. Second, and most relevant, the rate of bleeding nec-essary to incite respiratory compromise is highly dependent on the individual\u2019s prior respiratory status. For example, the loss of 100 mL of blood over 24 hours in a 40-year-old male with normal pulmonary function would be of little immediate con-sequence, because his normal cough would ensure his ability to clear the blood and secretions. In contrast, the same amount of bleeding in a 69-year-old male with severe COPD, chronic bronchitis, and an FEV1 of 1.1 L may be life-threatening.Anatomy. The lungs have two sources of blood supply: the pulmonary and bronchial arterial systems. The pulmonary sys-tem is a high-compliance, low-pressure system, and the walls of the pulmonary arteries are very thin and delicate. The bronchial"

On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."

            "content": "Initial Evaluation The initial evaluation of the bleeding patient focuses on the severity of hemorrhage as reflected by the postural vital signs, the frequency of hematemesis or melena, and (in some cases) findings on nasogastric lavage. Decreases in hematocrit and hemoglobin lag behind the clinical course and are not reliable gauges of the magnitude of acute bleeding. This initial evaluation, completed well before the bleeding source is confidently identified, guides immediate supportive care of the patient, triage to the ward or intensive care unit, and timing of endoscopy. The severity of the initial hemorrhage is the most important indication for urgent endoscopy, since a large initial bleed increases the likelihood of ongoing or recurrent bleeding. Patients with resting hypotension or orthostatic change in vital signs, repeated hematemesis, or bloody nasogastric aspirate that does not clear with large-volume lavage, or those requiring blood transfusions, should be considered for"

This syndrome, characterized by acute upper GI bleeding following vomiting, is considered to be the cause of up to 15% of all severe upper GI bleeds. The mechanism is similar to spontaneous esophageal perforation: an acute increase in intra-abdominal pressure against a closed glottis in a patient with a hiatal hernia.Mallory-Weiss tears are characterized by arterial bleeding, which may be massive. Vomiting is not an obligatory factor, as there may be other causes of an acute increase in intra-abdominal pressure, such as paroxysmal coughing, seizures, and retching. The diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, par-ticularly in the patient who develops upper GI bleeding follow-ing prolonged vomiting or retching. Upper endoscopy confirms the suspicion by identifying one or more longitudinal fissures in the mucosa of the herniated stomach as the source of bleeding.In the majority of patients, the bleeding will stop"

He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."
