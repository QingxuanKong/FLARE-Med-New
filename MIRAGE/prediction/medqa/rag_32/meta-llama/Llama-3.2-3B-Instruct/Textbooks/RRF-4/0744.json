    "question": "An 18-year-old college student presents to the student health clinic complaining of excessive sleepiness. He first noticed the daytime sleepiness about a year ago but reports that it significantly worsened once he started college. He reports that he goes to bed around 9 p.m. and wakes up for class at 8 a.m.. He naps between classes for a total of 4 hours during the day. Despite this, he wakes up feeling exhausted. He easily falls asleep during class and while studying. This has started to affect both his academics and his social life. On weekends, he can sleep up to 20 hours a day. He reports 2 recent episodes of sudden generalized body weakness along with ptosis and difficulty speaking that occurred after he became angry. Each episode lasted about 10 seconds, but he says he felt back to normal within 15 minutes without any persistent deficits. His Epworth Sleepiness Scale score is 17. Which of the following is the best next step in therapy?",

The patient\\u2019s symptoms include falling asleep during class and while studying, waking up feeling exhausted despite napping, and episodes of sudden generalized body weakness, ptosis, and difficulty speaking after becoming angry. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 17 indicates a high level of sleepiness. The patient\\u2019s sleep schedule is irregular, with bedtimes and wake-up times varying greatly between weekdays and weekends. This pattern is consistent with delayed sleep phase syndrome, which is a chronic inability to fall asleep and to arise at conventional clock times. The patient\\u2019s symptoms are not typical of narcolepsy, which is characterized by sudden attacks of excessive daytime sleepiness, often accompanied by cataplexy, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The patient\\u2019s symptoms do not suggest hypersomnolence disorder, which is characterized by excessive sleepiness due to prolonged sleep duration or nonrestorative sleep. The patient\\u2019s symptoms are more consistent with delayed sleep phase syndrome, which is a common cause of excessive daytime sleepiness in young adults. The best next step in therapy would be to discuss the patient\\u2019s sleep schedule and lifestyle with him, and encourage him to establish a consistent sleep schedule, including going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, including weekends. This can help regulate his circadian rhythms and improve the quality of his sleep. Additionally, the patient may benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) to address any underlying sleep-related issues and improve sleep hygiene. Modafinil, a wakefulness-promoting agent, may also be considered as an adjunctive treatment to help improve alertness and reduce sleepiness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

To determine the extent and impact of sleepiness on daytime function, it is helpful to ask patients about the occurrence of sleep episodes during normal waking hours, both intentional and unintentional. Specific areas to be addressed include the occurrence of inadvertent sleep episodes while driving or in other safety-related settings, sleepiness while at work or school (and the relationship of sleepiness to work and school performance), and the effect of sleepiness on social and family life. Standardized questionnaires such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale are often used clinically to measure sleepiness."

Sleep onset is delayed until 3 to 6 a.m.; the subject then sleeps normally until 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. An imposed sleep period from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. leads to a prolonged sleep latency and daytime sleepiness. By contrast, the advanced-sleep-phase syndrome is characterized by an early evening sleep onset (8 to 9 p.m.) and early morning awakening (3 to 5 a.m.). Simply delaying the onset of sleep usually fails to prevent early morning awakening. This pattern is not uncommon among healthy elderly persons (and also among college students), in whom it should probably not be defined as an insomnia syndrome. Still other persons show a completely irregular sleep\u2013wake pattern; sleep consists of persistent but variable short or long naps throughout the night and day, with a nearly normal 24-h accumulation of sleep."

As is typical with any disorder that causes sleepiness, individuals with chronically insufficient sleep may feel inattentive, irritable, unmotivated, and depressed, and have difficulty with school, work, and driving. Individuals differ in their optimal amount of sleep, and it can be helpful to ask how much sleep the patient obtains on a quiet vacation when he or she can sleep without restrictions. Some patients may think that a short amount of sleep is normal or advantageous, and they may not appreciate their biological need for more sleep, especially if coffee and other stimulants mask the sleepiness. A 2-week sleep log documenting the timing of sleep and daily level of alertness is diagnostically useful and provides helpful feedback for the patient. Extending sleep to the optimal amount on a regular basis can resolve the sleepiness and other symptoms. As with any lifestyle change, extending sleep requires commitment and adjustments, but the improvements"

Several times a day, usually after meals or while sitting in class or in other boring or sedentary situations, the affected person is assailed by an uncontrollable desire to sleep. The eyes close, the muscles relax, breathing deepens slightly, and by all appearances, the individual is dozing.

The MSLT measures a patient\u2019s propensity to sleep under quiet conditions. The test is performed after an overnight polysomnogram to establish that the patient has had an adequate amount of good-quality nighttime sleep. The MSLT consists of five 20-min nap opportunities every 2 h across the day. The patient is instructed to try to fall asleep, and the major endpoints are the average latency to sleep and the occurrence of REM sleep during the naps. An average sleep latency across the naps of less than 8 min is considered objective evidence of excessive daytime sleepiness. REM sleep normally occurs only during the nighttime sleep episode, and the occurrence of REM sleep in two or more of the MSLT naps provides support for the diagnosis of narcolepsy."

Individuals typically pre- sent with periods of insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or both, which alternate with short asymptomatic periods. Starting with the asymptomatic period, when the individual's sleep phase is aligned to the external environment, sleep latency will gradually increase and the individual will complain of sleep-onset insomnia. As the sleep phase continues to drift so that sleep time is now in the daytime, the individual will have trouble staying awake during the day and will complain of sleepiness. Because the circadian period is not aligned to the external 24\u2014hour environment, symptoms will depend on when an individ- ual tries to sleep in relation to the circadian rhythm of sleep propensity."

Across the five naps of the MSLT, most patients with narcolepsy will fall asleep in less than 8 min on average, and they will have episodes of REM sleep in at least two of the naps. Abnormal regulation of REM sleep is also manifested by the appearance of REM sleep within 15 min of sleep onset at night, which is rare in healthy individuals sleeping at their habitual bedtime. Stimulants should be stopped 1 week before the MSLT and antidepressants should be stopped 3 weeks prior, because these medications can affect the MSLT.

Physicians should inquire about when the patient typically goes to bed, when they fall asleep and wake up, whether they awaken during sleep, whether they feel rested in the morning, and whether they nap during the day. Depending on the primary complaint, it may be useful to ask about snoring, witnessed apneas, restless sensations in the legs, movements during sleep, depression, anxiety, and behaviors around the sleep episode.

After the call was transferred to 911, emergency medical technicians responded quickly and discovered that the young man was not breathing and that he had choked on his vomit. He was rushed to the hospital, where he remained in a coma for 2 days before ultimately being pronounced dead. The"

            "content": "In addition to jet lag associated with travel across time zones, many patients report a behavioral pattern that has been termed social jet lag, in which bedtimes and wake times on weekends or days off occur 4\u20138 h later than during the week. Such recurrent displacement of the timing of the sleep-wake cycle is common in adolescents and young adults and is associated with sleep-onset insomnia, poorer academic performance, increased risk of depressive symptoms, and excessive daytime sleepiness."

A 33-year-old man was playing cricket for his local Sunday team. As the new bowler pitched the ball short, it bounced higher than he anticipated and hit him on the side of his head. He immediately fell to the ground unconscious, but after about 30 seconds he was helped to his feet and felt otherwise well. It was noted he had some bruising around his temple. He decided not to continue playing and went to watch the match from the side. Over the next hour he became extremely sleepy and was eventually unrousable. He was rushed to hospital. When he was admitted to hospital, the patient\u2019s breathing was shallow and irregular and it was necessary to intubate him. A skull radiograph demonstrated a fracture in the region of the pterion. No other abnormality was demonstrated other than minor soft tissue bruising over the left temporal fossa. A CT scan was performed."

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

Persistent: Symptoms last 3 months or longer. Recurrent: Two or more episodes occur within the space of 1 year. The delayed sleep phase type is based primarily on a history of a delay in the timing of the major sleep period (usually more than 2 hours) in relation to the desired sleep and wake\u2014 up time, resulting in symptoms of insomnia and excessive sleepiness. When allowed to set their own schedule, individuals with delayed sleep phase type exhibit normal sleep qual- ity and duration for age. Symptoms of sleep\u2014onset insomnia, difficulty waking in the morning, and excessive early day sleepiness are prominent."
