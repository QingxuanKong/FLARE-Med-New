The social history includes participation in school wrestling, which suggests exposure to other people and possibly shared personal items. The absence of a significant family history is also noted.\\n\\nThe physical examination reveals an erythematous, well-demarcated patch on his left thigh, over his pubic region, and throughout the perineum. The scrotum is spared.\\n\\nGiven the location of the rash and the absence of scrotal involvement, we can rule out Tinea cruris (B) and Tinea unguium (D), as these conditions typically affect the scrotum.\\n\\nTinea corporis (A) is a possibility, but the distribution of the rash on the thigh, pubic region, and perineum is not typical for this condition.\\n\\nCandidal balanitis (C) is less likely, as the rash is not described as being on the glans penis, and the absence of other symptoms such as redness, swelling, or discharge makes this diagnosis less probable.\\n\\nConsidering the distribution of the rash and the absence of scrotal involvement, the most likely diagnosis is Tinea cruris, which is a fungal infection of the groin area.\\n\\nThis condition is common in young men, particularly those who participate in sports or activities that involve sweating, such as wrestling.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.

Burrows appear as dark wavy lines in the upper epidermis and are 3\u201315 mm long. Scabetic lesions are most common on the volar wrists and along the digital web spaces. In males, the penis and scrotum become involved. Small papules and vesicles, often accompanied by eczematous plaques, pustules, or nodules, appear symmetrically at those sites; within intertriginous areas; around the navel and belt line; in the axillae; and on the buttocks and upper thighs. Except in infants, the face, scalp, neck, palms, and soles are usually spared. Crusted scabies often resembles psoriasis: both are characterized by widespread thick keratotic crusts, scaly plaques, and dystrophic nails. Characteristic burrows are not seen in crusted scabies, and patients usually do not itch, although their infestations are highly contagious and"

Severe and paroxysmal itching is the hallmark, with complaints of itching that is frequently worse than the eruption would suggest. Most children exhibit an eczematous eruption composed of red, excoriated papules and nodules. The classic linear papule or burrow is often difficult to find. Distribution is the most diagnostic finding; the papules are found in the axillae, umbilicus, groin, penis, instep of the foot, and web spaces of the fingers and toes (Fig. 196-1). Infants infested with scabies have diffuse erythema, scaling, and pinpoint papules. Pustules, vesicles, and nodules are much more common in infants and may be more diffusely distributed.

Acne may begin as early as 8 years of age and may continue into adulthood. Acne primarily affects areas with increased sebaceous glanddensity, such as the face, upper chest, and back. Superficialplugging of the pilosebaceous unit results in noninflammatorysmall (1to 2-mm) open (blackhead) and closed (whitehead) comedones. An open comedo is less likely to become inflammatory than a closed comedo. Rupture of a comedo into adjacent dermis and proliferation of P. acnes induce an inflammatory response and development of inflammatory papules and pustules. Larger, skin-colored or red cysts and nodulesrepresent deeper plugging and cystic acne. Increased and persistent inflammation, especially with rupture of a deep cyst,increases the risk of scarring."

They are red, irregular, macular patches resultingfrom dilation of dermal capillaries and are usually found on thenape of the neck, the eyelids, and the glabella. Most of the faciallesions fade by 1 year of age, but lesions on the neck may persistfor life.

He was recently incarcerated near Bakersfield, California and returned to Oakland about 3 months ago. He is currently experiencing one month of severe headache and double vision. He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

The most important step in the diagnostic workup is the search for potentially diagnostic clues (PDCs) through complete and repeated history-taking and physical examination and the obligatory investigations listed above. PDCs are defined as all localizing signs, symptoms, and abnormalities potentially pointing toward a diagnosis. Although PDCs are often misleading, only with their help can a concise list of probable diagnoses be made. The history should include information about the fever pattern (continuous or recurrent) and duration, previous medical history, present and recent drug use, family history, sexual history, country of origin, recent and remote travel, unusual environmental exposures associated with travel or hobbies, and animal contacts. A complete physical examination should be performed, with special attention to the eyes, lymph nodes, temporal arteries, liver, spleen, sites of previous surgery,"

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension.

Although men are more commonly and severely affected, women can also show severe signs of the disease. Angiokeratomas are reddish-purple maculopapular lesions that are usually found around the umbilicus, scrotum, inguinal region, and perineum. Burning or lancinating pain in the hands and feet often develops in males in late childhood or early adult life. However, the neuropathy is usually overshadowed by complications arising from the associated premature atherosclerosis (e.g., hypertension, renal failure, cardiac disease, and stroke) that often lead to death by the fifth decade of life. Some patients also manifest primarily with a dilated cardiomyopathy."
