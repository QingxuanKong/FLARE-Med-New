    "question": "A 23-year-old college student presents to the clinic with a history of intermittent chest discomfort. He reports that, about once per month for the past 8 or 9 months, he's had episodes of \"feeling like my chest is going to explode.\" During these episodes, he also feels shortness of breath, feels shakiness throughout his arms and legs, and sweats so heavily that he needs to change his shirt. He is unsure of any clear precipitating factors but thinks they may occur more often around important exams or when big school projects are due. He shares that, as these episodes continue to recur, he has had mounting anxiety about having one when he is in class or at a restaurant. As a result, he is leaving the house less and less. He has no past medical history; the physical exam is unremarkable. Which of the following is the best medication for the long-term management of this patient's condition?",

The patient's history of mounting anxiety about having a panic attack during important situations also suggests a diagnosis of panic disorder. The physical examination is unremarkable, which is consistent with a diagnosis of panic disorder rather than a cardiac cause for the chest discomfort. The patient's symptoms are well-matched to the diagnostic criteria for panic disorder, which includes recurrent panic attacks, persistent worry about having another panic attack, and significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The patient's symptoms have been ongoing for 8-9 months, which is consistent with the diagnosis of panic disorder. The patient's avoidance of social situations due to fear of having a panic attack also suggests a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, which often co-occurs with panic disorder. However, the primary diagnosis is panic disorder. The patient's symptoms are not better explained by another medical condition, such as a cardiac cause for the chest discomfort. Therefore, the best medication for the long-term management of this patient's condition is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which is a common first-line treatment for panic disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Even though the typical history of dissection differs from that of MI, dissection is far less prevalent, so diagnosing dissection remains challenging unless it is explicitly and routinely considered as a diagnostic imperative (Chap. 301). If the clinician fails to elicit any of the characteristic features of dissection by history and finds equivalent blood pressures in both arms and no pulse deficits, he may feel comfortable discarding the aortic dissection hypothesis. If, however, the chest x-ray shows a possible widened mediastinum, the hypothesis may be reinstated and an appropriate imaging test ordered"

On examination he had a reduced peripheral pulse on the left foot compared to the right. On direct questioning, the patient revealed that he experienced severe left-sided buttock pain after walking 100 yards. After a short period of rest, he could walk another 100 yards before the same symptoms recurred. He also noticed that over the past year he was unable to obtain an erection. He smoked heavily and was on no other drugs or treatment."

            "content": "Some patients may be able to identify their symptoms only when asked to compare them with the feeling of movement they experience when they come to a halt after rapid rotation. If the patient is unobservant or imprecise in descriptions, a helpful tactic is to provoke sensations by rapid rotation, or by asking the patient to stoop for a minute and straighten up; having him stand relaxed for 3 min and checking his blood pressure for orthostatic effect; and, particularly, having him hyperventilate for 3 min. Should the patient be unable to distinguish among these several types of induced dizziness or to ascertain the similarity of one of the types to his own condition, the history is probably too inaccurate for purposes of diagnosis."

            "content": "Much of this change in behavior is accepted by the patient with forbearance; if any complaint is made, it is of being weak, tired, or dizzy (nonvertiginous). Within a few weeks or months, these symptoms become more prominent. When the patient is questioned, a long pause precedes each reply (abulia); at times the patient may not respond at all. Or, at the moment the examiner decides that the patient has not heard the question and prepares to repeat it, an appropriate answer is given, usually in few words. Moreover, the responses are often more intelligent than one would expect, considering the patient\u2019s torpid mental state. Many of these features will be recognized as components of a frontal lobe syndrome, but the tumor is often situated elsewhere, or is diffusely infiltrative. There are, in addition, patients who are overtly confused or demented. If the condition remains untreated, dullness and somnolence increase gradually and, finally, as increased intracranial pressure supervenes,"

Symptoms generally last approximately 15 minutes andare generally time-limited. It is common for patients to thinkthat they are about to die of a heart attack.

            "content": "Pain is the most common presenting complaint in patients with STEMI. The pain is deep and visceral; adjectives commonly used to 1600 describe it are heavy, squeezing, and crushing, although, occasionally, it is described as stabbing or burning (Chap. 19). It is similar in character to the discomfort of angina pectoris (Chap. 293) but commonly occurs at rest, is usually more severe, and lasts longer. Typically, the pain involves the central portion of the chest and/or the epigastrium, and, on occasion, it radiates to the arms. Less common sites of radiation include the abdomen, back, lower jaw, and neck. The frequent location of the pain beneath the xiphoid and epigastrium and the patients\u2019 denial that they may be suffering a heart attack are chiefly responsible for the common mistaken impression of indigestion. The pain of STEMI may radiate as high as the occipital area but not below the umbilicus. It is often accompanied by weakness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, and a sense"

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian"
