    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely cause of the patient's condition, we need to analyze the symptoms and the location of the affected area. The patient has severe abdominal pain and nausea, and the affected area is the hepatic colonic flexure and an adjacent segment of the transverse colon. This location is consistent with ischemia of the left colon, which is typically supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). The IMA is a branch of the aorta that arises below the renal arteries and supplies the distal one-third of the transverse colon, the sigmoid colon, and the rectum. Occlusion of the IMA can lead to ischemia of these areas, resulting in the symptoms and signs presented by the patient. The other options are less likely to cause ischemia in this location. The median sacral artery is a branch of the aorta that supplies the lower part of the spine and the sacrum, and is not typically involved in supplying the colon. The celiac artery is a major branch of the aorta that supplies the foregut, including the stomach, liver, and spleen, but not the colon. The superior mesenteric artery is a major branch of the aorta that supplies the midgut, including the small intestine and the right colon, but not the left colon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

In mild cases, patients may have diarrhea (usually bloody) without abdominal pain. With more severe ischemia, intense abdominal pain (often out of proportion to the clinical examination), tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis are present. Peritonitis and/or systemic toxicity are signs of full-thickness necrosis and perforation.The diagnosis of ischemic colitis is often based on the clinical history and physical examination.

She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Abdominal ultrasound for diagnosis or to follow an aneurysm over time. CT may be useful to determine the precise anatomy. In asymptomatic patients, monitoring is appropriate for lesions < 5 cm. Surgical repair is indicated if the lesion is > 5.5 cm (abdominal), > 6 cm (thoracic), or smaller but rapidly enlarging. Emergent surgery for symptomatic or ruptured aneurysms. A transverse tear in the intima of a vessel that results in blood entering the media, creating a false lumen and leading to a hematoma that propagates longitudinally. Most commonly 2\u00b0 to hypertension. The most common sites of origin are above the aortic valve and distal to the left subclavian artery. Most often occurs at 40\u201360 years of age, with a greater frequency in males than in females."

The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy. One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC). He undergoes surgical resection and is found to have high-risk stage III CRC with five positive lymph nodes. After surgery, he feels entirely well with no symptoms. Of note, he has no other illnesses. What is this patient\u2019s overall prognosis? Based on his prognosis, what"

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

On return to the surgeon in the outpatient clinic some weeks later, the patient did not wish to continue with his colostomy and bag. Further to discussion, surgery was planned to \u201crejoin\u201d the patient. At operation the colostomy was \u201ctaken down\u201d and the rectal stump was identified. There was, however, a significant gap between the bowel ends. To enable the bowel to be sutured, the descending colon was mobilized from the posterior abdominal wall. An anastomosis was performed and the patient left the hospital 1 week later and currently remains well. A 72-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (an expansion of the infrarenal abdominal aorta). The aneurysm measured 10 cm, and after discussion with the patient it was scheduled for repair. The surgical and endovascular treatment options were explained to the patient."
