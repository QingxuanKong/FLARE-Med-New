The joints of the hands, especially the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints, are usually the first joints involved, a feature that helps to distinguish the chondrocalcinosis associated with hemochromatosis from the idiopathic form (Chap. 395). A progressive polyarthritis involving wrists, hips, ankles, and knees may also ensue. Acute brief attacks of synovitis may be associated with deposition of calcium pyrophosphate (chondrocalcinosis or pseudogout), mainly in the knees. Radiologic manifestations include cystic changes of the subchondral bones, loss of articular cartilage with narrowing of the joint space, diffuse demineralization, hypertrophic bone proliferation, and calcification of the synovium. The arthropathy tends to progress despite removal of iron by phlebotomy. Although the relation of these abnormalities to iron"

            "content": "Most people with SLE have intermittent polyarthritis, varying from mild to disabling, characterized by soft tissue swelling and tenderness in joints and/or tendons, most commonly in hands, wrists, and knees. Joint deformities (hands and feet) develop in only 10%. Erosions on joint x-rays are rare but can be identified by ultrasound in almost half of patients. Some individuals have rheumatoid-like arthritis with erosions and fulfill criteria for both RA and SLE (\u201crhupus\u201d); they may be coded as having both diseases. If pain persists in a single joint, such as knee, shoulder, or hip, a diagnosis of ischemic necrosis of bone should be considered, particularly if there are no other manifestations of active SLE because its prevalence is increased in SLE, especially in patients treated with systemic glucocorticoids. Myositis with clinical muscle weakness, elevated creatine kinase levels, positive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)scan,andmusclenecrosis and inflammation on biopsy can occur,"

In general, hypoproliferative anemias are characterized by normocytic, normochromic red cells, although microcytic, hypochromic cells may be observed with mild iron deficiency or long-standing chronic inflammatory disease. The key laboratory tests in distinguishing between the various forms of hypoproliferative anemia include the serum iron and iron-binding capacity, evaluation of renal and thyroid function, a marrow biopsy or aspirate to detect marrow damage or infiltrative disease, and serum ferritin to assess iron stores. An iron stain of the marrow will determine the pattern of iron distribution. Patients with the anemia of acute or chronic inflammation show a distinctive pattern of serum iron (low), TIBC (normal or low), percent transferrin saturation (low), and serum ferritin (normal or high). These changes in iron values are brought"

The patient or family will describe an acute onset of pain in the groin/hip, anterior thigh, or knee. Irritation of the obturator nerve can cause referred pain in the thigh and knee when the pathology is at the hip. Patients with transient synovitis are often afebrile, walk with a painful limp, and have normal to minimally elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate compared with bacterial diseases of the hip (Table 199-1). Table 197-3 lists the differential diagnosis of a limping child. Anteroposterior and frog-leg radiographs of the hip are usually normal. Ultrasonography may reveal a joint effusion. It is mandatory to rule out septic arthritis in the presence of effusion with a joint aspiration and cell count."

Physical examination shows hyperpigmentation, hepatomegaly, and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory tests are remarkable for elevated serum transaminases (liver function tests) and fasting blood glucose. Results of other tests are pending. Correct answer = B. The patient has hereditary hemochromatosis, a disease of iron overload that results from inappropriately low levels of hepcidin caused primarily by mutations to the HFE (high iron) gene. Hepcidin regulates ferroportin, the only known iron export protein in humans, by increasing its degradation. The increase in iron with hepcidin deficiency causes hyperpigmentation and hyperglycemia (\u201cbronze diabetes\u201d). Phlebotomy or use of iron chelators is the treatment.

            "content": "Examination of involved and uninvolved joints will determine whether pain, warmth, erythema, or swelling is present. The locale and level of pain elicited by palpation or movement should be quantified. One standard would be to count the number of tender joints on palpation of 28 easily examined joints (proximal interphalangeals, metacarpophalangeals, wrists, elbows, shoulders, and knees). Similarly, the number of swollen joints (0\u201328) can be counted and recorded. Careful examination should distinguish between true articular swelling (caused by bony hypertrophy, synovial effusion or proliferation) and nonarticular (or periarticular) involvement, which usually extends beyond the normal joint margins. Synovial effusion can be distinguished from synovial hypertrophy or bony hypertrophy by palpation or specific maneuvers. For example, small to moderate knee effusions may be identified by the \u201cbulge sign\u201d or \u201cballottement of the patellae.\u201d Bursal effusions (e.g., effusions of the olecranon"
