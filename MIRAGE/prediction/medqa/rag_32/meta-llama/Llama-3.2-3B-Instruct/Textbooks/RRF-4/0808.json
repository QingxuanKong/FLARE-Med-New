    "question": "A 71-year-old woman presents to her physician accompanied by her son. She has no complaints, but her son states that the patient has impaired memory and poor orientation in space. She is ambulatory and is capable of self-care, but she tends to forget newly introduced information. Also, she got lost on the way from the home to the local market several times for the past 6 months, and her family is now afraid to let her go anywhere on her own. She does not have any concomitant chronic conditions nor did she have major cardiovascular events or head trauma. It is known that her father had dementia. The vital signs include: blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 62/min, respiratory rate is 11/min, and the temperature is 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F). The respiratory, cardiologic, and abdominal examinations are unremarkable. The neurological examination shows equal, round pupils with a normal reaction to light. The eye movements are normal with no nystagmus and normal oculocephalic reflex. There is no facial droop, the facial sensation is preserved, and there is no tongue deviation noted. There is no motor or sensory deficits on the upper and lower extremities. The patient scores 18 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Which of the following medications is indicated in the patient?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and the potential causes of dementia. The patient presents with impaired memory, poor orientation in space, and forgetfulness, which are common symptoms of dementia. The patient's father had dementia, and there is a family history of the condition. The patient's vital signs and physical examination are unremarkable, and there are no concomitant chronic conditions or major cardiovascular events. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score of 18 suggests mild cognitive impairment. Given the patient's symptoms and family history, the most likely diagnosis is Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia. The patient's medication options should be chosen based on the treatment of dementia. Imipramine (A) is a tricyclic antidepressant, which is not typically used to treat dementia. Lithium (B) is a mood stabilizer, which is not typically used to treat dementia. Donepezil (C) is a cholinesterase inhibitor, which is commonly used to treat Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Sulpiride (D) is an antipsychotic, which is not typically used to treat dementia. Therefore, the correct answer is Donepezil (C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The manner in which the patient tells the story of his illness may betray confusion or incoherence in thinking, impairment of memory or judgment, or difficulty in comprehending or expressing ideas. A more extensive examination of attention, memory, cognitive ability, and language is undertaken if the history or the manner in which it is given indicates the problem lies in those spheres. Otherwise, asking the date and place, repeating and recalling words, and simple arithmetic are adequate screening procedures. One then proceeds from an examination of the cranial nerves to the testing of motor, reflex, and sensory functions of the upper and lower limbs. This is followed by an assessment of gait and station (standing position) are observed before or after the rest of the examination."

Moreover, the responses are often more intelligent than one would expect, considering the patient\u2019s torpid mental state. Many of these features will be recognized as components of a frontal lobe syndrome, but the tumor is often situated elsewhere, or is diffusely infiltrative.

Often 30 percent or more of the body weight will have been lost by the time the patient\u2019s family insists on medical consultation. Bradycardia and hypotension are indicators for hospitalization. A fine lanugo covers the face, body, and limbs. The skin is thin and dry, without its normal elasticity, and the nails are brittle. The dental enamel is eroded. Pubic hair and breast tissue (except for loss of fat) are normal, and, in this respect, anorexia nervosa is unlike hypopituitary cachexia (Simmonds disease). Surprisingly, however, there are no neurologic signs of nutritional deficiency. The patient is alert and cheerfully indifferent to her condition. Any suggestion that she is unattractively thin or seriously depleted is rejected."

This calm attitude toward a turbulent illness and seemingly disabling physical signs is so common that it has been singled out as an important characteristic of hysteria, la belle indifference. Other patients, however, are obviously tense and anxious and report frank anxiety attacks. Emotional reactions are superficial and scenes that are disturbing to others are quickly forgotten. Claims of early life sexual or physical abuse are common and often prove to be true, or sometimes are not valid; when present, they probably play a role in the genesis of some cases (see further on)."

She is comatose, tachypneic (25 breaths per minute), and tachycardic (150 bpm), but she appears flushed, and fingertip pulse oximetry is normal (97%) breathing room air. Questioning of her parents reveals that they are homeless and have been living in their car (a small van). The nights have been cold, and they have used a small char-coal burner to keep warm inside the vehicle. What is the most likely diagnosis? What treatment should be instituted immediately?

Tremor of fast frequency and jerky restless movements are practically always present and may be of high amplitude. The face is flushed, the pupils are dilated, and the conjunctivae are injected; the pulse is rapid, blood pressure elevated, and the temperature may be raised. There is excessive sweating. Most of these signs are reflections of overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. The most certain indication of the subsidence of the attack is the occurrence of lucid intervals of increasing length and sound sleep. Recovery is usually complete. In retrospect, the patient has only a few vague memories of his illness or none at all. Single seizures may punctuate the syndrome at any time, including before its development."

The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is elevated in the early and active stages. Later there is evidence of occlusion of the brachiocephalic, subclavian, carotid, vertebral, and other arteries that may be asymptomatic or cause neurologic ischemic symptoms. The affected arteries no longer pulsate, hence the descriptive term pulseless disease. When renal arteries are involved, hypertension results, and there may be coronary occlusion, which may be fatal. Involvement of the pulmonary artery may lead to pulmonary hypertension. Coolness of the hands and weak radial pulses are common indicators of the disease and headaches are frequent. Blurring of vision, especially upon physical activity or fever, dizziness, and hemiparetic and hemisensory syndromes are the usual neurologic manifestations (Lupi-Herrera et al).

Here, the imperative is to rapidly identify patients likely to have nervous system infections, acute strokes, and spinal cord compression or other treatable mass lesions and arrange for immediate care. The Neurologic Screening Exam Daniel H. Lowenstein Knowledge of the basic neurologic examination is an essential clinical skill. A simple neurologic screening examination\u2014assessment of mental status, cranial nerves, motor system, sensory system, coordination, and gait\u2014can be reliably performed in 3\u20135 min. Although the components of the examination may appear daunting at first, skills usually improve rapidly with repetition and practice. In this video, the technique of performing a simple and efficient screening examination is presented. CHAPTER 438e The Neurologic Screening Exam"
