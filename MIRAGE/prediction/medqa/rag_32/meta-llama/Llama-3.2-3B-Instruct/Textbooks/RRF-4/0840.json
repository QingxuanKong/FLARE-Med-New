The reaction is a 14 mm raised, slightly hardened area at the injection site 48 hours after the injection of Candida into the skin. This reaction is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, as it appears 48-72 hours after antigen exposure. According to Document [3], classic delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions are initiated by mononuclear leukocytes and not by antibody alone, and are characterized by the recruitment of phagocytes and plasma to the site of antigen injection. In this scenario, the cell type that plays a role in the reaction is CD4+ T cells. According to Document [4] and [14.1 in Document [16]], CD4+ T cells are involved in delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. Therefore, the correct answer is Type IV hypersensitivity and CD4+ T cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The condition may be mild and limited to a specific area of the skin or nails, or it may take a severely disfiguring form (Candida granuloma) characterized by exophytic outgrowths on the skin. Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is usually associated with specific immunologic dysfunction; most frequently reported is a failure of T lymphocytes to proliferate or to excrete cytokines in response to stimulation by Candida antigens in vitro. A subset of the affected patients have mutations in the STAT1 gene resulting in an insufficiency of interferon \u03b3, interleukin 17, and interleukin 22."

Mycotic corneal ulcers and keratitis can be cured with topical drops as well as by direct subconjunctival injection. Fungal arthritis has been treated with adjunctive local injection directly into the joint. Candiduria responds to bladder irrigation with amphotericin B, and this route has been shown to produce no significant systemic toxicity. The toxicity of amphotericin B can be divided into two broad categories: immediate reactions, related to the infusion of the drug, and those occurring more slowly. A. Infusion-Related Toxicity"

            "content": "Treatment involves removal of any predisposing factors such as antibiotic therapy or chronic wetness and the use of appropriate topical or systemic antifungal agents. Effective topicals include nystatin or azoles (miconazole, clotrimazole, econazole, or ketoconazole). The associated inflammatory response accompanying candidal infection on glabrous skin can be treated with a mild glucocorticoid lotion or cream (2.5% hydrocortisone). Systemic therapy is usually reserved for immunosuppressed patients or individuals with chronic or recurrent disease who fail to respond to appropriate topical therapy. Oral agents approved for the treatment of candidiasis include itraconazole and fluconazole. Oral nystatin is effective only for candidiasis of the gastrointestinal tract. Griseofulvin and terbinafine are not effective."

In addition, candidal infections have an affinity for sites that are chronically wet and macerated, including the skin around nails (onycholysis and paronychia), and in intertriginous areas. Intertriginous lesions are characteristically edematous, erythematous, and scaly, with scattered \u201csatellite pustules.\u201d In males, there is often involvement of the penis and scrotum as well as the inner aspect of the thighs. In contrast to dermatophyte infections, candidal infections are frequently painful and accompanied by a marked inflammatory response. Diagnosis of candidal infection is based upon the clinical pattern and demonstration of yeast on KOH preparation or culture."
