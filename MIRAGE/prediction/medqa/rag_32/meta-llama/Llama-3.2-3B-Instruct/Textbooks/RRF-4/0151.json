This suggests that the pregnancy is likely ectopic, but the presence of an intrauterine mass also needs to be considered.\\n\\nThe ovaries are enlarged and have multiple thin-walled, septated cysts with clear content. This is a key finding that needs to be correlated with the other symptoms.\\n\\nThe question asks for the most likely cause of the ovarian findings. Let's evaluate the options given:\\n\\nA. Chocolate cysts: These are a type of ovarian cyst that occurs in women of reproductive age, often associated with endometriosis. However, they do not typically present with multiple thin-walled, septated cysts.\\n\\nB. Corpus luteum cysts: These are a type of cyst that forms in the ovary after ovulation. They can be seen in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and are characterized by multiple small cysts on the surface of the ovary. However, the description given does not match the typical appearance of corpus luteum cysts.\\n\\nC. Yolk sac tumor: This is a rare type of ovarian tumor that can occur in children and young women. It is characterized by the presence of a yolk sac within the tumor, which is not mentioned in the description.\\n\\nD. Theca lutein cysts: These are a type of ovarian cyst that occurs in response to high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which can be seen in conditions such as multiple gestations, molar pregnancy, or ovarian hyperstimulation. The description of multiple thin-walled, septated cysts with clear content is consistent with theca lutein cysts.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the most likely cause of the ovarian findings is theca lutein cysts, which are often associated with conditions that can also cause an intrauterine heteroechoic mass.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"D\"}",

It usually involves one lobe, has blood supply from the pulmonary artery, and drains into the pulmonary veins. Lesions with cysts :5 mm are generally FIGURE 10-24 Transverse (A) and sagittal (8) images of a 26-week fetus with a very large left-sided microcystic congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM).

Fortunately, the mass did not continue to grow, the ascites resolved, and the neonate was delivered at term and did well following resection. termed macrocystic, and lesions with cysts <5 mm are termed microcystic (Adzick, 1985)."

The exact prevalence of simple hepatic cysts in the U.S. population is not known, but the female to male ratio is approximately 4:1, and the prevalence is approximately 2.8% to 3.6%.71 Simple cysts are the result of excluded hyperplastic bile duct rests. Simple cysts usually are identified in hepatic imaging studies as thin-walled, homoge-neous, fluid-filled structures with few to no septations. The cyst epithelium is cuboidal and secretes a clear nonbilious serous fluid. With the exception of large cysts, simple cysts are usually asymptomatic. Large simple cysts may cause abdominal pain, epigastric fullness, and early satiety. Occasionally the affected patient presents with an abdominal mass.Asymptomatic simple cysts are best managed conserva-tively. The preferred treatment for symptomatic cysts is ultra-soundor CT-guided percutaneous cyst aspiration followed by sclerotherapy. This approach is approximately 90%"

The absence of an intrauterine pregnancy on transvaginal ultrasound evaluation in conjunction with a maternal serum hCG level above a threshold of 1,500 mIU/mL suggests the diagnosis (394,395). Heterotopic pregnancy involves concurrent intrauterine and ectopic pregnancy, usually within the fallopian tube, but ovarian implantations have been reported (395,396). The incidence of heterotopic pregnancy, which is normally rare, is particularly high (1%) after IVF treatment. Multiple gestation, smoking, previous tubal surgery, and prior PID are potential risk factors in addition to ART. As with standard ectopic pregnancies, pain and bleeding are the most common presenting findings with heterotopic pregnancies. Heterotopic pregnancies are most often diagnosed in the first 5 to 8 weeks of gestation using laparoscopy or laparotomy. Only 26% of heterotopic cases can be diagnosed with transvaginal ultrasound, possibly as a result of"

            "content": "Imaging If an ovarian or vaginal mass is suspected, a transabdominal pelvic ultrasonographic examination can provide useful information. The appearance of the ovaries (normal prepubertal size and volume, follicular development, cystic, or solid) can be noted, as well as the size and configuration of the uterus. The prepubertal uterus has a distinctive appearance, with equal proportions of cervix and fundus and a size of approximately 2 to 3.5 cm in length and 0.5 to 1 cm in width (Fig. 14.7). The uterine fundus enlarges with estrogen stimulation, resulting in the postmenarchal appearance in which the uterine fundus is larger than the cervix (19). An ultrasonographic examination should be the first imaging study performed; more sophisticated imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scanning, are rarely indicated as initial diagnostic modalities, and they add unnecessary expense and radiation exposure with CT."
