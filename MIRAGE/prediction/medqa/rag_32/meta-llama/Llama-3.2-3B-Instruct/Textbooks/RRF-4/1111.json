    "question": "A 3-year-old boy presents with episodic diarrhea with malodorous stools, stunted growth, occasional abdominal cramps, and an itchy rash. His mother says that these symptoms developed approximately 2 years ago. The patient was exclusively breastfed up to the age of 7 months. Supplementary feeding was started with non-starchy vegetable followed by starchy vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, and bread. Bread and cookies were the last product to be introduced at the age of 12 months. The patient\u2019s mother tried to withdraw dairy products from the patient\u2019s diet because she heard that lactose can cause such symptoms, but it did not help. The patient\u2019s vital signs include: blood pressure 90/55 mm Hg, heart rate 101/min, respiratory rate 19/min, and temperature 36.3\u2103 (97.3\u2109). His weight is 11 kg (24.2 lb, -2 SD) and height is 90 cm (2 ft 11 in, -1 SD). On physical examination, the patient\u2019s skin is pale with a papulovesicular rash on his abdomen and back. There are a few aphthous ulcers in the oral cavity. The abdomen is distended but no tenderness to palpation. No hepatosplenomegaly. An immunological assay is performed and shows positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies. Which of the following changes would you most likely expect to see on intestinal biopsy in this patient?",

The patient reported prior episodes of a similar nature following ingestion of a significant amount of dairy products. This clinical picture is most probably due to a deficiency in the activity of: A. isomaltase. B. lactase. C. pancreatic \u03b1-amylase. D. salivary \u03b1-amylase. E. sucrase. Correct answer = B. The physical symptoms suggest a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for carbohydrate degradation. The symptoms observed following the ingestion of dairy products suggest that the patient is deficient in lactase as a result of the age-dependent reduction in expression of the enzyme."

The symptoms range from significant malabsorption of multiple nutrients, with diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss, and the consequences of nutrient depletion (i.e., anemia and metabolic bone disease), to the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms despite evidence of the depletion of a single nutrient (e.g., iron or folate deficiency, osteomalacia, edema from protein loss).

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

In patients with persistent diarrhea not responding to simple antidiarrheal agents, a sigmoid colon biopsy should be performed to rule out microscopic colitis. In those age >40 years, an air-contrast barium enema or colonoscopy should also be performed. If the main symptoms are diarrhea and increased gas, the possibility of lactase deficiency should be ruled out with a hydrogen breath test or with evaluation after a 3-week lactose-free diet. Some patients with IBS-D may have undiagnosed celiac sprue. Because the symptoms of celiac sprue respond to a gluten-free diet, testing for celiac sprue in IBS may prevent years of morbidity and attendant expense. Decision-analysis studies show that serology testing for celiac sprue in patients with IBS-D has an acceptable cost when the prevalence of celiac sprue is >1% and is the dominant"

Vomiting differs from spitting up because ofits extremely forceful and often projectile nature. The vomited material never contains bile, because the gastric outlet obstruction is proximal to the duodenum. This featuredifferentiates pyloric stenosis from most other obstructivelesions of early childhood. Affected infants are ravenouslyhungry early in the course of the illness, but become morelethargic with increasing malnutrition and dehydration.The stomach becomes massively enlarged with retainedfood and secretions, and gastric peristaltic waves are often visible in the left upper quadrant. A hypertrophied pylorus (the \u201colive\u201d) may be palpated. As the illness progresses,very little of each feeding is able to pass through the pylorus, and the child becomes progressively thinner and moredehydrated."
