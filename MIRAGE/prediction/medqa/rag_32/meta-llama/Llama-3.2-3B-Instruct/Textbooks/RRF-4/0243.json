On physical exam, he has full range of motion of his extremities but complains of pain. His blood pressure is 126/84 mm Hg and heart rate is 74/min. The decision is made to stop the statin and return to the clinic in 2 weeks to assess any changes in symptoms. After stopping the statin, his muscular symptoms resolve. What is the next best course of action to take regarding his LDL control?",

The physical exam shows full range of motion of his extremities but complains of pain. The decision is made to stop the statin and return to the clinic in 2 weeks to assess any changes in symptoms. After stopping the statin, his muscular symptoms resolve. This suggests that the patient experienced muscle myopathy while taking rosuvastatin, which is a common side effect of statins. The next best course of action is to assess the patient's LDL control without the use of statins. The patient's LDL level is not mentioned in the provided documents, but it is generally recommended to maintain an LDL level below 100 mg/dL for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Initiating fenofibrate (B) or fish oils (D) may not be sufficient to achieve the desired LDL level. Restarting rosuvastatin at a lower dose (A) may not be necessary as the patient's symptoms resolved after stopping the statin. Initiating a different statin (C) may also not be necessary as the cause of the patient's symptoms is likely related to the statin itself, not the type of statin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

It further emphasizes that medications do not supplant a healthy lifestyle. The guideline also provides some practical suggestions regarding management of muscle symptoms attributed to statins, an issue of considerable concern to many patients and practitioners alike. In a major departure from prior guidelines, the 2013 guideline eliminates LDL targets as goals of therapy. The panel did so because major clinical trials did not titrate therapy to a goal, but rather used fixed doses of statins. Instead, the new guideline suggests different intensities of statin therapy based on risk category (Fig. 291e-4).

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

He had had limited instruction on how to manage his dia-betes. He had peripheral neuropathy, proteinuria, low HDL cholesterol levels, and hypertension. The patient underwent multifactorial intervention targeting his weight, glucose levels, and blood pressure. He was advised to stop smoking. He attended structured diabetes classes and received indi-vidualized instruction from a diabetes educator and a dieti-tian. Metformin therapy was reinitiated and his insulin doses were reduced. The patient was then given the GLP1 receptor agonist, exenatide. The patient lost about 8 kg in weight over the next 3 years and was able to stop his insulin. He had excellent control with an HbA1c of 6.5 % on a combination of metformin, exenatide, and glimepiride. His antihyperten-sive therapy was optimized and his urine albumin excretion declined to 1569 mg/g creatinine. This case"

He has hypertension, and during the last 8 years, he has been adequately managed with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH\u2019s problem? What information would you gather to confirm your diagnosis? What treatment steps would you initiate?"

The dose-response curves of pravastatin and especially of fluvastatin tend to level off in the upper part of the dosage range in patients with moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia. Those of other statins are somewhat more linear."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"
