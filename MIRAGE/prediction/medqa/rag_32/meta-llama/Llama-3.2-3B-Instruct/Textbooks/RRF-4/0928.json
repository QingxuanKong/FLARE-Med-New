    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe dyspnea, wheezing, and palpitations. His symptoms began approx. 20 minutes after being stung by a bee on the left arm. Past medical history is significant for hypertension for which he takes labetalol. While being questioned, the patient becomes obtunded. His vital signs include: temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F); blood pressure 85/55 mm Hg; pulse 110/min; respiratory rate 31/min; and oxygen saturation 90% on room air. On physical examination, an area of severe edema and erythema is noted on the extensor surface of the left forearm, and there is severe angioedema of the face and neck. The patient is intubated, and aggressive fluid resuscitation and intramuscular epinephrine are administered. A repeat blood pressure is 90/55 mm Hg, despite these efforts. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: ```json \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with severe dyspnea, wheezing, palpitations, and symptoms of anaphylaxis (severe edema and erythema on the arm, face, and neck) after being stung by a bee. The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension (low blood pressure), tachycardia (high heart rate), and respiratory distress. The patient is intubated and receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation and intramuscular epinephrine, but the blood pressure remains low. The next best step in management should be to address the underlying cause of the hypotension, which is likely due to anaphylaxis and potentially cardiac involvement. Given the patient's cardiac symptoms (palpitations) and the fact that epinephrine has not corrected the blood pressure, the next best step is to administer a medication that can help increase cardiac contractility and peripheral vascular tone. The options provided include dopamine, glucagon, dexamethasone, and norepinephrine. Dopamine can increase cardiac contractility and peripheral vascular tone, but it is not the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. Glucagon is not typically used in the treatment of anaphylaxis. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that may be used to treat allergic reactions, but it is not the best choice in this scenario where the patient is showing signs of cardiac involvement. Norepinephrine is a vasoconstrictor that can increase blood pressure, but it does not address the underlying cause of the anaphylaxis. The best choice is dopamine, as it can help increase cardiac contractility and peripheral vascular tone, which can help increase blood pressure in the setting of anaphylaxis and cardiac involvement. However, it's worth noting that the use of dopamine in this scenario should be used with caution and in conjunction with other treatments, such as epinephrine and fluid resuscitation, to manage the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Administer dopamine, but with caution and in conjunction with other treatments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" ``` Note that the answer is not a straightforward choice, and the best course of action may depend on the specific clinical scenario and the patient's response to treatment. However, based on the information provided, dopamine is the most likely next best step in management.",

Shock is not unusual and may result from (1) hypovolemia secondary to exudation of blood and plasma proteins into the retroperitoneal space; (2) increased formation and release of kinin peptides, which cause vasodilation and increased vascular permeability; and (3) systemic effects of proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes released into the circulation. Jaundice occurs infrequently; when present, it usually is due to edema of the head of the pancreas with compression of the intrapancreatic portion of the common bile duct or passage of a biliary stone or sludge. Erythematous skin nodules due to subcutaneous fat necrosis may rarely occur. In 10\u201320% of patients, there are pulmonary findings, including basilar rales, atelectasis, and pleural effusion, the latter most frequently left sided. Abdominal tenderness and muscle rigidity are present to a variable"

            "content": "The attending physician examined the back thoroughly and found no significant abnormality. He noted that there was reduced sensation in both legs, and there was virtually no power in extensor or flexor groups. The patient was tachycardic, which was believed to be due to pain, and the blood pressure obtained in the ambulance measured 120/80 mm Hg. It was noted that the patient\u2019s current blood pressure was 80/40 mm Hg; however, the patient did not complain of typical clinical symptoms of hypotension. On first inspection, it is difficult to \u201cadd up\u201d these clinical symptoms and signs. In essence we have a progressive paraplegia associated with severe back pain and an anomaly in blood pressure measurements, which are not compatible with the clinical state of the patient. It was deduced that the blood pressure measurements were obtained in different arms, and both were reassessed."

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

Hydralazine is administered intravenously with a 5-to 10-mg initial dose, and this is followed by 10-mg doses at 15-to 20-minute intervals until a satisfactory response is achieved. Although we will administer a third dose, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017 a) recommends labetalol therapy if severe hypertension persists after the second dose. Antepartum or intrapartum, the target response is a decline in systolic pressure to < 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure to 90 to 110 mm Hg. Lower diastolic pressures risk compromised placental perfusion. Hydralazine has proven remarkably efective to prevent cerebral hemorrhage. Its onset of action can be as rapid as 10 minutes. Although repeated administration every 15 to 20 minutes may theoretically lead to undesirable hypotension, this has not been our experience"

Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria.

At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

Fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and orthopnea are the most prominent complaints in patients with chronic severe MR. Palpitations are common and may signify the onset of AF. Right-sided heart failure, with painful hepatic congestion, ankle edema, distended neck veins, ascites, and secondary TR, occurs in patients with MR who have associated pulmonary vascular disease and pulmonary hypertension. Acute pulmonary edema is common in patients with acute severe MR. In patients with chronic severe MR, the arterial pressure is usually normal, although the carotid arterial pulse may show a sharp, low-volume upstroke owing to the reduced forward CO. A systolic thrill is often palpable at the cardiac apex, the LV is hyperdynamic with a brisk systolic impulse and a palpable rapid-filling wave (S3), and the apex beat is often displaced laterally."

Examination of the chest should focus on symmetry of movement; percussion (dullness is indicative of pleural effusion; hyperresonance is a sign of emphysema); and auscultation (wheezes, rhonchi, prolonged expiratory phase, and diminished breath sounds are clues to disorders of the airways; rales suggest interstitial edema or fibrosis). The cardiac examination should focus on signs of elevated right heart pressures (jugular venous distention, edema, accentuated pulmonic component to the second heart sound); left ventricular dysfunction (S3 and S4 gallops); and valvular disease (murmurs). When examining the abdomen with the patient in the supine position, the physician should note whether there is paradoxical movement of the abdomen: inward motion during inspiration is a sign of diaphragmatic"
