On arrival, he has rapid, shallow breathing and appears anxious. His pulse is 135/min, respirations are 30/min and shallow, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 80 mm Hg. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. Five minutes later, his pulse is 133/min and blood pressure is 82/45 mm Hg. Examination shows no active external bleeding. There is a 2.5-cm single stab wound to the left chest at the 4th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Cardiovascular examination shows muffled heart sounds and jugular venous distention. Breath sounds are normal. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a stab wound to the left chest, which is consistent with a penetrating trauma. The symptoms of rapid, shallow breathing, anxious appearance, tachycardia, hypotension, and muffled heart sounds are indicative of cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition where fluid accumulation in the pericardial sac compresses the heart and impairs its ability to function. The presence of jugular venous distention further supports this diagnosis. The fact that the patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated suggests that the patient is in a critical condition and requires immediate attention. The normal breath sounds and absence of tracheal deviation make options A and B less likely. The definition of paradoxical motion of part of the chest with breathing is not a typical finding in cardiac tamponade, making option D less likely. Therefore, the most likely finding is a drop in systolic blood pressure of 14 mmHg during inspiration, which is a classic sign of pulsus paradoxus, a characteristic feature of cardiac tamponade.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

            "content": "In this patient, compression of the left external iliac veins by the gravid uterus was the likely cause of stasis, which led to the deep vein thrombosis. The chest pain was due to pulmonary emboli. Small emboli were thrown off from the leading edge of the thrombus through the heart to lodge in the lungs. Small emboli cause typical pleuritic chest pain, which is exacerbated by breathing. In isolation these small pulmonary emboli may affect respiratory function, but they may be the precursor to a large and potentially fatal pulmonary embolus (eFig. 6.143). Anticoagulation was instituted and the patient had an uneventful delivery. A 45-year-old man had recently taken up squash. During a game he attempted a forehand shot and noticed severe sudden pain in his heel. He thought his opponent had hit him with his racket. When he turned, though, he realized his opponent was too far away to have hit him."

Blunt and penetrating cardiac injuries have widely dif-fering presentations and therefore disparate treatments. Survivable penetrating cardiac injuries consist of wounds that can be repaired operatively; most are stab wounds. Before repair of the injury is attempted, hemorrhage should be controlled; injuries to the atria can be clamped with a Satinsky vascular clamp, whereas digital pressure is used to occlude the majority of ventricular wounds. Foley catheter occlusion of larger stellate lesions is described, but even minimal traction may enlarge the original injury. Temporary control of hemorrhage, and at"
