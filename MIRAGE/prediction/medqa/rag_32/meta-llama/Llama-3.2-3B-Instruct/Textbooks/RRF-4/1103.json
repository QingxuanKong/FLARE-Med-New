    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the etiology of the patient's lower extremity edema, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and examination findings. The patient has a 6-month history of fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion, which suggests a possible cardiac or pulmonary issue. The 1-month history of ankle swelling is a key finding. The cardiac examination shows a widely split S2 that varies with respiration, which is consistent with pulmonary hypertension. The ECG shows right bundle branch block, which is also consistent with pulmonary hypertension. The patient's history of sleep apnea may be related to the pulmonary hypertension. Given these findings, the most likely etiology of the patient's lower extremity edema is related to the increased capillary hydrostatic pressure due to pulmonary hypertension. This is because pulmonary hypertension can cause an increase in pulmonary artery pressure, which can lead to increased pressure in the capillaries of the lower extremities, resulting in edema. The other options are less likely, as localized lymphatic obstruction (A) would not be directly related to the cardiac findings, thrombus formation in a deep vein (B) would not explain the bilateral edema, and decreased plasma oncotic pressure (D) would not be a direct consequence of pulmonary hypertension.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The physical examination in cardiogenic pulmonary edema is notable for evidence of increased intracardiac pressures (S3 gallop, elevated jugular venous pulse, peripheral edema) and rales and/or wheezes on auscultation of the chest. In contrast, the physical examination in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is dominated by the findings of the precipitating condition; pulmonary findings may be relatively normal in the early stages. The chest radiograph in cardiogenic pulmonary edema typically shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette, vascular redistribution, interstitial thickening, and perihilar alveolar infiltrates; pleural effusions are common. In noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, heart size is normal, alveolar infiltrates are distributed more uniformly throughout the lungs, and pleural effusions are uncommon."

He complained that his face and extremities had taken on a blue color. His medical history included chronic stable angina treated with isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin. Blood obtained for analysis was brown. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A. Carboxyhemoglobinemia B. Hemoglobin SC disease C. Methemoglobinemia D.

A hypotensive patient with decreased intravascular volume status may have a history suggesting hemorrhage or other volume losses (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea, polyuria). Although evidence of a reduced jugular venous pressure (JVP) is often sought, static measures of right atrial pressure do not predict fluid responsiveness reliably; the change in right atrial pressure as a function of spontaneous respiration is a better predictor of fluid responsiveness (Fig. 321-3). Patients with fluid-responsive (i.e., hypovolemic) shock also may manifest large changes in pulse pressure as a function of respiration during mechanical ventilation (Fig. 321-4). A hypotensive patient with increased intravascular volume and cardiac dysfunction may have S3 and/or S4 gallops on examination, increased JVP, extremity edema, and crackles on lung auscultation. The chest x-ray may show"

Past medical history included type 1 diabetes mellitus. A physical examination in the emergency department indicated postural hypo-tension, tachycardia, and Kussmaul respiration.

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

A young long-distance runner came to her physician with acute swelling around the lateral aspect of her ankle. This injury occurred directly after accidentally running into a pothole in the pavement. A fractured ankle was suspected. Plain anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the ankle revealed no evidence of any bone injury to account for the patient\u2019s soft tissue swelling. The patient was given a pair of crutches and analgesics and told to rest. A diagnosis of a simple sprain was made. Over the ensuing weeks the swelling and edema within the soft tissue of the ankle decreased and the patient began to run, but noted that the ankle kept \u201cgiving way.\u201d She went to an orthopedic surgeon for further assessment. There was a positive anterior drawer test of the ankle joint."
