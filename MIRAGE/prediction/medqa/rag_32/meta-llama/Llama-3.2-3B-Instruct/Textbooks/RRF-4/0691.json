A thorough history reveals that the patient suffers from phenylketonuria (PKU). She recalls being instructed by prior physicians to follow a diet that avoids certain foods; however, she admits to not being complaint with these recommendations. Laboratory testing reveals a plasma phenylalanine level of 20.2 mg/dL (normal range <2 mg/dL). Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient?",

        "A": "Improved PKU treatment will decrease the risks of spontaneous abortion and intrauterine fetal death",

        "D": "Your current phenylalanine levels do not pose a risk to any future pregnancy"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of phenylalanine. PKU is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the PAH gene, which leads to abnormally high levels of phenylalanine in the blood. If left untreated, PKU can cause intellectual impairment, autism, seizures, motor deficits, and neuropsychological abnormalities. The patient's plasma phenylalanine level is 20.2 mg/dL, which is above the normal range (< 2 mg/dL). To minimize the risk of fetal morbidity and ensure a healthy pregnancy, it is essential to manage her PKU before conception. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that women with PKU begin a phenylalanine-restricted diet 3 months prior to conception to lower phenylalanine levels to below 6 mg/dL. This will reduce the risk of fetal morbidity and prevent the transmission of the disease to the offspring. The other options are incorrect because improved PKU treatment will not decrease the risks of spontaneous abortion and intrauterine fetal death, beginning a phenylalanine-restricted diet in the first trimester may not be sufficient to reduce fetal morbidity, and current phenylalanine levels pose a risk to any future pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

Because of the lack of neonatal symptoms, laboratory testing for elevated blood levels of phenylalanine is mandatory for detection. However, the infant with PKU frequently has normal blood levels of phenylalanine at birth because the mother clears increased blood phenylalanine in her affected fetus through the placenta. Normal levels of phenylalanine may persist until the newborn is exposed to 24\u201348 hours of protein feeding. Thus, screening tests are typically done after this time to avoid false negatives. For newborns with a positive screening test, diagnosis is confirmed through quantitative determination of phenylalanine levels. 3."

The patient had no significant adverse effects from this dosage. At age 21, she had a second tonic-clonic seizure while in college; further discussion with her room-mate at that time revealed a history of two recent episodes of 1\u20132 minutes of altered consciousness with lip smacking (focal impaired awareness seizure, formerly complex partial seizure). A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid. Four days later, electroencephalography (EEG)"

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

            "content": "Phenylketonuria. Also known as phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency, this autosomal recessive disease is caused by mutations in the PAH gene. PAH metabolizes phenylalanine to tyrosine, and homozygotes have diminished or absent enzyme activity. This leads to abnormally high levels of phenylalanine, resulting in progressive intellectual impairment, autism, seizures, motor deficits, and neuropsychological abnormalities (Blau, 2010). Because phenylalanine competitively inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase-which is essential for melanin production, afected individuals also have hair, eye, and skin hypopigmentation. More than 500 PAH gene mutations have been characterized, and the carrier frequency is 1 in 60, such that the disease afects approximately 1 in 15,000 newborns (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2017 c). Prompt diagnosis and restriction of dietary phenylalanine beginning early in infancy are essential to prevent neurological damage, and all states mandate"

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."
