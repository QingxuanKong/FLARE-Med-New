    "question": "A 28-year-old male presents with a recent onset of upsetting dreams, anxiety, and disturbing flashbacks. The patient reports that he returned from active duty in Iraq 3 months ago and was adjusting to life back at home until about 7 weeks ago when he began having intense fear of loud noises and seeing sudden flashbacks to bombing attacks he endured during his time in Iraq. He had to take a leave from his army instructor duties as he was not able to handle the familiar settings of practice shooting ranges and sudden loud explosions during battalion training. After refusing to leave his house, he was finally persuaded by his wife to visit your clinic. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a recent onset of upsetting dreams, anxiety, and disturbing flashbacks, which started after returning from active duty in Iraq. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a traumatic event, and the fact that he had to take a leave from his army instructor duties due to being unable to handle familiar settings and sudden loud explosions suggests a significant impact of the traumatic experience. The symptoms of intense fear of loud noises and seeing sudden flashbacks to bombing attacks are also characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The duration of the symptoms, which started about 7 weeks ago, also supports a diagnosis of PTSD. The patient's symptoms do not appear to be a panic attack, as they are not described as episodic and are not limited to a specific situation. Performance anxiety is also not a good fit, as the patient's symptoms are not related to a specific performance or situation. Acute stress disorder is also not a good fit, as the duration of the symptoms is longer than the typical duration of acute stress disorder. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

In the panic attack, the patient is suddenly overwhelmed by feelings of apprehension, or a fear that he may lose consciousness and die, have a heart attack or stroke, lose his reason or self-control, become insane, or commit some horrible crime. These experiences are accompanied by a series of physiologic reactions, mainly sympathoadrenal hyperactivity, resembling the \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d reaction. Breathlessness, a feeling of suffocation, dizziness, sweating, trembling, palpitation, and precordial or gastric distress are typical but not invariable physical accompaniments.

Usually, the apprehension and physical symptoms escalate over a period of minutes to an hour and then abate over 20 to 30 min, leaving the patient tired, weak, and perplexed. The dramatic symptoms of the panic attack have usually abated by the time the patient reaches a doctor\u2019s office or an emergency department, but the blood pressure may still be elevated, and there may be tachycardia. Otherwise, the patient looks remarkably collected. Often, discrete anxiety attacks and persistent states of anxiety merge with one another. The fear of further attacks leads many patients, particularly women, to become agoraphobic and homebound, fearing public places, especially if alone."

The reaction may occur shortly after the trauma (acute stress disorder) or be delayed and subject to recurrence (PTSD) (Table 466-6). In both syndromes, individuals experience associated symptoms of detachment and loss of emotional responsivity. The patient may feel depersonalized and unable to recall specific aspects of the trauma, although typically it is reexperienced through intrusions in thought, dreams, or flashbacks, particularly when cues of the original event are present. Patients often actively avoid stimuli that precipitate recollections of the trauma and demonstrate a resulting increase in vigilance, arousal, and startle response. Patients with stress disorders are at risk for the development of other disorders related to anxiety, mood, and substance abuse (especially alcohol). Between 5"

Common questions are \u201cShould I correct or argue with the patient?\u201d (No.) Orientation as to date, circumstances, and planned appointments is, however, helpful in preparing the patient for the day activities. \u201cCan the patient be left alone?\u201d \u201cMust I be there constantly?\u201d (Depends on specific circumstances and the severity of dementia.) \u201cShould the patient manage his own money?\u201d (Generally not.) \u201cWill a change of environment or a trip help?\u201d (Generally not; often the disruption in daily routine worsens behavior and orientation.) \u201cCan he drive?\u201d (Best to advise against driving in most instances.) \u201cWhat shall we do about the patient\u2019s fears at night and his hallucinations?\u201d (Medication under supervision may help.) \u201cWhen is a nursing home appropriate?\u201d \u201cHow will the condition worsen?

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

            "content": "An enuretic episode is most likely to occur 3 to 4 h after sleep onset, and usually, but not necessarily, in stages 3 and 4 sleep. It is preceded by a burst of rhythmic delta waves associated with a general body movement. If the patient is awakened at this point, he does not report any dreams. Imipramine (10 to 75 mg at bedtime) has proved to be an effective agent in reducing the frequency of enuresis. A series of training exercises designed to increase the functional bladder capacity and sphincter tone may also be helpful. Sometimes all that is required is to proscribe fluid intake for several hours prior to sleep and to awaken the patient and have him empty his bladder about 3 h after going to sleep. One interesting patient, an elderly physician with lifelong enuresis, reported that he had finally obtained relief (after all other measures had failed) by using a nasal spray of an analogue of antidiuretic hormone (desmopressin) at bedtime. This has now been adopted for the treatment"
