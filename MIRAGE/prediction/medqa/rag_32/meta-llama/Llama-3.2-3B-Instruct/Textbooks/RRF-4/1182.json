    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the effects of decreased renal blood flow on the kidney's function and how it relates to the options provided. Decreased renal blood flow can lead to various changes in the kidney's physiology. Renal blood flow is crucial for the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is the rate at which the kidneys filter waste and excess fluids from the blood. Decreased renal blood flow can lead to a decrease in GFR, which can result in the retention of waste products in the blood and fluids in the body. A. Hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells - This is not a direct consequence of decreased renal blood flow. The juxtaglomerular cells are involved in the regulation of blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, but their hyperplasia is not a result of decreased blood flow. B. Dilation of efferent arteriole - In conditions of decreased renal blood flow, the efferent arteriole constricts to maintain blood pressure and ensure adequate blood flow to the glomerulus. Therefore, dilation of the efferent arteriole would not be a consequence of decreased renal blood flow. C. Decreased prostaglandin synthesis by macula densa - The macula densa cells in the distal convoluted tubule detect changes in sodium chloride delivery and synthesize prostaglandins in response. Prostaglandins help to dilate the afferent arteriole and constrict the efferent arteriole, which helps to increase GFR. In conditions of decreased renal blood flow, the macula densa may not detect the decrease in GFR as significantly, leading to decreased prostaglandin synthesis. This can result in vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole and further decrease in GFR. D. Decreased reabsorption of bicarbonate at proximal tubule - This is not a direct consequence of decreased renal blood flow. The reabsorption of bicarbonate is primarily regulated by the proximal tubule's acid-base balance and is not directly affected by renal blood flow. Considering the options, the most likely consequence of decreased renal blood flow is decreased prostaglandin synthesis by the macula densa, leading to vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole and further decrease in GFR.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

His physician initially prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic commonly used to treat hyper-tension. His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic. Because the patient had elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, hydrochlorothiazide was replaced with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril lowered his blood pressure to almost normotensive levels. However, after several weeks on enalapril, the patient returned complaining of a persistent cough. In addition, some signs of angioedema were detected. How does enalapril lower blood pressure? Why does it occasionally cause coughing and angioedema?

An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhib-itor was added (enalapril, 20 mg twice daily), and over the next few weeks, he continued to feel better.

In the initial stages, the mechanism of hypertension generally is related to activation of the renin-angiotensin system. However, renin activity and other components of the renin-angiotensin system may be elevated only transiently; over time, recruitment of other pressure mechanisms may contribute to elevated arterial pressure. Two groups of patients are at risk for this disorder: older arteriosclerotic patients who have a plaque obstructing the renal artery, frequently at its origin, and patients with fibromuscular dysplasia. Atherosclerosis accounts for the large majority of patients with renovascular hypertension. Although fibromuscular dysplasia may occur at any age, it has a strong predilection for young white women.

Angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II (ATII) by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). 4. ATII raises blood pressure by (1) contracting arteriolar smooth muscle, increasing total peripheral resistance and (2) promoting adrenal release of aldosterone, which increases resorption of sodium in the distal convoluted tubule (expanding plasma volume). 5. Leads to HTN with increased plasma renin and unilateral atrophy (due to low blood flow) of the affected kidney; neither feature is seen in primary hypertension."

Kidney biopsies in patients with hypertension, microhematuria, and moderate proteinuria demonstrate arteriolosclerosis, chronic nephrosclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis in the absence of immune deposits (see Fig. 62e-21). Today, based on a careful history, physical examination, urinalysis, and some serologic testing, the diagnosis of chronic nephrosclerosis is usually inferred without a biopsy. Treating hypertension is the best way to avoid progressive renal failure; most guidelines recommend lowering blood pressure to <130/80 mmHg if there is preexisting diabetes or kidney disease. In the presence of kidney disease, most patients begin antihypertensive therapy with two drugs, classically a thiazide diuretic and an ACE inhibitor; most will require three drugs. There is strong evidence in African Americans with hypertensive nephrosclerosis that therapy initiated with an ACE inhibitor can slow the rate of decline in renal function"

Noninvasive characterization of the renal vasculature may be achieved by several techniques, summarized in Table 299-1. Although activation of the renin-angiotensin system is a key step in developing renovascular hypertension, it is transient. Levels of renin activity are therefore subject to timing, the effects of drugs, and sodium intake, and do not reliably predict the response to vascular therapy. Renal artery velocities by Doppler ultrasound above 200 cm/s generally predict hemodynamically important lesions (above 60% vessel lumen occlusion), although treatment trials require velocity above 300 cm/s to avoid false positives. The renal resistive index has predictive value regarding the viability of the kidney. It remains operatorand institution-dependent, however. Captopril-enhanced renography has a strong negative predictive value when entirely normal. Magnetic resonance"

With experienced operators, major complications occur in about 9% of cases, including renal artery dissection, capsular perforation, hemorrhage, and occasional atheroembolic disease. Although not common, atheroembolic disease can be catastrophic and accelerate both hypertension and kidney failure, precisely the events that revascularization is intended to prevent. Although renal blood flow usually can be restored by endovascular stenting, recovery of renal function is limited to about 25% of cases, with no change in 50% and some deterioration evident in others. Patients with rapid loss of kidney function, sometimes associated with antihypertensive drug therapy, or with vascular disease affecting the entire functioning kidney mass are more likely to recover function after restoring blood flow. When hypertension is refractory to effective therapy, revascularization offers real benefits. Table 299-2 summarizes currently accepted"

Kotchen Hypertension is one of the leading causes of the global burden of disease. Approximately 7.6 million deaths (13\u201315% of the total) and 92 million disability-adjusted life years worldwide were attributable to high blood pressure in 2001. Hypertension doubles the risk of cardio-298 vascular diseases, including coronary heart disease (CHD), congestive heart failure (CHF), ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, renal failure, and peripheral arterial disease. It often is associated with additional cardiovascular disease risk factors, and the risk of cardiovascular disease increases with the total burden of risk factors. Although anti-hypertensive therapy reduces the risks of cardiovascular and renal disease, large segments of the hypertensive population are either untreated or inadequately treated."
