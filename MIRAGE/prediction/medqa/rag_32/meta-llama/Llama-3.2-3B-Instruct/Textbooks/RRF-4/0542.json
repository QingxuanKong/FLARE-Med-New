    "question": "A 32-year-old primigravid woman at 16 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a routine prenatal visit. She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. Her only medication is a prenatal vitamin. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F) and blood pressure is 108/60 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 16-week gestation. A quadruple screening test shows maternal serum AFP of 3 times the median and normal levels of serum \u03b2-hCG, estriol, and inhibin A. Which of the following is most likely to account for these findings?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is at 16 weeks' gestation and the quadruple screening test shows elevated maternal serum AFP, normal levels of \u03b2-hCG, estriol, and inhibin A. The quadruple screening test is used to detect trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) and trisomy 18. Elevated AFP levels are associated with trisomy 18, while normal levels of \u03b2-hCG, estriol, and inhibin A are associated with trisomy 21. Therefore, the patient's elevated AFP level is most likely due to trisomy 18. However, the patient is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness, which makes a molar pregnancy less likely. The patient's normal levels of \u03b2-hCG, estriol, and inhibin A also make trisomy 18 less likely. The most likely diagnosis is trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), which is characterized by low levels of AFP, high levels of \u03b2-hCG, low levels of estriol, and high levels of inhibin A. However, the patient's AFP level is actually elevated, which makes trisomy 21 less likely. Therefore, the correct answer is trisomy 18, but with a lower detection rate due to the elevated AFP level. The detection rate of trisomy 18 is lower than trisomy 21, but it is still a possible explanation for the elevated AFP level.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Some of the AFP crosses the placenta and enters the maternal circulation. Although maternal serum screening was initially used to detect high levels of AFP associated with neural tube defects (NTDs) and the disruption of fetal integument such as omphalocele or gastroschisis, low levels of AFP were found to be associated with fetal aneuploidy. Approximately 50% of fetuses with autosomal trisomies (Down syndrome, trisomy 18, trisomy 13) will be detected by low maternal serum AFP levels. Three other proteins\u2014unconjugated estriol (uE3),inhibin A, and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)\u2014were added to the maternal serum screening to create the quad screen.

In general, after a irst successful pregnancy, a woman may irst perceive fetal movements between 16 and 18 weeks' gestation. A primigravida may not appreciate fetal movements until approximately 2 weeks later. At about 20 weeks, depending on maternal habitus, an examiner can begin to detect fetal movements. Of pregnancy signs, changes in the lower reproductive tract, uterus, and breasts develop early. These are described in detail in Chapter 4 (p. 49). Detection of hCG in maternal blood and urine is the basis for endocrine assays of pregnancy. Syncytiotrophoblast produces hCG in amounts that increase exponentially during the irst trimester following implantation. A main function of hCG is to prevent involution of the corpus luteum, which is the principal site of progesterone formation during the irst 6 weeks of pregnancy."

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

All pregnant women are ofered screening for fetal open neural-rube defects in the second trimester, either with MSAFP screening or with sonography (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 20 16c). Measurement of the MSAFP concentration between 15 and 20 weeks' gestation has been ofered as part of routine prenatal care for more than 30 years. Because AFP is the major protein in fetal serum, analogous to albumin in a child or adult, the normal concentration gradient between fetal plasma and maternal serum is on the order of 50,000: 1. Defects in fetal integument, such as neural-tube and ventral-wall defects, permit AFP to leak into the amnionic fluid, resulting in dramatically increased maternal serum levels. he AFP value rises by about 15 percent per week during the screening window (Knight, 1992). he MoM is generally recalculated if the irst-trimester CRL or second-trimester biparietal diameter difers from the"

First trimester screening with maternal chemistries and fetal nuchal lucency measurement or chorionic villus sampling are recommended for obstetrical indications. Maternal serum can also be obtained for assessment at 16 to 18 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis may be recommended to assess the fetal karyotype after the pregnancy has progressed past the time of prior losses."

These begin to rise in patient B, who by term has substantively higher blood pressures. However, her pressures are still < 140/90 mm Hg, and thus she is considered to be \"normotensive.\" We use the term delta hypertension to describe this rather acute rise in blood pressure. Some of these women will go on to have obvious preeclampsia, and some even develop eclamptic seizures or HELLP (hemolysis, devatedliver enzyme levels, low 2latelet count) syndrome while still normotensive."
