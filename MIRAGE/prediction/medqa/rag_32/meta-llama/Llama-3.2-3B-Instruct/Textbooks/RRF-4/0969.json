The patient describes the lesion as painful and swollen. She denies vaginal discharge. Her past medical history is notable for mild intermittent asthma, gout, and obesity. She uses an albuterol inhaler as needed and takes allopurinol. She has had 5 sexual partners in the past year and uses the pull-out method for contraception. She has a 10-pack-year smoking history and drinks 10-12 alcoholic beverages per week. On exam, she has an ulcerated, tender, and purulent ulcer on the left labia majora. The patient has mild unilateral painful inguinal lymphadenopathy. This patient's condition is most likely caused by which of the following pathogens?",

The patient presents with a painful and swollen ulcer on the left labia majora, along with mild unilateral painful inguinal lymphadenopathy. This suggests a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The patient's history of 5 sexual partners in the past year and use of the pull-out method for contraception increases the likelihood of an STI. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with chancroid, a bacterial STI caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. Chancroid is characterized by painful genital ulcers and lymphadenopathy, which matches the patient's presentation. The other options are less likely: Klebsiella granulomatis causes granuloma inguinale, herpes simplex virus type 2 causes genital herpes, and Treponema pallidum causes syphilis, which typically presents with a painless ulcer (chancre).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

This primary lesion heals in a few days without scarring and is usually recognized as LGV only in retrospect. LGV strains of C. trachomatis have occasionally been recovered from genital ulcers and from the urethra of men and the endocervix of women who present with inguinal adenopathy; these areas may be the primary sites of infection in some cases. Proctitis is more common among people who practice receptive anal intercourse, and an elevated white blood cell count in anorectal smears may predict LGV in these patients. Ulcer formation may facilitate transmission of HIV infection and other sexually transmitted and blood-borne diseases."

She visits her gynecologist, who obtains plasma levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, both of which are moderately elevated. She is diagnosed with premature ovarian failure, and estrogen and pro-gesterone replacement therapy is recommended. A dual-energy absorptiometry scan (DEXA) reveals a bone density t-score of <2.5 SD, ie, frank osteoporosis. How should the ovarian hormones she lacks be replaced? What extra mea-sures should she take for her osteoporosis while receiving treatment? \u25a0 THE OVARY (ESTROGENS, PROGESTINS, OTHER OVARIAN HORMONES, ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES, INHIBITORS & ANTAGONISTS, & OVULATIONINDUCING AGENTS)"

The differential includes gonorrhea, endometriosis, PID, orchitis, vaginitis, and UTI. Lymphogranuloma venereum presents in its 1\u00b0 form as a painless, transient papule or shallow ulcer. In its 2\u00b0 form, it presents as painful swelling of the inguinal nodes, and in its 3\u00b0 form it can present as an \u201canogenital syndrome\u201d (anal pruritus with discharge, rectal strictures, rectovaginal f stula, and elephantiasis). Diagnosis is usually clinical. Culture is the gold standard. Urine tests (PCR or ligase chain reaction) are a rapid means of detection, while DNA probes and immunofuorescence (for gonorrhea/chlamydia) take 48\u201372 hours. Gram stain of urethral or genital discharge may show PMNs but no bacteria (intracellular). Chlamydia infection is a common cause of nongonococcal urethritis in men."

After an incubation period of 4\u20137 days, the initial lesion\u2014a papule with surrounding erythema\u2014 appears. In 2 or 3 days, the papule evolves into a pustule, which spontaneously ruptures and forms a sharply circumscribed ulcer that generally is not indurated (Fig. 182-2). The ulcers are painful and bleed easily; little or no inflammation of the surrounding skin is evident. Approximately half of patients develop enlarged, tender inguinal lymph nodes, which frequently become fluctuant and spontaneously rupture. Patients usually seek medical care after 1\u20133 weeks of painful symptoms."

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

The ulcer of chancroid has irregular margins and is deep with undermined edges. The syphilis ulcer has a smooth, indurated border and a smooth base.

Atlas of sexually transmitted diseases. Philadelphia, PA: Lippincott, 1990.) Genital Ulcer Disease In the United States, most patients with genital ulcers have genital HSV or syphilis (47\u201350). Chancroid is the next most common cause of sexually transmitted genital ulcers, followed by the rare occurrence of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) and granuloma inguinale (donovanosis). These diseases are associated with an increased risk for HIV infection. Other infrequent and noninfectious causes of genital ulcers include abrasions, fixed drug eruptions, carcinoma, and Behcet\u2019s disease."
