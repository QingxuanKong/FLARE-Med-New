    "question": "A 65-year-old man presents with a 6-month history of repeated falls, postural dizziness, progressive fatigue, generalized weakness and a 13.6 kg (30 lb) weight loss. He is a vegetarian. The patient\u2019s family says that he had been high functioning but has had significant behavioral changes over the past year. The patient denies any smoking history, alcohol consumption, or illicit drug use. No significant family history. His vital signs include: blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg without postural changes, pulse 92/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.0\u2103 (98.6\u2109). Physical examination reveals a poorly groomed, disheveled, thin man. He is irritable, paranoid, and delusional but denies any hallucinations. An unstable, wide-based ataxic gait is noted. Laboratory results are significant for the following:\nHb 6.1 g/dL\nMCV 109 fL\nPlatelets 90,0000/mm3\nTotal count 3,000/mm3\nReticulocyte count 0.8%\nA peripheral blood smear demonstrates hypersegmented neutrophils.

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. The patient has a 6-month history of repeated falls, postural dizziness, progressive fatigue, generalized weakness, and a significant weight loss. He also has a poorly groomed appearance, irritable and paranoid behavior, and an unstable, wide-based ataxic gait. Laboratory results show a low hemoglobin level (Hb 6.1 g/dL), macrocytic anemia (MCV 109 fL), thrombocytopenia (platelets 90,000/mm^3), and a low reticulocyte count (0.8%). The peripheral blood smear demonstrates hypersegmented neutrophils. The patient is a vegetarian, which may suggest a dietary deficiency. The absence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies makes pernicious anemia less likely. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a vitamin B12 deficiency, which is common in vegetarians. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause macrocytic anemia, neurological symptoms, and gastrointestinal problems. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with megaloblastic anemia, which is a hallmark of vitamin B12 deficiency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

A healthy young adult with thrombocytopenia will have a much more limited differential diagnosis than an ill hospitalized patient who is receiving multiple medications.

Physical examina-tion reveals a pale woman with diminished vibration sen-sation, diminished spinal reflexes, and extensor plantar reflexes (Babinski sign). Examination of her oral cavity reveals atrophic glossitis, in which the tongue appears deep red in color and abnormally smooth and shiny due to atro-phy of the lingual papillae. Laboratory testing reveals a mac-rocytic anemia based on a hematocrit of 30% (normal for women, 37\u201348%), a hemoglobin concentration of 9.4 g/dL, an erythrocyte mean cell volume (MCV) of 123 fL (nor-mal, 84\u201399 fL), an erythrocyte mean cell hemoglobin con-centration (MCHC) of 34% (normal, 31\u201336%), and a low reticulocyte count. Further laboratory testing reveals a normal serum folate concentration and a serum vitamin B12 (cobalamin) concentration"

The patient had noted progressive weakness over several days, to the point that he was unable to rise from bed. Past medical history was notable for small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, liver, and adrenals. The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced. Blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, increasing to 160/98 mmHg after 1 L of saline, with a JVP at 8 cm. There was generalized muscle weakness.

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"
