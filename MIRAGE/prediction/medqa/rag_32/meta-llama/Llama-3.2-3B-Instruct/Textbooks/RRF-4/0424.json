He recalls that he has been told by his primary care physician that he suffers from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The gastroenterologist decides to perform an upper endoscopy with biopsy. Which of the following findings would be consistent with Barrett's esophagus?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Presence of Paneth cells in the lower esophagus",
        "B": "Metaplasia in the upper esophagus",
        "C": "A small region of red, velvet-like mucosa in the lower esophagus",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which finding is consistent with Barrett's esophagus, we need to understand what Barrett's esophagus is. Barrett's esophagus is a condition in which the normal squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced by metaplastic columnar epithelium, typically in the distal esophagus, as a complication of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The question asks for a finding that is consistent with Barrett's esophagus, so we need to look for options that describe changes in the esophageal mucosa that are characteristic of Barrett's esophagus.\\n\\nOption A, the presence of Paneth cells in the lower esophagus, is not a characteristic finding of Barrett's esophagus. Paneth cells are typically found in the small intestine, not the esophagus.\\n\\nOption B, metaplasia in the upper esophagus, is not typical of Barrett's esophagus. Metaplasia refers to the replacement of one cell type with another, but in Barrett's esophagus, it is the metaplasia that occurs in the distal esophagus, not the upper esophagus.\\n\\nOption C, a small region of red, velvet-like mucosa in the lower esophagus, is consistent with Barrett's esophagus. This is because the metaplastic columnar epithelium in Barrett's esophagus can appear as a red, velvet-like mucosa during endoscopy.\\n\\nOption D, esophageal varices, is not a finding associated with Barrett's esophagus. Esophageal varices are dilated submucosal veins that are typically seen in patients with liver disease or portal hypertension, not in patients with Barrett's esophagus.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. A small region of red, velvet-like mucosa in the lower esophagus is consistent with Barrett's esophagus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

Endoscopy is indicated in patients with reflux symptoms refractory to antisecretory therapy; in those with alarm symptoms, such as dysphagia, weight loss, or gastrointestinal bleeding; and in those with recurrent dyspepsia after treatment that is not clearly due to reflux on clinical grounds alone.

Esophageal manometry is done if dysphagia is not adequately explained by endoscopy or to confirm the diagnosis of a suspected esophageal motor disorder. Barium radiography can provide useful adjunctive information in cases of subtle or complex esophageal strictures, prior esophageal surgery, esophageal diverticula, or paraesophageal herniation. In specific cases, computed tomography (CT) examination and endoscopic ultrasonography may be useful."

            "content": "Barrett\u2019s Esophagus Barrett\u2019s esophagus is specialized columnar metaplasia that replaces the normal squamous mucosa of the distal esophagus in some persons with GERD. Barrett\u2019s epithelium is a major risk factor for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and is readily detected endoscopically, due to proximal displacement of the squamocolumnar junction (Fig. 345-3). A screening EGD for Barrett\u2019s esophagus should be considered in patients with a chronic (\u226510 year) history of GERD symptoms. Endoscopic biopsy is the gold standard for confirmation of Barrett\u2019s esophagus and for dysplasia or cancer arising in Barrett\u2019s mucosa. FIGURE 345-36 Obstructing colonic carcinoma. A.

The main symptom of relux is heartburn, or pyrosis, which is especially common in pregnancy. Its prevalence rose from 26 percent in the irst trimester to 36 percent in the second and 51 percent in the third trimesters (Malfertheiner, 2012). The retrosternal burning sensation stems from esophagitis caused by gastroesophageal relux related to relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter."

            "content": "Upper endoscopy, also referred to as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), is performed by passing a flexible endoscope through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. The procedure is the best method for examining the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. While the upper gastrointestinal radiographic series has similar accuracy for diagnosis of duodenal ulcer (Fig. 345-1), EGD is superior for detection of gastric ulcers (Fig. 345-2) and flat mucosal lesions such as Barrett\u2019s esophagus (Fig. 345-3), and it permits directed biopsy and endoscopic therapy. Intravenous conscious sedation is given to most patients in the United States to ease the anxiety and discomfort of the procedure, although in many countries EGD is routinely performed with topical pharyngeal anesthesia only. Patient tolerance of unsedated EGD is improved by the use of an ultrathin, 5-mm diameter endoscope that can be passed transorally or transnasally."

He incorrectly believed it to be congenital in origin. It is now realized that it is an acquired abnormality, occurs in 10% to 15% of patients with GERD, and represents the end stage of the natural history of this disease. It is also distinctly different from the congenital condition in which islands of gastric fundic epithelium are found in the upper half of the esophagus.The definition of BE has evolved considerably over the past decade. Traditionally, BE was identified by the presence of columnar mucosa extending at least 3 cm into the esophagus. It is now recognized that the specialized, intestinal-type epi-thelium, or intestinal metaplasia (IM) found in the Barrett\u2019s mucosa, is the only tissue predisposed to malignant degenera-tion.

Although none of the aforementioned symptoms alone is specific for gastric disease, when elicited in the con-text of a careful history and physical examination, they point to a differential diagnosis, which can be refined with certain tests. Early endoscopy should be considered in patients present-ing with recent onset of alarm symptoms (weight loss, anemia, dysphagia, vomiting) particularly those over 55 years of age (Table 26-5).Diagnostic TestsEsophagogastroduodenoscopy.
