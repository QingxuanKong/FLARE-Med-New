    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's analyze the given information and options step by step. The patient presents with pitting edema and proteinuria exceeding 3.5g in 24 hours, which is a classic presentation of nephrotic syndrome. The key finding that confirms the diagnosis is related to the loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membranes. Let's examine each option in relation to this finding.\\n\\nA. WBC casts in the urine: WBC casts are indicative of inflammation in the kidneys and are more commonly associated with nephritic syndrome, which presents with hematuria, proteinuria, and hypertension. This is not directly related to the loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membranes.\\n\\nB. Selective albuminuria: Selective albuminuria refers to the loss of albumin in the urine, which is a characteristic feature of nephrotic syndrome. However, this option does not directly indicate the loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membranes.\\n\\nC. Negatively birefringent crystals in the urine: Negatively birefringent crystals in the urine are associated with the loss of polyanions, such as albumin, in the glomerular basement membranes. This is a classic finding in conditions like thin basement membrane disease, where there is a thinning of the glomerular basement membrane, leading to the loss of polyanions.\\n\\nD. Bence-Jones proteinuria: Bence-Jones proteinuria refers to the presence of light chains of immunoglobulins in the urine, which is more commonly associated with multiple myeloma and other plasma cell dyscrasias. This is not directly related to the loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membranes.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is C. Negatively birefringent crystals in the urine, as it directly indicates the loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membranes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Nephrotic syndrome describes the onset of heavy proteinuria (>3.0 g/24 h), hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hypoalbuminemia, edema/anasarca, and microscopic hematuria; if only large amounts of proteinuria are present without clinical manifestations, the condition is sometimes called nephrotic-range proteinuria. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in these patients may initially be normal or, rarely, higher than normal, but with persistent hyperfiltration and continued nephron loss, it typically declines over months to years.

Both have \u2191 hematocrit and RBC mass, but polycythemia vera should have normal O2 saturation and low erythropoietin levels."

Autoantibodies to renal glomerular and lung alveolar basement membranes are present. This syndrome can present and recur as DAH without an associated glomerulonephritis. In such cases, circulating anti-basement membrane antibody is often absent, and the only way to establish the diagnosis is by demonstrating linear immunofluorescence in lung tissue. HISTOLOGIC FINDINGS The underlying histology may be bland hemorrhage or DAH associated with capillaritis. TREATMENT Plasmapheresis has been recommended as adjunctive treatment."

            "content": "necrosis and interstitial inflammation are also reported. In children, the abnormal urine principally contains albumin with minimal amounts of highermolecular-weight proteins, and is sometimes called selective proteinuria. Although up to 30% of children have a spontaneous remission, all children today are treated with steroids; only children who are nonresponders are biopsied in this setting. Primary responders are patients who have a complete remission (<0.2 mg/24 h of proteinuria) after a single course of prednisone; steroid-dependent patients relapse as their steroid dose is tapered. Frequent relapsers have two or more relapses in the 6 months following taper, and steroid-resistant patients fail to respond to steroid therapy. Adults are not considered steroid-resistant until after 4 months of therapy. Ninety to 95% of children will develop a complete remission after 8 weeks of steroid therapy, and 80\u201385% of adults will achieve complete remission, but only after a longer course of"

            "content": "Each region of a renal biopsy is assessed separately. By light microscopy, glomeruli (at least 10 and ideally 20) are reviewed individually for discrete lesions; <50% involvement is considered focal, and >50% is diffuse. Injury in each glomerular tuft can be segmental, involving a portion of the tuft, or global, involving most of the glomerulus. Glomeruli having proliferative characteristics show increased cellularity. When cells in the capillary tuft proliferate, it is called endocapillary, and when cellular proliferation extends into Bowman\u2019s space, it is called extracapillary. Synechiae are formed when epithelial podocytes attach to Bowman\u2019s capsule in the setting of glomerular injury; crescents, which in some cases may be the extension of synechiae, develop when fibrocellular/fibrin collections fill all or part of Bowman\u2019s space; and sclerotic glomeruli show acellular, amorphous accumulations of proteinaceous material throughout the tuft with loss of functional capillaries and"

            "content": "Plasma uric acid concentration is typically elevated in preeclampsia. The elevation exceeds that attributable to the reduction in glomerular filtration rate and likely is also due to enhanced tubular reabsorption (Chesley, 1945). At the same time, preeclampsia is associated with diminished urinary excretion of calcium, perhaps because of greater tubular reabsorption (Taufield, 1987). As shown in Table 40-1, detection of proteinuria helps to establish the diagnosis of preeclampsia. Abnormal protein excretion is empirically deined by 24-hour urinary excretion exceeding 300 mg; a urine protein:creatinine ratio \ufffd0.3; or persistent protein values of 30 mg/ dL (1 + dipstick) in random urine samples. Although worsening or nephrotic-range proteinuria has been considered by most to be a sign of severe disease, this does not appear to be the case (Airoldi, 2007). Certainly, this concept was not accepted by the 20r13 Task Force."

Age, race, and geography affect the incidence of NS. Certain HLA types (HLA-DR7, HLA-B8, and HLA-B12) are associated with an increased incidence of NS. Increased glomerular permeability is due to alterations in the normal glomerular cellular and basement membrane barrier that restrict filtration of serum proteins. The resultant massive proteinuria leads to decreased serum proteins, especially albumin. Plasma oncotic pressure is diminished, leading to fluid shifts from vascular to interstitial compartments and plasma volume contraction.
