    "question": "A 31-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of acute onset neck pain and enlargement. Specifically, he reports that he has been experiencing pain and swelling of the anterior portion of his neck near the midline. Otherwise, he says that he has been getting tired easily and feels cold often. Physical exam reveals a painful diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with many small nodules. A biopsy is obtained showing diffuse cellular hyperplasia with areas of focal colloid hyperplasia. Given these findings, the patient is started on appropriate therapy, and the neck mass becomes smaller over time. Which of the following is most likely associated with the cause of this patient's symptoms?",

    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: Step 1: Analyzing the patient's symptoms - The patient presents with acute onset neck pain and enlargement, fatigue, and cold intolerance. These symptoms are suggestive of an autoimmune thyroiditis. Step 2: Reviewing the physical exam findings - The patient has a painful diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with many small nodules, which is consistent with a diffuse goiter. Step 3: Interpreting the biopsy results - The biopsy shows diffuse cellular hyperplasia with areas of focal colloid hyperplasia, which is characteristic of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Step 4: Eliminating options - Based on the biopsy results, options B (Iodine deficiency) and C (Presence of embryological remnant) are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms. Step 5: Considering the remaining options - Options A (HLA-B8 risk factor) and D (Proliferation of fibroinflammatory cells) are both associated with autoimmune thyroiditis, but HLA-B8 is a specific risk factor for Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Step 6: Making a final decision - Based on the biopsy results and the patient's symptoms, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is associated with HLA-B8.

MNG typically develops over many years and is detected on routine physical examination, when an individual notices an enlargement in the neck, or as an incidental finding on imaging. If the goiter is large enough, it can ultimately lead to compressive symptoms including difficulty swallowing, respiratory distress (tracheal compression), or plethora (venous congestion), but these symptoms are uncommon. Symptomatic MNGs are usually extraordinarily large and/or develop fibrotic areas that cause compression. Sudden pain in an MNG is usually caused by hemorrhage into a nodule but should raise the possibility of invasive malignancy. Hoarseness, reflecting laryngeal nerve involvement, also suggests malignancy."

Clinical evaluation includes a general health assessment, particularly relating to symptoms from the head and neck.

Near-total or total thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice, and patients require lifelong T4 therapy.Solitary Thyroid NoduleSolitary thyroid nodules are present in approximately 4% of individuals in the United States, whereas thyroid cancer has a much lower incidence of 40 new cases per 1 million. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to determine which patients with soli-tary thyroid nodule would benefit from surgery.History. Details regarding the nodule, such as time of onset, change in size, and associated symptoms such as pain, dyspha-gia, dyspnea, or choking, should be elicited. Pain is an unusual symptom and, when present, should raise suspicion for intra-thyroidal hemorrhage in a benign nodule, thyroiditis, or malig-nancy. Patients with MTC may complain of a dull, aching"

The patient\u2019s age, social history, including alcohol and smoking history, preced-ing illness history, and synchronous upper aerodigestive tract physical examination findings can significantly impact the dif-ferential diagnosis and the investigation to work up a neck mass. A thorough history and head and neck examination, including fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy, are therefore paramount to com-plete evaluation. With regard to age, in children, a neck mass is far more likely to be congenital, inflammatory, or infectious, whereas in adults, neck masses >2 cm have a >80% probability of being malignant. Typically, the first investigation is an FNA biopsy, which can be performed with ultrasound or CT guid-ance when the mass is not easily palpable or largely cystic with a small solid component. Imaging is critical in"

On follow-up the patient had no complications. A 25-year-old man complained of significant swelling in front of his right ear before and around mealtimes. This swelling was associated with considerable pain, which was provoked by the ingestion of lemon sweets. On examination he had tenderness around the right parotid region and a hard nodule was demonstrated in the buccal mucosa adjacent to the right upper molar teeth. A diagnosis of parotid duct calculus was made."

Malaise and symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may precede the thyroid-related features by several weeks. In other patients, the onset is acute, severe, and without obvious antecedent. The patient typically complains of a sore throat, and examination reveals a small goiter that is exquisitely tender. Pain is often referred to the jaw or ear. Complete resolution is the usual outcome, but late-onset permanent hypothyroidism occurs in 15% of cases, particularly in those with coincidental thyroid autoimmunity. A prolonged course over many months, with one or more relapses, occurs in a small percentage of patients."

About 10% to 20% of abnormal parathyroid glands are found in the mediasti-num; most can be removed during exploration from a cervi-cal incision. In cases of true mediastinal parathyroid glands, thoracoscopic or open resection may be indicated. Location can generally be pinpointed by a combination of CT scan and Sestamibi scans.MediastinitisAcute Mediastinitis. Acute mediastinitis is a fulminant infec-tious process that spreads rapidly along the continuous fascial planes connecting the cervical and mediastinal compartments. Infections originate most commonly from esophageal perfora-tions, sternal infections, and oropharyngeal or neck infections, but a number of less common etiologic factors can lead to this deadly process (Table 19-32). Clinical signs and symptoms include fever, chest pain, dysphagia, respiratory"
