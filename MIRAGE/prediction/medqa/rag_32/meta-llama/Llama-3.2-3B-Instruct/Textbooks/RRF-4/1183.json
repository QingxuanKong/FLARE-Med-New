    "question": "A 65-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband after he found her with nausea, headache, and agitation 1 hour ago. When he left their lakeside cabin 6 hours before to go ice fishing and get more firewood, she did not have any symptoms. She has chronic migraines, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her medications include lisinopril and metformin, but she ran out of her anti-hypertensive medications over the weekend. Her temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 154/92 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. She is confused and oriented only to person and place. She recalls only one of three objects after 5 minutes. Her gait is unsteady. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most effective intervention for this patient's current condition?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To determine the most effective intervention for this patient's current condition, let's analyze the given information step by step. 1. **Patient Presentation**: The patient is a 65-year-old woman presenting with nausea, headache, agitation, confusion, and unsteadiness. These symptoms occurred after a 6-hour absence from her antihypertensive medications. 2. **Medical History**: The patient has chronic migraines, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. 3. **Current Medications**: Lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) and metformin. 4. **Symptoms Onset**: The patient's symptoms started after a 6-hour absence from her antihypertensive medications. 5. **Vital Signs**: The patient is confused, oriented only to person and place, has a high pulse rate (110/min), and elevated blood pressure (154/92 mmHg). Considering these points, the patient's symptoms and presentation are consistent with **Hypertensive Encephalopathy**, a condition characterized by high blood pressure leading to brain dysfunction and symptoms such as headache, confusion, and altered mental status. **Treatment Options**: A. **Intravenous nitroprusside**: This is a vasodilator used to rapidly lower blood pressure in hypertensive emergencies. It is an effective option for managing severe hypertension, especially in cases of hypertensive encephalopathy. B. **Hyperbaric oxygen therapy**: While oxygen therapy may be beneficial in certain conditions, it is not the primary treatment for hypertensive encephalopathy. C. **100% oxygen therapy**: Oxygen therapy may be helpful in certain situations, but it is not the primary treatment for hypertensive encephalopathy. D. **Heliox therapy**: Heliox is not typically used to treat hypertensive encephalopathy. **Most Effective Intervention**: Given the patient's presentation and symptoms, the most effective intervention is to rapidly lower her blood pressure to alleviate the cerebral edema and prevent further brain damage. Therefore, **Intravenous nitroprusside** is the best choice. Here's the answer in the required format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and presentation are consistent with hypertensive encephalopathy. The most effective intervention to rapidly lower blood pressure and alleviate cerebral edema is intravenous nitroprusside.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

She admits to having taken a \u201chandful\u201d of Lorcet (hydrocodone/acetaminophen, an opioid/nonopioid analgesic combination), Soma (carisoprodol, a centrally acting muscle relaxant), and Cymbalta (duloxetine HCl, an antidepressant/ antifibromyalgia agent) 2 days earlier. On physical examina-tion, the sclera of her eyes shows yellow discoloration. Labora-tory analyses of blood drawn within an hour of her admission reveal abnormal liver function as indicated by the increased indices: alkaline phosphatase 302 (41\u2013133),* alanine amino-transferase (ALT) 351 (7\u201356),* aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1045 (0\u201335),* bilirubin 3.33 mg/dL (0.1\u20131.2),* and pro-thrombin time of 19.8 seconds (11\u201315).* In addition, plasma bicarbonate is reduced, and she has ~45% reduced glomerular filtration rate from the normal value"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

Circled values are oxygen saturations. Available @ StudentConsult.com Syncope is the transient loss of consciousness and muscle tone that, by history, does not suggest other altered states of consciousness. Presyncope or near-syncope has many or all of the prodromal symptoms without loss of consciousness. Syncope is relatively common (Table 140-1). The frequency of episodes, amount of stress, and functional impairment caused by syncope vary. Most syncopal events are relatively benign, but can represent a serious cardiac condition that may lead to death (Table 140-1). The differential diagnosis for typical syncope includes seizure, metabolic cause (hypoglycemia), hyperventilation, atypical migraine, and breath holding."

OH is defined as a sustained drop in systolic (\u226520 mmHg) or diastolic (\u226510 mmHg) BP after 2\u20133 min of standing. In nonneurogenic causes of OH (such as hypovolemia), the BP drop is accompanied by a compensatory increase in heart rate of >15 beats/min. A clue that the patient has neurogenic OH is the aggravation or precipitation of OH by autonomic stressors (a meal, hot bath, or exercise). Neurologic examination should include mental status (neurodegenerative disorders), cranial nerves (impaired downgaze with progressive supranuclear palsy; abnormal pupils with Horner\u2019s or Adie\u2019s syndrome), motor tone (Parkinson\u2019s disease and parkinsonism), and sensation (polyneuropathies). In patients without a clear diagnosis initially, follow-up evaluations every few months or whenever symptoms worsen may reveal the underlying cause."

Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating.

Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse.

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is elevated in the early and active stages. Later there is evidence of occlusion of the brachiocephalic, subclavian, carotid, vertebral, and other arteries that may be asymptomatic or cause neurologic ischemic symptoms. The affected arteries no longer pulsate, hence the descriptive term pulseless disease. When renal arteries are involved, hypertension results, and there may be coronary occlusion, which may be fatal. Involvement of the pulmonary artery may lead to pulmonary hypertension. Coolness of the hands and weak radial pulses are common indicators of the disease and headaches are frequent. Blurring of vision, especially upon physical activity or fever, dizziness, and hemiparetic and hemisensory syndromes are the usual neurologic manifestations (Lupi-Herrera et al). The frequency of posturally induced neurologic symptoms has been"

These begin to rise in patient B, who by term has substantively higher blood pressures. However, her pressures are still < 140/90 mm Hg, and thus she is considered to be \"normotensive.\" We use the term delta hypertension to describe this rather acute rise in blood pressure. Some of these women will go on to have obvious preeclampsia, and some even develop eclamptic seizures or HELLP (hemolysis, devatedliver enzyme levels, low 2latelet count) syndrome while still normotensive."
