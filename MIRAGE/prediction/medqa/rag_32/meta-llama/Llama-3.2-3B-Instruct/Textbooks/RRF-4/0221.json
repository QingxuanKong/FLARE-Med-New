The mother's HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery, which is considered low. The labor was uncomplicated, and the newborn has normal Apgar scores. The physical examination shows no abnormalities. The most appropriate next step in the management of this infant is to perform HIV DNA testing to confirm whether the infant is infected or not. This is because HIV DNA testing can identify the presence of HIV DNA in the infant's blood, which can confirm whether the infant is infected or not. HIV RNA testing may not be able to detect HIV infection in the first few weeks of life, and HIV DNA testing is more sensitive in this period. Administering zidovudine without confirming the infant's HIV status may not be necessary. Reassurance and follow-up may not be sufficient, as the infant's HIV status needs to be confirmed to provide appropriate care and treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

All newborns of HIV-infected mothers should be treated with zidovudine for 6 months after birth. Women who are HIV-positive may transmit the virus through their breast milk.

ART is recommended for all HIVinfected pregnant women, and it should be initiated as early in pregnancy as possible. Treatment reduces the risk of perinatal transmission regardless of CD4 T-cell count or HIV RNA level. Adherence is essential because the risk of viral drug resistance is lessened. As for nonpregnant adults, pregnant women are treated with at least three antiviral agents. The Panel on Treatment of HI V-Infected Pregnant Women and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission (2016) has issued guidelines for four diferent scenarios during pregnancy (Table 65-5). he following paragraphs summarize these recommendations."

HIV infection can be reasonably excluded in nonbreastfed infants with at least two virologic tests performed at older than 1 month of age, with one test being performed after 4 months of age, or at least two negative antibody tests performed after 6 months of age, with an interval of at least 1 month between the tests. Loss of HIV antibody combined with negative HIV DNA PCR confirms absence of HIV infection. Persistence of a positive HIV antibody test after 18 months of age indicates HIV infection. The differential diagnosis of AIDS in infants includes primary immunodeficiency syndromes and intrauterine infections with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and syphilis. Prominenceof individual symptoms, such as diarrhea, may suggest otheretiologies."

            "content": "HIV DNA PCR is the preferred virologic method for diagnosing HIV infection during infancy and identifies 38% of infected infants at 48 hours and 96% at 28 days. Diagnostic viral testing should be performed by 48 hours of age, at 1 to 2 months of age, and at 3 to 6 months of age. An additional test at 14 days of age is often performed because the diagnostic sensitivity increases rapidly by 2 weeks of age. HIV RNA PCR has 25% to 40% sensitivity during the first weeks of life, increasing to 90% to 100% by 2 to 3 months of age. However a negative HIV RNA PCR cannot be used to exclude infection and, thus, is not recommended as first-line testing."

Many of these pregnancies are at high risk for other complications related to IV drug abuse, such as hepatitis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and syphilis. In addition, the LBW rate and the long-term risk for sudden infant death syndrome are higher in the infants of these high-risk women."

            "content": "HIV infection can be transmitted from an infected mother to her fetus during pregnancy, during delivery, or by breast-feeding. This remains an important form of transmission of HIV infection in certain developing countries, where the proportion of infected women to infected men is ~1:1. Virologic analyses of aborted fetuses indicate that HIV can be transmitted to the fetus during the first or second trimesters of pregnancy. However, maternal transmission to the fetus occurs most commonly in the perinatal period. Two studies performed in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (then called Zaire) indicated that among all mother-to-child transmissions of HIV, the relative proportions were 23\u201330% before birth, 50\u201365% during birth, and 12\u201320% via breast-feeding."

Other risk factors include maternal substance abuse, placenta previa, and multiple gestations. First step: Diagnose by confrming serial fundal height measurements with ultrasound. Second step: Ultrasound the fetus for EFW (although as pregnancy advances, ultrasound fetal weight estimates become increasingly unreliable). First step: Explore the underlying etiology and correct if possible. If near due date: Administer steroids (e.g., betamethasone) to accelerate fetal lung maturity. Then: Perform fetal monitoring with NST, CST, BPP, and umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry. A nonreassuring status near term may prompt delivery. \u2191 perinatal morbidity and mortality.

Initiation of therapy is recommended for all children 1 to 5 years of age with AIDS or significant HIV-related symptoms or CD4 below 25% (clinical category C or most clinical category B) regardless of symptoms or HIV RNA level. For children older than 5 years with AIDS or significant HIV-related symptoms, CD4 count below 350/mm3 should be treated. Indications for treatment of adolescents and adults include CD4 cell count less than 200 to 350/mm3 or plasma HIV RNA levels above 55,000 copies/mL. Combination therapy with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is recommended based on the risk of disease progression as determined by CD4 percentage or count and plasma HIV RNA copy number; the potential benefits"
