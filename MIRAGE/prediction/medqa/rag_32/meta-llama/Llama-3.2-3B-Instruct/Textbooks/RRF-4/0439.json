The patient has a medical history of chronic dermatitis and chronic sinusitis for which he has prescriptions of topical hydrocortisone and fexofenadine. He smokes one-half pack of cigarettes every day. His vital signs include: blood pressure 128/76 mm Hg, heart rate 78/min, and respirations 12/min. On physical examination, the patient appears tired but oriented. Examination of the skin reveals a 2 x 2 cm round and erythematous, annular plaque on the abdomen 3 cm to the left of the umbilicus. There are no vesicles, pustules, or papules. Auscultation of the heart reveals a 1/6 systolic murmur. Breath sounds are mildly coarse at the bases. A KOH preparation from the skin scraping confirms the presence of hyphae. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a circular, itchy rash over the abdomen that has been slowly getting worse for the past 2 weeks. The patient has a medical history of chronic dermatitis and chronic sinusitis, and he smokes one-half pack of cigarettes every day. The physical examination reveals a 2 x 2 cm round and erythematous, annular plaque on the abdomen 3 cm to the left of the umbilicus. The KOH preparation from the skin scraping confirms the presence of hyphae. These findings are suggestive of a fungal infection, likely tinea corporis (ringworm of the body). The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a superficial fungal infection, which can be treated with topical antifungal agents. The presence of a 1/6 systolic murmur and mild coarse breath sounds at the bases may indicate some degree of systemic involvement, but they are not directly related to the primary diagnosis of fungal infection. Itraconazole is a systemic antifungal agent that may be used for more severe or disseminated fungal infections, but it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for superficial fungal infections like tinea corporis. Griseofulvin is an oral antifungal agent that is used to treat fungal infections of the skin, hair, and nails, but it is not typically used for superficial skin infections. Topical clindamycin is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections, not fungal infections. Doxycycline is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections, including acne and sinusitis, but it is not used to treat fungal infections. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is itraconazole, but considering the superficial nature of the infection, a topical antifungal agent may be sufficient. However, the question does not provide information about the severity of the infection or the patient's response to treatment, so itraconazole may be a reasonable choice. Topical antifungals like clotrimazole or miconazole may be more appropriate for superficial infections, but they are not listed as options. Given the options provided, itraconazole is the best choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination?

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, neurologic, or pulmonary disease help focus the differential diagnosis, as do findings relevant to the jugular venous pressure and waveforms, the arterial pulses, other heart sounds, the lungs, the abdomen, the skin, and the extremities. In many instances, laboratory studies, an ECG, and/or a chest x-ray may have been obtained earlier and may contain valuable information. A patient with suspected infective endocarditis, for example, may have a murmur in the setting of fever, chills, anorexia, fatigue, dyspnea, splenomegaly, petechiae, and positive blood cultures. A new systolic murmur in a patient with a marked fall in blood pressure after a recent MI suggests myocardial rupture.

First, it is critical to determine what type of lesions make up the eruption. Macules are flat lesions defined by an area of changed color (i.e., a blanchable erythema). Papules are raised, solid lesions <5 mm in diameter; plaques are lesions >5 mm in diameter with a flat, plateau-like surface; and nodules are lesions >5 mm in diameter with a more rounded configuration. Wheals (urticaria, hives) are papules or plaques that are pale pink and may appear annular (ringlike) as they enlarge; classic (nonvasculitic) wheals are transient, lasting only 24 h in any defined area. Vesicles (<5 mm) and bullae (>5 mm) are circumscribed, elevated lesions containing fluid.

Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): MW displayed signs of dehydration (such as dry mucous membranes and skin, poor skin turgor, and low blood pressure) and acidosis (such as deep, rapid breathing [Kussmaul respiration]). Her breath had a faintly fruity odor. Her temperature was normal."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

            "content": "Although AS and AR may coexist, a grade 2 or 3 crescendo-decrescendo mid-systolic murmur frequently is heard at the base of the heart in patients with isolated, severe AR and is due to an increased volume and rate of systolic flow. Accurate bedside identification of coexistent AS can be difficult unless the carotid pulse examination is abnormal or the mid-systolic murmur is of grade 4 or greater intensity. In the absence of heart failure, chronic severe AR is accompanied by several peripheral signs of significant diastolic run-off, including a wide pulse pressure, a \u201cwater-hammer\u201d carotid upstroke (Corrigan\u2019s pulse), and Quincke\u2019s pulsations of the nail beds. The diastolic murmur of acute, severe AR is notably shorter in duration and lower pitched than the murmur of chronic AR. It can be very difficult to appreciate in the presence of a rapid heart rate. These attributes reflect the abrupt rate of rise of diastolic pressure within the unprepared and noncompliant left ventricle and the"

The expression of infection is promoted by heat and humidity. The typical lesions consist of oval scaly macules, papules, and patches concentrated on the chest, shoulders, and back but only rarely on the face or distal extremities. On dark skin the lesions often appear as hypopigmented areas, while on light skin they are slightly erythematous or hyperpigmented. A KOH preparation from scaling lesions will demonstrate a confluence of short hyphae and round spores (\u201cspaghetti and meatballs\u201d). Lotions or shampoos containing sulfur, salicylic acid, or selenium sulfide will clear the infection if used daily for 1\u20132 weeks and then weekly thereafter. These preparations are irritating if left on the skin for >10 min; thus, they should be washed off completely. Treatment with some oral antifungal agents is also effective, but they do not provide lasting results and are not FDA"

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases.

He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min.
