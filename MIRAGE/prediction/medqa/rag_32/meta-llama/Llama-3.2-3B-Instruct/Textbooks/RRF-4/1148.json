Among all premenopausal women with breast cancer, 25\u201330% were pregnant at the time of diagnosis. It has been recognized for some time that breast cancer associated with pregnancy generally seems to have a poorer prognosis for both overall survival and progression-free survival. The definition of pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) has differed in various publications, but a generally accepted definition is breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy or within 1 year of delivery. There are likely several reasons for the observation of the poorer prognosis. Breast cancers diagnosed during pregnancy are often diagnosed at a later stage of disease and so have a poorer outcome. The late diagnosis is often due to the fact that early physical signs of the disease are missed or attributed to the changes that occur in the breast normally as a"

Some argue that stage for stage, the outcome is the same for breast cancer diagnosed in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Primary tumors in pregnant women are 3.5 cm on average, compared to <2 cm in nonpregnant women. A dominant mass and a nipple discharge are the most common presenting signs, and they should prompt ultrasonography and breast MRI exam (if available) followed by lumpectomy if the mass is solid and aspiration if the mass is cystic. Mammography is less reliable in pregnancy due to the increased breast density. Needle aspirates of breast masses in pregnant women are often nondiagnostic or falsely positive.

Mammography is appropriate if indicated, and the fetal radiation risk is negligible-0.04 mGywith appropriate shielding (rishna, 2013). But, because breast tissue is denser in pregnancy, mammography has a false-negative rate of 35 to 40 percent (Woo, 2003). If the decision to biopsy is uncertain, then MR imaging may be used.

            "content": "Although lactation does not affect the incidence of breast cancer, women who were never pregnant have a higher risk of breast cancer than those who are multiparous. Women who give birth to their first child later in life have a higher incidence of breast cancer than do younger primigravida women (12). A historic well-controlled study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that oral contraceptive use does not increase the risk of breast cancer, regardless of duration of use, family history, or coexistence of benign breast disease (13). A pooled analysis from 54 epidemiologic studies showed current users of oral contraceptives had a small but significant increased risk when compared with nonusers. Ten years after discontinuation, the risk of past users declined to that of the normal population (14)."

            "content": "In both circumstances, radiation exposure during adolescence, a period of active breast development, magnifies the deleterious effect. Studies also sug-gest that the risk of breast cancer increases as the amount of alcohol a woman consumes increases.49 Alcohol consumption is known to increase serum levels of estradiol. Finally, evidence suggests that long-term consumption of foods with a high fat content contributes to an increased risk of breast cancer by increasing serum estrogen levels.Risk Assessment ModelsThe average lifetime risk of breast cancer for newborn U.S. women is 12%.50,51 The longer a woman lives without cancer, the lower her risk of developing breast cancer. Thus, a woman age 50 years has an 11% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer, and a woman age 70 years has a 7% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Because risk factors for breast cancer interact, evaluating the risk conferred by combinations of risk factors is difficult. There are several risk"

            "content": "Breast Cancer Breast cancer is a major health concern for menopausal women, as it is the most common cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer death (56). The lifetime risk of invasive breast cancer for US women is 12%; therefore, any therapies that increase or reduce this risk will have a major impact on women\u2019s health. Risk factors for breast cancer include age, family history, early menarche, late menopause, and prior breast disease, including epithelial atypia and cancer. Risk is reduced in women who had bilateral oophorectomy or a term pregnancy before the age of 30. Many of these risk factors are consistent with the hypothesis that prolonged estrogen exposure increases breast cancer risk."
