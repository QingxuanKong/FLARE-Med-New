Of note, the patient denies any recent travel, sexual contacts, fever, dysuria, or diarrhea. His temperature is 98.1\u00b0F (36.7\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 12/min. On exam, the patient demonstrates severe excoriations in his perianal region with slight erythema over the areas that are torn. He does not have any other dermatologic findings. The scotch tape test is positive. The patient has a previous documented allergy to albendazole. Which of the following is an alternative medication that can be used?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break it down step by step. The patient presents with several weeks of intense itching around his anus, severe excoriations in the perianal region, and a positive scotch tape test. These symptoms are highly suggestive of anal itching due to a parasitic infestation, particularly pinworms (Enterobius vermicularis). Given the patient's symptoms and the scotch tape test result, the first step is to confirm the diagnosis of pinworm infection. The patient has a documented allergy to albendazole, which is a common treatment for pinworms. Therefore, we need to consider alternative medications. Amphotericin B is an antifungal medication, which is not indicated for pinworm infection. Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medication that is commonly used to treat pinworms, but it is not the only option. Pyrantel pamoate is another antiparasitic medication that is used to treat pinworms and other parasitic infections. It is a suitable alternative to albendazole. Considering the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most appropriate alternative medication to albendazole for treating pinworm infection is pyrantel pamoate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

            "content": "The following three brief scenarios of a patient with hemoptysis demonstrate three distinct patterns: A 46-year-old man presents to his internist with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

Focused History: LT is a widower and lives alone in a suburban community on the East Coast. He no longer drives. His two children live on the West Coast and come east infrequently. Since the death of his wife 11 months ago, he has been isolated and finds it hard to get out of the house. His appetite has changed, and he is content with cereal, coffee, and packaged snacks. Chewing is difficult."

Bleeker-Rovers, Jos W. M. van der Meer DEFINITION Clinicians commonly refer to any febrile illness without an initially obvious etiology as fever of unknown origin (FUO). Most febrile ill-nesses either resolve before a diagnosis can be made or develop distin-26 guishing characteristics that lead to a diagnosis. The term FUO should be reserved for prolonged febrile illnesses without an established etiology despite intensive evaluation and diagnostic testing. This chapter focuses on classic FUO in the adult patient."

It is important to perform a complete skin exam, with attention to both front and back. Specific rashes are often extremely helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis of an infection (Chaps. 24 and 25e). In numerous anecdotal instances, patients in the intensive care unit have had \u201cfever of unknown origin\u201d that was actually due to unrecognized pressure ulcers. Moreover, close examination of the distal extremities for splinter hemorrhages, Janeway lesions, or Osler\u2019s nodes may yield evidence of endocarditis or other causes of septic emboli."

            "content": "The clinical manifestations of atopic dermatitis vary with age. In infants, atopic dermatitis involves the face, scalp, cheeks, and extensor surfaces of the extremities (Fig. 80-1). The diaper area is spared. In older children, the rash localizes to the antecubital and popliteal flexural surfaces, head, and neck. In adolescents and adults, lichenified plaques are seen in the flexural areas (Fig. 80-2) and the head and neck regions. Itching or pruritus has a significant impact on the child and family\u2019s quality of life; it is often worse at night, interrupting sleep. Physical examination may show hyperlinearity of the palms and soles, white dermatographism, pityriasis alba, creases under the lower eyelids (Dennie\u2212Morgan folds or Dennie lines), and keratosis pilaris (asymptomatic horny follicular papules on the extensor surfaces of the arms)."

The eruption is localized to skin surfaces that are exposed to the irritant. Irritant contact dermatitis is observed frequently on the dorsal surfaces of the hands in patients, often from repeated hand washing or exposure to irritating chemicals. Diaper dermatitis is a common problem in infants and most commonly is a form of irritant contact dermatitis. The dermatitis is caused by irritation from urine and feces, typically affecting the perianal region and the buttocks while sparing the protected groin folds and other occluded areas. Secondary infection by Candida albicans or bacterial pathogens may complicate diaper dermatitis as well."
