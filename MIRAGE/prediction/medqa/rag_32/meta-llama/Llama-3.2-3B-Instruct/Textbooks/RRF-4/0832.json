    "question": "Two hours after admission to the hospital for rupture of membranes, a 35-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 40 weeks\u2019 gestation is evaluated for the sudden onset of chills, dyspnea, confusion, and hypotension. The patient successfully underwent combined spinal-epidural anesthesia 1 hour ago. Her pregnancy was uncomplicated with the exception of a positive vaginal swab for group B streptococci 3 weeks ago, for which she received one dose of intravenous penicillin. Her temperature is 37.6\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 70/30 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 82%. Physical examination shows labored breathing and thready pulses. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. The abdomen is nontender. Speculum examination shows pooling of bright red blood in the cervical canal. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 7.6 mg/dL and an undetectable fibrinogen concentration. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient\u2019s current condition?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a gravida 3, para 2 at 40 weeks\u2019 gestation with a history of rupture of membranes 2 hours ago. She presents with sudden onset of chills, dyspnea, confusion, and hypotension after undergoing combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. The patient\u2019s vital signs show tachycardia (130/min), tachypnea (30/min), hypotension (70/30 mmHg), and low oxygen saturation (82%) on room air. The physical examination reveals labored breathing, thready pulses, and crackles at both lung bases. The speculum examination shows pooling of bright red blood in the cervical canal, and laboratory studies show a low hemoglobin concentration (7.6 mg/dL) and undetectable fibrinogen concentration. The key to this case is the combination of maternal tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, and the presence of bright red blood in the cervical canal, which suggests a catastrophic event involving the maternal cardiovascular system and the fetal-placental unit. The patient\u2019s symptoms and signs are consistent with a diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism (AFE), a life-threatening condition that occurs when amniotic fluid enters the maternal circulation, triggering a severe reaction that can lead to cardiovascular collapse, respiratory failure, and death. The patient\u2019s recent history of rupture of membranes increases her risk for AFE. The undetectable fibrinogen concentration is a key laboratory finding that supports this diagnosis, as fibrinogen is consumed in the coagulation cascade triggered by AFE. The correct answer is B. Amniotic fluid entering the endocervical veins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Urine cultures are taken, but prospective trials show that blood cultures are of limited clinical utility (Gomi, 2015; Wing, 2000). We obtain blood cultures if the temperature is >39\u00b0C. Intravenous hydration to ensure adequate urinay ouput is the cornerstone of treatment. Antimicrobials are also begun promptly with the caveat that they may initially worsen endotoxemia from bacterial lysis. Surveillance for worsening sepsis syndrome includes serial monitoring of urinary output, blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and oxygen saturation. High fevers are lowered with a cooling blanket and acetaminophen. his is especially important in early pregnancy because of possible teratogenic efects from hyperthermia."

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Immediate consultation with an internist, hospitalist, or infectious disease specialist is recommended. Oxygen therapy and hydration should be initiated in addition to antibiotic therapy. Most patients will have an adequate clinical response within 3 days of treatment. Oral antibiotics may be given when patients meet the following criteria: ability to eat and drink, improvement in cough and dyspnea, afebrile (<100\u25e6F) on two occasions 8 hours apart, and a decreasing white blood cell count. If other clinical features are favorable, patients may be switched to oral antibiotics even if febrile. They may be discharged on the same day that oral antibiotics are started if other medical and social factors are favorable."

Despite precautions, hypotension is the most frequent side efect and is severe enough to require treatment in a third of women (Sharma, 1997). According to Miller and coworkers (2013), hypotension is more common-20 percent-in women with an admission pulse pressure <45 mm Hg, compared with 6 percent in those whose pulse pressure is >45 mm Hg. In normal gravidas, hypotension induced by epidural analgesia usually can be prevented by rapid infusion of 500 to 1000 mL of crystalloid solution as described for spinal analgesia. Maintaining a lateral position also minimizes hypotension."

Nitrazine paper test is (paper turns blue, indicating alkaline pH of amniotic f uid). Fern test is (a ferning pattern is seen under a microscope after amniotic fuid dries on a glass slide). Second step: Ultrasound to assess amniotic f uid volume. If unsure: Ultrasound-guided transabdominal instillation of indigo carmine dye to check for leakage (unequivocal test). Minimize infection risk; do not perform digital vaginal exams on women who are not in labor or for whom labor is not planned immediately. Check fetal heart tracing, maternal temperature, WBC count, and uterine tenderness for evidence of chorioamnionitis. Depends on GA and fetal lung maturity."

Before hypovolemic shock develops, symptoms and physical findings in women with uterine rupture may appear bizarre unless the possibility is kept in mind. For example, hemoperitoneum from a ruptured uterus may result in diaphragmatic irritation with pain referred to the chest. This may direct one to a diagnosis of pulmonary or amnionic fluid embolism instead of uterine rupture. As shown in Figure 31-5, the most common sign of uterine rupture is a nonreassuring fetl heart rate pattern with variable decelerations that may evolve into late decelerations and bradycardia. In 36 cases of such rupture during TOLAC, there were fetal signs of uterine rupture in 24, maternal signs in eight, and a combination of maternal and fetal in three (Holmgren, 2012). Few women experience cessation of contractions following uterine"

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."
