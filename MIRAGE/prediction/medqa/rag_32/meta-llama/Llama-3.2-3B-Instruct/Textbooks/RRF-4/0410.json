Treatment of hypernatremia must include both replacement of the existing free water deficit and daily replacement of ongoing free water loss. The first step is to estimate total-body water (TBW), typically estimated as 50% of the body weight in women and 60% in men. The free water deficit is then calculated as ([Na+ \u2212 140]/140) \u00d7 TBW. In this patient, the free water deficit was 4.2 L at a weight of 97.5 kg and plasma Na+ concentration of 150 meq/L.

A reduction in osmolality of even 1 percent stimulates osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus to decrease ADH and to suppress thirst and drinking; increased osmolality and reduced blood volume do the opposite. Normally, blood osmolality is about 282 mmol/kg and is maintained within a very narrow range. Release of ADH begins when osmolality reaches 287 mmol/kg (the \u201cosmotic threshold\u201d). At this point, plasma ADH levels are 2 pg/mL and increase rapidly as the osmolality rises. The response of ADH secretion to hyperosmolality is not the same for all plasma solutes; in contrast to hypernatremia, for example, hyperosmolality induced by elevations in urea nitrogen or endogenous glucose produce minimal or no elevations in ADH."

Polyuria results from two potential mechanisms: excretion of nonabsorbable solutes (such as glucose) or excretion of water (usually from a defect in ADH production or renal responsiveness). To distinguish a solute diuresis from a water diuresis and to determine whether the diuresis is appropriate for the clinical circumstances, urine osmolality is measured. The average person excretes between 600 and 800 mosmol of solutes per day, primarily as urea and electrolytes. If the urine output is >3 L/d and the urine is dilute (<250 mosmol/L), total mosmol excretion is normal and a water diuresis is present.

            "content": "The neurohumoral response to hypovolemia stimulates an increase in renal tubular Na+ and water reabsorption. Therefore, the urine Na+ concentration is typically <20 mM in nonrenal causes of hypovolemia, with a urine osmolality of >450 mOsm/kg. The reduction in both GFR and distal tubular Na+ delivery may cause a defect in renal potassium excretion, with an increase in plasma K+ concentration. Of note, patients with hypovolemia and a hypochloremic alkalosis due to vomiting, diarrhea, or diuretics will typically have a urine Na+ concentration >20 mM and urine pH of >7.0, due to the increase in filtered HCO3\u2013; the urine Cl\u2013 concentration in this setting is a more accurate indicator of volume status, with a level <25 mM suggestive of hypovolemia. The urine Na+ concentration is often >20 mM in patients with renal causes"

            "content": "The average adult daily \ufb02uid maintenance requirement is approximately 30 mL/kg/day, or 2,000 to 3,000 mL per day (26). This level is offset partially by insensible losses of 1,200 mL per day, which include losses from the lungs (600 mL), skin (400 mL), and gastrointestinal tract (200 mL). Urinary output from the kidney accounts for the remainder of the \ufb02uid loss, and this output will vary depending on total body intake of water and sodium. Approximately 600 to 800 mOsm of solute are excreted by the kidneys daily. Healthy kidneys can concentrate urine up to approximately 1,200 mOsm and, therefore, the minimum output can range between 500 and 700 mL per day. The maximal urine output of the kidney can be as high as 20 L per day, as seen in patients with diabetes insipidus. In healthy individuals, the kidney adjusts output commensurate with daily \ufb02uid intake."

            "content": "The ability of the kidney to produce a concentrated urine is dependent upon many factors and reliant on good tubular function in multiple regions of the kidney. In the patient not taking diuretics and with good baseline kidney function, urine osmolality may be above 500 mOsm/kg in prerenal azotemia, consistent with an intact medullary gradient and elevated serum vasopressin levels causing water reabsorption resulting in concentrated urine. In elderly patients and those 1808 with CKD, however, baseline concentrating defects may exist, making urinary osmolality unreliable in many instances. Loss of concentrating ability is common in septic or ischemic AKI, resulting in urine osmolality below 350 mOsm/kg, but the finding is not specific."

The plasma Na+ concentration increased to 129 meq/L with this therapy; however, the patient developed orthostatic hypotension and dizziness. He was started on demeclocycline, 600 mg PO in the morning and 300 mg in the evening, just before discharge from hospital. Plasma Na+ concentration increased to 140 meq/L with a BUN of 23 and creatinine of 1.4, at which point demeclocycline was reduced to 300 mg PO bid. Bronchoscopic biopsy eventually showed small-cell lung cancer; the patient declined chemotherapy and was admitted to hospice. What factors contributed to this patient\u2019s hyponatremia? What are the therapeutic options?"

As the tubular fluid descends deeper into the medulla, water continues to be reabsorbed from the collecting duct, increasing the tubular fluid osmolality to 1200 mOsm/ kg H2O at the tip of the papilla. 7. The urine produced when AVP levels are elevated has an osmolality of 1200 mOsm/kg H2O and contains high concentrations of urea and other nonreabsorbed solutes. Urine volume under this condition can be as low as 0.5 L/day."

            "content": "Diagnostic Approach The cause of hypokalemia is usually evident from history, physical examination, and/or basic laboratory tests. The history should focus on medications (e.g., laxatives, diuretics, antibiotics), diet and dietary habits (e.g., licorice), and/or symptoms that suggest a particular cause (e.g., periodic weakness, diarrhea). The physical examination should pay particular attention to blood pressure, volume status, and signs suggestive of specific hypokalemic disorders, e.g., hyperthyroidism and Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Initial laboratory evaluation should include electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, serum osmolality, Mg2+, Ca2+, a complete blood count, and urinary pH, osmolality, creatinine, and electrolytes (Fig. 63-7). The presence of a non\u2013anion gap acidosis suggests a distal, hypokalemic renal tubular acidosis or diarrhea; calculation of the urinary anion gap can help differentiate these two diagnoses. Renal K+ excretion can be assessed with a 24-h urine collection; a 24-h K+"
