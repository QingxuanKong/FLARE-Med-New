    "question": "A 42-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressive fatigue and shortness of breath for 1 month. He has been unable to practice with his recreational soccer team and has had to rest frequently when walking to work. His only medication is ibuprofen for joint pain. Physical examination shows tanned skin. There is tenderness to palpation and stiffness of the metacarpophalangeal joints of both hands. Pulmonary examination shows coarse crackles in both lung fields. The liver is palpated 4 cm below the right costal margin. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) testing is most likely to be positive for which of the following?",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To solve this question, we need to analyze the symptoms and physical examination findings presented in the scenario. The patient is a 42-year-old man with progressive fatigue and shortness of breath for 1 month, which has forced him to stop participating in his recreational soccer team and rest frequently while walking to work. He has joint pain, tenderness to palpation, and stiffness of the metacarpophalangeal joints of both hands. The patient's skin is tanned, and there are coarse crackles in both lung fields on pulmonary examination. The liver is palpated 4 cm below the right costal margin. These symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a systemic illness with joint involvement, lung involvement, and liver involvement. The presence of systemic symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and joint pain, along with the liver enlargement, points towards a systemic autoimmune disease. In this context, the most likely diagnosis is Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect various parts of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, brain, and other organs. HLA testing is often used to help diagnose SLE, as certain HLA types are associated with an increased risk of developing the disease. The most commonly associated HLA types with SLE are HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR3. Therefore, the correct answer is: B. HLA-DR4 Here is the output in the required JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a systemic autoimmune disease.

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?"

            "content": "Palpation can be accomplished by bimanual palpation, ballotment, and palpation from above (Middleton maneuver). For bimanual palpation, which is at least as reliable as the other techniques, the patient is supine with flexed knees. The examiner\u2019s left hand is placed on the lower rib cage and pulls the skin toward the costal margin, allowing the fingertips of the right hand to feel the tip of the spleen as it descends while the patient inspires slowly, smoothly, and deeply. Palpation is begun with the right hand in the left lower quadrant with gradual movement toward the left costal margin, thereby identifying the lower edge of a massively enlarged spleen. When the spleen tip is felt, the finding is recorded as centimeters below the left costal margin at some arbitrary point, i.e., 10\u201315 cm, from the midpoint of the umbilicus or the xiphisternal junction. This allows other examiners to compare findings or the initial examiner to determine changes in size over time. Bimanual palpation"

The examining physician discovers postural hypotension and moderate vitiligo (depigmented areas of skin) and obtains routine blood tests. She finds hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis and suspects Addison\u2019s disease. She performs a standard ACTH 1\u201324 stimulation test, which reveals an insufficient plasma cortisol response compatible with primary adrenal insuf-ficiency. The diagnosis of autoimmune Addison\u2019s disease is made, and the patient must start replacement of the hormones he cannot produce himself. How should this patient be treated? What precautions should he take?"

            "content": "Symptoms of localized inflammation vary depending on the involved site. Arthritis, or inflammation of the synovium (synovitis), leads to joint pain, swelling, and impaired ability to use the affected joint. Morning stiffness or gelling is described. The child may be slow to arise in the morning and may have a limp. Children may refrain from usual activities and athletics. Enthesitis is inflammation at the insertion of a ligament to a bone. Serositis, inflammation of serosal lining such as pleuritis, pericarditis, or peritonitis, gives rise to chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. Myositis,inflammation of the muscle, may lead to symptoms of muscle pain, weakness, or difficulty performing tasks of daily living. Vasculitis, inflammation of the blood vessels, leads to nonspecific symptoms of rash (petechiae, purpura) and edema when small vessels deep in the papillary dermis are involved; involvement of medium-sized vessels results in a circumscribed tender nodule."

The patient or family will describe an acute onset of pain in the groin/hip, anterior thigh, or knee. Irritation of the obturator nerve can cause referred pain in the thigh and knee when the pathology is at the hip. Patients with transient synovitis are often afebrile, walk with a painful limp, and have normal to minimally elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate compared with bacterial diseases of the hip (Table 199-1). Table 197-3 lists the differential diagnosis of a limping child. Anteroposterior and frog-leg radiographs of the hip are usually normal. Ultrasonography may reveal a joint effusion. It is mandatory to rule out septic arthritis in the presence of effusion with a joint aspiration and cell count."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"
