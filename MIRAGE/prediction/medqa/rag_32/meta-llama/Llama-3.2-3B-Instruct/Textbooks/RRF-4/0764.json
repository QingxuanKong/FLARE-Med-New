She is in active labor and has lost a lot of blood in the past 2 hours, but appears alert and cooperative. At the hospital, her blood pressure is 88/65 mm Hg, the pulse is 110/min, and the respirations are 23/min. Neither the hospital nor the emergency department is equipped for high-risk pregnancies. The patient and her husband request a transfer to a more capable center. They are informed of the hospital\u2019s obligations under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act and the risks of transfer. They insist to be transferred. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) requires that a hospital provide emergency medical screening examination to any pregnant woman experiencing contractions, regardless of her ability to pay. The patient is already in active labor and has lost a lot of blood, but appears alert and cooperative. The hospital is not equipped for high-risk pregnancies, but the patient and her husband insist on being transferred to a more capable center. The key issue here is balancing the patient's autonomy with the hospital's obligations under EMTALA and the risks associated with transfer. The patient's condition requires immediate attention, and delaying treatment could lead to further complications. The hospital should prioritize the patient's well-being and safety while also respecting her autonomy and the couple's request for transfer. The most appropriate next step is to transfer the patient to a more capable center, while also ensuring that she receives necessary treatment and monitoring during transport. This approach respects the patient's autonomy while minimizing the risks associated with transfer and ensuring that she receives timely and appropriate care.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Neonatologists are consulted before delivery, and a trilateral discussion of survival and morbidity rates ensues with the woman and her family. A neonatologist attends each delivery and determines subsequent management. In our institution, traditional fetal indications for cesarean delivery are practiced in women at 25\u00b0/7 weeks or beyond. Cesarean delivery is not ofered for fetal indications before 24\u00b0/7 weeks. At 240r weeks, cesarean delivery is not ofered unless fetal weight is estimated at 750 g or greater.

Request urgent help from the anesthesia team. 4. Secure at least two large-bore intravenous catheters so that crystalloid with oxytocin can be continued simultaneously with blood products. Insert an indwelling Foley catheter for continuous urine output monitoring. 5. Begin volume resuscitation with rapid intravenous infusion of crystalloid (p. 788). 6. With sedation, analgesia, or anesthesia established and now with optimal exposure, once again manually explore the uterine cavity for retained placental fragments and for uterine abnormalities, including lacerations or rupture.

The patient had no significant adverse effects from this dosage. At age 21, she had a second tonic-clonic seizure while in college; further discussion with her room-mate at that time revealed a history of two recent episodes of 1\u20132 minutes of altered consciousness with lip smacking (focal impaired awareness seizure, formerly complex partial seizure). A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid. Four days later, electroencephalography (EEG)"

Domestic violence is also common, affecting between 10% and 30% of pregnant women and resulting in fetal mortality of 5%.Pregnancy results in physiologic changes that may impact postinjury evaluation (Table 7-13). Heart rate increases by 10 to 15 beats per minute during the first trimester and remains elevated until delivery. Blood pressure diminishes during the first two trimesters due to a decrease in systemic vascular resis-tance and rises again slightly during the third trimester (mean values: first = 105/60, second = 102/55, third = 108/67). Intra-vascular volume is increased by up to 8 L, which results in a relative anemia but also a relative hypervolemia. Consequently, a pregnant woman may lose 35% of her blood volume before exhibiting signs of shock."

Only a few obstetrical sevices have these capabilities (Zeeman, 2003, 2006). For smaller hospitls, transfer to a medical or surgical ICU is usually preferable, and sometimes transfer to another hospital is necessary. s discussed, indications for admission to these types of critical care units vary, however, patient mix for these units is similar (Table 47-2). he American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017b) has summarized criticl obstetrical care implementation depending on hospital size and technical facilities. Data obtained during pregnancy with pulmonary artery catheterization (PAC) have contributed immensely to the understanding of normal pregnancy hemodynamics and pathophysiology of common obstetrical conditions. These include preeclampsia-eclampsia, acute respiratory distress syndrome,"

The tip of the catheter is then placed more inferiorly at the junction of the right atrium and the superior vena cava. The reason for placing the catheter in such a position relates to the agents that are infused. Most chemotherapeutic agents are severely cytotoxic (kill cells), and enabling good mixing with the blood prevents thrombosis and vein wall irritation. A 15-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of productive cough with copious purulent sputum, increasing shortness of breath, fatigue, fever around 38.5\u00b0 C, and no response to oral amoxicillin prescribed to her by a family physician. The patient was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis shortly after birth and had multiple admissions to the hospital for pulmonary and gastrointestinal manifestations of the disease."
