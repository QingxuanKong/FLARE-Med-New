    "question": "A 22-year-old man presents to a psychiatrist complaining of mood fluctuations. He is accompanied by his mother who reports that the patient recently experienced a 5-day episode of minimal sleep and unusual levels of energy. The patient admits to spending $2,000 of his parent\u2019s money, without asking, on a down payment for a motorcycle. The episode resolved after 5 days, at which point the patient felt guilty and upset. The patient\u2019s medical history is notable for multiple month-long episodes in the past 2 years of feeling sad, sleeping more than usual, being uninterested in his hobbies, and feeling constantly tired and guilty. The patient has a history of severe meningoencephalitis at the age of 17 requiring four days in the intensive care unit. During that episode, he reported seeing monkeys in his hospital room. On exam, he is a well-appearing, cooperative male in no acute distress. He is alert and oriented with a normal affect. He states that he feels sad and guilty about what happens. He denies suicidal ideation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely diagnosis for the patient, we need to analyze the symptoms and history provided. The patient experiences mood fluctuations, including episodes of elevated energy, impulsive spending, and feelings of guilt and sadness. He has a history of severe meningoencephalitis, which may have had a lasting impact on his mental health. The patient's symptoms do not meet the criteria for a manic episode, as there is no evidence of increased energy, activity, or grandiosity. However, the episodes of elevated mood and impulsive behavior are characteristic of bipolar disorder. The patient's symptoms also include feelings of guilt and sadness, which are common in depressive disorders. The patient's history of meningoencephalitis and the presence of psychotic symptoms (seeing monkeys in his hospital room) suggest a possible psychotic component to his condition. This is consistent with schizoaffective disorder. The patient's symptoms do not meet the criteria for cyclothymic disorder, as there is no evidence of a consistent mood fluctuation pattern over a period of two years. The patient's symptoms do not meet the criteria for persistent depressive disorder, as there is no evidence of a depressed mood for more than two years. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder, with a psychotic feature.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The patient\u2019s inability to give a coherent account of his symptoms bears witness to the presence of dementia. Sleep disturbances, especially insomnia, are prominent in some cases and a particular disorder relating to the acting out of dreams during REM sleep marks some of the degenerative dementia. Sometimes the mental failure is brought to light more dramatically by a severe confusional state attending a febrile illness, a concussive head injury, an operative procedure, or the administration of some new medicine, as discussed in the following text and in Chap. 19. As noted there, the family almost uniformly, but mistakenly, dates an abrupt onset of dementia to the time of the intercurrent illness, a fall, or an operation."

There may be a brief prodromal period of inertia and drowsiness. The duration of nocturnal sleep may be greatly prolonged, or, as in our patients referred to below, they may sleep for days on end. Food intake during and around the period of hypersomnia may exceed three times the normal (bulimia) and occurs almost compulsively during brief periods of semiwakefulness; to a variable extent, there are other behavioral changes such as social withdrawal, negativism, slowness of thinking, incoherence,"

They say that they are \u201cwiped out, or burned out,\u201d \u201ctired all the time,\u201d \u201cweary,\u201d \u201cexhausted,\u201d or that they have \u201cno energy,\u201d \u201cno ambition,\u201d or \u201cno interest.\u201d They may manifest their condition by showing an indifference to the tasks at hand, by emphasizing how hard they are working, or how stressed they are by circumstances; they may be inclined to lie down or to occupy themselves with trivial tasks. On closer analysis, one observes and hears that many such patients have difficulty initiating activity but also in sustaining it; that is, their endurance is diminished. This condition, of course, is the familiar aftermath of sleeplessness or prolonged mental or physical effort, and, under such circumstances, it is accepted as a normal reaction. When, however, similar symptoms appear without relation to such antecedents, they should be suspected of being the manifestations of"

Following a sleepless night with significant dyspnea, the patient develops nausea and vomiting and collapses. He presents to the emergency department in cardiac arrest and is unable to be resuscitated. His autopsy shows a posterior wall myocardial infarction and a fresh thrombus in an atherosclerotic right coronary artery. What went wrong? The clinician had decided, based on the patient\u2019s appearance, even before starting the history, that the patient\u2019s complaints were not serious. Therefore, he felt confident that he could perform an abbreviated and focused examination by using the URI assessment protocol rather than considering the broader range of possibilities and performing appropriate tests to confirm or refute his initial hypotheses. In particular, by concentrating on the URI, the clinician failed to elicit the full dyspnea history, which would have"

An episode may be characterized by sadness, indifference, apathy, or irritability and is usually associated with changes in sleep patterns, appetite, and weight; motor agitation or retardation; fatigue; impaired concentration and decision making; feelings of shame or guilt; and thoughts of death or dying. Patients with depression have a profound loss of pleasure in all enjoyable activities, exhibit early morning awakening, feel that the dysphoric mood state is qualitatively different from sadness, and often notice a diurnal variation in mood (worse in morning hours). Patients experiencing bereavement or grief may exhibit many of the same signs and symptoms of major depression, although the emphasis is usually on feelings of emptiness and loss, rather than"

To witness an attack is of great assistance in diagnosis but electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring is often required for certainty. The lack of an aura, initiating cry, hurtful fall, or incontinence; the presence of peculiar movements such as grimacing, squirming, thrashing and flailing of the limbs, side-to-side motions of the head, and striking at or resisting those who offer assistance; the retention of consciousness during a motor seizure that involves both sides of the body; a long duration of the seizure, its abrupt termination by strong sensory stimulation, lack of postictal confusion, and failure to produce a rise in creatine kinase\u2014are all typical of the psychogenic attack. Sometimes hyperventilation will initiate an attack and is"

Elevated, expansive mood. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school. or sexually). 6. Increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees. sexual in- discretions, foolish business investments). 7. Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleeping less than usual; to be contrasted with insomnia). B. Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the per- son\u2019s usual behavior."

This is usually in the form of monetary compensation, which, surprisingly, is sometimes less than that which the patient could earn if he returned to work. Most such patients are actively engaged in litigation when first seen. Another interesting feature is the frequency with which the patient expresses extreme dissatisfaction with the medical care given him; he is often hostile toward the physicians and nurses. Many of these patients have already been subjected to an excessive number of hospitalizations and rather dramatic mishaps have allegedly occurred in carrying out diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The majority of these patients were previously suspected of malingering."

Occurring, as it often does, during an infection with fever or in the course of a toxic or metabolic disorder (such as renal or hepatic failure) or as an effect of medication, drugs, or alcohol, it never fails to create problems for the physician, nurses, and family. The physician has to cope with the problem of diagnosis, often without the advantage of a lucid history, and any program of therapy is constantly impeded by the patient\u2019s inattention, agitation, sleeplessness, and inability to cooperate. Nurses are burdened with the need to provide satisfactory care and a safe environment for the patient, and at the same time, maintain a tranquil atmosphere for other patients. The family must be supported as it faces the frightening prospect of a deranged mind with peculiar behaviors and all it signifies."
