He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, mitral regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation. Three days ago, he was started on treatment with warfarin. His only other medications are metformin and lisinopril. His temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100.0\u00b0F), pulse is 108/min and irregularly irregular, and blood pressure is 155/89 mm Hg.

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: **Step 1: Analyze the patient's symptoms and medical history** The patient is a 78-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus, mitral regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation. He has been started on warfarin 3 days ago, and now presents with painful enlarging bruises, skin ulceration over his thighs and external genitalia, purpura, hemorrhagic bullae, and areas of skin necrosis. **Step 2: Identify the likely cause of the patient's symptoms** Given the patient's recent initiation of warfarin and the development of skin necrosis, the likely cause of his symptoms is warfarin-induced skin necrosis. This is a rare but serious complication of warfarin therapy, characterized by skin lesions that can progress to necrosis. **Step 3: Evaluate the treatment options** The patient is most likely to benefit from treatment with protein C concentrate, which is a specific antidote for warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Protein C concentrate can help reverse the anticoagulant effects of warfarin and promote the healing of skin lesions. **Answer in JSON format:** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms are consistent with warfarin-induced skin necrosis, a rare but serious complication of warfarin therapy. The patient is most likely to benefit from treatment with protein C concentrate, which is a specific antidote for this condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"} Note: The other options are not correct because hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used to treat gas gangrene, argatroban is an anticoagulant that would exacerbate the condition, and tranexamic acid is used to treat bleeding, not skin necrosis.",

Local hypoxemia secondary to decreased cutaneous blood flow can also produce blisters, which explains the presence of bullae over pressure points in comatose patients (coma bullae). In diabetes mellitus, tense bullae with clear sterile viscous fluid arise on normal skin. The lesions can be as large as 6 cm in diameter and are located on the distal extremities. There are several types of porphyria, but the most common form with cutaneous findings is porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). In sun-exposed areas (primarily the face and hands), the skin is very fragile, with trauma leading to erosions mixed with tense vesicles. These lesions then heal with scarring and formation of milia; the latter are firm, 1to 2-mm white or yellow papules that represent epidermoid inclusion cysts.

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian"

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

He had had limited instruction on how to manage his dia-betes. He had peripheral neuropathy, proteinuria, low HDL cholesterol levels, and hypertension. The patient underwent multifactorial intervention targeting his weight, glucose levels, and blood pressure. He was advised to stop smoking. He attended structured diabetes classes and received indi-vidualized instruction from a diabetes educator and a dieti-tian. Metformin therapy was reinitiated and his insulin doses were reduced. The patient was then given the GLP1 receptor agonist, exenatide. The patient lost about 8 kg in weight over the next 3 years and was able to stop his insulin. He had excellent control with an HbA1c of 6.5 % on a combination of metformin, exenatide, and glimepiride. His antihyperten-sive therapy was optimized and his urine albumin excretion declined to 1569 mg/g creatinine. This case"

D. Krabbe disease. E. Niemann-Pick disease. Correct answer = A. Fabry disease, a deficiency of \u03b1-galactosidase, is the only X-linked sphingolipidosis. It is characterized by pain in the extremities, a red-purple skin rash (generalized angiokeratomas), and kidney and cardiac complications. Protein in his urine indicates kidney damage. Enzyme replacement therapy is available. 7.4. Current medical advice for individuals experiencing chest pain is to call emergency medical services and chew a regular strength, noncoated aspirin.
