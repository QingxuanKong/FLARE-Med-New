This leads to increased vascular permeability, vasodilation, and smooth muscle contraction, resulting in symptoms such as pruritic wheals, erythema, and edema.

It is characterized by an urticarial reaction localized to the site of skin trauma. It has been suggested that trauma induces an IgE-mediated reaction causing histamine to be released from the mast cells. Cholinergic urticaria, characterized by the appearance of 1to 3-mm wheals surrounded by large erythematous flares after an increase in core body temperature, occurs commonly in young adults. Lesions may develop during strenuous exercise, after a hot bath, or emotional stress. The lack of airway symptoms differentiates it from exercise-induced anaphylaxis."

These mediators cause a rapid increase in vascular permeability, resulting in visible edema and reddening of the skin (in a skin response) and airway narrowing as result of edema and the constriction of smooth muscle (in an airway response). In the skin, histamine acting on H1 receptors on local blood vessels causes an immediate increase in vascular permeability, which leads to extravasation of fluid and edema. Histamine also acts on H1 receptors on local nerve endings, leading to reflex vasodilation of cutaneous blood vessels and local reddening of the skin.

Cross-linking of IgE causes mast cell degranulation, which results in a histamine release; this prompts the development of a central wheal and erythematous flare.

Urticaria and angioedema occur in response to the release of inflammatory mediators, including histamine, leukotrienes, platelet-activating factor, prostaglandins, and cytokines from mast cells present in the skin. A variety of stimuli can trigger mast cells and basophils to release their chemical mediators. Typically mast cells degranulate when cross-linking of the membrane-bound IgE occurs. Release of these mediators results in vasodilation, increased vascular leakage, and pruritus.

            "content": "When an individual is exposed to a specific antigen (aller-gen) that reacts with IgE antibodies bound to the surface of mast cells or basophils via their high-affinity receptors (Fc\u03b5RI), it initiates mast cell activation. This type of IgE-dependent activation initiates a cascade of events, result-ing in allergic reactions. These reactions can occur as immediate hypersensitiviy reactions, (usually within sec-onds to minutes after exposure to an allegen), late-phase reactions, or chronic allergic inflammations. The immediate hypersensitivity reaction involves IgE-mediated release of histamine and other mediators from mast cells and also from basophils. The clinical symp-toms caused by the above mediators vary, depending on which organ system is affected. The release of mediators in the superficial layers of the skin can manifest as erythema (redness), swelling and itch-ing, or pain sensations. Respiratory system symptoms in-clude sneezing, rhinorrhea (runny nose), increased production"

Dermatitis herpetiformis is an autoimmune blistering disorder associated with gluten sensitivity that is characterized by extremely pruritic grouped vesicles and papules. The disease affects predominantly males, often in the third and fourth decades of life. Up to 80% of cases are associated with celiac disease; conversely, only a small fraction of patients with celiac disease develop dermatitis herpetiformis. Like celiac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis responds to a gluten-free diet."

There may be upper or lower airway obstruction or both. Laryngeal edema may be experienced as a \u201clump\u201d in the throat, hoarseness, or stridor, whereas bronchial obstruction is associated with a feeling of tightness in the chest and/or audible wheezing. Patients with asthma are predisposed to severe involvement of the lower airways and increased mortality. Flushing with diffuse erythema and a feeling of warmth may occur. A characteristic feature is the eruption of well-circumscribed, discrete cutaneous wheals with erythematous,raised, serpiginous borders and blanched centers. These urticarial eruptions are intensely pruritic and may be localized or disseminated. They may coalesce to form"
