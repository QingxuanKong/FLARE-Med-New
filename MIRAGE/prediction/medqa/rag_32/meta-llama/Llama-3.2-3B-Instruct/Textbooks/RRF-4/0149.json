    "question": "An 11-month-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother for a rash on his trunk, which he has had for the past 2 days. She notes that he is eating less and is more cranky than usual. His birth history is insignificant, and his immunizations are up to date. Vital signs include: temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100.0\u00b0F), pulse is 98/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. The rash features thin-walled, fluid-filled blisters that rupture easily. Fluid samples from the lesions are sent for analysis to a microbiology lab. The results reveal an infection by the gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The patient is diagnosed with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Which of the following is involved with the primary defense in response to the bacteria and toxins produced by this organism?",

SSSS is a condition characterized by the production of exfoliative toxins by Staphylococcus aureus, which cause the separation of the epidermis from the dermis, leading to blistering and skin sloughing. The primary defense against S. aureus and its toxins involves the activation of the immune system, specifically the production of antibodies. Among the immunoglobulins, IgG is the most abundant and provides long-term protection against S. aureus. IgM is the first line of defense and provides immediate protection, but its half-life is shorter than IgG. IgA is primarily involved in mucosal immunity, while IgD is present on the surface of mature B cells and plays a role in the activation of B cells. Given the clinical presentation of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, the most likely involved immunoglobulin is IgG, which provides long-term protection against S. aureus and its toxins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

The skin is usually fragile and often tender, with thin-walled, fluid-filled bullae. Gentle pressure results in rupture of the lesions, leaving denuded underlying skin (Nikolsky\u2019s sign; Fig. 172-4). The mucous membranes are usually spared. In more generalized infection, there are often constitutional symptoms, including fever, lethargy, and irritability with poor feeding. Significant amounts of fluid can be lost in more extensive cases. Illness usually follows localized infection at one of a number of possible sites. SSSS is much less common among adults but can follow infections caused by exfoliative toxin\u2013producing strains."

In SSSS, the initial findings are redness and tenderness of the central face, neck, trunk, and intertriginous zones. This is followed by short-lived flaccid bullae and a slough or exfoliation of the superficial epidermis. Crusted areas then develop, characteristically around the mouth in a radial pattern. SSSS is distinguished from TEN by the following features: younger age group (primarily infants), more superficial site of blister formation, no oral lesions, shorter course, lower morbidity and mortality rates, and an association with staphylococcal exfoliative toxin (\u201cexfoliatin\u201d), not drugs. A rapid diagnosis of SSSS versus TEN can be made by a frozen section of the blister roof or exfoliative cytology of the blister contents. In SSSS, the site of staphylococcal infection is usually extracutaneous (conjunctivitis, rhinorrhea,"

Obstetric abnormalities in the third trimester (premature birth, prolonged labor, premature rupture of fetal membranes) occur frequently in mothers of infants who develop meningitis in the first weeks of life. The most significant factor in the pathogenesis of the meningitis is maternal infection (usually a urinary tract infection or puerperal fever of unknown cause). The infection in both mother and infant is most often caused by gram-negative enterobacteria, particularly E. coli, and group B streptococci, and less often to Pseudomonas, Listeria, S. aureus, or Staphylococcus epidermidis (formerly albus), and group A streptococci. Analysis of postmortem material indicates that in most cases infection occurs at or near the time of birth, although clinical signs of meningitis may not become evident until several days or a week later."

Blisters are caused by the production of exfoliative toxin by S. aureus phage type II. This is the same toxin responsible for staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome, often resulting in dramatic loss of the superficial epidermis due to blistering. The latter syndrome is much more common in children than in adults; however, it should be considered along with toxic epidermal necrolysis and severe drug eruptions in patients with widespread blistering of the skin.

Enzyme replacement therapy is available. 7.4. Current medical advice for individuals experiencing chest pain is to call emergency medical services and chew a regular strength, noncoated aspirin. What is the basis for recommending aspirin?"

It is transmitted by direct contact. There are two types: Common type: Characterized by pustules and honey-colored crusts on an erythematous base; generally appears on the face (see Figure 2.211). Bullous type: Usually acral; characterized by large stable blisters. Bullous impetigo is almost always caused by S. aureus and can evolve into SSSS. Streptococcal impetigo can be complicated by acute streptococcal glomerulonephritis. FIGURE 2.2-11. Impetigo. What is another skin condition caused by group A strep? Erysipelas, which presents as a small red patch on the cheek that turns into a painful raised, shiny red plaque. Patients often have a history of trauma or pharyngitis. Treat with penicillin."

This syndrome was called streptococcal TSS because it shares certain features with staphylococcal TSS. In 1993, a case definition for streptococcal TSS was formulated (Table 173-4). The general features of the illness include fever, hypotension, renal impairment, and respiratory distress syndrome. Various types of rash have been described, but rash usually does not develop. Laboratory abnormalities include a marked shift to the left in the white blood cell differential, with many immature granulocytes; hypocalcemia; hypoalbuminemia; and thrombocytopenia, which usually becomes more pronounced on the second or third day of illness. In contrast to patients with staphylococcal TSS, the majority with streptococcal TSS are bacteremic. The most common associated infection is a soft tissue infection\u2014necrotizing"

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

These lesions, which evolve from maculopapules to vesicles over hours to days, appear on the trunk and face and rapidly spread to involve other areas of the body. Most are small and have an erythematous base with a diameter of 5\u201310 mm. Successive crops appear over a 2to 4-day period. Lesions can also be found on the mucosa of the pharynx and/or the vagina. Their severity varies from one person to another. Some individuals have very few lesions, while others have as many as 2000.
