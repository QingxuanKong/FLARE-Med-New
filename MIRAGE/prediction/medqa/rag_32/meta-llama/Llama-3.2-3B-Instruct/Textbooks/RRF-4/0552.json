    "question": "A 58-year-old woman presents to the emergency department because of worsening abdominal pain for the past 2 days. She reports nausea and vomiting and is unable to tolerate oral intake. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), the pulse is 92/min, the respirations are 18/min, and the blood pressure is 132/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows yellowish discoloration of her sclera. Her abdomen is tender in the right upper quadrant. There is no abdominal distention or organomegaly. The laboratory tests show the following results:\nHemoglobin 13 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 16,000/mm3\nUrea nitrogen 25 mg/dL\nCreatinine 2 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 432 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase 196 U/L\nAspartate transaminase 207 U/L\nBilirubin  \nTotal 3.8 mg/dL\nDirect 2.7 mg/dL\nLipase 82 U/L\nUltrasound of the right upper quadrant shows dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple hyperechoic spheres within the gallbladder. The pancreas is not well visualized. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and metronidazole are initiated. After 12 hours, the patient appears acutely ill and is not oriented to time. Her temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.4\u00b0F), the pulse is 105/min, the respirations are 22/min, and the blood pressure is 112/82 mm Hg.

The ultrasound findings of dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple hyperechoic spheres within the gallbladder suggest a diagnosis of acute cholangitis or choledocholithiasis. Given the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform an ERCP to visualize the bile ducts and remove any stones or debris causing the obstruction. This will also allow for therapeutic interventions such as stone extraction, dilation of the bile duct, or placement of a stent to restore bile flow. The patient's instability and lack of improvement with initial fluid and antibiotic therapy necessitate urgent intervention to relieve the obstruction and prevent further complications.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

            "content": "The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is usually made on the basis of a characteristic history and physical examination. The triad of sudden onset of RUQ tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis is highly suggestive. Typically, leukocytosis in the range of 10,000\u201315,000 cells per microliter with a left shift on differential count is found. The serum bilirubin is mildly elevated (<85.5 \u03bcmol/L [5 mg/dL]) in fewer than half of patients, whereas about one-fourth have modest elevations in serum aminotransferases (usually less than a fivefold elevation). Ultrasound will demonstrate calculi in 90\u201395% of cases and is useful for detection of signs of gallbladder inflammation including thickening of the wall, pericholecystic fluid, and dilatation of the bile duct. The radionuclide (e.g., HIDA) biliary scan may be confirmatory if bile duct imaging is seen without visualization of the gallbladder."

Abdominal swelling caused by intestinal gas can be differentiated from swelling caused by fluid or a solid mass by percussion; an abdomen filled with gas is tympanic, whereas an abdomen containing a mass or fluid is dull to percussion.

Murphy\u2019s sign, an inspiratory arrest with deep palpation in the right subcostal area, is characteristic of acute cholecystitis.Laboratory evaluation commonly reveals a mild to mod-erate leukocytosis (12,000\u201315,000 cells/mm3). However, a normal WBC does not rule out the diagnosis. An unusually high WBC count (>20,000 cells/mm3) suggests a complicated form of cholecystitis such as gangrenous cholecystitis, perfo-ration, or associated cholangitis. In uncomplicated acute cho-lecystitis, serum liver chemistries are usually normal, but a mild elevation of serum"

Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria.

            "content": "the presence of a palpably enlarged gallbladder suggests that the biliary obstruction is secondary to an underlying malignancy rather than to calculous disease. Biliary obstruction causes progressive dilatation of the intra-hepatic bile ducts as intrabiliary pressures rise. Hepatic bile flow is suppressed, and reabsorption and regurgitation of conjugated bilirubin into the bloodstream lead to jaundice accompanied by dark urine (bilirubinuria) and light-colored (acholic) stools. CBD stones should be suspected in any patient with cholecystitis whose serum bilirubin level is >85.5 \u03bcmol/L (5 mg/dL). The maximum bilirubin level is seldom >256.5 \u03bcmol/L (15.0 mg/dL) in patients with choledocholithiasis unless concomitant hepatic or renal disease or another factor leading to marked hyperbilirubinemia exists. Serum bilirubin levels \u2265342.0 \u03bcmol/L (20 mg/dL) should suggest the possibility of neoplastic obstruction. The serum alkaline phosphatase level is almost always elevated in biliary"

Nonspecific symptoms, such as chills, anorexia, weight loss, nausea, and vomiting, may also develop. Only 50% of patients with liver abscesses, however, have hepatomegaly, right-upper-quadrant tenderness, or jaundice; thus, one-half of patients have no symptoms or signs to direct attention to the liver. Fever of unknown origin may be the only manifestation of liver abscess, especially in the elderly. Diagnostic studies of the abdomen, especially the right upper quadrant, should be a part of any workup for fever of unknown origin.

Ultrasound is the best tool for diagnosing gallstones and gynecologic pathology. Bedside ultrasound (FAST and aortic views) can diagnose hemoperitoneum and AAA in unstable patients. Hemodynamically unstable patients must have emergent surgical management. In stable patients, expectant management may include NPO status, NG tube placement, IV \ufb02uids, placement of a Foley catheter (to monitor urine output and \ufb02uid status), and vital sign monitoring with serial abdominal exams and serial labs."
