His family history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus in his mother and cousin. His weight is 112 kg ( 246.9 lb), height 187 cm (6 ft 1 in), blood pressure: 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate: 89/min, respiratory rate: 14/min, and temperature: 36.7\u2103 (98.4\u2109). The physical examination is significant for dry skin, a pustular rash over the patient\u2019s shoulders and back, an accentuated second heart sound (S2) best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border, and distal loss of vibration sensitivity in both feet.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the cause of glucosuria in this patient, we need to analyze the provided urinalysis results and consider the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient presents with excessive thirst, frequent urination, and partial visual loss in both eyes, which are classic symptoms of diabetes mellitus. The urinalysis shows a pH of 6.6, which is slightly acidic, and the presence of glucose at 199 mg/dL, which is elevated. The absence of ketones and nitrites suggests that the patient is not experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis or a urinary tract infection. The presence of protein (120 mg/d) and 3 RBCs/hpf may indicate some degree of kidney damage or disease. However, the primary finding is the presence of glucose in the urine, which is a hallmark of glucosuria in diabetic patients. Glucosuria occurs when the kidneys are unable to reabsorb glucose from the filtrate back into the bloodstream, leading to its excretion in the urine. This can occur due to various reasons, including defects in the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in the proximal renal tubules. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely cause of glucosuria is a disruption of the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal renal tubules, which is consistent with option B. Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

            "content": "Urinalysis is a useful screen for renal abnormalities. In addition to urine color and turbidity, macroscopic urinalysis uses a urine dipstick for pH and the presence of protein, glucose, ketones, blood, and leukocytes. Dilute urine may result in a false-negative result for protein; false-positive results may occur with extremely alkaline or concentrated urine or if there is a delay in reading the test. Dipsticks are exquisitely sensitive to the presence of hemoglobin (or myoglobin); there are few false-negative test results but many false-positive results. Glucose is detected via a glucose oxidase-peroxidase reaction, and leukocytes are detected via a leukocyte esterase reaction. The nitrite test may detect bacteriuria if the bacteria reduce nitrate to nitrite and have long contact time with the urine. False-negative results occur with frequent voiding, low urine bacterial count, urinary tract obstruction, and infection with bacteria unable to generate nitrite. Gross hematuria or"

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

At the initial examination, blood pressure should be measured in both arms and preferably in the supine, sitting, and standing positions to evaluate for postural hypotension. Even if the femoral pulse is normal to palpation, arterial pressure should be measured at least once in the lower extremity in patients in whom hypertension is discovered before age 30. Heart rate also should be recorded. Hypertensive individuals have an increased prevalence of atrial fibrillation. The neck should be palpated for an enlarged thyroid gland, and patients should be assessed for signs of hypoand hyperthyroidism. Examination of blood vessels may provide clues about underlying vascular disease and should include funduscopic examination, auscultation for bruits over the carotid and femoral arteries, and palpation of femoral and pedal pulses. The retina is the only tissue in which arteries and arterioles can be examined directly. With increasing"
