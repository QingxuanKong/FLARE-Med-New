    "question": "In order to assess the feasibility and evaluate the outcomes of cerclage wiring as a supportive approach to osteosynthesis in femur fractures, a group of orthopedic surgeons studied 14 patients with primary and periprosthetic fractures of the thigh bone. Parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications were thoroughly recorded and analyzed in all the patients, with a mean duration of patient follow-up of 16 months. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in patients included in the study. The authors were satisfied with their findings and, due to the prospective nature of their research, submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study (which they noted in the study title as well). However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead. The editor made this suggestion to the authors for which of the following reasons?",

The editor's suggestion is based on the understanding that cohort studies typically involve a larger sample size and are designed to assess the incidence and prevalence of a disease or outcome in a population over time. In contrast, case series studies focus on a small number of cases and are often used to describe the experience with a particular treatment or intervention. The fact that the study had a mean duration of follow-up of 16 months and included only 14 patients suggests that it is more suitable for a case series study.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Patients often present late and may not be able to localize their pain. In severe cases, the ligaments of the wrist can rupture to the point of dislocation of the capitate off the lunate or even the lunate off the radius. Mayfield and colleagues classified the progression of this injury into four groups.15 In the most severe group, the lunate dislocates off the radius into the carpal tunnel.

Subtrochanteric hip frac-tures occur in the proximal femoral shaft just distal to the lesser trochanter in an area of high biomechanical stresses. While they can occur in older adult patients after a fall, they are also seen in high-energy trauma. Because of the forces of muscles attached to the fractured segments, they tend to be significantly displaced (Fig. 43-17) and may be difficult to reduce. They are most often treated with a long cephalomedullary nail that includes a screw distally to lock the nail in place and prevent rotation of the femur.

Screws can then be placed across the cortices of the bone through holes in the rod proximal and distal to the fracture to create a locked construct that further stabilizes the rod. When the fracture is locked proximally and distally, this is called static locking. In situations where patients are severely injured and cannot safely undergo more invasive open surgery, damage control orthope-dics is done by utilizing an external fixator. External fixators are also used when the soft tissues are too swollen or injured to allow for surgical incisions to be safely made.

If the fracture is too proximal or too distal, or if the fracture is comminuted and unstable, a submuscu-lar bridge plate is usually used; alternatively, an external fix-ator may also be used, especially in multiple trauma patients. If the patient is older than 11 years, an interlocking IM rod with a lateral trochanteric entry is used. Insertion of IM rod in younger children can cause avascular necrosis of the femoral head due to interruption of the blood supply. Refracture of the femur is a risk after using an external fixator. Overgrowth of the injured femur with leg length discrepancy can occur in children between 2 and 10 years of age.Figure 43-52.

Tables 158-1 and 158-2 show appropriate therapeutic choices for the most frequently identified microorganisms causing sternal osteomyelitis in the absence and presence, respectively, of an implanted device. In a recent observational study of patients with staphylococcal deep sternal wound infection, the use of a rifampin-containing regimen was predictive of success. The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy has not been established. In acute sternal osteomyelitis without hardware, a 6-week course is the rule. In patients with remaining sternal wires, treatment duration is generally prolonged to 3 months (Table 158-2).

The outcome of surgery depends on the com-minution of the fracture and degree of articular involvement. The more fragments seen on a CT scan, the worse the outcome for the patient. Wound complications are a problem for calca-neal fractures with the risk being even higher in diabetics, smok-ers, and in open fractures. Open calcaneal fractures have a high rate of amputation.Talus FracturesFractures of the talus commonly result from forced dorsiflexion of the ankle, causing the talar neck to impact on the anterior distal tibia. The dominant blood supply is the artery of the tarsal canal. The blood supply to the talus can be jeopardized after a displaced fracture and may lead to osteonecrosis (Fig. 43-22), which is an unfortunately common complication following talus fractures. The incidence of osteonecrosis depends on the degree"

Risks shared by hip and knee arthroplasties include infection, intraoperative or postop-erative fracture, vascular injury, need for intraoperative or post-operative blood transfusion, nerve injury or nerve palsy (most commonly involving the deep peroneal nerve and loss of ankle dorsiflexion), stress shielding, component fracture or wear, and medical complications, including venous thromboembolic dis-ease (DVT and PE), myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accident.

Estimates suggest only about 20% of fracture patients receive follow-up care. Patients who sustain acute fractures are at dramatically elevated risk for more fractures, particularly within the first several years, and pharmacologic intervention can reduce that risk substantially. Recently, several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of a relatively simple and inexpensive program that reduces the risk of subsequent fractures. In the Kaiser system, it is estimated that a 20% decline in hip fracture occurrence was seen with the introduction of what is called a fracture liaison service. This typically involves a health care professional (usually a nurse) whose job is to coordinate follow-up care and education of fracture patients. If the Kaiser experience can be repeated, there would be significant savings of health care dollars, as well as a"

In the aging population, perhaps due to osteo-porosis, less force is required to cause a fracture. In fact, in one study, 50% of patients >65 years old sustained rib fractures from a fall of <6 ft, compared with only 1% of patients <65 years of age. Concurrent pulmonary contusion is noted in up to 35% of patients, and pneumonia complicates the injuries in 10% to 30% of patients with rib fractures, not surprisingly leading to longer ICU stays.153,154 Additionally, mortality increases linearly with the number of rib fractures. Patients who sustain more than six rib fractures have pulmonary morbidity rates of >50% and over-all mortality rates of >20%.Chronologic age is not the best predictor of outcome, but the presence of preexisting conditions, which affect a patient\u2019s physiologic age, is associated with increased mortality rates.
