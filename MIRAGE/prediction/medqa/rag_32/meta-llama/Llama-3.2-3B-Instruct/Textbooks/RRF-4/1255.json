    "question": "A 50-year-old woman with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) presents to your clinic with complaints of left eye pain and reduced vision. She notes that she was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to presentation when she noticed some mild tenderness around her left eye, unrelieved by any pain relievers. This morning when she woke up she was unable to see out of her left eye and made an appointment to come see you. Other than SLE, her medical history is unremarkable. She has had no additional symptoms other than pain and vision loss. Her vital signs are all within normal limits. On exam, she has no vision in her left eye, but 20/30 visual acuity in her right eye. When you shine a light in her left eye there is no response. What response would you expect when you shine a light in her right eye?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to understand the relationship between the patient's condition and the pupillary response. The patient has Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and presents with left eye pain and reduced vision. The key to this question is the pupillary response when shining a light in her left eye, which is unresponsive. This suggests an afferent pupillary defect, which is a common finding in optic neuritis, a condition often associated with SLE. In cases of optic neuritis, the affected eye may not respond to light due to the inflammation and damage to the optic nerve. The normal eye, in this case the right eye, should still respond to light, resulting in miosis (pupillary constriction). Therefore, the correct answer is B. Miosis of the right eye only.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes.

Often in our experience, there is no headache but if one is present, it is of the typical migraine type, not ocular pain. In some cases of uniocular visual disturbance with scotoma, fortuitous examination during an attack may reveal attenuation of the retinal arterioles as noted by Berger and colleagues. Most often, there are no funduscopic changes. Either the retinal or the ciliary circulation is probably involved.

Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision?

With dim background lighting, the pupils are equal and relatively large. B. Shining a flashlight into the right eye evokes equal, strong constriction of both pupils. C. Swinging the flashlight over to the damaged left eye causes dilation of both pupils, although they remain smaller than in A. Swinging the flashlight back over to the healthy right eye would result in symmetric constriction back to the appearance shown in B. Note that the pupils always remain equal; the damage to the left retina/optic nerve is revealed by weaker bilateral pupil constriction to a flashlight in the left eye compared with the right eye.

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

Focused History: Ten days ago, CR had her spleen removed following a bicycle accident in which she fractured her tibial eminence, necessitating immobilization of the right knee. She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."

These complaints are new since she used to always feel \u201chot,\u201d noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to \u201cprotect her bones\u201d and omeprazole for \u201cheartburn.\u201d On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm.
