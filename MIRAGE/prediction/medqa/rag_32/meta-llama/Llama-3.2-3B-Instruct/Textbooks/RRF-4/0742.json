She also has mitral stenosis, for which she has been advised to undergo a balloon valvotomy. Her temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.7\u00b0F), blood pressure is 120/60 mm Hg, and pulse is 90/minute. Her random blood glucose is 220 mg/dL and HbA1C is 8.5%. She wants to discuss possible complications concerning her pregnancy.

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and answer: The patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus and mitral stenosis. Mitral stenosis is a heart valve problem where the mitral valve is narrowed, restricting blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. In pregnancy, this can lead to complications such as mitral regurgitation, which can increase the risk of cardiac problems in the fetus. The correct answer is D. Mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve prolapse is a condition where the two valve flaps of the mitral valve do not close properly, allowing blood to flow back into the left atrium. This condition can be exacerbated by the increased blood volume and pressure during pregnancy, making it a concern for women with pre-existing mitral stenosis. Here is the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus and mitral stenosis, which can increase the risk of cardiac complications in the fetus.

In addition to dietary changes, this enhanced management requires more frequent blood glucose monitoring and often involves additional injections of insulin or conversion to an insulin pump. Fasting blood glucose levels should be maintained at <5.8 mmol/L (<105 mg/dL), with avoidance of values >7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL). Commencing in the third trimester, regular surveillance of maternal glucose control as well as assessment of fetal growth (obstetric sonography) and fetoplacental oxygenation (fetal heart rate monitoring or biophysical profile) optimize pregnancy outcome. Pregnant diabetic patients without vascular disease are at greater risk for delivering a macrosomic fetus, and attention to fetal growth via clinical and ultrasound examination is important.

Women without overt hypertension, but in whom eary developing preeclampsia is suspected during routine prenatal visits, are seen more frequenty. For many years at Parkland Hospital, women with new-onset diastolic blood pressures >80 mm Hg but <90 mm Hg or with sudden abnormal weight gain of more than 2 pounds per week have, at minimum, returned for visits at 7 -day intervals. Outpatient surveillance is continued unless overt hypertension, proteinuria, headache, visual disturbances, or epigastric pain supervenes. Women with overt new-onset hypertension-either diastolic pressures \ufffd90 mm Hg or systolic pressures \ufffd 140 mm Hg-are admitted to determine if the increase is due to preeclampsia, and if so, to evaluate its severity. With hospitalization, a systematic evaluation is instituted to include:"

These begin to rise in patient B, who by term has substantively higher blood pressures. However, her pressures are still < 140/90 mm Hg, and thus she is considered to be \"normotensive.\" We use the term delta hypertension to describe this rather acute rise in blood pressure. Some of these women will go on to have obvious preeclampsia, and some even develop eclamptic seizures or HELLP (hemolysis, devatedliver enzyme levels, low 2latelet count) syndrome while still normotensive."

Diagnosis: MW is in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) that was precipitated by a UTI. [Note: Diabetes increases the risk for infections such as UTI.] Immediate Treatment: MW was rehydrated with normal saline given intravenously (IV). She also was given insulin IV. Blood glucose, ketone bodies, and electrolytes were measured periodically. Antibiotic treatment of her UTI was started. Long-Term Treatment: Diabetes increases the risk for macrovascular complications (such as coronary artery disease and stroke) and microvascular complications (such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy). Ongoing monitoring for these complications will be continued."
