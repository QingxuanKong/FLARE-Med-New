    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question is asking about the potential long-term effect of combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs) on the patient's risk of developing certain conditions. The patient has severe acne vulgaris and has been treated with oral antibiotics and topical combination therapy, but the symptoms persist. The doctor decides to start long-term therapy with combined oral contraceptive pills. We need to analyze the potential benefits and risks of COCs in relation to the given options.\\n\\nFirst, let's consider the relationship between COCs and each option:\\n\\nA. Hypertension: COCs are known to have a complex relationship with blood pressure. Some studies suggest that COCs may increase blood pressure in some women, especially those who are overweight or have a family history of hypertension. However, this effect is generally mild and temporary. Therefore, it is not a significant concern for most women taking COCs.\\n\\nB. Ovarian cancer: The use of COCs has been shown to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer significantly. This protective effect is thought to be due to the suppression of androgen production and the inhibition of follicular growth in the ovaries.\\n\\nC. Cervical cancer: There is limited evidence to suggest that COCs have a significant impact on the risk of cervical cancer. In fact, some studies have suggested that COCs may increase the risk of cervical cancer, although this effect is still being studied and debated.\\n\\nD. Breast cancer: The relationship between COCs and breast cancer risk is complex and depends on several factors, including the type of COC, duration of use, and individual factors such as family history and age. Some studies suggest that COCs may slightly increase the risk of breast cancer, but this effect is generally seen in women who use COCs for extended periods or at a young age.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the most likely condition that COCs would decrease the patient's risk of developing is ovarian cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

Minimal to moderate pauci-inflammatory disease may respond adequately to local therapy alone. Although areas affected with acne should be kept clean, overly vigorous scrubbing may aggravate acne due to mechanical rupture of comedones. Topical agents such as retinoic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or salicylic acid may alter the pattern of epidermal desquamation, preventing the formation of comedones and aiding in the resolution of preexisting cysts. Topical antibacterial agents (such as azelaic acid, erythromycin, clindamycin, or dapsone) are also useful adjuncts to therapy."

Acne may begin as early as 8 years of age and may continue into adulthood. Acne primarily affects areas with increased sebaceous glanddensity, such as the face, upper chest, and back. Superficialplugging of the pilosebaceous unit results in noninflammatorysmall (1to 2-mm) open (blackhead) and closed (whitehead) comedones. An open comedo is less likely to become inflammatory than a closed comedo. Rupture of a comedo into adjacent dermis and proliferation of P. acnes induce an inflammatory response and development of inflammatory papules and pustules. Larger, skin-colored or red cysts and nodulesrepresent deeper plugging and cystic acne. Increased and persistent inflammation, especially with rupture of a deep cyst,increases the risk of scarring."

The primary event in all acne lesions is the development of the micro-comedo, which results from the obstruction of the hair follicle with keratin, increased sebum production from sebaceous glands, and overgrowth of normal skin flora, leading to pilosebaceous occlusion and enlargement. Androgens are a potent stimulus of the sebaceous gland. The subsequent inflammatory component and pustule formation results from proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes, a commensal organism of the skin. The pathogenesis of acne thus involves three components: increased sebum production, hyperkeratosis, and bacterial proliferation. Effective treatment focuses on minimizing these factors."

Laboratory blood tests indicate elevated d-dimer levels. What therapy is indicated acutely? What are the long-term therapy options? How long should she be treated? Should this indi-vidual use oral contraceptives? A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency depart-ment complaining of acute onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic pain. She had been in her usual state of health until 2 days prior when she noted that her left leg was swollen and red. Her only medication was oral contraceptives. Family history was significant for a history of \u201cblood clots\u201d in mul-tiple members of the maternal side of her family. Physical examination demonstrates an anxious woman with stable vital signs. The left"

            "content": "The diagnosis of acne is usually not difficult because of the characteristic and chronic lesions. Laboratory studies and imaging studies are usually not necessary to diagnose acne. Screening tests may be necessary if there are signs of hyperandrogenism due to polycystic ovarian syndrome (irregular menses, hirsutism, insulin resistance) or an underlying androgen-secreting tumor (irregular menses, hirsutism, deepening voice, clitoromegaly). The mainstays of treatment of acne are topical keratolytic agents and topical antibiotics. Creams, lotions, gels, foams, and solutions are available. Gels and solutions are commonly used because acne skin is generally greasier and these agents tend to be drying, but they have the tendency to be irritating and may not be as well tolerated. Creams and lotions are better tolerated but may not be as effective."

            "content": "Philip J. Rosenthal, MD A 5-year-old American girl presents with a 1-week history of intermittent chills, fever, and sweats. She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"
