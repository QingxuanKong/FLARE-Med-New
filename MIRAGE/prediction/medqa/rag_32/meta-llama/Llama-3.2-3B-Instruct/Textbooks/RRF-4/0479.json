    "question": "A 63-year-old patient presents to the emergency department because of severe left leg pain and tingling. His condition started suddenly 30 minutes ago. He has had hypertension for the past 10 years for which he takes bisoprolol. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.7\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, and the pulse is 100/min and irregular. On physical examination, the patient appears in severe pain and his left leg is pale and cool. The popliteal pulse is weaker on the left side compared to the right side. Which of the following is the most common cause of this patient's condition?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and medical history. Step 1: The patient presents with severe left leg pain and tingling, which started suddenly 30 minutes ago. This suggests an acute event. Step 2: The patient has a history of hypertension for the past 10 years, but does not smoke or drink alcohol. Step 3: The patient's physical examination reveals severe pain, a pale and cool left leg, and a weaker popliteal pulse on the left side compared to the right side. Step 4: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with acute limb ischemia, which is a medical emergency. Step 5: Considering the patient's age, medical history, and symptoms, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is arterial emboli. This is because the patient has a history of hypertension, which increases the risk of atherosclerosis, and the sudden onset of symptoms is consistent with an embolic event. Here is the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with acute limb ischemia. The most likely cause of this patient's condition is arterial emboli, given the patient's history of hypertension and the sudden onset of symptoms.

The development of cold-induced pallor in these disorders may be confined to one or two digits of the involved extremity.

At the time of surgery, the initial dissection mobilized the kidney on its vascular pedicle; however, a large portion of tumor became detached in the inferior vena cava. The tumor embolus passed through the right atrium and right ventricle and occluded the pulmonary artery. This could not be cleared at the time of surgery, and the patient succumbed. A 65-year-old businessman came to the emergency department with severe lower abdominal pain that was predominantly central and left sided. He had pain radiating into the left loin, and he also noticed he was passing gas and fecal debris as he urinated. A CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis was performed (eFig. 4.191)."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

            "content": "The physical examination is often normal in patients with stable angina when they are asymptomatic. However, because of the increased likelihood of IHD in patients with diabetes and/or peripheral arterial disease, clinicians should search for evidence of atherosclerotic disease at other sites, such as an abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid arterial bruits, and diminished arterial pulses in the lower extremities. The physical examination also should include a search for evidence of risk factors for atherosclerosis such as xanthelasmas and xanthomas (Chap. 291e). Evidence for peripheral arterial disease should be sought by evaluating the pulse contour at multiple locations and comparing the blood pressure between the arms and between the arms and the legs (ankle-brachial index). Examination of the fundi may reveal an increased light reflex and arteriovenous nicking as evidence of hypertension. There also may be signs of anemia, thyroid disease, and nicotine stains on the fingertips from"

He gives a typical history relating to lack of blood flow to the muscles. A similar finding is present when muscular branches of the femoral artery are occluded or stenosed. Such patients develop similar (ischemic) pain in the calf muscles called intermittent claudication. How does the blood get to the gluteal muscles? Blood arrives at the aortic bifurcation and then passes into the common iliac arteries, which divide into the internal and external iliac vessels. The internal iliac artery then divides into anterior and posterior divisions, which in turn give rise to vessels that leave the pelvis by passing through the greater sciatic foramen and supply the gluteal muscles. The internal pudendal artery also arises from the anterior division of the internal iliac artery and supplies the penis."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

            "content": "Clinical Evaluation Fewer than 50% of patients with PAD are symp-1643 tomatic, although many have a slow or impaired gait. The most common symptom is intermittent claudication, which is defined as a pain, ache, cramp, numbness, or a sense of fatigue in the muscles; it occurs during exercise and is relieved by rest. The site of claudication is distal to the location of the occlusive lesion. For example, buttock, hip, thigh, and calf discomfort occurs in patients with aortoiliac disease, whereas calf claudication develops in patients with femoral-popliteal disease. Symptoms are far more common in the lower than in the upper extremities because of the higher incidence of obstructive lesions in the former region. In patients with severe arterial occlusive disease in whom resting blood flow cannot accommodate basal nutritional needs of the tissues, critical limb ischemia may develop. Patients complain of rest pain or a feeling of cold or numbness in the foot and toes. Frequently, these"

Interestingly, the height of the patient and the previous lens surgery would suggest a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and a series of blood tests and review of the family history revealed this was so. A 35-year-old male patient presented to his family practitioner because of recent weight loss (14 lb over the previous 2 months). He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets."
