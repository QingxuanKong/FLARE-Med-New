Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae. Laboratory studies show decreased serum hemoglobin levels and increased serum gastrin levels. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy shows inflammation of the gastric body and fundus. A photomicrograph of a biopsy specimen taken from the gastric antrum is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results and correlate them with the potential causes listed in the options. The patient presents with progressive fatigue, lethargy, and epigastric pain after eating, which are classic symptoms of hypothyroidism. However, the patient also has increased serum gastrin levels, which is a key finding in this case. Elevated gastrin levels can be caused by several factors, including gastrinomas, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and hypergastrinemia due to other conditions such as H. pylori infection or retained gastric antrum. The esophagogastroduodenoscopy shows inflammation of the gastric body and fundus, which is consistent with gastritis. The photomicrograph of the biopsy specimen from the gastric antrum is not described in the question, but based on the options provided, we can infer that it is likely showing a specific type of cell proliferation. Mucosal cell hyperplasia and enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia are both possible causes of gastritis, but they are not directly related to the elevated gastrin levels. Parietal cell destruction and chief cell destruction are more likely to cause hypochlorhydria and are not directly related to the symptoms or laboratory results in this case. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is related to the increased gastrin levels, which is consistent with gastrinoma or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. However, since gastrinoma is not listed as an option, we can rule out that as the correct answer. The correct answer is B. Enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia, which is a type of G-cell hyperplasia that can cause hypergastrinemia and gastritis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Gastric biopsy usually shows atrophy of all layers of the body and fundus, with loss of glandular elements, an absence of parietal and chief cells and replacement by mucous cells, a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate, and perhaps intestinal metaplasia. The infiltrate of plasma cells and lymphocytes contains an excess of CD4 cells. These are directed against gastric H/K-ATPase. The antral mucosa is usually well preserved. Helicobacter pylori infection occurs infrequently in PA, but it has been suggested that H. pylori gastritis occurs at an early phase of atrophic gastritis and presents in younger patients as iron-deficiency anemia but in older patients as PA. H. pylori is suggested to stimulate an autoimmune process directed against parietal cells, with the H. pylori infection then being gradually replaced, in some individuals, by an autoimmune process."

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

ZES should have been excluded preoperatively. Surreptitious use of NSAIDs is an important reason for recurrent ulcers after surgery, especially if the initial procedure was done for an NSAID-induced ulcer. Once H. pylori and NSAIDs have been excluded as etiologic factors, the question of incomplete vagotomy or retained gastric antrum should be explored. For the latter, fasting plasma gastrin levels should be determined. If elevated, retained antrum or ZES (see below) should be considered. Incomplete vagotomy can be ruled out by gastric acid analysis coupled with sham feeding. In this test, gastric acid output is measured while the patient sees, smells, and chews a meal (without swallowing). The cephalic phase of gastric secretion, which is mediated by the vagus, is being assessed with this study. An increase in"

A nondiagnostic biopsy may lead to a surgically obtained full-thickness biopsy to exclude malignancy. Although MD is considered premalignant by some, the risk of neoplastic progression is not defined. Complete blood count, serum gastrin, serum albumin, CMV and H. pylori serology, and pH testing of gastric aspirate during endoscopy should be included as part of the initial evaluation of patients with large gastric folds."

Because IgA deficiency iscommon in celiac disease, total serum IgA also must be measured to document the accuracy of these tests. In the absence ofIgA deficiency, either test yields a sensitivity and specificity of95%. An endoscopic small bowel biopsy is essential to confirm the diagnosis and should be performed while the patient is stilltaking gluten. The biopsy specimen shows various degrees ofvillous atrophy (short or absent villi), mucosal inflammation,crypt hyperplasia, and increased numbers of intraepitheliallymphocytes. When there is any question about response totreatment, a repeat biopsy specimen may be obtained severalmonths later. Other laboratory studies should be performed torule out complications, including complete blood count, calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, iron, total protein and albumin,and liver function tests.

A careful assessment is of particular importance in patients with atrophic gastritis or pernicious anemia. Unusual clinical features associated with gastric adenocarcinomas include migratory thrombophlebitis, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, diffuse seborrheic keratoses (so-called Leser-Tr\u00e9lat sign), and acanthosis nigricans. Diagnosis The use of double-contrast radiographic examinations has been supplanted by esophagogastroscopy and CT scanning for the evaluation of patients with epigastric complaints."

Bacteria such as H. pylori may also contribute to this effect by causing chronic inflammatory atrophic gastritis, loss of gastric acidity, and bacterial growth in the stomach. Although the risk for developing gastric cancer is thought to be sixfold higher in people infected with H. pylori, it remains uncertain whether eradicating the bacteria after infection has already occurred actually reduces this risk. Loss of acidity may occur when acid-producing cells of the gastric antrum have been removed surgically to control benign peptic ulcer disease or when achlorhydria, atrophic gastritis, and even pernicious anemia develop in the elderly. Serial endoscopic examinations of the stomach in patients with atrophic gastritis have documented replacement of the usual gastric mucosa by intestinal-type cells. This process of intestinal metaplasia may lead to cellular atypia and eventual neoplasia. Because the"

The DNA damage is thought to be due principally to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species arising from inflammatory cells, perhaps in relation to other bacteria that survive in a hypochlorhydric stomach. Longitudinal analyses of gastric biopsy specimens taken years apart from the same patient show that the common intestinal type of gastric adenocarcinoma follows stepwise changes from simple gastritis to gastric atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia. A second, diffuse type of gastric adenocarcinoma found more commonly in younger adults may arise directly from chronic gastritis without atrophic changes."

After admission a bronchoscopy was carried out and sputum was aspirated from the left upper lobe bronchus. This was cultured in the laboratory and also viewed under the microscope and tuberculous bacilli (TB) were identified. A 68-year-old man came to his family physician complaining of discomfort when swallowing (dysphagia). The physician examined the patient and noted since his last visit he had lost approximately 18 lb over 6 months. Routine blood tests revealed the patient was anemic and he was referred to the gastroenterology unit. A diagnosis of esophageal cancer was made and the patient underwent a resection, which involved a chest and abdominal incision. After 4 years the patient remains well though still subject to follow-up."
