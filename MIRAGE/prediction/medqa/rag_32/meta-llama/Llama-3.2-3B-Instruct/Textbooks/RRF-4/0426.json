He returned from a research trip to Madagascar 2 weeks ago and has since developed a worsening fever with a maximum temperature of 102.2\u00b0F (39\u00b0C). He also reports some swelling around his neck and groin. He works as a zoologist and was in rural Madagascar studying a rare species of lemur. His past medical history is notable for hypertension and gout. He takes lisinopril and allopurinol. His temperature is 101.9\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 145/85 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 22/min.

The patient's recent travel to Madagascar and work as a zoologist studying a rare species of lemur increases the suspicion of a zoonotic infection. The black hemorrhagic eschars are particularly suggestive of anthrax, which is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. The virulence factor responsible for anthrax is a toxin that inhibits ribosomal function, leading to cell death. This toxin is a key virulence factor that enables the bacteria to cause disease. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Inhibit ribosomal function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

            "content": "Vital Signs Given that elevations in temperature are often a hallmark of infection, paying close attention to the temperature may be of value in diagnosing an infectious disease. The idea that 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F) is the normal human body temperature dates back to the nineteenth century and was initially based on axillary measurements. Rectal temperatures more accurately reflect the core body temperature and are 0.4\u00b0C (0.7\u00b0F) and 0.8\u00b0C (1.4\u00b0F) higher than oral and axillary temperatures, respectively. Although the definition of fever varies greatly throughout the medical literature, the most common definition, which is based on studies defining fever of unknown origin (Chap. 26), uses a temperature \u226538.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F). Although fever is very commonly associated with infection, it is also documented in many other diseases (Chap. 23). For every 1\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) increase in core temperature, the heart rate typically rises by 15\u201320 beats/min. Table 144-1 lists infections that are associated with relative"

            "content": "Philip J. Rosenthal, MD A 5-year-old American girl presents with a 1-week history of intermittent chills, fever, and sweats. She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

            "content": "Skin The fact that many infections have cutaneous manifestations gives the skin examination particular importance in the evaluation of patients (Chaps. 24, 25e, 72, and 156). It is important to perform a complete skin exam, with attention to both front and back. Specific rashes are often extremely helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis of an infection (Chaps. 24 and 25e). In numerous anecdotal instances, patients in the intensive care unit have had \u201cfever of unknown origin\u201d that was actually due to unrecognized pressure ulcers. Moreover, close examination of the distal extremities for splinter hemorrhages, Janeway lesions, or Osler\u2019s nodes may yield evidence of endocarditis or other causes of septic emboli."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension.
