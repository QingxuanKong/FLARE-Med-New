    "question": "A 59-year-old man complains of chest pain that has been present for 4 hours on the 5th day of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction. 5 days ago, he had a burning sensation in his chest and discomfort in his left shoulder. Upon initial presentation to the hospital\u2019s emergency department, he was diagnosed with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction and treated with alteplase. He has been under close observation since then. The patient now describes discomfort in his chest and left shoulder, somewhat similar in nature to what initially brought him into the hospital. A pulse of 86/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and a blood pressure of 146/90 mm Hg are observed. Auscultation of the chest reveals no abnormal findings. The patient\u2019s ECG is difficult to interpret. Of the following laboratory tests, an abnormal result of which would have the most diagnostic utility?",

The patient's symptoms are somewhat similar to the initial presentation, and the ECG is difficult to interpret. The patient's laboratory tests should be evaluated to determine the cause of the new symptoms and to rule out complications of the initial STEMI. The patient's symptoms and history suggest the possibility of a complication such as reinfarction, recurrent ischemia, or a new cardiac injury. Among the options, troponin T is the most sensitive and specific marker for myocardial injury, making it the most useful test to evaluate the patient's condition. Troponin T levels can help diagnose reinfarction, recurrent ischemia, or new cardiac injury, which could be the cause of the patient's new symptoms. The other options, alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase (CK-MB), and lactate dehydrogenase, are not as specific for myocardial injury and may not provide the same level of diagnostic utility in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

However, the characteristics of the pain are pivotal in formulating an initial clinical impression and assessing the likelihood of a serious cardiopulmonary process (Table 19-1), including acs in particular (Fig. 19-2). Pressure or tightness is consistent with a typical presentation of myocardial ischemic pain. Nevertheless, the clinician must remember that some patients with ischemic chest symptoms deny any \u201cpain\u201d but rather complain of dyspnea or a vague sense of anxiety. The severity of the discomfort has poor diagnostic accuracy. It is often helpful to ask about the similarity of the discomfort to previous definite ischemic symptoms.

Unstable angina describes chest pain that is new onset, is accelerating (i.e., occurs with less exertion, lasts longer, or is less responsive to medications), or occurs at rest; it is distinguished from stable angina by patient history. It signals the presence of possible impending infarction based upon plaque instability. In contrast, NSTEMI indicates myocardial necrosis marked by elevations in troponin I, troponin T, or CK-MB. Patients should be risk stratified according to the TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction study) criteria to determine the likelihood of adverse cardiac events (see Table 2.1-10). Unstable angina is not associated with elevated cardiac markers, but ST changes may be seen on ECG and are indicative of high-risk occlusions. NSTEMI is diagnosed by serial cardiac enzymes and ECG."

The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?"

Some of the most important factors include persistent ischemia (spontaneous or provoked), depressed LV ejection fraction (<40%), rales above the lung bases on physical examination or congestion on chest radiograph, and symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias. Other features associated with increased risk include a history of previous MI, age >75, diabetes mellitus, prolonged sinus tachycardia, hypotension, ST-segment changes at rest without angina (\u201csilent ischemia\u201d), an abnormal signal-averaged ECG, nonpatency of the infarct-related coronary artery (if angiography is undertaken), and persistent advanced heart block or a new intraventricular conduction abnormality on the ECG. Therapy must be individualized on the basis of the relative importance of the risk(s) present."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

The depth of the ST-segment depression and the time needed for recovery of these ECG changes are also important.

Normal ECGs and serum marker levels in patients with acute chest pain should raise suspicion about the possibility of aortic dissection. It is important to remember that ECG changes and elevated serum marker levels associated with myocardial infarction do not exclude the diagnosis of aortic dissection because dissection can cause coronary malperfusion. Of note, abnormal ECGs have recently been shown to delay the diagnosis of aortic dissection, and the possibility of aortic dissection should not be prema-turely ruled out.172,178 Similarly, although CXRs may show a widened mediastinum or abnormal aortic contour, up to 16% of patients with dissection have a normal-appearing CXR.174 The value of the CXR for detecting aortic dissection is limited, with a sensitivity of 67% and a"
