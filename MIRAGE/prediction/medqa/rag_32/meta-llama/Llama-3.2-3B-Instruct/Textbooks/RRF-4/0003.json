The patient presents with fevers, chills, left lower quadrant pain, mucopurulent discharge from the cervical os, and left adnexal tenderness. The laboratory studies show a low platelet count, low fibrinogen, and elevated D-dimer. The key finding is the result of the phenol test, which identifies a phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with 6 fatty acids attached to a polysaccharide side chain. This is a characteristic finding for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a gram-negative coccobacillus. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with gonococcal pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Now, let's evaluate the answer choices in the context of the given information. Choice A refers to Staphylococcus aureus, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation. Choice C refers to Bacillus anthracis, which is not relevant to the patient's symptoms. Choice D refers to Escherichia coli, which is a gram-negative rod but does not match the patient's presentation. Choice B, encapsulated, gram-negative coccobacilli forming grey-colored colonies on charcoal blood agar, is consistent with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Therefore, the blood culture is most likely to show this organism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The sedimentation rate is nonspecific, but often is the only abnormal laboratory finding in women with subacute PID. If the pregnancy test is positive, a quantitative \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2hCG) should be ordered. Other studies that are recommended include transvaginal pelvic ultrasound, or if imaging is not available, culdocentesis. The \ufb02uid from culdocentesis can be sent for hematocrit if bloody \ufb02uid is obtained or Gram stain with culture if the \ufb02uid is purulent.

Laboratory studies helpful in identifying community-acquired pneumonia are sputum Gram stain, sputum culture, and two sets of blood culture. An \u201cadequate sputum\u201d sample (defined as more than 25 neutrophils with less than 10 epithelial cells per low-powered field on microscopic examination) may be difficult to obtain. Respiratory therapists are an excellent resource for inducing sputum. Hospitalized patients undergo assessment of blood\u2013gas exchange by either oximetry or arterial blood\u2013gas analysis. Diagnosis of Legionella pneumoniae requires a different laboratory technique: measuring urinary antigen levels. Mycoplasma pneumoniae should be suspected when cold agglutinin findings are positive in the presence of the appropriate clinical symptoms."

Pregnancy test is usually negative because PID as co-existent intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) is rare. If the pregnancy test is positive, an infected or very in\ufb02amed ectopic pregnancy, or instrumented IUP or infected, incomplete abortion should be suspected. Appendicitis and diverticulitis can be mistaken for PID. Laparoscopy can be useful if the diagnosis is uncertain. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for diagnosing PID state that PID should be suspected and treatment started if the patient is at risk for PID and she has uterine, cervical, or adnexal motion tenderness without any apparent cause (19a).

In the acute phase, inflammatory parameters are elevated, including white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and the ESR, which can be profoundlyelevated (often >80 mm/hr). Platelet counts may be inappropriately low or normal. A lumbar puncture, if performed toexclude infection, may reveal pleocytosis. Tests of hepatobiliary function may be abnormal. Greatly elevated platelet countsdevelop during the subacute phase. The development of coronary artery aneurysms is monitored by performing two-dimensional echocardiograms, usually during the acute phase, at 2 to3 weeks, and again at 6 to 8 weeks. More frequent echocardiograms and, potentially, coronary angiography are indicated forpatients who develop coronary artery abnormalities."
