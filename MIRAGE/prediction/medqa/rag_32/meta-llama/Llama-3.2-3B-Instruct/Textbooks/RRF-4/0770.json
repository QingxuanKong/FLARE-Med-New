They range in age from 7 to 11, and most of them had no abnormal activities prior to developing the paralysis. These patients concern her because she has not seen this type of paralytic illness in over 20 years of practice. Based on this experience, she decides to write up the initial presentation and clinical course of these patients and publish them in a journal. Which of the following is most likely true about this study?",

This type of study is considered a case series, which is a descriptive study that reports a series of cases with similar characteristics. Since the pediatrician is publishing the initial presentation and clinical course of these patients, this study is likely to be a case series rather than an experiment or a randomized controlled trial. Case series studies are often used to describe the characteristics of a group of patients with a specific condition or disease and can provide valuable information about the natural history of the disease. In this case, the pediatrician is not testing any interventions or comparing them to a control group, so hypothesis testing is not applicable. The study is not comparing different interventions, so option A is not correct. The study is not comparing groups, so option D is not correct. Since the study is a descriptive study, it is not necessary to report the results in terms of odds ratio, so option C is not correct. The study is simply describing the characteristics of the patients, so it is not a test of a hypothesis. The study is likely to be a case series, and the pediatrician is simply reporting the initial presentation and clinical course of the patients, so the study does not involve hypothesis testing or comparison of interventions. The study does not meet the criteria for a randomized controlled trial, so the pediatrician can publish the study as a case series.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

In each case, the illness began with fever and aseptic meningitis (50 to 150 lymphocytes/mm3 in the CSF), followed by backache and widespread, relatively symmetrical paralysis, including the oropharyngeal muscles in two cases and asymmetrical weakness limited to the arms in two patients. There were no sensory changes. One patient had a mild concurrent encephalitic illness and died months later. The evolving electromyographic changes indicated that the paralysis was caused by a loss of anterior horn cells rather than by a motor neuropathy or a purely motor radiculopathy, but this distinction was not always certain. MRI was remarkable in showing distinct changes in the gray matter of the cord, mainly ventrally (Fig. 32-3). No virus could be isolated from the CSF and serologic"

Muscle weakness may develop rapidly, attaining its maximum severity in 48 h or even less; or it may develop more slowly or in stuttering fashion over a week, rarely even longer. As a general rule, there is no progression of weakness after the temperature has been normal for 48 h. The distribution of spinal paralysis is quite variable; rarely there may be an acute symmetrical paralysis of the muscles of the trunk and limbs as occurs in the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Excessive physical activity and local injections during the period of asymptomatic infection were thought to favor the development of paralysis of the exercised or injected limbs."

In some cases the disease appears to be biphasic, with aseptic meningitis followed first by apparent recovery but then (1\u20132 days later) by the return of fever and the development of paralysis; this form is more common among children than among adults. Weakness is generally asymmetric, is proximal more than distal, and may involve the legs (most commonly); the arms; or the abdominal, thoracic, or bulbar muscles. Paralysis develops during the febrile phase of the illness and usually does not progress after defervescence. Urinary retention may also occur.

These figures are exclusive of patients in whom seizures transiently complicate febrile and other illnesses or injuries. It has also been estimated that slightly less than 1 percent of persons in the United States will have epilepsy by the age of 20 years (Hauser and Annegers). Over two-thirds of all epileptic seizures begin in childhood (most in the first year of life), and this is the period when seizures assume the widest array of forms. In the practice of pediatric neurology, epilepsy is one of the most common disorders, and the chronicity of childhood forms adds to their importance. The incidence increases again after age 60 years.

When the patient\u2019s cooperation is not possible, as for example in a comatose or confused individual or in a young child, an attempt should be made to acquire the necessary information from other sources. The following points about taking the neurologic history deserve further comment: 1."

Neither the patient nor the family physician had any concerns about the pregnancy. However, the patient did complain of unilateral swelling of her left leg, which had gradually increased over the previous 2 days. Furthermore, the evening before her visit she developed some sharp chest pain, which was exacerbated by deep breaths. The family physician ordered a duplex ultrasound scan of the left leg venous system. Ultrasound scanning of the vascular tree can demonstrate flow and occlusion of arteries and veins."

The examining physician discovers postural hypotension and moderate vitiligo (depigmented areas of skin) and obtains routine blood tests. She finds hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis and suspects Addison\u2019s disease. She performs a standard ACTH 1\u201324 stimulation test, which reveals an insufficient plasma cortisol response compatible with primary adrenal insuf-ficiency. The diagnosis of autoimmune Addison\u2019s disease is made, and the patient must start replacement of the hormones he cannot produce himself. How should this patient be treated? What precautions should he take?"

            "content": "Having oriented the above discussion to imply that many cases of chronic fatigue have a psychologic, or asthenic basis, it should be emphasized that previously healthy individuals, may have persistent fatigue for years after a severe febrile viral infection. Most of these cases, in our experience, have arisen suddenly, mostly in adolescents and young men, and less often women, who experience overwhelming fatigue during a well-documented and prolonged viral infection. They continue to take interest in activities in which they are able to participate, do not show anxiety or major depressive symptoms, and have the best prognosis, although complete recovery may take up to 5 years. Often these patients are able to define the date on which the illness began. The term postviral fatigue state is most appropriate for this group. Impressive in some of our cases have been severe headaches and orthostatic hypotension, with wide swings in blood pressure resulting in syncope as well as intermittent"

            "content": "Children with concussion without subsequent neurologic deficits have a favorable long-term prognosis, and late sequelae are rare. Children with moderate contusions usually make good recoveries even when neurologic signs persist for weeks. Longterm sequelae may include poor memory, slowing of motor skills, generalized decrease in cognitive skills, behavioral alterations, or attention deficits. Language function, especially in a young child, frequently makes a good recovery. Rehabilitation programs with physical therapy, behavioral management, and appropriate education may be necessary. Poor prognostic signs include a Glasgow Coma Scale score of less than 4 on admission without improvement in 24 hours, absent pupillary light reflexes, and persistent extensor plantar reflexes."

            "content": "The latency between infection and the first neurologic symptoms that it is acceptable for this diagnosis is a matter of debate, but there are convincing cases (postexanthematous) in which the 2 phases of illness are separated by 3 or 4 weeks; several days is more typical, as noted below. Curiously, in the encephalitic form, new signs may continue to appear for up to 2 or 3 weeks from the onset. This is emphasized in the series of affected children collected by Hynson and colleagues. The imaging changes may also display delayed or continued evolution. These authors note that ataxia was the most common initial feature in their cases, which is not entirely in accordance with our experience."
