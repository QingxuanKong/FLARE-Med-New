The patient has a history of marijuana use, IV drug use, and alcohol use, which may increase the risk of liver disease. The patient's physical exam is notable for yellow/orange skin color, and laboratory studies show elevated bilirubin levels (total: 11.3 mg/dL, direct: 7.8 mg/dL). The patient's liver function tests are not provided, but the elevated bilirubin levels suggest liver dysfunction. Considering the patient's history of substance use, the possibility of liver disease, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis, should be considered. The elevated bilirubin levels can be due to pre-hepatic, hepatic, or post-hepatic causes. Given the patient's history of marijuana and alcohol use, a pre-hepatic cause (e.g., hemolytic anemia) is less likely. The presence of jaundice and elevated bilirubin levels suggests a hepatic cause. The patient's liver function tests are not provided, but the elevated bilirubin levels and jaundice suggest liver dysfunction. The patient's physical exam is notable for yellow/orange skin color, which is consistent with jaundice. The patient's history of substance use and elevated bilirubin levels suggest a liver-related pathology. The correct answer should be related to liver disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Tissue deposition of bilirubin occurs only in the presence of serum hyperbilirubinemia and is a sign of either liver disease or, less often, a hemolytic disorder. The degree of serum bilirubin elevation can be estimated by physical examination. Slight increases in serum bilirubin level are best detected by examining the sclerae, which have a particular affinity for bilirubin due to their high elastin content. The presence of scleral icterus indicates a serum bilirubin level of at least 51 \u03bcmol/L (3 mg/dL). The ability to detect scleral icterus is made more difficult if the examining room has fluorescent lighting. If the examiner suspects scleral icterus, a second site to examine is underneath the tongue.

Details regarding onset, timing, and precipitants of specific symptoms can help discern one diagnosis from another. History regarding pharmacologic, occupational, and environmental exposures is instructive, and family and travel history are crucial. In addition to details about the sinuses and lungs, it is important to inquire about systemic manifestations and assess for physical findings of cardiac, gastrointestinal (GI), neurologic, dermatologic, and genitourinary involvement, all of which may give clues to specific diagnoses. Once the details from history and physical are teased out, laboratory testing (including measurements of blood eosinophils, cultures, and markers of inflammation), spirometry and radiographic imaging can help distinguish between different diseases. Often, however, BAL, transbronchial, or open lung biopsies are required. In many cases, biopsies or"

Assessment of the patient\u2019s general appearance and vital signs, skin and soft tissue examination, and the neurologic evaluation are of particular importance. The patient may appear either anxious and agitated or lethargic and apathetic. Fever is usually present, although elderly patients and compromised hosts (e.g., patients who are uremic or cirrhotic and those who are taking glucocorticoids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be afebrile despite serious underlying infection. Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate helps determine the degree of hemodynamic and metabolic compromise. The patient\u2019s airway must be evaluated to rule out the risk of obstruction from an invasive oropharyngeal infection."

Suspect smoke inhalation in the presence of singed nose hairs, facial burns, hoarseness, wheezing, or carbonaceous sputum. Check an ABG and serum carboxyhemoglobin level (normal is < 5% in nonsmokers and < 10% in smokers). Check an ECG in the elderly and in patients with a history of cardiac disease."
