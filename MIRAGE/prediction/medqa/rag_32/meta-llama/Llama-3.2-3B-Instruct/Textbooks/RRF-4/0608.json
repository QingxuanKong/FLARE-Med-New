    "question": "A 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his grandparents. He is in a wheelchair with soft restraints because he has been violent and had been trying to hurt himself that day. The child\u2019s parents died in a car accident 1 month ago. His grandparents also brought the medications he stopped taking after his parents\u2019 death, including multivitamins, allopurinol, and diazepam. They say that their grandson has been using these medications for many years; however, they are unable to provide any medical history and claim that their grandson has been behaving strangely, exhibiting facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements for the past few days. They also note that he has had no teeth since the time they first met him at the age of 2. An intramuscular medication is administered to calm the boy down prior to drawing blood from him for laboratory tests. Which of the following biochemical pathway abnormalities is the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s condition?",

        "A": "Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the pyrimidine metabolism pathway",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the biochemical pathway abnormality that is the most likely cause of the patient's condition, we need to analyze the symptoms and laboratory findings presented. The patient is a 10-year-old boy who has been experiencing violent behavior, facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements. He has also had no teeth since the age of 2. These symptoms suggest a neurological disorder. The patient's grandparents brought the medications he stopped taking after his parents' death, including multivitamins, allopurinol, and diazepam. Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor used to treat gout, and diazepam is a benzodiazepine used to treat anxiety and seizures. The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest a diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase). This enzyme is involved in the purine metabolism pathway, specifically in the breakdown of hypoxanthine and guanine. A deficiency in HGPRTase leads to an accumulation of uric acid and other toxic compounds, causing neurological symptoms such as the ones described in the patient. The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and medical history. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the pyrimidine metabolism pathway (A) is not relevant, as pyrimidine metabolism is not affected in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Aminolevulinic acid synthetase of the heme metabolism pathway (B) is also not relevant, as heme metabolism is not directly related to the patient's symptoms. Thymidylate synthetase of the pyrimidine metabolism pathway (D) is not relevant, as pyrimidine metabolism is not affected in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Therefore, the correct answer is C, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase of the purine metabolism pathway.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."

At about 2 to 3 years of age, boys develop an awkward gait and an inability to run properly. Some have an antecedent history of mild slowness in attaining motor milestones or poor head control during infancy. Examination shows firm calf hypertrophy and mild to moderate proximal leg weakness with a hyperlordotic, waddling gait. The child typically arises from a lying position on the floor by using his arms to climb up his legs and body (Gower sign). Arm weakness is evident by age 6 years, and most boys are wheelchair dependent by age 12 years. Other manifestations include cardiomyopathy, scoliosis, respiratory decline, and, in some boys, cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. Many boys with Duchenne live into adulthood. Most die in their 20s or early 30s, usually as a result of progressive respiratory decline or cardiac dysfunction."

His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

Other less frequent causes include HIV, poststreptococcal infection, West Nile virus encephalitis, and rickettsial infections. Opsoclonus may also be observed in patients who are intoxicated with antidepressants, anticonvulsants, organophosphates, cocaine, lithium, thallium, and haloperidol; in the nonketotic hyperosmolar state; and in cerebral Whipple disease, where the eye movements are coupled with rhythmic jaw movements (oculomasticatory myorhythmia). A benign childhood form can persist for years without explanation and is responsive to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), as in the \u201cdancing eyes\u201d syndrome of Kinsbourne. In addition, a self-limited benign form exists in neonates."

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"
