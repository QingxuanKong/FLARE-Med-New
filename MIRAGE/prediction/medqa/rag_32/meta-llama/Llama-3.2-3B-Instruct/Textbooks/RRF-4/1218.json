    "question": "A 56-year-old man of Korean descent visits his primary care provider for an annual health check-up. His personal history is relevant for cigarette smoking and a sedentary lifestyle. He has type-2 diabetes mellitus which is under control with oral medications. Upon physical examination, he is found to have a blood pressure of 130/70 mm Hg, a pulse of 72/min, a respiratory rate of 18/min, and a body temperature of 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F). The rest of the examination is unremarkable except for an enlarged, nontender left supraclavicular node. In addition to a fine needle aspiration or biopsy, which of the following tests should also be included in further assessment of this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Chest radiograph",

        "C": "Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain",

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Given the patient's presentation of an enlarged, nontender left supraclavicular node, the primary concern is for metastasis from a primary malignancy, particularly lung cancer. This is a common site for metastasis to the supraclavicular lymph nodes. Considering the patient's history of type-2 diabetes mellitus and the presence of an enlarged supraclavicular lymph node, further assessment should focus on identifying the primary source of the malignancy. Option A, Chest radiograph, may not provide sufficient detail to identify the primary tumor, especially if it is located in a central location. Option B, Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, may be useful if the primary tumor is suspected to be located in the upper gastrointestinal tract, but it is not the most appropriate initial choice given the patient's presentation. Option C, Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, is not indicated as the patient does not have any symptoms or signs suggestive of central nervous system involvement. Option D, Ultrasound of the neck, is the most appropriate choice as it can help identify a thyroid mass or other neck masses that could be the primary source of the malignancy. Therefore, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the patient's presentation of an enlarged, nontender left supraclavicular node, the primary concern is for metastasis from a primary malignancy, particularly lung cancer. The patient's history of type-2 diabetes mellitus also increases the risk of lung cancer.

Any mucosal lesion that is suspicious for a primary neoplastic process should be biopsied first. If no mucosal lesion is detected, an excisional biopsy of the largest node should be performed. Fine-needle aspiration should not be performed as the first diagnostic procedure. Most diagnoses require more tissue than such aspiration can"

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

Initial general health evaluation should consist of a complete history and physical examination and the following laboratory tests: CBC with differential, chemistry profile, lipid profile, urinalysis, thyroid function tests, urine for microalbuminuria, and ECG (baseline at age 40 or older, repeat yearly). Oral hypoglycemic agents like the sulfonylureas may be considered if fasting blood glucose does not decline or increase and if the patient has diabetes for fewer than 10 years, does not have severe hepatic or renal disease, and is not pregnant or allergic to sulfa drugs. While on oral hypoglycemic agents, check the HgA1C every 3 months and at least two times a year if stable. If the HgA1C is <7% or the postprandial glucose is <200 mg/dL, omit the oral hypoglycemic agents, place on diet alone, and follow every 3 months."

A 30-year-old man had a diffuse and poorly defined epigastric mass. Further examination revealed asymmetrical scrotal enlargement. As part of her differential diagnosis, the resident considered the possibility that the man had testicular cancer with regional abdominal para-aortic nodal involvement (the lateral aortic, or lumbar, nodes). A primary testicular neoplasm is the most common tumor in men between the ages of 25 and 34 and accounts for between 1% and 2% of all malignancies in men. A family history of testicular cancer and maldescent of the testis are strong predisposing factors. Spread of the tumor is typically to the lymph node chains that drain the testes."

At the initial examination, blood pressure should be measured in both arms and preferably in the supine, sitting, and standing positions to evaluate for postural hypotension. Even if the femoral pulse is normal to palpation, arterial pressure should be measured at least once in the lower extremity in patients in whom hypertension is discovered before age 30. Heart rate also should be recorded. Hypertensive individuals have an increased prevalence of atrial fibrillation. The neck should be palpated for an enlarged thyroid gland, and patients should be assessed for signs of hypoand hyperthyroidism. Examination of blood vessels may provide clues about underlying vascular disease and should include funduscopic examination, auscultation for bruits over the carotid and femoral arteries, and palpation of femoral and pedal pulses. The retina is the only tissue in which arteries and arterioles can be examined directly. With increasing"

Therefore, they should be carried out only if the results can be expected to modify the patient\u2019s management. The prevention of heart disease, especially of CAD, is one of the most important tasks of primary care health givers as well as cardiologists. Prevention begins with risk assessment, followed by attention to lifestyle, such as achieving optimal weight, physical activity, and smoking cessation, and then aggressive treatment of all abnormal risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (Chap. 417). After a complete diagnosis has been established in patients with known heart disease, a number of management options are usually available. Several examples may be used to demonstrate some of the 1441 principles of cardiovascular therapeutics: 1."

His physician initially prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic commonly used to treat hyper-tension. His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic. Because the patient had elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, hydrochlorothiazide was replaced with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril lowered his blood pressure to almost normotensive levels. However, after several weeks on enalapril, the patient returned complaining of a persistent cough. In addition, some signs of angioedema were detected. How does enalapril lower blood pressure? Why does it occasionally cause coughing and angioedema? What other drugs could be used to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and decrease blood pressure,"
