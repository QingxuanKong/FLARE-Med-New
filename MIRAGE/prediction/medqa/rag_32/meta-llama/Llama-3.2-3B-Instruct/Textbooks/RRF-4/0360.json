The mother reports that her child has difficulty rolling from his back to his front and sitting unsupported. The patient is able to smile and furrow his brow normally, but she has noticed that he has a weak cry and suck. He was born at 38 weeks gestation via a spontaneous vaginal delivery without any complications. The mother said that the patient appeared \"normal\" until the past few weeks. On physical exam, his extraocular muscle movements are intact, and a symmetric smile is seen. He has symmetric flaccid weakness of both his upper and lower extremities. He also has a bell-shaped chest. Deep tendon reflexes are diminished. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

Other infants seem to develop normally for several months before the weakness becomes apparent. In these, the trunk, pelvic, and shoulder-girdle muscles are at first disproportionately affected, while the fingers and hands, toes and feet, and cranial muscles retain mobility. Hypotonia accompanies the weakness, and because passive displacement of articulated parts in testing muscle tone is easier to judge than power of contraction at this early age, it may be singled out as the dominant clinical characteristic. As a rule, the tendon reflexes are unobtainable. Volume of muscle is diminished but is difficult to evaluate in the infant because of the coverings of adipose tissue. Fasciculations are seldom visible except sometimes in the tongue. Perception of tactile and painful stimuli is undiminished, and emotional and social development measures up to age."

Weakness of all unilateral muscles of the face, including the forehead, eye, and mouth, indicates a lesion of the ipsilateral peripheral facial nerve (Bell palsy).Because the upper third of the face receives bilateral cortical innervation, if the weakness affects only the lower face and mouth, a contralateral lesion of upper motor neuron in the brain (tumor, stroke, abscess) must be considered."

Several forms have been observed. One is congenital, with generalized weakness in the neonatal period, making breathing and feeding difficult. The limbs are flaccid and flexic (again \u201cfloppy\u201d infant). Pneumonia and death occur within weeks to months. In forms that permit longer survival, the weakness is less severe, involving mainly the proximal muscles. Tendon reflexes are diminished or absent. The young child with this disease usually suffers from inanition and frequent respiratory infections, which may shorten life. Strength slowly improves with growth, the latter process evidently counteracting the advance of the disease."

Intercostal paralysis with a degree of collapse of the chest is the rule. Respiratory movements become paradoxical (abdominal protrusion with chest retraction). The cry becomes feeble, and sucking and swallowing are less efficient. Such infants are unable to sit unless propped, and they cannot hold up their heads without support and cannot roll over or support their weight when placed on their feet. Their posture is characteristic: arms abducted and flexed at the elbow, legs in the \u201cfrog position\u201d with external rotation and abduction at hips and flexion at hips and knees. If the effects of gravity are removed, all muscles continue to contract; that is there is paresis, not paralysis. Until late in the illness, these children appear bright-eyed, alert, and responsive."

Examination shows firm calf hypertrophy and mild to moderate proximal leg weakness with a hyperlordotic, waddling gait.

Does the patient choose to avoid certain body positions to reduce or eliminate pain, as might be the case with suspected acute pericarditis? Are there clues indicating that dyspnea may have a pulmonary cause, such as a barrel chest deformity with an increased anterior-posterior diameter, tachypnea, and pursed-lip breathing? Skin pallor, cyanosis, and jaundice can be"

He is then switched to celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily, and on this regimen his joint symptoms and heartburn resolve. Two years later, he returns with increased joint symptoms. His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor. With the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, he is started on a regimen"

            "content": "Muscles of the pelvic girdle, lumbosacral spine, and shoulders become weak and wasted, accounting for certain clinical peculiarities. Weakness of abdominal and paravertebral muscles accounts for a lordotic posture and protuberant abdomen when standing and the rounded back when sitting. Weakness of the extensors of the knees and hips interferes with equilibrium and with activities such as climbing stairs or rising from a chair or from a stooped posture. In standing and walking, the patient places his feet wide apart so as to increase his base of support. To rise from a sitting position, he first flexes his trunk at the hips, puts his hands on his knees, and pushes the trunk upward by working the hands up the thighs. In rising from the ground, the child first assumes a four-point position by extending the arms and legs to the fullest possible extent and then works each hand alternately up the corresponding thigh (the sign traditionally attached to Gowers\u2019 name). In getting up from a"

Clinical features of childhood-onset \u201cclassic\u201d DM include slowly progressive facial and distal extremity weakness as well as myotonia. Myotonia is a disorder of muscle relaxation after contraction. Patients grasp onto an object and have difficulty releasing their grasp, peeling their fingers away slowly. The facial appearance is characteristic, with hollowing of muscles around temples, jaw, and neck; ptosis; facial weakness; and drooping of the lower lip. The voice is nasal and mildly dysarthric. Not only is the striated muscle affected, but smooth muscle of the alimentary tract, uterus, and cardiac tissue are involved. Patients have variable arrhythmias, endocrinopathies, immunologic deficiencies, cataracts, and intellectual impairment."

            "content": "PATHOgENESIS upper Motor Neuron Weakness Lesions of the upper motor neurons or their descending axons to the spinal cord (Fig. 30-1) produce weakness through decreased activation of lower motor neurons. In general, distal muscle groups are affected more severely than proximal ones, and axial movements are spared unless the lesion is severe and bilateral. Spasticity is typical but may not be present acutely. Rapid repetitive movements are slowed and coarse, but normal rhythmicity is maintained. With corticobulbar involvement, weakness occurs in the lower face and tongue; extraocular, upper facial, pharyngeal, and jaw muscles are typically spared. Bilateral corticobulbar lesions produce a pseudobulbar palsy: dysarthria, dysphagia, dysphonia, and emotional lability accompany bilateral facial weakness and a brisk jaw jerk. Electromyogram (EMG) (Chap. 442e) shows that with weakness of the upper motor neuron type, motor units have a diminished maximal discharge frequency."

Focused History: LT is a widower and lives alone in a suburban community on the East Coast. He no longer drives. His two children live on the West Coast and come east infrequently. Since the death of his wife 11 months ago, he has been isolated and finds it hard to get out of the house. His appetite has changed, and he is content with cereal, coffee, and packaged snacks. Chewing is difficult."

            "content": "A 45-year-old man came to his physician complaining of pain and weakness in his right shoulder. The pain began after a fall on his outstretched hand approximately 6 months previously. The patient recalled having some minor shoulder tenderness but no other specific symptoms. He was otherwise fit and well. On examination of the shoulder, there was marked wasting of the muscles in the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae. The patient found initiation of abduction difficult and there was a weakness of lateral rotation of the humerus. The wasted muscles were the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The cause of the muscle wasting was disuse. Muscle atrophy (wasting) occurs through a variety of disorders. Disuse atrophy is one of the most common causes. Examples of disuse atrophy include the loss of muscle bulk after fracture immobilization in a plaster cast. The opposite effect can also be demonstrated\u2014when muscles are overused they become bulkier (hypertrophy)."
