    "question": "A 34-year-old man with acute lymphocytic leukemia presents for follow-up in the oncology clinic after his second cycle of chemotherapy. In addition to intermittent nausea, he has mild weakness, tingling, and numbness in his left hand. With his affected hand, he is able to grip, but occasionally drops small objects. His oncologist tells him that one of his chemotherapy agents likely caused his neuropathy given its strong association with neurotoxicity. He was recently treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, and dasatinib. The culprit medication works by which of the following mechanisms of action?",

The key to answering this question is to identify the mechanism of action of the culprit medication. Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that works by adding an alkyl group to the DNA molecule, which can lead to cross-linking of DNA strands and ultimately cell death. Vincristine is a vinca alkaloid that works by binding to tubulin and preventing microtubule formation, which is necessary for cell division. Doxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic that intercalates between DNA strands, inhibiting topoisomerase II and preventing DNA replication. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that suppresses inflammation and immune response. Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets specific enzymes involved in cancer cell growth and survival. Given these mechanisms of action, the only medication that stands out as a common cause of neurotoxicity is vincristine, which blocks microtubule formation. This is consistent with the patient's symptoms of mild weakness, tingling, and numbness in his left hand, which are typical of vincristine-induced neuropathy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Patients with localized disease might be treated with combination chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy; however, these patients are exceedingly rare. For the usual presentation with disseminated disease, standard lymphoma treatments have been unsatisfactory, with the minority of patients achieving complete remission. Aggressive combination chemotherapy regimens followed by autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation are frequently offered to younger patients. For the occasional elderly, asymptomatic patient, observation followed by single-agent chemotherapy might be the most practical approach. An intensive combination chemotherapy regimen originally used in the treatment of acute leukemia, HyperC-VAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, cytarabine, and methotrexate), in combination with rituximab, seems to be associated with better response rates, particularly in younger patients.

Proprioception and vibratory sensation are most severely impaired. Some patients develop acrodynia and episodic color changes in the fingertips and toes suggesting that autonomic nerves are also involved; in severe cases there is sensory ataxia and pseudoathetosis. The severity of histopathologic changes in the peripheral nervous system corresponds to the concentration of platinum in these tissues, the highest being found in dorsal root ganglia.

Bendamustine, an alkylating agent structurally related to nitrogen mustard, is highly effective and is vying with fludarabine as the primary treatment of choice. Patients who present with lymphoma (rather than leukemia) are also highly responsive to bendamustine, and some patients will receive a combination chemotherapy regimen used in other lymphomas such as CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone) or CHOP plus rituximab.

Many patients are then able to tolerate vincristine in low dosage, such as 1 mg every 2 weeks, for many months. Thalidomide produces a similar sensory neuropathy. It is finding use in the treatment of inflammatory conditions such as Beh\u00e7het disease, graft versus host reactions, erythema nodosum, lepromatous eruptions, aphthous stomatitis in HIV patients and highly vascular tumors and certain tumors such as renal cell cancer."

This complication has also been seen in patients with other forms of cancer treated with taxanes, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, vinorelbine, cisplatin, carboplatin, and high-dose chemotherapy (Fig. 331-5). It also has been reported in patients with AIDS, aplastic anemia, cyclic neutropenia, idiosyncratic drug reactions involving antibiotics, and immunosuppressive therapies. The patient develops right lower quadrant abdominal pain, often with rebound tenderness and a tense, distended abdomen, in a setting of fever and neutropenia. Watery diarrhea (often containing sloughed mucosa) and bacteremia are common, and bleeding may occur. Plain abdominal films are generally of little value in the diagnosis; CT scan may show marked bowel wall thickening, particularly in the cecum, with bowel wall edema, mesenteric stranding, and ascites, and may help to"

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

They are initiated by autophosphorylation of select tyrosine residues in their receptors. C. They are mediated by binding to adrenergic receptors, which are a class of nuclear receptors. D. They result in the activation of glycogen and triacylglycerol synthesis. Q3. NE bound to certain receptors causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. Why might NE be used clinically in the treatment of septic shock?

Focused History: AZ\u2019s father reports that the boy has always been quite sensitive to the sun. His skin turns red (erythema) and his eyes hurt (photophobia) if he is exposed to the sun for any period of time."

Further examination of his left eye reveals rupture of his globe. The ophthalmolo-gist requests emergency surgery to repair and save his eye. Because the patient has suffered a recent trauma, you decide to perform a rapid sequence intubation in preparation for the surgical procedure.

After intravenous infusion of your chosen muscle relaxant, you are unable to adequately visualize the patient\u2019s larynx and vocal cords and cannot successfully pass an endotracheal tube.

The choice of therapy for an individual patient, administration of treatment, and management of toxicities are complicated and require hematologic expertise."

Nausea may be acute (within 24 h of chemotherapy), delayed (>24 h), or anticipatory of the receipt of chemotherapy. Patients may be likewise stratified for their risk of susceptibility to nausea and vomiting, with increased risk in young, female, heavily pretreated patients without a history of alcohol or drug use but with a history of motion or morning sickness. Antineoplastic agents vary in their capacity to cause nausea and vomiting. Highly emetogenic drugs (>90%) include mechlorethamine, streptozotocin, DTIC, cyclophosphamide at >1500 mg/m2, and cisplatin; moderately emetogenic drugs (30\u201390% risk) include carboplatin, cytosine arabinoside (>1 mg/m2), ifosfamide, conventional-dose cyclophosphamide, and anthracyclines; low-risk (10\u201330%) agents include 5FU, taxanes, etoposide, and bortezomib, with minimal risk (<10%) afforded by treatment with antibodies, bleomycin, busulfan, fludarabine,"
