    "question": "A 31-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 32 weeks' gestation presents to the emergency department for clear vaginal discharge that started roughly 26 hours ago. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Her first child was born at term by vaginal delivery. She has no history of any serious illnesses. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. Current medications include vitamin supplements. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (98.9\u00b0F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 128/82 mm Hg. Speculum examination demonstrates clear fluid at the cervical os. The fetal heart rate is reactive at 160/min with no decelerations. Tocometry shows uterine contractions. Nitrazine testing is positive. She is started on indomethacin. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "A": "Administer ampicillin and perform amnioinfusion",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with clear vaginal discharge and a positive nitrazine test, which indicates chorioamnionitis. The patient is started on indomethacin, which is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat preterm labor. The next step in management should be to administer antibiotics to treat the chorioamnionitis. The choice of antibiotic is not explicitly stated, but ampicillin is a common choice for treating chorioamnionitis. Progesterone is also often used in addition to antibiotics to prevent preterm birth. Betamethasone is a corticosteroid that can be administered to promote fetal lung maturity, but it is not the next step in management in this scenario. Induction of labor is not indicated in this scenario, as the patient is already showing signs of preterm labor. Therefore, the correct answer is to administer ampicillin and progesterone.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

With a living viable-aged fetus, and with vaginal delivery not imminent, emergency cesarean delivery is chosen by most. In some women, fetal compromise will be evident as shown in Figure 41-19. When evaluating fetal status, sonographic conirmation of fetal heart activity may be necessary because sometimes an electrode applied directly to a dead fetus will provide misleading information by recording the maternal heart rate.

Their overall cesarean delivery rate was 5 percent in the 1970s and 1980s with such management. The approach is now referred to as active management of labor. Two of its components-amniotomy and oxytocinhave been widely used, especially in English-speaking countries outside the United States. With this protocol, labor is diagnosed when painful contractions are accompanied by complete cervical efacement, bloody \"show,\" or ruptured membranes. Women with such indings are committed to delivery within 12 hours. Pelvic examination is performed each hour for the next 3 hours, and thereafter at 2-hour intervals. When dilation has not increased by at least 1 cm/hr, amniotomy is performed. Progress is again assessed at 2 hours, and high-dose oxytocin infusion, described in Chapter 26 (p. 509),"

She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

            "content": "In most cases, bearing down is reflexive and spontaneous during second-stage labor. Occasionally, a woman may not employ her expulsive forces to good advantage and coaching is desirable. Her legs should be half-flexed so that she can push with them against the mattress. When the next uterine contraction begins, she is instructed to exert downward pressure as though she were straining at stool. A woman is not encouraged to push beyond the completion of each contraction. Instead, she and her fetus are allowed to rest and recover. During this period of actively bearing down, the fetal heart rate auscultated during the contraction is likely to be slow but should recover to normal range before the next expulsive efort. Fetal and obstetrical outcomes appear to be unafected whether pushing is coached or uncoached during second-stage labor (Bloom, 2006; Tuuli, 2012). Bloom and colleagues (2006) studied efects of actively coaching expulsive eforts in women without epidural analgesia. hey"

The pregnancy record is promptly reviewed to identiY complications. Problems identiied or anticipated during prenatal care should be displayed prominently in the pregnancy record. Most often, unless there has been bleeding in excess of bloody show, a cervical examination is performed. he gloved index and second ingers are introduced into the vagina while avoiding the anal region. During prenatal care, the woman is instructed to be aware of luid leakage from the vagina and to report such an event promptly. Rupture of the membranes is signiicant for three reasons. First, if the presenting part is not ixed in the pelvis, the umbilical cord can prolapse and be compressed. Second, labor is likely to begin soon if the pregnancy is at or near term."

He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

If membranes have been ruptured for many hours before labor onset or if there is a borderline temperature elevation, the temperature is checked hourly. Although uterine contractions are usually assessed with electronic monitoring, they can be quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated manually (Chap. 24, p. 478). With the palm of the hand resting lightly on the uterus, the time of contraction onset is determined. Its intensity is gauged from the degree of irm ness the uterus achieves. At the acme of efective contractions, the finger or thumb cannot readily indent the uterus during a \"irm\" contraction. he time at which the contraction disap pears is noted next. his sequence is repeated to evaluate the frequency, duration, and intensity of contractions."
