    "question": "A 21-year-old man comes to the emergency room with swelling and severe pain in his left lower leg that started 2 hours ago. He has no history of serious illness or trauma. His father has a history of pulmonary embolism. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily since he started college 3 years ago. He appears very distressed. He is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 92 kg (203 lb); BMI is 30.7 kg/m2. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a tender and mildly swollen left lower leg; dorsiflexion of the left foot causes severe pain in the calf. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 184,000/mm3, a prothrombin time of 11 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 26 seconds, and positive fibrin split products. Ultrasonography of the left leg shows incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow. The patient is administered a 5000 IU intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin followed by a constant infusion. Six hours later, the activated partial thromboplastin time is 30 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

Ultrasonography of the left leg shows incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow.\\n\\nGiven these findings, the patient likely has deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left leg. The positive fibrin split products and the ultrasound findings are consistent with a blood clot in the deep veins of the leg.\\n\\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\\nA. Antithrombin III deficiency: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the regulation of blood clotting. However, it is not the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.\\nB. Factor V Leiden: This is a genetic mutation that increases the risk of blood clots. While it is a risk factor for DVT, it is not the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.\\nC. Protein C deficiency: This is another genetic disorder that affects the regulation of blood clotting. Like Factor V Leiden, it is a risk factor for DVT, but not the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.\\nD. Antiphospholipid syndrome: This is an autoimmune disorder that affects the regulation of blood clotting. It is a known risk factor for DVT, and the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with this diagnosis.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is Antiphospholipid syndrome.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"D\"}}",

The most common location for an embolus to lodge in the leg is at the common femoral bifurcation. Typically, a patient will complain of foot and calf pain. Pulses are absent, and there may be diminution of sensation. Inability to move the affected muscle group is a sign of very severe ischemia and necessitates urgent revascularization. During evaluation of the affected extremity, it is important to compare findings with the contralateral limb. Clinical evaluation is extremely important in determining the etiology and location of the obstruction. One of the most important pieces of information to obtain is whether the patient has had prior vascular procedures or if there is a history of lower extremity claudication.

Clinical Pearls Not all leg pain is due to DVT, and not all dyspnea is due to PE (Table 300-2). Sudden, severe calf discomfort suggests a ruptured Baker\u2019s cyst. Fever and chills usually herald cellulitis rather than DVT. Physical findings, if present, may consist only of mild palpation discomfort in the lower calf. However, massive DVT often presents with marked thigh swelling, tenderness, and erythema. If the leg is diffusely edematous, DVT is unlikely. More probable is an acute exacerbation of venous insufficiency due to postthrombotic syndrome. Upper extremity venous thrombosis may present with asymmetry in the supraclavicular fossa or in the circumference of the upper arms."

An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

            "content": "When a patient in hypothermic cardiac arrest is first discovered, cardiopulmonary resuscitation is indicated unless (1) a do-not-resuscitate status is verified, (2) obviously lethal injuries are identified, or (3) the depression of a frozen chest wall is not possible. As the resuscitation proceeds, the prognosis is grave if there is evidence of widespread cell lysis, as reflected by potassium levels >10\u201312 mmol/L (10\u201312meq/L). Other findings that may preclude continuing resuscitation include a core temperature <10\u201312\u00b0C (<50\u201354\u00b0F), a pH <6.5, and evidence of intravascular thrombosis with a fibrinogen value <0.5 g/L (<50 mg/ dL). The decision to terminate resuscitation before rewarming the patient past 33\u00b0C (91\u00b0F) should be predicated on the type and severity of the precipitants of hypothermia. There are no validated prognostic indicators for recovery from hypothermia. A history of asphyxia with secondary cooling is the most important negative predictor of survival."

Bleeding into any organ may occur when the PTT is greater than 3 times the pretreatment level. When the PTT exceeds 100 s, it is preferable to discontinue the infusion, check the blood clotting values, and then reinstitute the infusion at a lower rate based on the test results (rather than simply lower the infusion rate). In circumstances of fluctuating basilar artery ischemia, it is our practice to permit higher values of PTT."

            "content": "Coagulopathies are common because cold inhibits the enzymatic reactions required for activation of the intrinsic cascade. In addition, thromboxane B2 production by platelets is temperature dependent, and platelet function is impaired. The administration of platelets and fresh-frozen plasma is therefore not effective. The prothrombin or partial thromboplastin times or the international normalized ratio can be deceptively normal and contrast with the observed in vivo coagulopathy. This contradiction occurs because all coagulation tests are routinely performed at 37\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), and the enzymes are thus rewarmed."

            "content": "The standard anticoagulant agent used in clinical practice is unfractionated heparin (UFH). The available data suggest that when UFH is added to a regimen of aspirin and a non-fibrin-specific thrombolytic agent such as streptokinase, additional mortality benefit occurs (about 5 lives saved per 1000 patients treated). It appears that the immediate administration of intravenous UFH, in addition to a regimen of aspirin and relatively fibrin-specific fibrinolytic agents (tPA, rPA, or TNK), helps to maintain patency of the infarct-related artery. This effect is achieved at the cost of a small increased risk of bleeding. The recommended dose of UFH is an initial bolus of 60 U/kg (maximum 4000 U) followed by an initial infusion of 12 U/kg per hour (maximum 1000 U/h). The activated partial thromboplastin time during maintenance therapy should be 1.5\u20132 times the control value."

He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."
