She is accompanied by her sister who says that her symptoms developed acutely and is unsure about what caused it. She is currently on methimazole, which she last took approximately 1 week ago. Approximately 5 days ago she developed an upper respiratory infection managed with bed rest and ibuprofen. Her temperature is 105\u00b0F (40.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 95/68 mmHg, pulse is 145/min, and respirations are 23/min. On physical examination, the patient has altered mentation and is agitated and diaphoretic. The patient also has a goiter, exophthalmos, warm skin, and a hand tremor. She is started on intravenous fluids. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?",

The patient is on methimazole, which she last took approximately 1 week ago. The patient also has a goiter, exophthalmos, warm skin, and a hand tremor. These symptoms are suggestive of thyroid storm, a life-threatening complication of untreated or undertreated hyperthyroidism. The patient's symptoms are likely exacerbated by the upper respiratory infection she developed 5 days ago, which may have triggered the thyroid storm. The patient's vital signs, such as tachycardia and hypotension, also support this diagnosis. The best treatment option for this patient is to start her on beta-blockers to control the symptoms of tachycardia and tremors, and to administer iodine or beta-blockers to treat the thyroid storm. Among the options provided, propranolol is a beta-blocker that can be used to treat the symptoms of tachycardia and tremors, making it a suitable choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

The febrile stage lasts 3 or 4 days and is identified by the abrupt onset of fever, headache, severe myalgia, thirst, anorexia, and often nausea and vomiting. Photophobia, retroorbital pain, and pain on ocular movement are common, and the vision may become blurred with ciliary body inflammation. Flushing over the face, the V area of the neck, and the back is characteristic, as are pharyngeal injection, periorbital edema, and conjunctival suffusion. Petechiae often develop in areas of pressure, the conjunctivae, and the axillae. Back pain and tenderness to percussion at the costovertebral angle reflect massive retroperitoneal edema. Laboratory evidence of mild to moderate DIC is present. Other laboratory findings of HFRS include proteinuria and active urinary sediment. The hypotensive stage lasts from a few hours to 48 h and begins with falling blood pressure and sometimes shock. The relative bradycardia typical of the febrile"
