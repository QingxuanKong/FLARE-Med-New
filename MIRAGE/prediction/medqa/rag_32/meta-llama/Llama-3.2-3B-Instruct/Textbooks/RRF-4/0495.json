The mass is biopsied and cytology results are diagnostic for invasive ductal adenocarcinoma that is estrogen receptor positive. The patient is started on chemotherapy and ultimately has the mass resected. She is taking tamoxifen and has regular outpatient follow up appointments to monitor for any recurrence of cancer. The patient has a past medical history of asthma, obesity, and a uterine leimyoma which was definitively treated last year. Her last menstrual period was at the age of 47. The patient's vital signs and exam are unremarkable. Which of the following is a potential complication that could occur in this patient?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the given question: The patient is a 55-year-old postmenopausal woman with a history of invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast, which is estrogen receptor-positive. She is taking tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is commonly used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen is known to have several side effects, including an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Considering the patient's age, history of cancer, and use of tamoxifen, the potential complications that could occur in this patient are: * Thromboembolic events, such as deep venous thrombosis (DVT), are a well-known risk associated with tamoxifen use, especially in postmenopausal women. * Seborrheic keratoses are a type of skin lesion that is not directly related to tamoxifen use. * Increased bleeding is not a common side effect of tamoxifen. * Osteoporosis is a potential side effect of tamoxifen, but it is not as directly related to the patient's current situation as DVT. Therefore, the most likely potential complication that could occur in this patient is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is taking tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.

An apparently fibrocystic lesion that does not completely resolve within several menstrual cycles should be sampled for biopsy. Any mass in a post-menopausal woman who is not taking estrogen therapy should be presumed to be malignant. Some clinicians will monitor a mass when results of the clinical diagnosis, breast imaging studies, and cytologic studies are all in agreement, such as with fibroadenoma.

The lesion typically is not a discrete mass, but rather a multifocal entity within one or both breasts incidentally discovered by the pathologist during the evaluation of a completely unrelated issue. Lobular carcinoma in situ usually is managed with an excisional biopsy followed by careful surveillance with clinical breast examinations and mammography. Occasionally, a patient may request either bilateral prophylactic mastectomy or tamoxifen for chemoprevention.

This two-step approach allows patients to adjust to the diagnosis of cancer, carefully consider alternative forms of therapy, and seek a second opinion. Studies show no adverse effect from the 1to 2-week delay associated with the two-step procedure (71).

A 35-year-old man had a soft mass approximately 3 cm in diameter in the right scrotum. The diagnosis was a right indirect inguinal hernia. What were the examination findings? The mass was not tender and the physician was not able to \u201cget above it.\u201d The testes were felt separate from the mass, and a transillumination test (in which a bright light is placed behind the scrotum and the scrotal sac is viewed from the front) was negative. (A positive test occurs when the light penetrates through the scrotum.) When the patient stood up, a positive cough \u201cimpulse\u201d was felt within the mass. After careful and delicate maneuvering, the mass could be massaged into the inguinal canal, so emptying from the scrotum. When the massaging hand was removed, the mass recurred in the scrotum."

            "content": "Breast cancer is about 1/150th as frequent in men as in women; 1720 men developed breast cancer in 2006. It usually presents as a unilateral lump in the breast and is frequently not diagnosed promptly. Given the small amount of soft tissue and the unexpected nature of the problem, locally advanced presentations are somewhat more common. When male breast cancer is matched to female breast cancer by age and stage, its overall prognosis is identical. Although gynecomastia may initially be unilateral or asymmetric, any unilateral mass in a man older than age 40 years should receive a careful workup including biopsy. On the other hand, bilateral symmetric breast development rarely represents breast cancer and is almost invariably due to endocrine disease or a drug effect. It should be kept in mind, nevertheless, that the risk of cancer is much greater in men with gynecomastia; in such men, gross asymmetry of the breasts should arouse suspicion of cancer. Male breast cancer is best managed"

            "content": "Signs The most important sign of epithelial ovarian cancer is the presence of a pelvic mass on physical examination. A solid, irregular, fixed pelvic mass is highly suggestive of an ovarian malignancy. If an upper abdominal mass or ascites is present, the diagnosis of ovarian cancer is almost certain. Because the patient usually reports abdominal symptoms, she may not have a pelvic examination, and a tumor may be missed. In patients who are at least 1 year past menopause, the ovaries should be atrophic and not palpable. It was proposed that any palpable pelvic mass in these patients should be considered potentially malignant, a situation that was referred to as the postmenopausal palpable ovary syndrome (91). This concept was challenged, because subsequent authors reported that only about 3% of palpable masses measuring less than 5 cm in postmenopausal women are malignant (57)."

            "content": "Because the breasts are a common site of potentially fatal malignancy in women, examination of the breast is an essential part of the physical examination. Unfortunately, internists frequently do not examine breasts in men, and in women, they are apt to defer this evaluation to gynecologists. Because of the plausible association between early detection and improved outcome, it is the duty of every physician to identify breast abnormalities at the earliest possible stage and to institute a diagnostic workup. Women should be trained in breast self-examination (BSE). Although breast cancer in men is unusual, unilateral lesions should be evaluated in the same manner as in women, with the recognition that gynecomastia in men can sometimes begin unilaterally and is often asymmetric."
