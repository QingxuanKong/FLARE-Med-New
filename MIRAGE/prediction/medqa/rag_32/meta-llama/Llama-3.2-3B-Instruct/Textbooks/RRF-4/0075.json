She is only able to verbalize two word sentences and has generalized developmental delay. When she was born it was noticed that she had a high pitched mewing cry and subsequent physical exam revealed microcephaly, prominent epicanthal folds, and a holosystolic murmur best heard in the left 5th intercostal space near the sternum.

The patient is a 5-year-old female with a high-pitched mewing cry, microcephaly, prominent epicanthal folds, and a holosystolic murmur best heard in the left 5th intercostal space near the sternum. These symptoms are indicative of Cri-du-chat syndrome, which is associated with a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5 (5p-). This condition is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and physical abnormalities, including a high-pitched cry, microcephaly, and heart defects. The presence of a holosystolic murmur is also consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, the abnormality of chromosome 5 is most likely responsible for this patient's disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Articulation of speech sounds follows a developmental pattern, which is re\ufb02ected in the age norms of standardized tests.

At 56 hours, she started showing focal seizure activity. The plasma ammonia level was found to be 887 \u00b5mol/l (normal 5\u201335 \u00b5mol/l). Quantitative plasma amino acid levels revealed a marked elevation of citrulline but not argininosuccinate. 9.3.

The most common causes of the speech delay are MR, hearing impairment, social deprivation, autism, and oral-motor abnormalities. If a problem is suspected based on screening with tests such as Ages and Stages Questionnaires or the Parents\u2019 Evaluation of Developmental Status test (see Chapter 8) or other standard screening test (Early Language Milestone Scale), a referral to a specialized hearing and speech center is indicated. While awaiting Before 6 months, the child does not startle, blink, or change immediate activity in response to sudden, loud sounds. Before 6 months, the child does not attend to the human voice and is not soothed by his or her mother\u2019s voice. By 6 months, the child does not babble strings of consonant and vowel syllables or imitate gurgling or cooing sounds."

Long diastolic murmur, hyperdynamic pulse, and head bobbing when severe and chronic. Wide pulse pressure. Causes include Bicuspid aortic valve, Endocarditis, Aortic root dilation, Rheumatic fever (BEAR). Progresses to left HF. Follows opening snap (OS; due to abrupt halt in leaflet motion in diastole, after rapid opening due to fusion at leaflet tips). Delayed rumbling mid-to-late diastolic murmur (\u0090 interval between S2 and OS correlates with \u008f severity). LA >> LV pressure during diastole. Often a late (and highly specific) sequela of rheumatic fever. Chronic MS can result in pulmonary congestion/hypertension and LA dilation \u008e atrial fibrillation and Ortner syndrome. Patent ductus arteriosus Continuous machine-like murmur. Best heard at left infraclavicular area. Loudest at S2. Often due to congenital rubella or prematurity."

            "content": "In discussing the developmental disorders of speech and language, we have adopted a conventional classification. Not usually included in such a classification are the many mundane peculiarities of speech and language that are usually accepted without comment: lack of fluency, inability to speak uninterruptedly in complete sentences, and lack of proper intonation, inflection, and melody of speech (dysprosody). Fully two-thirds of children say their first words between 9 and 12 months of age and their first word combinations before their second birthday; when this does not happen, it becomes a matter of parental concern. Children who fail to reach these milestones at the stated times fall into two general categories. In one group there is no clear evidence of cognitive delay or impairment of neurologic or auditory function. In a second group, the speech delay has an overt pathologic basis."
