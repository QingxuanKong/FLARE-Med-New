The key information provided is that the tissue is derived from a 2-year-old boy with a palpable left-sided abdominal mass that does not cross the midline, and histological examination of the kidney mass shows primitive blastemal cells and immature tubules and glomeruli. This is a characteristic of Wilms tumor, also known as nephroblastoma, which is a type of kidney cancer that typically affects children. The embryological origin of Wilms tumor is related to the development of the kidneys. The kidneys develop from the intermediate mesoderm in the embryo, which also gives rise to other structures. The intermediate mesoderm differentiates into two main layers: the nephrogenic layer, which forms the kidneys, and the urogenital ridge, which forms the gonads (ovaries and testes). The tissue in question is derived from the same embryological structure as the gonads. Therefore, the correct answer can be inferred by understanding the embryological origin of Wilms tumor and the development of the gonads.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Evaluation of the inferior vena cava is crucial because the tumor may extend from the kidney into the vena cava. A complete blood count, urinalysis, liver and renal function studies, and a chest radio-graph (to identify pulmonary metastases) should be obtained. In most cases, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is obtained. The diagnosis is confirmed by histologic examination of the tumor. Although most cases of Wilms tumor are classified as favorable histology, the presence of anaplasia is predictive of a worse prognosis and is considered unfavorable."

            "content": "The kidney is less frequently injured than the liver or spleen, and when injured is often associated with other injuries. A young child\u2019s kidney is more vulnerable to trauma than an adult\u2019s because of a more compliant rib cage and relatively immature abdominal muscle development. The diagnosis of renal injury is based on history and physical examination coupled with urinalysis showing blood and increased protein levels. An ultrasound or CT may also be useful. Low-grade renal injury is usually managed conservatively, with bed rest, catheter drainage, and monitoring for resolution of injury by ultrasound or CT. Surgery may be required for falling hemoglobin levels, refractory shock, or urinary obstruction caused by clots."

            "content": "The physical examination may point to the potential causes (see Table 150-2). The physiologic stability of the patient may be abnormal with acute blood loss and acute hemolysis, manifesting as tachycardia, blood pressure changes, and, most ominously, an altered state of consciousness. The presence of jaundice suggests hemolysis. Petechiae and purpura indicate a coagulopathy. Hepatosplenomegaly and adenopathy suggest infiltrative disorders. Growth failure or poor weight gain suggests an anemia of chronic disease. An essential element of the physical examination is the investigation of the stool for the presence of occult blood."

            "content": "Wilms tumor, or nephroblastoma, is the most common primary tumor of the kidney in children, with most cases occurring in children between 2 and 5 years of age. This tumor illustrates several important concepts of childhood tumors: the relationship between congenital malformation and increased risk of tumors; the histologic similarity between tumor and developing organ; and finally, the remarkable success in the treatment of childhood tumors. Each of these concepts is presented in the following discussion."

            "content": "Acute obstruction of urine flow is the cause of renal colic, a severe sharp intermittent pain in the flank or lower abdomen often radiating to the groin. Vomiting, distress, and inability to relieve pain with position changes are characteristic. In younger children, classic symptoms may not be apparent; fussiness and vomiting may be the only symptoms. Hematuria may be gross or microscopic and typically clears rapidly with passage of gravel or stone material."
