These findings are consistent with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism. The patient's tachycardia, edema, and waxy discoloration in his legs are also consistent with this diagnosis. The correct answer can be determined by analyzing the options provided. Option A, sympathetic underactivity, is incorrect because the patient is tachycardic, not bradycardic. Option B, anti-thyroglobin antibodies, is incorrect because the patient has thyroglobulin-stimulating immunoglobulins, not anti-thyroglobin antibodies. Option D, increased TSH release, is incorrect because the patient has low TSH levels, not elevated levels. Option C, exophthalmos, is the correct answer because it is a characteristic feature of Graves' disease. Exophthalmos, or bulging of the eyes, is a common finding in patients with Graves' disease due to the inflammation and swelling of the tissues around the eye. This condition is often associated with other symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as heat intolerance, weight loss, and tachycardia.\" \"answer_choice\": \"C\" } ``` The final answer is C.",

Graves\u2019 disease also is associated with other autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, Addison\u2019s disease, pernicious anemia, and myasthenia gravis.Macroscopically, the thyroid gland in patients with Graves\u2019 disease is diffusely and smoothly enlarged, with a concomitant increase in vascularity. Microscopically, the gland is hyperplastic, and the epithelium is columnar with minimal colloid present. The nuclei exhibit mitosis, and papillary pro-jections of hyperplastic epithelium are common. There may be aggregates of lymphoid tissue, and vascularity is markedly increased.Clinical Features. The clinical manifestations of Graves\u2019 disease can be divided into those related to hyperthyroidism and those specific to Graves\u2019 disease. Hyperthyroid symp-toms include heat intolerance, increased sweating and thirst, and weight loss despite adequate caloric intake. Symptoms of increased adrenergic stimulation include"

Raised TSH levels are found in primary thyroid failure, whereas secondary hypothyroidism is characterized by low TSH levels that do not increase following TRH stimulation. Thyroid autoantibodies are highest in patients with autoimmune disease (Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, Graves\u2019 dis-ease) and may also be elevated in patients with nodular goiter and thyroid neoplasms. An electrocardiogram demonstrates decreased voltage with flattening or inversion of T waves.Treatment T4 is the treatment of choice and is administered in dosages varying from 50 to 200 \u03bcg per day, depending on the patient\u2019s size and condition. Starting doses of 100 \u03bcg of T4 daily are well tolerated; however, elderly patients and those with coexisting heart disease and"

The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy. One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC). He undergoes surgical resection and is found to have high-risk stage III CRC with five positive lymph nodes. After surgery, he feels entirely well with no symptoms. Of note, he has no other illnesses. What is this patient\u2019s overall prognosis? Based on his prognosis, what"

            "content": "The incidence of hypothyroidism is approximately 1% in the adult population, and 5% in adults older than 50 years (154). In women older than 60 years, the incidence of hypothyroidism may approach 6% (168). Hypothyroidism is 10 times more common in women than in men (154). Many such cases are secondary to previous antithyroid therapy (radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy) for hyperthyroidism. The most common primary cause of hypothyroidism is Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, an autoimmune condition (154). A history of lethargy, cold intolerance, lassitude, weight gain, \ufb02uid retention, constipation, dry skin, hoarseness, periorbital edema, and brittle hair can be indicative of inadequate thyroid function. In this setting, physical findings of increased relaxation phase of deep tendon re\ufb02exes, cardiomegaly, pleural or pericardial effusions, or peripheral edema should stimulate further investigation of thyroid function by assessment of TSH and free T4 levels. Hypothyroidism decreases cardiac"

Malaise and symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may precede the thyroid-related features by several weeks. In other patients, the onset is acute, severe, and without obvious antecedent. The patient typically complains of a sore throat, and examination reveals a small goiter that is exquisitely tender. Pain is often referred to the jaw or ear. Complete resolution is the usual outcome, but late-onset permanent hypothyroidism occurs in 15% of cases, particularly in those with coincidental thyroid autoimmunity. A prolonged course over many months, with one or more relapses, occurs in a small percentage of patients."

He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"
