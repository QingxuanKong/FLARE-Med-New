The impact of these changes is still being assessed, but the evidence that medical errors have decreased as a consequence is sparse.

In addition to continuing controversy over their effectiveness, some ethical concerns are raised by work-hour limitations. One concern is that physicians may develop a shift-worker mentality that undermines their dedication to the well-being of patients. Forced handoffs to colleagues may actually increase the risk of errors, and inflexibility can be detrimental. In some cases, trainees could provide an irreplaceable benefit to a patient or family by going beyond work-hour limits, especially if there is rapport with the patient or family that is not easily transferred to another provider.

The ACGME has mandated the teaching of these core competencies but has not established a formal guide on how to teach the lead-ership skills described within the core competencies. Therefore, this chapter offers a review of fundamental principles of leader-ship and an introduction of the concept of a leadership training program for future surgeons.DEFINITIONS OF LEADERSHIPMany different definitions of"
