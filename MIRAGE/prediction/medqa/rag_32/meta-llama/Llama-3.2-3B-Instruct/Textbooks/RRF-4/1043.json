Her vital signs are within normal limits. On physical exam of the thyroid gland, a solitary nodule is palpated. It is fixed to the surrounding tissues and nontender.

This information helps to rule out autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis, option C) and hyperthyroidism (normal TSH level).\\n\\nThe patient's age and the slow growth of the nodule also make follicular carcinoma (option B) less likely. Follicular carcinoma is more common in older adults and often presents with a rapidly growing mass.\\n\\nEndemic goiter (option A) is also unlikely, as it typically presents with a diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland and is often seen in areas with iodine deficiency. The patient's normal TSH level and lack of symptoms suggest that the thyroid gland is functioning normally.\\n\\nGiven the patient's age, the slow growth of the nodule, and the normal thyroid function, the most likely diagnosis is papillary carcinoma (option D). Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer, often presents with a slowly growing, painless mass, and is more common in younger adults. It is also more likely to be fixed to the surrounding tissues.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is papillary carcinoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

This disease is most likely autoimmune in etiology, as circulating antithyroid antibodies are found in a majority of patients. It mostly affects middle-aged women, who present with a painless neck mass or features of thyroid hormone excess. The initial phase of thyrotoxicosis (which is likely to be secondary to thyroid tissue damage) is followed by return to a euthyroid state within a few months. In a minority of affected individuals, the condition eventually progresses to hypothyroidism. Except for possible mild symmetric enlargement, the thyroid appears normal on gross inspection.

Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to \u201cprotect her bones\u201d and omeprazole for \u201cheartburn.\u201d On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm. Her weight is 136 lb (61.8 kg), an increase of 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the last year. Her thyroid gland is not palpable and her reflexes are delayed. Laboratory findings include a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 24.9 \u03bcIU/mL"

Thyroid nodules are very common and show an \u2191 incidence with age. Most are benign. Usually asymptomatic on initial presentation. Hyperfunctioning nodules present with hyperthyroidism and local symptoms (dysphagia, dyspnea, cough, choking sensation) and are associated with a family history (especially medullary thyroid cancer). An \u2191 risk of malignancy is associated with a history of neck irradiation, \u201ccold\u201d nodules on radionuclide scan, male sex, age < 20 or > 70, firm and fixed solitary nodules, a family history (especially medullary thyroid cancer), and rapidly growing nodules with hoarseness. Check for anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Carcinoma (see Table 2.3 4) may be frm and f xed. Medullary thyroid carcinoma is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 and familial medullary thyroid cancer."

            "content": "In iodine-sufficient populations, the data are less impressive. Randomized controlled trial analyses have shown that less than 25% of benign nodules shrink more than 50% with TSH suppression in iodine-replete populations. Thyroidectomy should be performed if a nodule enlarges on TSH suppression, causes compressive symptoms, or for cos-metic reasons. An exception to this general rule is the patient who has had previous irradiation of the thyroid gland or has a family history of thyroid cancer. In these patients, total or near-total thyroidectomy is recommended because of the high incidence of thyroid cancer and decreased reliability of FNAB in this setting.Malignant Thyroid DiseaseIn the United States, thyroid cancer accounts for <1% of all malignancies (2% of women and 0.5% of men) and is the most rapidly increasing cancer in women. Thyroid cancer is respon-sible for six deaths per million persons annually. Most patients present with a palpable swelling in the neck, which initiates"

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice?
