He has had a weight loss of 41 kgs (90 lbs) in the past year. Physical examination shows a soft bulge inferior and lateral to the navel on the left.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question requires identifying the muscle located directly medial to the pathology seen on the CT scan. The pathology is a mass or tumor, likely a hernia given the symptoms and location, which is inferior and lateral to the navel on the left. The muscles of the abdominal wall are listed as options. The rectus abdominis muscle is located in the midline of the abdomen, making it the most likely candidate to be directly medial to the pathology. The psoas major muscle is located posterior to the abdominal wall, the external oblique muscle is located superficial to the rectus abdominis, and the transverse abdominal muscle is also superficial to the rectus abdominis. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is the rectus abdominis muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

On further questioning, he reported that the pain also radiated over the lateral part of the foot, particularly around the lateral malleolus. The areas of pain correspond to dermatomes L4 to S3 nerves. Over the following weeks, the patient began to develop muscular weakness, predominantly footdrop. These findings are consistent with loss of the motor function and sensory change in the common fibular nerve, which is a branch of the sciatic nerve in the lower limb. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a mass in the posterior aspect of the right side of the pelvis. The mass was anterior to the piriformis muscle and adjacent to the rectum."

This patient had no long-standing neurological deficit. A 65-year-old man was examined by a surgical intern because he had a history of buttock pain and impotence. On examination he had a reduced peripheral pulse on the left foot compared to the right. On direct questioning, the patient revealed that he experienced severe left-sided buttock pain after walking 100 yards. After a short period of rest, he could walk another 100 yards before the same symptoms recurred. He also noticed that over the past year he was unable to obtain an erection. He smoked heavily and was on no other drugs or treatment."

Unfortunately, a complication of a vertical incision in the midclavicular line is division of the segmental nerve supply to the rectus abdominis muscle. This produces muscle atrophy and asymmetrical proportions of the anterior abdominal wall. A 45-year-old man had mild epigastric pain, and a diagnosis of esophageal reflux was made. He was given appropriate medication, which worked well. However, at the time of the initial consultation, the family practitioner requested a chest radiograph, which demonstrated a prominent hump on the left side of the diaphragm and old rib fractures.

The pain began after a fall on his outstretched hand approximately 6 months previously. The patient recalled having some minor shoulder tenderness but no other specific symptoms. He was otherwise fit and well. On examination of the shoulder, there was marked wasting of the muscles in the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae. The patient found initiation of abduction difficult and there was a weakness of lateral rotation of the humerus. The wasted muscles were the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The cause of the muscle wasting was disuse. Muscle atrophy (wasting) occurs through a variety of disorders. Disuse atrophy is one of the most common causes. Examples of disuse atrophy include the loss of muscle bulk after fracture immobilization in a plaster cast. The opposite effect can also be demonstrated\u2014when muscles are overused they become bulkier (hypertrophy)."

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

This case was fatal, but early diagnosis has increased the survival rate up to 65%. If the disease is left untreated, mortality is 100%. Typically, the rupture occurs in the lower third of the esophagus with a sudden rise in intraluminal esophageal pressure produced by vomiting secondary to an uncoordination and failure of the cricopharyngeus muscle to relax. Because the tears typically occur on the left, they are often associated with a large left pleural effusion that contains the gastric contents. In some patients, subcutaneous emphysema may be demonstrated. Treatment is optimal with urgent surgical repair. A 65-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe central chest pain that radiated to the neck and predominantly to the left arm. He was overweight and a known heavy smoker."

A review of the patient\u2019s old notes revealed that at the time of the injury the spleen was removed surgically, but it was not appreciated that there was a small rupture of the dome of the left hemidiaphragm. The patient gradually developed a hernia through which bowel could enter, producing the \u201chump\u201d on the diaphragm seen on the chest radiograph. Because this injury occurred many years ago and the patient has been asymptomatic, it is unlikely that the patient will come to any harm and was discharged."

Patients report pain with flexion and internal rotation, and after pro-longed sitting. On examination, there is a decrease in internal rotation that appears out of proportion to the loss of the other ranges of motion, and flexion can also be limited. The impinge-ment test, elicited by 90\u00b0 of flexion and adduction and internal rotation of the hip, is almost always positive, signified by pain in the groin region.The imaging findings of FAI can be seen on plain radio-graphs, CT scan, MRI, and magnetic resonance angiography. Some of the abnormalities seen include abnormal lateral femo-ral head/neck offset seen as a lateral femoral neck bump, os acetabuli, synovial herniation pits, acetabular over-coverage, hyaline cartilage abnormalities, and labral tears.Treatment of FAI has traditionally been surgical and has evolved from open surgical treatment with acetabuloplasty, to combined"
