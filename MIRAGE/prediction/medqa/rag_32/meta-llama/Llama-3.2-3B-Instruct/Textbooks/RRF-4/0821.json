She was recently asked to step down from her position as volunteer accountant for a local charity organization because she was no longer able to coordinate her tasks. She reports that she has become unable to taste or smell her food. Two years later, the patient dies. At autopsy, examination of the brain shows generalized cortical atrophy.

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with impaired memory and word-finding difficulties, which are typical symptoms of a dementia. She also reports a loss of taste and smell, which are common sensory deficits in Alzheimer's disease. The autopsy shows generalized cortical atrophy, which is also consistent with Alzheimer's disease. The key to answering this question is to identify the inclusions in the photomicrograph of the brain section. The inclusions indicated by the arrows are predominantly composed of a particular substance that is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Based on the options provided, the correct answer is B.

Even a manifest psychosis may have occurred in relation to some of these disorders, but such occurrences are admittedly rare. For example, one of our patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy, a 30-year-old man, began failing in college years and was later unsuccessful in holding a job because of carelessness and mistakes in his work and indifference to criticism, irritability, and stubbornness (clearly traceable to a mild dementia). Only when Babinski signs and loss of tendon reflexes in the legs were detected was the correct diagnosis entertained for the first time. By then he had been ill for nearly 10 years. Bosch and Hart described a patient with the onset of dementia at 62 years of age and drew attention"

            "content": "By the manner in which the patient expresses ideas and responds to spoken or written requests, it is possible to determine whether there are hallucinations or delusions, defective memory, or other recognizable symptoms of brain disease merely by watching and listening to the patient. On occasion, mute and resistive patients judged to be psychotic prove to have some widespread cerebral disease. The reader is referred to the special methods of examination described by Volpe and the staff members of the Mayo Clinic, which are listed in the references and described in Chap. 27. Many of these tests address the developmental aspects of the child\u2019s nervous system, and although some signs may be difficult to obtain because of the age of the patient, they still stand as the best reflections of the child\u2019s neurologic state."

Common ones in experience with our patients have been gas poisoning in the house, unaccustomed suspiciousness, alleged home break ins, having inadequate money, or being stolen from or cheated. (Some of these arise in early dementia as well.) Hallucinations, when they occur, are usually transitory, vocal, and only vaguely accusatory; their presence should always raise the possibility of an associated structural brain disease, drug intoxication, or alcoholic auditory hallucinosis."

In many patients with AD, neurofibrillary degeneration eventually spreads to prefrontal cortex and gives rise to components of the frontal lobe syndrome, but almost always on a background of severe memory impairment. Rarely, the bvFTD syndrome can arise in isolation in the context of an atypical form of AD pathology. Lesions in the caudate nucleus or in the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus (subcortical components of the prefrontal network) also can produce a frontal lobe syndrome. This is one reason why the changes in mental state associated with degenerative basal ganglia diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease and Huntington\u2019s disease display components of"

            "content": "Memory impairment, which is a central feature of many dementias, occurs with extensive disease in several different parts of the cerebrum, but the integrity of discrete parts of the diencephalon and of the medial temporal lobes is fundamental to memory. Also, impairment of language function is associated specifically with disease of the dominant cerebral hemisphere, particularly the perisylvian parts of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes. Loss of capacity for reading and calculation is related to lesions in the posterior part of the left (dominant) cerebral hemisphere; loss of use of tools and imitation of gestures (apraxias) is related to loss of tissue in the dominant parietal region. Impairment in drawing or constructing simple and complex figures with blocks, sticks, picture arrangements, etc., is observed with parietal lobe lesions, more often with right-sided (nondominant) than with left-sided ones. And problems with modulation of behavior and stability of personality are"

            "content": "The first step in diagnosis is to recognize that the patient is confused. This is obvious in most cases but, as pointed out earlier, the mildest forms, particularly when some other alteration of personality is prominent, may be overlooked. Sometimes, the patient\u2019s attention can be best engaged by speaking softly or whispering rather than shouting or using a conversational amplitude of voice. A subtle disorder of orientation may be betrayed by an incorrect response regarding dates (off by more than one day of the month or day of the week), or in misnaming the hospital. The ability to retain a span of digits forward (normally 7) and backward (normally 5), spelling a word such as \u201cworld\u201d or \u201cearth\u201d forward and then backward, reciting the months of the year in their reverse order, and serial subtraction of 3s from 30 or 7s from 100 are useful bedside tests of the patient\u2019s capacity for attentiveness and sustained mental activity, though some of these presuppose that the patient is"

Little-used words from an earlier period of life also tend to be lost. Appointments are forgotten and possessions misplaced. Questions are repeated again and again, the patient having forgotten what was just discussed. It is said that remote memories are preserved and recent ones lost (one of Ribot\u2019s laws of memory), but this is only relatively true and it is difficult to check the accuracy of distant personal memories. For example, Albert and associates, who tested Alzheimer patients\u2019 recognition of dated political events and pictures of prominent people past and present, found that some degree of memory loss extends to all previous decades of the person\u2019s life (neuropsychologic testing is discussed further on)."
