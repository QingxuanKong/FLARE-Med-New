    "question": "A 53-year-old man presents to clinic with a six month history of shoulder pain that is especially bothersome at night. Over the weekend he \"strained his shoulder\" during a pick-up basketball game and reports an acute exacerbation of his pain symptoms. On exam, he complains of pain to palpation just below the acromion. You suspect he has torn his supraspinatus. If correct, which of these functional maneuvers would you expect to be deficient on physical exam?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to understand the anatomy and function of the shoulder joint and the supraspinatus muscle. The supraspinatus muscle is one of the rotator cuff muscles that stabilize the shoulder joint. It is responsible for initiating the initiation of abduction of the humerus at the glenohumeral joint. Given the patient's symptoms of shoulder pain, especially at night, and the physical examination finding of pain to palpation just below the acromion, we suspect that the patient has torn his supraspinatus tendon. This is consistent with the description of supraspinatus tendinitis or tear. Now, let's analyze the options to determine which functional maneuver would be deficient on physical exam. The supraspinatus muscle is responsible for initiating abduction of the humerus, which is the movement of bringing the arm out to the side. Therefore, the correct answer would be related to the initiation of abduction. A. Initiation of adduction - This is the movement of bringing the arm towards the midline of the body, which is not related to the function of the supraspinatus muscle. B. External rotation - This is a movement of rotating the arm outward, which is also not related to the function of the supraspinatus muscle. C. Initiation of abduction - This is the correct answer, as the supraspinatus muscle is responsible for initiating abduction of the humerus. D. Internal rotation - This is the movement of rotating the arm inward, which is not related to the function of the supraspinatus muscle. The final answer is: C. Initiation of abduction\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The pain began after a fall on his outstretched hand approximately 6 months previously. The patient recalled having some minor shoulder tenderness but no other specific symptoms. He was otherwise fit and well. On examination of the shoulder, there was marked wasting of the muscles in the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae. The patient found initiation of abduction difficult and there was a weakness of lateral rotation of the humerus. The wasted muscles were the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The cause of the muscle wasting was disuse. Muscle atrophy (wasting) occurs through a variety of disorders. Disuse atrophy is one of the most common causes. Examples of disuse atrophy include the loss of muscle bulk after fracture immobilization in a plaster cast. The opposite effect can also be demonstrated\u2014when muscles are overused they become bulkier (hypertrophy)."

Subacromial bursitis is a frequent cause of shoulder pain. Anterior to the subacromial bursa, the bicipital tendon traverses the bicipital groove. This tendon is best identified by palpating it in its groove as the patient rotates the humerus internally and externally. Direct pressure over the tendon may reveal pain indicative of bicipital tendinitis.

            "content": "Focused History: BJ reports episodes of exertional chest pain in the last few months, but they were less severe and of short duration. He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

            "content": "Disputed TOS accounts for 95% of patients diagnosed with TOS; chronic arm and shoulder pain are prominent and of unclear cause. The lack of sensitive and specific findings on physical examination or specific markers for this condition results in diagnostic uncertainty. The role of surgery in disputed TOS is controversial. Multidisciplinary pain management is a conservative approach, although treatment is often unsuccessful."

            "content": "Christian L\u00fcscher, MD A 15-year-old high school student is brought to the emergency department after his parents found him in his room staring at the ceiling and visibly frightened. Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

            "content": "Thisconditionischaracterizedbydepositionofcalciumsalts,primarily hydroxyapatite, within a tendon. The exact mechanism of calcification is not known but may be initiated by ischemia or degeneration of the tendon. The supraspinatus tendon is most often affected because it is frequently impinged on and has a reduced blood supply when the arm is abducted. The condition usually develops after age 40. Calcification within the tendon may evoke acute inflammation, producing sudden and severe pain in the shoulder. However, it may be asymptomatic or not related to the patient\u2019s symptoms. Diagnosis of calcific tendonitis can be made by ultrasound or radiograph. Most cases are self-limited and respond to conservative therapy with physical therapy and/or NSAIDs. A subset of patients is refractory and requires ultrasound-guided percutaneous needle aspiration and lavage or surgery."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"
