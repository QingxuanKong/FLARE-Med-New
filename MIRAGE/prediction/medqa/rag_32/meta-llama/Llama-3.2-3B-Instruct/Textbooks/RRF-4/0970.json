    "question": "A 67-year-old man presents with feelings of nervousness and anxiety. He mentions that lately, he has been feeling increasingly restless and is unable to control feelings of nervousness pertaining to all his daily tasks. He noticed that these feelings were more prominent in the last 2 months but have been present on and off for the last year. On many occasions, his mind will be racing with thoughts that keep him up at night. During these moments, he finds his heart racing and feels light-headed and dizzy to the point of blacking out. He has also been experiencing back and neck pain with increased muscle tension in these areas. The patient reports no smoking or alcohol use but mentions that he had tried cocaine and heroin in his 20s and 30s. Which of the following would be the best course of treatment for this patient\u2019s symptoms?",

        "A": "Diazepam",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of nervousness, anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia, which have been present for the past 2 months. The patient also reports experiencing blackouts due to lightheadedness and dizziness. The patient has a history of substance use, including cocaine and heroin, which could be relevant to his current symptoms. The patient's symptoms are suggestive of panic disorder, which is characterized by recurrent panic attacks, often accompanied by anxiety, fear, and avoidance behaviors. The patient's symptoms are also consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), given his history of substance use and the presence of avoidance behaviors. However, the primary diagnosis to consider is panic disorder, given the patient's symptoms of panic attacks and anxiety. The patient's symptoms do not appear to be adequately managed with the options listed, and a more targeted treatment approach is needed. Buspirone is a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic that is often used to treat generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. It has a different pharmacological profile compared to benzodiazepines and is often preferred for long-term treatment due to its lower risk of dependence and withdrawal. Ramelteon is an melatonin receptor agonist used to treat insomnia, and while it may help with sleep, it is not typically used to treat anxiety or panic disorder. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that can be effective for acute anxiety but is not typically used for long-term treatment due to the risk of dependence and withdrawal. Alprazolam is also a benzodiazepine and is not the best choice for long-term treatment due to the same risks. Therefore, buspirone is the most appropriate choice for this patient's symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

In the panic attack, the patient is suddenly overwhelmed by feelings of apprehension, or a fear that he may lose consciousness and die, have a heart attack or stroke, lose his reason or self-control, become insane, or commit some horrible crime. These experiences are accompanied by a series of physiologic reactions, mainly sympathoadrenal hyperactivity, resembling the \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d reaction. Breathlessness, a feeling of suffocation, dizziness, sweating, trembling, palpitation, and precordial or gastric distress are typical but not invariable physical accompaniments.

            "content": "Patient Presentation: BE is a 45-year-old woman who presents with concerns about sudden (paroxysmal), intense, brief episodes of headache, sweating (diaphoresis), and a racing heart (palpitations). Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

Interestingly, the height of the patient and the previous lens surgery would suggest a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and a series of blood tests and review of the family history revealed this was so. A 35-year-old male patient presented to his family practitioner because of recent weight loss (14 lb over the previous 2 months). He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets."

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

By this vague term, the layperson usually refers to a state of restlessness, inner tension, uneasiness, apprehension, irritability, or hyperexcitability. Unfortunately, the term may have a wide range of other connotations, such as a distressing hallucination or paranoid idea, a frankly hysterical outburst, or even tics or tremulousness. Obviously, a careful inquiry as to what the patient means in complaining of nervousness is always a necessary first step in the analysis."

On closer analysis, one observes and hears that many such patients have difficulty initiating activity but also in sustaining it; that is, their endurance is diminished. This condition, of course, is the familiar aftermath of sleeplessness or prolonged mental or physical effort, and, under such circumstances, it is accepted as a normal reaction. When, however, similar symptoms appear without relation to such antecedents, they should be suspected of being the manifestations of"
