She was born with a disease that has led her to have recurrent upper respiratory infections throughout her life requiring antibiotic prophylaxis and chest physiotherapy as well as pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. She marries a man (without this disease phenotype) from a population where the prevalence of this disease is 1/100. What is the chance that their child will have the disease of interest?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To determine the chance that the child will have the disease, we need to consider the genotype of the parents and the mode of inheritance of the disease. The disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that a person needs to inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to express the disease. Let's analyze the situation: * The 21-year-old female has the disease phenotype, which means she is likely homozygous recessive (aa) for the mutated gene. * Her partner (the man) does not have the disease phenotype, which means he is likely homozygous dominant (AA) or heterozygous (Aa) for the mutated gene. * The prevalence of the disease in the population is 1/100, which means the frequency of the mutated gene is 1/100. Since the disease is autosomal recessive, we can use the following genotype-phenotype relationships: * AA or Aa: normal phenotype (not affected) * aa: disease phenotype (affected) Now, let's analyze the possible genotypes of the parents: * The 21-year-old female (homozygous recessive, aa) * The man (heterozygous, Aa or AA) To determine the probability that the child will have the disease, we need to calculate the probability of each possible genotype of the child and then multiply it by the probability of expressing the disease phenotype. Let's assume the man is heterozygous (Aa). * Probability of the man being Aa: 99/100 (since the prevalence of the disease is 1/100) * Probability of the man being AA: 1/100 (since the prevalence of the disease is 1/100) * Probability of the child being aa (homozygous recessive): 25% (1/4) if the man is Aa, since there is a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene from each parent * Probability of the child being Aa (heterozygous): 75% (3/4) if the man is Aa, since there is a 50% chance of inheriting the normal gene from each parent Now, let's calculate the probability of the child expressing the disease phenotype: * Probability of the child being aa (homozygous recessive) and expressing the disease phenotype: 25% (1/4) x 1/100 (probability of the man being AA) = 1/400 * Probability of the child being Aa (heterozygous) and expressing the disease phenotype: 75% (3/4) x 99/100 (probability of the man being Aa) = 0.5625 Since the child cannot be homozygous dominant (AA), the only possible genotype is Aa. Therefore, the probability that the child will have the disease phenotype is 0.5625. To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100: 0.5625 x 100 = 56.25% Since the options are not exact percentages, we can approximate the answer to the nearest whole number. The chance that the child will have the disease is approximately 56%. The final answer in JSON format is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the chance that the child will have the disease, we need to consider the genotype of the parents and the mode of inheritance of the disease.

Assuming the man is heterozygous (Aa), the probability of the child being aa (homozygous recessive) is 25% (1/4), and the probability of the child being Aa (heterozygous) is 75% (3/4).

Disorders of Autosomal Dominant Inheritance Disorders of autosomal dominant inheritance are manifested in the heterozygous state, so at least one parent in an index case usually is affected. Both males and females can be affected, and both sexes can transmit the condition. When an affected person marries an unaffected one, each child has one chance in two of having the disease. The following features also pertain to autosomal dominant diseases: With any autosomal dominant disorder, some patients do not have affected parents. Such patients owe their disorder to new mutations involving either the egg or the sperm from which they were derived. Their siblings are neither affected nor at increased risk for development of the disease."

If both parents are carriers, chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis can help determine whether the fetus has inherited one or both of the parental mutations. Counseling following identification of two disease-causing mutations is challenging, because phenotype prediction is reasonably accurate only for pancreatic disease, and then only for well-characterized mutations. Prognosis is most heavily afected by the degree of pulmonary disease, which varies considerably even among individuals with the most common genotype associated with classic disease, that is, those homozygous for the .F508 mutation. his likely relects the efect of genetic modiiers on protein function, which may further vary depending on the CFTR mutation and on exposure and susceptibility to environmental factors (Cutting, 2005; Drumm, 2005)."

For example, it is common to screen healthy pregnant women (and their partners) for mutations in the CFTR gene, which is mutated in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The goal of this screening is to identify women who are carriers of a CFTR mutation and therefore are at increased risk of having a baby with CF. Because CF is an autosomal recessive disorder, a fetus has a 1:4 chance of being affected if both parents are carriers of disease-causing CFTR mutations. The screening test approach that is commonly used to identify mutations in carriers detects 80\u201385% of all known disease-causing CFTR mutations in Caucasians and up to 97% of mutations among Ashkenazi Jews. A negative screening result therefore does not completely eliminate the possibility that a woman (or her partner) actually has a mutation. What can be inferred from a negative test result is"

Molecular genetic testing is clinically available, initially using sequence analysis of the CP21A2 gene, which encodes the 21-hydroxylase enzyme (Nimkarn, 2016). If this is uninformative, gene-targeted deletion/duplication analy sis is performed, and additional testing such as whole exome sequencing may be considered (Chap. 13, p. 272). A goal of prenatal diagnosis is to limit dexamethasone expo sure in males and in unafected females. Prenatal diagnosis villi-at 10 to 12 weeks' gestation-or on amniocytes after 15 weeks.

In the research setting, cell-free DNA testing using hybridization probes lanking the CP21A2 gene can be efective as early as 5617 weeks' gestation (New, 2014)."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

This rare disorder (1\u20132/million) is due to loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding LPL, an enzyme normally produced in skeletal muscle and required for the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and chylomicrons. Affected individuals have lipemic serum and may have eruptive xanthomas, hepatosplenomegaly, and in some cases, recurrent bouts of acute pancreatitis. Clinical trials demonstrated the safety of intramuscular injection of AAV-LPL and its efficacy in reducing frequency of pancreatitis episodes in affected individuals, leading to drug approval in Europe. Additional clinical trials currently under way that use AAV vectors in the setting of genetic disease include those for muscular dystrophies, \u03b11 antitrypsin deficiency, Parkinson\u2019s disease, Batten\u2019s disease, hemophilia B,"

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the standard treatment for patients presenting at <2 years of age who appear to have or are at risk for neurologic degeneration. HSCT results in stabilization of CNS disease and reverses hepatosplenomegaly. It also beneficially affects cardiac and respiratory disease. HSCT does not eliminate corneal disease or result in the resolution of progressive skeletal disease. Enzyme therapy effectively addresses hepatosplenomegaly and alleviates cardiac and respiratory disease. The enzyme does not effectively penetrate the CNS and does not directly affect CNS disease. Enzyme therapy and HSCT appear to have similar effects on visceral signs and symptoms. Enzyme therapy poses a lower risk of life-threatening complications and may therefore be advantageous for patients who have attenuated manifestations without CNS disease. A combination of enzyme therapy and HSCT has been used, with enzyme"

Disease onset is within the first 6 months, and afected children die of respiratory failure by age 2 years. Type II generally has onset before age 2 years, and the age at death can range from 2 years to the third decade of life. Type III also presents before age 2 years, with disease severity that is milder and more variable. Type IV does not present until adulthood."
