    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with fatigue, swelling of legs and feet, puffiness in the mornings, frothy urine, pallor, periorbital edema, pedal edema, ascites, swan-neck deformities, nodules of multiple fingers, and restricted range of motion of bilateral knee joints. Laboratory studies show anemia (Hemoglobin 8.2 mg/dl), elevated alkaline phosphatase (120 U/L), and proteinuria (Protein 3+). The patient has a history of chronic alcohol abuse, rheumatoid factor-positive rheumatoid arthritis, and is taking methotrexate and ibuprofen. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are suggestive of a systemic condition that affects multiple organ systems. The presence of swan-neck deformities and nodules of multiple fingers is particularly indicative of amyloidosis. The patient's anemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and proteinuria also support this diagnosis. The most likely cause of this patient's findings is the deposition of amyloid proteins in various tissues, leading to organ dysfunction. The patient's history of chronic alcohol abuse increases the risk of secondary amyloidosis. The presence of rheumatoid factor-positive rheumatoid arthritis also supports this diagnosis, as rheumatoid arthritis can be a cause of primary amyloidosis. The correct answer is C. Renal deposition of AL amyloid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

On physical examination, the patient was alert, extubated, and thirsty. Weight was 97.5 kg. Urine output for the previous 24 h had been 3.4 L, with an IV intake of 2 L/d of D5W."

His blood urate was 8.5 mg/dl (reference = 2.5\u20138.0). The unusually young age of presentation is suggestive of an enzymopathy of purine metabolism, and additional blood tests are ordered. Diagnosis: IR has gout (MSU crystal deposition disease), a type of inflammatory arthritis. Treatment: IR was given prescriptions for allopurinol and colchicine. The treatment goals are to reduce his blood urate levels to <6.0 mg/dl and prevent additional attacks. He was advised to lose weight because being overweight or obese is a risk factor for gout. His BMI of 31 puts him in the obese category. He was also given written information on the association between diet and gout. Prognosis: Gout increases the risk of developing renal stones. It is also associated with hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease."

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria.

The febrile stage lasts 3 or 4 days and is identified by the abrupt onset of fever, headache, severe myalgia, thirst, anorexia, and often nausea and vomiting. Photophobia, retroorbital pain, and pain on ocular movement are common, and the vision may become blurred with ciliary body inflammation. Flushing over the face, the V area of the neck, and the back is characteristic, as are pharyngeal injection, periorbital edema, and conjunctival suffusion. Petechiae often develop in areas of pressure, the conjunctivae, and the axillae. Back pain and tenderness to percussion at the costovertebral angle reflect massive retroperitoneal edema. Laboratory evidence of mild to moderate DIC is present. Other laboratory findings of HFRS include proteinuria and active urinary sediment. The hypotensive stage lasts from a few hours to 48 h and begins with falling blood pressure and sometimes shock. The relative bradycardia typical of the febrile"
