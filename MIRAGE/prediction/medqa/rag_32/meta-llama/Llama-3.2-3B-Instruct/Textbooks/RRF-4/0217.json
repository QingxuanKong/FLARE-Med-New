She has had spotting during the last 3 days. Her medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 89/65 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a dilated cervical os and a uterus consistent in size with an 11-week gestation. Ultrasonography shows an embryo of 4 cm in crown-rump length and no fetal cardiac activity.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with vaginal bleeding and dull suprapubic pain at 12 weeks' gestation, with a dilated cervical os and a uterus consistent in size with an 11-week gestation. Ultrasonography shows an embryo of 4 cm in crown-rump length and no fetal cardiac activity. This suggests a nonviable pregnancy. The patient's symptoms and ultrasonography results are consistent with a diagnosis of a missed abortion or a nonviable pregnancy. The next step in management would be to perform a dilation and curettage (D\\&C) to evacuate the nonviable pregnancy and manage any potential complications. Misoprostol therapy is not indicated for evacuation of a nonviable pregnancy, and methotrexate therapy is typically used for medical management of early pregnancy loss (up to 49 days' gestation). Complete bed rest is not an appropriate management strategy for a nonviable pregnancy. Options B and C are incorrect because methotrexate therapy is not indicated for evacuation of a nonviable pregnancy, and dilation and curettage is the appropriate procedure for evacuation of a nonviable pregnancy. Option D is incorrect because complete bed rest is not an appropriate management strategy for a nonviable pregnancy. The correct answer is C. Dilation and curettage is the most appropriate next step in management in this scenario. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

With a living viable-aged fetus, and with vaginal delivery not imminent, emergency cesarean delivery is chosen by most. In some women, fetal compromise will be evident as shown in Figure 41-19. When evaluating fetal status, sonographic conirmation of fetal heart activity may be necessary because sometimes an electrode applied directly to a dead fetus will provide misleading information by recording the maternal heart rate. If the fetus has died or if it is not considered suiciently mature to live outside the uterus, then FIGURE 41-19 Placental abruption with fetal compromise.

Labs show markedly \u2191 serum \u03b2-hCG (usually > 100,000 mIU/mL), and pelvic ultrasound reveals a \u201csnowstorm\u201d appearance with no gestational sac or fetus present (see Figure 2.11-9).

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

Bleeding and cramping with medical termination typically is signiicantly worse than with menses. Thus, adequate analgesia, usually including a narcotic, is provided. If bleeding soaks two or more pads per hour for at least 2 hours, the woman is instructed to contact her provider to determine whether she needs to be seen . At the follow-up appointment, routine postabortal sonographic examination is typically unnecessary (Clark, 2010). Instead, assessment of the clinical course along with bimanual pelvic examination is recommended. If sonography is indicated TABLE 18-7.

The yolk sac can normally be seen by the middle of the ifth week. As shown in Figure 9-3, after 6 weeks, an embryo is seen as a linear structure immediately adjacent to the yolk sac. Cardiac motion is typically noted at this point. Up to 12 weeks' gestation, the crown-rump length is predictive of gestational age within 4 days (Chap. 10, p. 183). Prenatal care is ideally initiated early. Major goals are to: (1) deine the health status of the mother and fetus, (2) estimate the gestational age, and (3) initiate a plan for continued obstetrical care. Typical components of the initial visit are summarized in Table Subsequent care may range from relatively infrequent routine visits to prompt hospitalization because of serious maternal or fetal disease."

The distinction from missed or inevitable abortion requires ultrasound documentation of an intrauterine embryo or fetus with cardiac activity. The bleeding is usually light and may be associated with mild lower abdominal or cramping pain. The differential diagnosis in these patients includes consideration of possible cervical polyps, vaginitis, cervical carcinoma, gestational trophoblastic disease, ectopic pregnancy, trauma, and foreign body. On physical examination, the abdomen usually is not tender, and the cervix is closed. Bleeding can be seen coming from the os, and usually there is no cervical motion or adnexal tenderness."

As listed in Table 18-3, absence of an embryo in a sac with a mean sac diameter (MSD) ::25 mm signiies a dead fetus (Fig. 18-1). Fetal cardiac activity can typically be detected at 6 to 6.5 weeks with a crown-rump length (CL) of 1 to 5 mm and an MSD of 13 to 18 mm (Goldstein, 1992; Levi, 1990). A threshold CL ::7 mm with absent cardiac activity is also used to diagnose nonviability (Doubilet, 2013). Preisler and associates (2015) implemented the guidelines in Table 18-3 and conirmed' these CL and MSD thresholds.

The mean of three discrete measurements is used. Until 136/7 weeks' gestation, the CL is accurate to within 5 to 7 days (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 201 7b)."
