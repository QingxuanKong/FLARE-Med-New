    "question": "A 20-day-old child is brought to the emergency department by her parents. They are concerned about lethargy and easy bruising. Her mother reports that she has been eating less for the past few days. Today she was difficult to arouse. She normally nurses four-five times a day, but ate less yesterday and this morning. The girl was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery at home with minimal prenatal or postnatal care. This is her first visit to a physician of any type. The family is carefully questioned and child abuse is ruled out. The daughter\u2019s pulse is 97/min, respirations are 35/min, temperature is 35.8\u00b0C (96.4\u00b0F), and blood pressure is 71/46 mm Hg. Physical examination shows diffuse petechiae and bruising. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",

        "A": "Group B streptococcus (GBS) infection",
        "B": "Hepatitis B infection",
        "C": "Thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the symptoms and physical examination findings presented in the scenario. The 20-day-old child is lethargic, has easy bruising, and has been eating less for the past few days. The child is also having trouble nursing, which could indicate a problem with milk production or absorption. The physical examination shows diffuse petechiae and bruising, which suggests a bleeding disorder. Considering these findings, we need to think about potential causes that could explain these symptoms. Group B streptococcus (GBS) infection is a possibility, but it is typically associated with symptoms such as fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Hepatitis B infection is unlikely in a newborn, and thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency would not cause easy bruising or petechiae. Vitamin K deficiency could cause easy bruising and petechiae, but it would not explain the lethargy or difficulty nursing. The most likely cause of these symptoms is vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB), which is a known complication of newborns who have not received vitamin K at birth. VKDB can occur when the newborn has not received vitamin K prophylaxis, which is typically given to newborns within the first 24 hours of life to prevent VKDB. The child was born at home with minimal prenatal or postnatal care, which may have contributed to the lack of vitamin K administration. The symptoms of VKDB include lethargy, easy bruising, petechiae, and difficulty nursing, which are all consistent with the presentation in this scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}}",

The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

It is estimated that 1% to 2% of children are physically abused during childhood and that approximately 1500 children are fatally injured each year. Although mothers are most frequently reported as the perpetrators of physical abuse, serious injuries, such as head or abdominal trauma, are more likely to be inflicted by fathers or maternal boyfriends. The diagnosis of physical abuse can be made easily if the child is battered, has obvious external injuries, or is capable of providing a history of the abuse. In many cases, the diagnosis is not obvious. The history provided by the parent is often inaccurate because the parent is unwilling to provide the correct history or is a nonoffending parent who is unaware of the abuse. The child may be too young or ill to provide a history of the assault. An older child may be too scared to do so or may have a strong sense of loyalty to the perpetrator."

Labora-tory analyses of blood drawn within an hour of her admission reveal abnormal liver function as indicated by the increased indices: alkaline phosphatase 302 (41\u2013133),* alanine amino-transferase (ALT) 351 (7\u201356),* aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1045 (0\u201335),* bilirubin 3.33 mg/dL (0.1\u20131.2),* and pro-thrombin time of 19.8 seconds (11\u201315).* In addition, plasma bicarbonate is reduced, and she has ~45% reduced glomerular filtration rate from the normal value"

Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image).

A 60-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department with acute right-sided weakness, predominantly in the upper limb, which lasted for 24 hours. She made an uneventful recovery, but was extremely concerned about the nature of her illness and went to see her local doctor. A diagnosis of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) was made. A TIA is a neurological deficit resolving within 24 hours. It is a type of stroke. Neurological deficits may be permanent or transient. Most transient events resolve within 21 days; any failure of resolution beyond 21 days is an established stroke. An investigation into the cause of the TIA was undertaken. Eighty-five percent of all strokes result from cerebral infarction, of which most are due to embolization. A duplex Doppler scan of the carotid vessels was performed."

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."
