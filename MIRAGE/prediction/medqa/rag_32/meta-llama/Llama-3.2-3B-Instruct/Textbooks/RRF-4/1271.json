    "question": "A 19-year-old man is brought to the physician by his mother because she is worried about his strange behavior. Over the past 3 years, he has been dressing all in black and wears a long black coat, even in the summer. The mother reports that her son has always had difficulties fitting in. He does not have any friends and spends most of his time in his room playing online games. He is anxious at college because he is uncomfortable around other people, and his academic performance is poor. Rather than doing his coursework, he spends most of his time reading up on paranormal phenomena, especially demons. He says that he has never seen any demons, but sometimes there are signs of their presence. For example, a breeze in an enclosed room is likely the \u201cbreath of a demon\u201d. Mental status examination shows laborious speech. The patient avoids eye contact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

He has difficulties fitting in, lacks social skills, and spends most of his time playing online games in his room, which indicates social isolation.\\n\\nHe is anxious around other people and has poor academic performance, which may be related to his social anxiety or difficulties with social interactions. Instead of doing his coursework, he spends most of his time reading up on paranormal phenomena, especially demons, which suggests an unusual preoccupation with a specific topic.\\n\\nThe patient's mental status examination shows laborious speech and avoids eye contact, which are also indicative of social anxiety or difficulties with social interactions.\\n\\nConsidering these symptoms, we can evaluate the options as follows:\\n\\nA. Social anxiety disorder: While the patient does exhibit social anxiety, the presence of delusions about demons and a preoccupation with paranormal phenomena are not typical symptoms of social anxiety disorder.\\n\\nB. Avoidant personality disorder: The patient's difficulties with social interactions and avoidance of social situations are consistent with avoidant personality disorder. However, the presence of delusions and a preoccupation with paranormal phenomena are not typical symptoms of this disorder.\\n\\nC. Schizotypal personality disorder: The patient's eccentric behavior, preoccupation with paranormal phenomena, and delusions about demons are consistent with schizotypal personality disorder. This disorder is characterized by a pattern of eccentric behavior, anomalies of thinking and speech, and a pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others.\\n\\nD. Schizophrenia: While the patient exhibits some symptoms that could be consistent with schizophrenia, such as delusions and social withdrawal, the presence of a preoccupation with paranormal phenomena and eccentric behavior is not typical of schizophrenia.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the most likely diagnosis is schizotypal personality disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The patient is inattentive and unable to perceive the elements of his situation. He may talk incessantly and incoherently, and look distressed and perplexed; his expression may be in keeping with vague notions of being annoyed or threatened by someone. From his manner and the content of speech, it is evident that he misinterprets the meaning of ordinary objects and sounds, misidentifies the people around him, and is experiencing vivid visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations, often of a most unpleasant type. At first the patient can be brought into touch with reality and may identify the examiner and answer other questions correctly; but almost at once he relapses into a preoccupied, confused state, giving incorrect answers and being unable to think coherently. As the process evolves, the patient cannot shake off his hallucinations and is unable to make meaningful responses"

This may appear before the more obvious memory or language defects announce themselves. The patient becomes convinced that relatives are stealing his possessions or that an elderly and even infirm spouse is guilty of infidelity. He may hide his belongings, even relatively worthless ones, and go about spying on family members. Hostilities arise, and wills may be altered irrationally. Many of these patients are constantly worried, tense, and agitated. Of course, paranoid delusions may be part of a depressive psychosis and of other dementias, but most of the elderly patients in whom paranoia is the presenting problem, seem not to be depressed, and their cognitive functions are for a time relatively well preserved.

When such patients are calmed by reassurance and encouraged to try harder, their mental function improves, indicating that intellectual deterioration has not occurred. Conversely, it is helpful to remember that demented patients in the mid-stages of the process infrequently have sufficient insight to complain of mental deterioration; if they admit to poor memory, they do so without conviction or full appreciation of the degree of their disability. The physician must not rely on the patient\u2019s statements alone in gauging the efficiency of mental function and should seek corroboration from family members. Yet another problem is that of the impulsive, cantankerous, and quarrelsome patient who is a constant source of distress to employer and family.

They are initiated by autophosphorylation of select tyrosine residues in their receptors. C. They are mediated by binding to adrenergic receptors, which are a class of nuclear receptors. D. They result in the activation of glycogen and triacylglycerol synthesis. Q3. NE bound to certain receptors causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. Why might NE be used clinically in the treatment of septic shock?

Focused History: AZ\u2019s father reports that the boy has always been quite sensitive to the sun.

He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

A simple amalgam will suffice\u2014that of a middle-aged man of uneasy, brooding, asocial, eccentric nature who gradually develops a dominating idea or belief of his own importance, of having in his possession special powers that make him the envy of others who become bent on persecuting him. As the delusion grows, he becomes more preoccupied, less efficient, and increasingly suspicious of others, with a tendency to interpret every one of their words, gestures, or actions as having some reference to himself. On examining such a person, one is impressed with his capacity for careful reasoning, even betraying good intelligence. Whatever the delusional theme\u2014erotomanic (a delusion that another person, usually of higher status, is in love with the patient), grandiose, jealous, persecutory, or somatic, the last being the most common\u2014the patient\u2019s arguments are logical and buttressed cogently by"
