    "question": "A 7-day-old infant boy presents to an emergency department due to poor feeding. His parents are recent immigrants to the United States. He was born in a traditional home birth and has never seen a medical provider. Mom had no prenatal care, has no medical issues, and is unvaccinated. The baby had been breastfeeding well until 24 hours ago when mom noticed he started having trouble latching. In the last 12 hours, he has completely refused to feed. He has had a decreased number of wet diapers and has stooled twice in the last 24 hours. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C), pulse is 180/min, respirations are 52/min, and blood pressure is 70/50 mmHg. On exam, the infant has increased tone, a clenched jaw, no head lag, and clenched hands. Initial screening bloodwork is normal. What is the most likely organism causing this infant's presentation?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with poor feeding, decreased wet diapers, and stooled twice in the last 24 hours, which are classic symptoms of neonatal sepsis. The infant's high pulse rate (180/min), respiratory rate (52/min), and low blood pressure (70/50 mmHg) also suggest sepsis. The physical examination findings of increased tone, clenched jaw, and clenched hands are consistent with tetanus. The patient's history of recent immunization and vaccination is not provided, but it is unlikely that the infant would be unvaccinated against tetanus. The most likely organism causing this infant's presentation is Clostridium tetani, which is the causative agent of tetanus. The patient's symptoms are consistent with tetanus infection, which can occur in neonates, particularly those who have not been vaccinated against the disease. The patient's symptoms of poor feeding, abdominal rigidity, and muscle spasms are classic signs of tetanus infection. The patient's lack of response to feeding and decreased wet diapers also suggest a systemic infection. The patient's high pulse rate and low blood pressure also suggest sepsis, which is a common complication of tetanus infection in neonates.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

If the fetus was infected in utero, there may be depression and acidosis at birth for no apparent reason. The neonate may suck poorly, vomit, or show abdominal distention. Respiratory insuiciency can develop, which may present similarly to idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome. he neonate may be lethargic or jittery. he response to sepsis may be hypothermia rather than hyperthermia, and the total leukocyte and neutrophil counts may be depressed."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula.

Knowing the mother\u2019s risk factors enables the delivery room team to anticipate problems that may occur after birth. The history of a woman\u2019s labor and delivery can reveal events that might lead to complications affecting either the mother or the neonate, even when the pregnancy was previously considered low risk. Anticipating the need to resuscitate a newborn as a result of fetal distress increases the likelihood of successful resuscitation."

This team readies equipment, ensures that adequate personnel are present, delegates roles and responsibilities, and considers contingency plans to stabilize the newborn. Four questions a neonatal provider will ask pertain to expected gestional age, amnionic fluid color, fetal number, and additional fetal risks. Several conditions are associated with a nonvigorous presentation. These may include immaturity, hypoxemia or acidosis from any cause, sepsis syndrome, recent drugs administered to the mother, and central nervous system developmental abnormalities. Those related to the respiratory tract are lung abnormalities, upper airway obstruction, pneumothorax, and meconium aspiration."
