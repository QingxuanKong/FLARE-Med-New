His temperature today is 37.5\u00b0C (98.5\u00b0F). An MRI of the brain shows bilateral ventricular enlargement and enlargement of the subarachnoid space.

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the symptoms and the MRI findings of the patient. The patient has been experiencing headaches for 2 weeks, which are worse in the morning and accompanied by nausea and vomiting. This pattern of symptoms is suggestive of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The patient's past medical history of being treated for fever, irritability, and neck rigidity with antibiotics one month ago suggests a possible complication of meningitis, which can cause long-term effects on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics. The MRI findings of bilateral ventricular enlargement and enlargement of the subarachnoid space are indicative of hydrocephalus, which is a condition characterized by an accumulation of CSF and increased ICP. The most likely explanation for the patient's condition is impaired CSF drainage into the subarachnoid space, which is a common cause of hydrocephalus. This can occur due to scarring or blockage of the CSF pathways, such as the arachnoid granulations, which are responsible for CSF absorption. The other options are less likely explanations for the patient's condition. Increased CSF production by the choroid plexus would not lead to hydrocephalus, impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations could be a possible cause, but it is not the most likely explanation given the patient's history and symptoms. Impaired CSF drainage into the fourth ventricle is also not a common cause of hydrocephalus in this context. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Acute, severe headache with stiff neck and fever suggests meningitis. LP is mandatory. Often there is striking accentuation of pain with eye movement.

Usually the onset is acute and the temperature is elevated, from 38 to 40\u00b0C (100.4 to 104\u00b0F). Headache that is more severe than that associated with other febrile states is the most frequent symptom. A variable but usually mild degree of lethargy, irritability, and drowsiness may occur. Photophobia and pain on movement of the eyes are common additional complaints. Stiffness of the neck and spine on forward bending attests to the presence of meningeal irritation (meningismus), but at first it may be so slight as to pass unnoticed.

Most cases turn out to be idiopathic. Wijdicks and colleagues confirmed that thunderclap headache is usually a benign condition; among 71 patients followed for more than 3 years they found no serious cerebrovascular lesions. For this reason, these idiopathic thunderclap headaches have been presumed by some workers to be a form of migraine (\u201ccrash migraine\u201d).

            "content": "Patients with cough or strain headache will only occasionally be found to have serious intracranial disease; when present, particularly if a first attack, subarachnoid hemorrhage may be suspected. In other infrequent cases, this type of headache has been traced to lesions of the posterior fossa and foramen magnum, arteriovenous malformation, subdural hematoma, Chiari malformation, or tumor. It may be necessary, therefore, to supplement the neurologic examination by appropriate lumbar puncture, CT and MRI. Far more common, of course, are the temporal and maxillary pains that are caused by dental or sinus disease, which may also be worsened by coughing."

            "content": "A 76-year-old retired banker complains of a shuffling gait with occasional falls over the last year. He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

Associated symptoms/signs: Significant findings include fever or rash (consider meningitis or other infectious causes), jaw claudication (specific for temporal arteritis), or constitutional symptoms such as weight loss (associated with neoplastic, in\ufb02ammatory, or infectious conditions). Photophobia, nausea, and vomiting are associated with migraine, aneurysmal SAH, and meningitis, but neck stiffness is more likely to accompany the latter two. Neurologic sequelae: Look for diplopia, mental status changes or associated symptoms (numbness, weakness, dizziness, ataxia, visual disturbances), papilledema, or pupillary abnormalities (partial CN III palsy or Horner\u2019s syndrome). Patient risk factors: High-risk patients are > 50 years of age, immunocompromised, or with preexisting malignancy. If SAH is suspected, obtain a head CT without contrast. If CT is , LP is mandatory. Obtain a CBC."
