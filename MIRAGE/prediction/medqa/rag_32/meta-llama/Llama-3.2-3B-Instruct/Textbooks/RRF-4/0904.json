    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient is a 7-year-old boy presenting with progressively worsening swelling around the eyes, moderate periorbital edema, and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities bilaterally. This suggests a condition affecting the kidneys, leading to fluid retention and edema. 2. **History**: The boy had a sore throat and cough 2 weeks ago that resolved spontaneously. This could be a triggering event for an immune-mediated reaction. 3. **Kidney Biopsy Findings**: The kidney biopsy shows effacement of the podocytes on electron microscopy. Podocytes are specialized cells in the glomeruli of the kidneys that play a crucial role in filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood. Effacement of these cells suggests a condition affecting the glomeruli. Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is **Nephrotic Syndrome**, which is characterized by heavy proteinuria (loss of large amounts of protein in the urine), hypoalbuminemia (low levels of albumin in the blood), hyperlipidemia (elevated levels of lipids in the blood), and edema (swelling due to fluid retention). Now, let's consider the options provided for the urinalysis findings: A. **Hyaline casts and immunoglobulins**: Hyaline casts are a common finding in normal urine and can also be seen in conditions like acute tubular necrosis. Immunoglobulins are not typically associated with the clinical presentation. B. **Fatty casts and albumin**: Fatty casts are seen in conditions like nephrotic syndrome, where there is significant proteinuria. The presence of albumin in the urine (albuminuria) is a hallmark of nephrotic syndrome. C. **White blood cell casts and eosinophils**: White blood cell casts are indicative of an inflammatory process, and eosinophils can be seen in conditions like vasculitis. This combination is not typical for nephrotic syndrome. D. **Granular casts and tubular epithelial cells**: Granular casts can be seen in various conditions, including acute tubular necrosis. Tubular epithelial cells can be seen in conditions like acute tubular necrosis or acute interstitial nephritis. **Conclusion**: Based on the clinical presentation, history, and kidney biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is nephrotic syndrome. The presence of **fatty casts and albumin** in the urine is consistent with this diagnosis. **Answer Choice**: B. Fatty casts and albumin.",

In its more subtle form, edema may be detected by noting that after the stethoscope is removed from the chest wall, the rim of the bell leaves an indentation on the skin of the chest for a few minutes. Edema may be present when the ring on a finger fits more snugly than in the past or when a patient complains of difficulty putting on shoes, particularly in the evening. Edema may also be recognized by puffiness of the face, which is most readily apparent in the periorbital areas. The differences among the major causes of generalized edema are shown in Table 50-1. Cardiac, renal, hepatic, or nutritional disorders are responsible for a majority of patients with generalized edema. Consequently, the differential diagnosis of generalized edema should be directed toward identifying or excluding these several conditions."

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?"

Review of the past history and growth chart demonstrates normal birth weight and birth length, but a progressive decrease in height per-centiles relative to age-matched normal ranges starting at 6 months of age, and orthostasis with febrile illnesses. Physical examination demonstrates short stature and mild generalized obesity. Genital examination reveals descended but small testes and a phallic length of \u20132 SD. Laboratory evaluations demonstrate growth hormone (GH) deficiency and a delayed bone age of 18 months.

On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

            "content": "The physician will be aided in the pursuit of an explanation for the lymphadenopathy by a careful medical history, physical examination, selected laboratory tests, and perhaps an excisional lymph node biopsy. The medical history should reveal the setting in which lymphadenopathy is occurring. Symptoms such as sore throat, cough, fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, or pain in the nodes should be sought. The patient\u2019s age, sex, occupation, exposure to pets, sexual behavior, and use of drugs such as diphenylhydantoin are other important historic points. For example, children and young adults usually have benign (i.e., nonmalignant) disorders that account for the observed lymphadenopathy such as viral or bacterial upper respiratory infections; infectious mononucleosis; toxoplasmosis; and, in some countries, tuberculosis. In contrast, after age 50, the incidence of malignant disorders increases and that of benign disorders decreases."

The onset of fever is followed by conjunctival erythema; mucosal changes, including dry, cracked lips and a strawberry tongue; cervical lymphadenopathy; and swelling of the hands and feet (Fig. 88-1). Conjunctivitis is bilateral, bulbar, and nonsuppurative. Cervical lymphadenopathy is found in 70% of children and should be greater than 1.5 cm in diameter for the purposes of diagnosis. A rash, which can vary in appearance, occurs in 80% of children with KD and may be particularly accentuated in the inguinal area and on the chest. Extreme irritability is prominent, especially in infants. Abdominal pain and hydrops of the gallbladder, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, sterile pyuria, and arthritis, particularly of medium-sized to large joints, may occur. Carditis in the acute phase may be manifested by tachycardia, shortness of breath, or overt congestive"

Patients with this condition present with nonspecific findings. Most patients are diagnosed after ure-teral obstruction. Patients may complain of dull or acute back or flank pain. Systemic complaints include anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, fever, and malaise. Decreased urinary out-put may ensue if the ureters become fibrotic. Because of renal artery impingement, patients are commonly hypertensive on exam. Other physical exam findings include lower extremity edema and diminished lower extremity pulses if the vessels of the lower extremities are compressed. New hydrocele or varico-cele can also be associated with fibrosis of the retroperitoneum. Laboratory analysis is also nonspecific. If there is renal obstruc-tion, patients may have elevated serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive pro-tein is elevated in most"
