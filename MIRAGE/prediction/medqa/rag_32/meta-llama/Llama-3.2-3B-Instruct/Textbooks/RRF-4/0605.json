    "question": "A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by police. He was found at a local celebration acting very strangely and was reported by other patrons of the event. The patient is very anxious and initially is hesitant to answer questions. He denies any substance use and states that he was just trying to have a good time. The patient's responses are slightly delayed and he seems to have difficulty processing his thoughts. The patient tells you he feels very anxious and asks for some medication to calm him down. The patient has a past medical history of psoriasis which is treated with topical steroids. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. On physical exam, you note an anxious young man. HEENT exam reveals a dry mouth and conjunctival injection. Neurological exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with normal strength and sensation in his upper and lower extremities. Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia, and pulmonary exam is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely intoxication in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Alcohol",
        "B": "Marijuana",
        "C": "Cocaine",

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely intoxication in this patient, let's analyze the symptoms and signs presented: 1. The patient is anxious and hesitant to answer questions, which could be indicative of a sedative or depressant effect. 2. The patient denies any substance use, but the symptoms could still be consistent with a substance-induced intoxication. 3. The patient has a dry mouth and conjunctival injection, which could be consistent with the use of certain substances. 4. The patient has a history of psoriasis treated with topical steroids, which could be relevant to the patient's behavior and physical exam findings. 5. The patient's physical exam reveals tachycardia, which could be consistent with the use of certain stimulants. Considering these points, the most likely intoxication in this patient is Phencyclidine (PCP). PCP is a dissociative anesthetic that can cause anxiety, agitation, and tachycardia, as well as a dry mouth and conjunctival injection. It can also cause hallucinations and altered perception, which could be consistent with the patient's slightly delayed responses and difficulty processing thoughts. Additionally, PCP can cause a range of other symptoms, including hypertension, which is present in this patient. The other options are less likely: A. Alcohol: While alcohol can cause anxiety and tachycardia, it is less likely to cause the patient's other symptoms, such as dry mouth and conjunctival injection. B. Marijuana: Marijuana is less likely to cause the patient's symptoms, including tachycardia and dry mouth. C. Cocaine: Cocaine can cause anxiety and tachycardia, but it is less likely to cause the patient's other symptoms, including dry mouth and conjunctival injection. D. Phencyclidine: As discussed above, PCP is the most likely intoxication in this patient due to the combination of symptoms and signs presented. answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

            "content": "A 66-year-old obese Caucasian man presented to an academic Diabetes Center for advice regarding his diabetes treatment. His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

The patient is afebrile and normotensive but anxious, tachycardic, and markedly tachy-pneic. Auscultation of the chest reveals diffuse wheezes. The physician provisionally makes the diagnosis of bronchial asthma and administers epinephrine by intramuscular injec-tion, improving the patient\u2019s breathing over several minutes. A normal chest X-ray is subsequently obtained, and the medical history is remarkable only for mild hypertension that is being treated with propranolol. The physician instructs the patient to discontinue use of propranolol, and changes the patient\u2019s antihypertensive medication to verapamil. Why is the physician correct to discontinue propranolol? Why is verapamil a better choice for managing hypertension in this patient? What alternative treatment change might the physi-cian consider?"

The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy. One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC). He undergoes surgical resection and is found to have high-risk stage III CRC with five positive lymph nodes. After surgery, he feels entirely well with no symptoms. Of note, he has no other illnesses. What is this patient\u2019s overall prognosis? Based on his prognosis, what"

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

Between 8:30 and approximately midnight, he and several other pledges consumed beer and a bottle of whiskey, and then he consumed most of a bottle of rum at the urging of upperclassmen. The young man complained of feeling nau-seated, lay down on a couch, and began to lose conscious-ness. Two upperclassmen carried him to a bedroom, placed him on his stomach, and positioned a trash can nearby. Approximately 10 minutes later, the freshman was found unconscious and covered with vomit. There was a delay in treatment because the upperclassmen called the college police instead of calling 911. After the call was transferred to 911, emergency medical technicians responded quickly and discovered that the young man was not breathing and that he had choked on his vomit. He was rushed to the hospital, where he remained in a coma for 2 days before ultimately being pronounced dead. The"

If the patient is unobservant or imprecise in descriptions, a helpful tactic is to provoke sensations by rapid rotation, or by asking the patient to stoop for a minute and straighten up; having him stand relaxed for 3 min and checking his blood pressure for orthostatic effect; and, particularly, having him hyperventilate for 3 min. Should the patient be unable to distinguish among these several types of induced dizziness or to ascertain the similarity of one of the types to his own condition, the history is probably too inaccurate for purposes of diagnosis."

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian"
