The patient recently completed a cycle of chemotherapy with vincristine, a well-known cause of peripheral neuropathy. The mechanism of vincristine-induced neuropathy is related to its effect on microtubules, which are essential for axonal transport and maintenance of neuronal structure. Vincristine binds to tubulin, a protein component of microtubules, and inhibits its polymerization, leading to disruption of axonal transport and neuronal damage. This is consistent with option A, inhibition of beta-tubulin polymerization. Options B, C, and D are not directly related to the mechanism of vincristine-induced neuropathy. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's peripheral neuropathy is inhibition of beta-tubulin polymerization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Response of this condition to antiretrovirals has been variable, perhaps because antiretrovirals are responsible for the problem in some instances.

With the dose regimens currently used, the weakness is usually mild, but in the past, some patients became quadriparetic and bedbound. Adults are more severely affected than are children, as are persons with preexisting polyneuropathies.

Cranial nerves are affected less frequently, but ptosis and lateral rectus, facial, and vocal cord palsies have been observed. Autonomic nervous system function may also be affected: constipation and impotence are frequent complications; orthostatic hypotension, atonicity of the bladder, and adynamic ileus are less frequent. The polyneuropathy caused by vincristine is described more fully in Chap. 43. Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and seizures have been reported but are uncommon."

Potential complications are a direct needle spike of the branches of the brachial plexus, damage to the axillary artery, and inadvertent arterial injection of the local anesthetic. Fortunately, these are rare in skilled hands. A 35-year-old woman comes to her physician complaining of tingling and numbness in the fingertips of the first, second, and third digits (thumb, index, and middle fingers). The symptoms were provoked by arm extension. Local anesthesia was also present around the base of the thenar eminence. The problem was diagnosed as median nerve compression."

            "content": "Some patients who have taken phenytoin for decades may lose ankle and patellar reflexes and acquire mild distal symmetrical impairment of sensation, slowed conduction velocity in the peripheral nerves of the legs and rarely, weakness of the distal musculature. The mechanism and frequency of this complication are not clear. The cholesterol-lowering statin drugs have been tentatively implicated in a painful, paresthetic distal axonal polyneuropathy with retained reflexes (Gaist et al) but the evidence for this association is not strong; sometimes a period off the drug or a change to an alternative agent is all that can be tried but it should not preclude a search for alternative causes. More often the problem with statins is one of a toxic myopathy. Colchicine has long been known to cause a myopathy, but a few cases of predominantly axonal sensory neuropathy have also been reported (neuromyopathy)."
