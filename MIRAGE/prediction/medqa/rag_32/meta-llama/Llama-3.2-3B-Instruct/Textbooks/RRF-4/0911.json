    "question": "A previously healthy 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of depressed mood and fatigue. During this time, she has had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight gain. She reports trouble concentrating at her job as a preschool teacher and has missed work several times in recent weeks due to generalized fatigue. She has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 10 years and is actively trying to quit smoking. A drug is prescribed that will treat the patient's mood disturbance and support smoking cessation. This patient should be counseled about which of the following possible side effects of this drug?",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Based on the patient's symptoms and history, I will analyze the situation step by step: 1. The patient is a 27-year-old woman with a 2-month history of depressed mood and fatigue, which has caused her to gain 5 kg (11 lb) and miss work several times due to generalized fatigue. 2. She has a history of smoking 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 10 years and is actively trying to quit. 3. The patient is prescribed a drug that treats both her mood disturbance and supports smoking cessation. Given the combination of smoking cessation and mood treatment, the most likely prescribed medication is bupropion (Zyban), which is an antidepressant that also helps with smoking cessation. Now, let's consider the potential side effects of bupropion: A. Hypotension - Not a common side effect of bupropion. B. Urinary retention - Not a common side effect of bupropion. C. Tachycardia - Bupropion can cause an increase in heart rate, but it's not the most common side effect. D. QTc prolongation - This is a known side effect of bupropion, especially at higher doses. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient should be counseled about the possible side effect of QTc prolongation associated with bupropion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Approximately 70\u201380% of smokers would like to quit smoking. More than one-half of current smokers attempted to quit in the last year, but only 6% quit for 6 months, and only 3% remain abstinent for 2 years. Clinician-based smoking interventions should repeatedly encourage smokers to try to quit and to use different forms of cessation assistance with each new cessation attempt rather than focusing exclusively on immediate cessation at the time of the first visit. Advice from a physician to quit smoking, particularly at the time of an acute illness, is a powerful trigger for cessation attempts, with up to half of patients who are advised to quit making a cessation effort. Other triggers include the cost of cigarettes, media campaigns, and changes in rules to restrict smoking in the workplace."

            "content": "Differential Diagnosis of Fatigue If one looks critically at patients who seek medical help because of incapacitating exhaustion, lassitude, and fatigability, it is evident that the most commonly overlooked diagnoses are anxiety and depression as described in Chap. 47. The correct conclusion can usually be reached by keeping these illnesses in mind as one elicits the history from patient and family. Difficulty arises when symptoms of the psychiatric illness are so inconspicuous as not to be appreciated; one comes then to suspect the diagnosis only by having eliminated the common medical causes. Repeated observation may bear out the existence of an anxiety state or gloomy mood. Reassurance in combination with a therapeutic trial of antidepressant drugs may suppress symptoms of which the patient was barely aware, thus clarifying the diagnosis. The best that can be done is to assist the patient in adjusting to the adverse circumstances that have brought him under medical surveillance."

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease.

An episode may be characterized by sadness, indifference, apathy, or irritability and is usually associated with changes in sleep patterns, appetite, and weight; motor agitation or retardation; fatigue; impaired concentration and decision making; feelings of shame or guilt; and thoughts of death or dying. Patients with depression have a profound loss of pleasure in all enjoyable activities, exhibit early morning awakening, feel that the dysphoric mood state is qualitatively different from sadness, and often notice a diurnal variation in mood (worse in morning hours). Patients experiencing bereavement or grief may exhibit many of the same signs and symptoms of major depression, although the emphasis is usually on feelings of emptiness and loss, rather than"
