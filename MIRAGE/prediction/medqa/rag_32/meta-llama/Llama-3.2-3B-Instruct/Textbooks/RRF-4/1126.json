On arrival, she has a cervical collar in place and is unresponsive. Her temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98\u00b0F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 131/76 mm Hg. Her pupils are dilated and not reactive to light. She is unresponsive to noxious stimuli. She is intubated, and mechanical ventilation is begun. Serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within the reference range. Toxicology screening is negative. A CT scan of the head without contrast shows a massive intracranial bleed and a cervical spine injury at the level of C3.

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To diagnose brain death, we need to evaluate the patient's clinical status and perform tests to confirm the absence of brain function. The patient is unresponsive, has dilated pupils, and is intubated with mechanical ventilation, indicating a severe brain injury. The CT scan shows a massive intracranial bleed, which is a strong indicator of brain death. However, we need to confirm the absence of brain function using specific tests. The options provided are electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), deep tendon reflex testing, and corneal reflex testing. EEG is not suitable for diagnosing brain death as it can show abnormal patterns in patients with severe brain injury but does not confirm the absence of brain function. MRA is not relevant for diagnosing brain death as it is used to evaluate blood flow to the brain. Deep tendon reflex testing can be used to assess spinal cord function, not brain function. Corneal reflex testing is not a reliable indicator of brain death as it can be preserved in patients with severe brain injury. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform a clinical examination to assess the patient's clinical status and evaluate the absence of brain function using other methods such as apnea testing or brainstem auditory evoked response audiometry (BAER). However, among the options provided, none of them is a standard test for diagnosing brain death. The correct answer would be apnea testing, which is not among the options. The best answer is not available among the options provided.\", \"answer_choice\": \"None of the above (apnea testing is the correct test, but it is not among the options)\"} Note: The question is poorly worded, and the options provided do not include apnea testing, which is the standard test for diagnosing brain death.",

In the toddler age group, nonaccidental trauma is the most common cause of serious head injury. Findings suggestive of abuse include the presence of retinal hemorrhage on fundo-scopic evaluation and intracranial hemorrhage without evidence of external trauma (indicative of a shaking injury) and fractures at different stages of healing on skeletal survey. In older children, CNS injury occurs most commonly after falls and bicycle and motor vehicle collisions. The initial head CT can often underesti-mate the extent of injury in children.

The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score should be determined for all injured patients (Table 7-3). It is calculated by adding the scores of the best motor response, best verbal response, and the best eye response. Scores range from 3 (the lowest) to 15 (normal). Scores of 13 to 15 indicate mild head injury, 9 to 12 moderate injury, and \u22648 severe injury. The GCS is a quantifiable determination of neurologic function that is useful for triage, treatment, and prognosis.Neurologic evaluation, including spinal cord integrity, is critical before administration of neuromuscular blockade for intubation. Subtle changes in mental status can be caused by hypoxia, hypercarbia, or hypovolemia, or may be an early sign of increasing"

High-risk patients include those with persistent depressed or decreasing level of consciousness, focal neurologic signs, penetrating skull injury, depressed skull fractures, or worsening symptoms. Because patients with intracranial hemorrhage may progressively deteriorate and require immediate neurosurgical care, these patients warrant care in a skilled trauma center. The Glasgow Coma Scale is a valuable tool for monitoring the course of patients after trauma for signs of deterioration (Chapter 42). Management includes ensuring an appropriate airway, breathing, and circulation. Neuroimaging with CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and skull and cervical spine radiographs are obtained emergently. Neuroimaging is not necessary for uncomplicated concussions but should be employed whenever suspicion of structural intracranial lesion exists."
