    "question": "A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a right breast mass that she noticed 3 weeks ago. It has rapidly increased in size during this period. She does not have pain. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows large dense breasts; a 5-cm, nontender, multinodular mass is palpated in the right outer quadrant of the right breast. There are no changes in the skin or nipple. There is no palpable cervical or axillary adenopathy. Mammography shows a smooth polylobulated mass. Biopsy of the mass shows papillary projections of epithelial-lined stroma with hyperplasia and atypia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely diagnosis for the 45-year-old woman with a rapidly increasing breast mass, let's analyze the given information step by step.\\n\\nThe patient presents with a 5-cm, nontender, multinodular mass in the right outer quadrant of the right breast, which has increased in size over 3 weeks. The mammography shows a smooth polylobulated mass, and the biopsy reveals papillary projections of epithelial-lined stroma with hyperplasia and atypia.\\n\\nFirst, let's consider the age of the patient, which is 45 years old. At this age, the most common breast lesions are fibroadenomas, which are typically benign and often present as a well-circumscribed, mobile mass. However, the presence of multinodularity and rapid growth makes this less likely.\\n\\nNext, let's examine the mammography findings. A smooth polylobulated mass is concerning for a malignant process, as benign lesions are usually well-circumscribed and not polylobulated. However, this finding alone is not specific for cancer.\\n\\nThe biopsy results show papillary projections of epithelial-lined stroma with hyperplasia and atypia. This is a significant finding, as it suggests a malignant process. The presence of papillary projections and atypia is more consistent with a malignant tumor, such as invasive lobular carcinoma.\\n\\nConsidering the age of the patient, the mammography findings, and the biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is invasive lobular carcinoma.\\n\\nNow, let's evaluate the options provided:\\nA. Phyllodes tumor: While phyllodes tumors can be malignant, they are typically characterized by a leaf-like appearance on biopsy, which is not mentioned in the biopsy results.\\nB. Fibroadenoma: This is unlikely given the multinodular nature of the mass and the biopsy findings.\\nC. Fibrocystic disease of the breast: This condition typically presents with cysts and is not consistent with the biopsy findings.\\nD. Invasive lobular carcinoma: This is the most likely diagnosis based on the biopsy results and the clinical presentation.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.

About 20% of breast cancers are detected in the first trimester, 45% in the second trimester, and 35% in the third trimester. Some argue that stage for stage, the outcome is the same for breast cancer diagnosed in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Primary tumors in pregnant women are 3.5 cm on average, compared to <2 cm in nonpregnant women. A dominant mass and a nipple discharge are the most common presenting signs, and they should prompt ultrasonography and breast MRI exam (if available) followed by lumpectomy if the mass is solid and aspiration if the mass is cystic. Mammography is less reliable in pregnancy due to the increased breast density. Needle aspirates of breast masses in pregnant women are often nondiagnostic or falsely positive.

If nonbloody fluid is aspirated, the diagnosis (cyst) and therapy have been accomplished together. Solid lesions that are persistent, recurrent, complex, or bloody cysts require mammography and biopsy, although in selected patients the so-called triple diagnostic technique (palpation, mammography, aspiration) can be used to avoid biopsy (Figs. 108-1, 108-2, and 108-3). Ultrasound can be used in place of fine-needle aspiration to distinguish cysts from solid lesions.

Palpable masses can arise from proliferations of stromal cells or epithelial cells and are generally detected when they are 2 to 3 cm in size ( Fig. 19.22 ). Most (~95%) are benign; these tend to be round to oval and to have circumscribed borders. In contrast, malignant tumors usually invade across tissue planes and have irregular borders. However, because some cancers grow deceptively as circumscribed masses, all palpable masses require evaluation. Gynecomastia is the only common breast symptom in males. There is an increase in both stroma and epithelial cells resulting from an imbalance between estrogens, which stimulate breast tissue, and androgens, which counteract these effects."

Mammography has met this promise, as the average size of invasive carcinomas detected by mammography is about 1 cm (significantly smaller than cancers identified by palpation), and only 15% will have metastasized to regional lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis.

            "content": "Breast cancer is about 1/150th as frequent in men as in women; 1720 men developed breast cancer in 2006. It usually presents as a unilateral lump in the breast and is frequently not diagnosed promptly. Given the small amount of soft tissue and the unexpected nature of the problem, locally advanced presentations are somewhat more common. When male breast cancer is matched to female breast cancer by age and stage, its overall prognosis is identical. Although gynecomastia may initially be unilateral or asymmetric, any unilateral mass in a man older than age 40 years should receive a careful workup including biopsy. On the other hand, bilateral symmetric breast development rarely represents breast cancer and is almost invariably due to endocrine disease or a drug effect. It should be kept in mind, nevertheless, that the risk of cancer is much greater in men with gynecomastia; in such men, gross asymmetry of the breasts should arouse suspicion of cancer. Male breast cancer is best managed"

            "content": "In practice, however, the first investigation of pal-pable breast masses may be a needle biopsy, which allows for the early diagnosis of cysts. A 21-gauge needle attached to a 10-mL syringe is placed directly into the mass, which is fixed by fingers of the nondominant hand. The volume of a typical cyst is 5 to 10 mL, but it may be 75 mL or more. If the fluid that is aspirated is not bloodstained, then the cyst is aspirated to dryness, the needle is removed, and the fluid is discarded because cytologic examination of such fluid is not cost effec-tive. After aspiration, the breast is carefully palpated to exclude a residual mass. In most cases, however, imaging has been per-formed prior to a needle being introduced into the breast, and indeed the majority of cysts are now aspirated under ultrasound guidance. If a mass was noted on initial ultrasound or there is a residual mass post aspiration, then a tissue specimen is obtained, usually by core biopsy. When cystic fluid is bloodstained,"

Stage for stage, breast cancer in pregnant patients is no different from premenopausal breast cancer in nonpregnant patients. However, pregnant women often have more advanced disease because the significance of a breast mass was not fully considered and/or because of endogenous hormone stimulation. Persistent lumps in the breast of pregnant or lactating women cannot be attributed to benign changes based on physical findings; such patients should be promptly referred for diagnostic evaluation."

About one-third of the abnormalities detected on screening mammography prove malignant when biopsy is performed (23). 2. To evaluate a questionable or ill-defined breast mass or other suspicious change in the breast that is detected by clinical breast examination. 3. To establish a baseline breast mammogram and reevaluate patients at yearly intervals to diagnose a potentially curable breast cancer before it has been diagnosed clinically. 4. To search for occult breast cancer in a patient with metastatic disease in axillary nodes or elsewhere from an unknown primary origin. 5. To screen for unsuspected cancer before cosmetic operations or biopsy of a mass. 6. To monitor breast cancer patients who were treated with a breast-conserving surgery and radiation."

            "content": "Diagnostic mammography should not be confused with screening mammography, which is performed after a palpable abnormality has been detected. Diagnostic mammography is aimed at evaluating the rest of the breast before biopsy is performed or occasionally is part of the triple-test strategy to exclude immediate biopsy. Subtle abnormalities that are first detected by screening mammography should be evaluated carefully by compression or magnified views. These abnormalities include clustered microcalcifications, densities (especially if spiculated), and new or enlarging architectural distortion. For some nonpalpable lesions, ultrasound may be helpful either to identify cysts or to guide biopsy. If there is no palpable lesion and detailed mammographic studies are unequivocally benign, the patient should have routine follow-up appropriate to the patient\u2019s age. It cannot be stressed too strongly that in the presence of a breast lump a negative mammogram does not rule out cancer."

The lesion should triangulate to the same location on those two views. Calcifications can be macrocalcifications, which are coarse and usually represent benign degenerative breast conditions. Calcifications associated with breast cancer are clustered pleomorphic microcalcifications; typically five to eight or more calcifications are aggregated in one part of the breast (45). These calcifications may be associated with a mammographic mass density. A mass density may appear without evidence of calcifications. It can represent a cyst, benign tumor, or a malignancy. A malignant density usually has irregular or ill-defined borders and may lead to architectural distortion, which may be subtle and difficult to detect in a dense breast. Other mammographic findings suggesting breast cancer are architectural distortion, asymmetric density, skin thickening or retraction, or nipple"
