The strongest environmental influence is smoking, which doubles the risk. Long-standing chronic pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus are also associated with a modestly increased risk for pancreatic cancer. These two entities have a bidirectional link with pancreatic cancer. Thus, for example, tumors arising in the head of the pancreas often cause chronic pancreatitis in the distal parenchyma, while diabetes caused by duct obstruction and subsequent pancreatitis may be the manifestation of an underlying neoplasm. In fact, approximately 1% of the older adult population with new-onset diabetes harbor an unsuspected pancreatic cancer. Familial clustering of pancreatic cancer has been reported, and a growing number of inherited genetic defects are now recognized that increase pancreatic cancer risk.

In the United States, colorectal cancer is most common and usually presents after age 50 years. Worldwide, gastric cancer is prevalent especially in certain Asian regions. Esophageal cancer develops with chronic acid reflux or after an extensive alcohol or tobacco use history. Small-intestinal neoplasms are rare and occur with underlying inflammatory disease. Anal cancers arise after prior anal infection or inflammation. Pancreatic and biliary cancers elicit severe pain, weight loss, and jaundice and have poor prognoses. Hepatocellular carcinoma usually arises in the setting of chronic viral hepatitis or cirrhosis secondary to other causes. Most GI cancers exhibit carcinomatous histology; however, lymphomas and other cell types also are observed."

Although abdominal CT scanning and MRCP greatly aid in the diagnosis of pancreatic disease, the diagnostic test with the best sensitivity and specificity is the hormone stimulation test using secretin. The secretin test becomes abnormal when \u226560% of the pancreatic exocrine function has been lost. This usually correlates well with the onset of chronic abdominal pain. The role of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in diagnosing early chronic pancreatitis is still being defined. A total of nine endosonographic features have been described in chronic pancreatitis. The presence of five or more features is considered diagnostic of chronic pancreatitis. EUS is not a sensitive enough test for detecting early chronic pancreatitis alone (Chap. 370) and may show positive features in patients"

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

Most patients do experience pain as part of the symptom complex of pancreatic cancer, and it is often the first symptom. Therefore, awareness of the way pancreatic pain is perceived may help clinicians sus-pect pancreatic cancer. The pain associated with pancreatic can-cer is usually perceived in the epigastrium but can occur in any Brunicardi_Ch33_p1429-p1516.indd 148601/03/19 6:46 PM 1487PANCREASCHAPTER 33the serum of patients with pancreatic cancer. Serum levels are elevated in about 75% of patients with pancreatic cancer. How-ever, CA19-9 is also elevated in about 10% of patients with benign diseases of the pancreas, liver, and bile ducts.15 CA19-9 is thus neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific to allow an early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Despite the fact that many tumor markers such as CA19-9 have been studied, there are still no effective screening tests for pancreatic cancer."

As in other GI cancers, diets high in fat and low in fiber, fruits, and vegetables are thought to be associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer.Diabetes has been known to be associated with pancreatic cancer for many years. In fact, glucose intolerance is present in 80% of patients with pancreatic cancer, and approximately 20% have overt diabetes, a much greater incidence than would be expected to occur by chance. Preexisting type 2 diabetes increases the risk for development of pancreatic cancer by about twofold.309 The new onset of diabetes also can be an early mani-festation of otherwise occult pancreatic cancer. Thus, the new onset of diabetes, or a sudden increase in insulin requirement in an older adult patient with preexisting diabetes, should provoke concern for the presence of pancreatic cancer.Recent epidemiologic studies have confirmed the fact that patients with chronic"
