    "question": "A 41-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a suicide attempt. His wife found him on the bathroom floor with an empty bottle of medication next to him. He has a history of major depressive disorder. His only medication is nortriptyline. His pulse is 127/min and blood pressure is 90/61 mm Hg. Examination shows dilated pupils and dry skin. The abdomen is distended and there is dullness on percussion in the suprapubic region. An ECG shows tachycardia and a QRS complex width of 130 ms. In addition to intravenous fluid resuscitation, which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Given the symptoms described, let's break down the case step by step: 1. The patient is a 41-year-old man with a history of major depressive disorder and is found with an empty bottle of medication next to him, suggesting an overdose. 2. He has a history of taking nortriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). 3. The patient presents with tachycardia (127/min), low blood pressure (90/61 mmHg), dilated pupils, dry skin, and abdominal distension with dullness on percussion in the suprapubic region. 4. The ECG shows tachycardia and a widened QRS complex (130 ms), which is consistent with TCA toxicity. Given these symptoms, the most likely cause is TCA toxicity. In TCA toxicity, sodium bicarbonate is administered to: * Neutralize the acidosis caused by the accumulation of toxic metabolites of the TCA. * Help in the re-uptake of the TCA into the presynaptic neuron, thereby reducing the amount of TCA available to bind to receptors and cause toxicity. The other options are not the best choices: * A. Naloxone is used to reverse opioid overdose, which is not indicated here. * B. Cyproheptadine is an antihistamine with some anticholinergic properties and is not typically used in TCA toxicity. * C. Ammonium chloride is not typically used in the treatment of TCA toxicity. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the symptoms of TCA toxicity (tachycardia, low blood pressure, dilated pupils, dry skin, abdominal distension, and widened QRS complex), sodium bicarbonate is administered to neutralize acidosis and re-uptake of the TCA into the presynaptic neuron.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

            "content": "Mild hypovolemia (\u226420% of the blood volume) generates mild tachycardia but relatively few external signs, especially in a supine young patient (Table 324-5). With moderate hypovolemia (~20\u201340% of the blood volume), the patient becomes increasingly anxious and tachycardic; although normal blood pressure may be maintained in the supine position, there may be significant postural hypotension and tachycardia. If hypovolemia is severe (\u226540% of the blood volume), the classic signs of shock appear; the blood pressure declines and becomes unstable even in the supine position, and the patient develops marked tachycardia, oliguria, and agitation or confusion. Perfusion of the central nervous system is well maintained until shock becomes severe. Hence, mental obtundation is an ominous clinical sign. The transition from mild to severe hypovolemic shock can be insidious or extremely rapid. If severe shock is not reversed rapidly, especially in elderly patients and those with comorbid illnesses,"

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

Following a sleepless night with significant dyspnea, the patient develops nausea and vomiting and collapses. He presents to the emergency department in cardiac arrest and is unable to be resuscitated. His autopsy shows a posterior wall myocardial infarction and a fresh thrombus in an atherosclerotic right coronary artery. What went wrong? The clinician had decided, based on the patient\u2019s appearance, even before starting the history, that the patient\u2019s complaints were not serious. Therefore, he felt confident that he could perform an abbreviated and focused examination by using the URI assessment protocol rather than considering the broader range of possibilities and performing appropriate tests to confirm or refute his initial hypotheses. In particular, by concentrating on the URI, the clinician failed to elicit the full dyspnea history, which would have"

His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

Further examination of his left eye reveals rupture of his globe. The ophthalmolo-gist requests emergency surgery to repair and save his eye. Because the patient has suffered a recent trauma, you decide to perform a rapid sequence intubation in preparation for the surgical procedure. What muscle relaxant would you use to facilitate tracheal intubation? What is the proper dose for your chosen muscle relaxant? After intravenous infusion of your chosen muscle relaxant, you are unable to adequately visualize the patient\u2019s larynx and vocal cords and cannot successfully pass an endotracheal tube.

She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"
