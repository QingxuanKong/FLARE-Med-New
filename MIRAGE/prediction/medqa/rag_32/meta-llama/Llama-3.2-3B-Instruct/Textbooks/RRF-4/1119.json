She describes the pain as affecting the inside part of the knee as well as the front of her knee, below the kneecap. She denies any inciting injury or trauma to the knee but reports that the pain is worse when she is climbing up stairs or rising from a chair. Physical examination is significant for localized tenderness to palpation over the left anteromedial proximal tibia, 6 cm inferior to the joint line. There is no joint effusion noted. Valgus stress testing is negative for any pain or instability of the knee joint. Radiographs of the left knee are obtained and reveal only mild arthritis, without evidence of any fractures or bony lesions. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

This condition is often caused by repetitive friction or overuse, and is more common in individuals who are overweight or have a history of repetitive knee flexion and extension, such as runners or individuals who frequently climb stairs. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with pes anserine bursitis, which is characterized by pain and tenderness over the affected area, swelling, and sometimes a palpable mass. The diagnosis can be confirmed with a glucocorticoid injection, which is often effective in reducing symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The history should include information about the complaint, the signs and symptoms, and the patient\u2019s lifestyle (level of activity).

            "content": "OA is the most common cause of chronic knee pain in persons over age 45, but the differential diagnosis is long. Inflammatory arthritis is likely if there is prolonged morning stiffness and many other joints are affected. Bursitis occurs commonly around knees and hips. A physical examination should focus on whether tenderness is over the joint line (at the junction of the two bones around which the joint is articulating) or is outside of it. Anserine bursitis, medial and distal to the knee, is an extremely common cause of chronic knee pain that may respond to a glucocorticoid injection. Prominent nocturnal pain in the absence of end-stage OA merits a distinct workup. For hip pain, OA can be detected by loss of internal rotation on passive movement, and pain isolated to an area lateral to the hip joint usually reflects the presence of trochanteric bursitis. No blood tests are routinely indicated for workup of patients with OA unless symptoms and signs suggest inflammatory arthritis."

A careful history should delineate the chronology of the knee complaint and whether there are predisposing conditions, trauma, or medications that might underlie the complaint. For example, patellofemoral disease (e.g., OA) may cause anterior knee pain that worsens with climbing stairs. Observation of the patient\u2019s gait is also important. The knee should be carefully inspected in the upright (weight-bearing) and supine positions for swelling, erythema, malalignment, visible trauma, muscle wasting, and leg length discrepancy. The most common malalignment in the knee is genu varum (bowlegs) or genu valgum (knock-knees) resulting from asymmetric cartilage loss medially or laterally.

Modest synovitis develops in many but not all osteoarthritic joints. Some diseased joints have no synovitis, whereas others have synovial inflammation that approaches the severity of joints with rheumatoid arthritis (Chap. 380). The presence of synovitis on MRI is correlated with the presence and severity of knee pain. Capsular stretching from fluid in the joint stimulates nociceptive fibers there, inducing pain. Increased focal loading as part of the disease not only damages cartilage but probably also injures the underlying bone. As a consequence, bone marrow edema appears on the MRI; histologically, this edema signals the presence of microcracks and scar, which are the consequences of trauma. These lesions may stimulate bone nociceptive fibers."

In pediatric patients with knee pain, the ipsi-lateral hip should be assessed as well.Examination of the patient will show obligatory external rotation with flexion and loss of internal rotation of the hip. Obtain AP and frog leg lateral views of both the hips.Slipped epiphysis is classified as either stable or unstable on the basis of the patient\u2019s ability to bear weight. It is classi-fied as stable if the patient is able to bear weight and the risk of osteonecrosis is less than 10%. It is classified as unstable if the patient is unable to bear weight even with crutches, and the incidence of avascular necrosis is high.Treatment for slipped capital femoral epiphysis patients is percutaneous screw fixation through the femoral neck to engage the epiphysis, causing the growth plate to close. Reduc-tion of the slipped epiphysis is not recommended because of an increased risk of avascular necrosis. One screw is usually adequate"

A young long-distance runner came to her physician with acute swelling around the lateral aspect of her ankle. This injury occurred directly after accidentally running into a pothole in the pavement. A fractured ankle was suspected. Plain anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the ankle revealed no evidence of any bone injury to account for the patient\u2019s soft tissue swelling. The patient was given a pair of crutches and analgesics and told to rest. A diagnosis of a simple sprain was made. Over the ensuing weeks the swelling and edema within the soft tissue of the ankle decreased and the patient began to run, but noted that the ankle kept \u201cgiving way.\u201d She went to an orthopedic surgeon for further assessment. There was a positive anterior drawer test of the ankle joint."

In sports, the major stabilizing structures such as the ACL and the medial collateral ligament (MCL) are frequently injured. Other common knee injuries involve the menisci, posterolateral corner (PLC), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and patellofemoral joint.MenisciThe menisci are crescent-shaped pieces of fibrocartilage that provide joint stability, shock absorption, load distribution, and proprioception to the knee. Sudden meniscal tears often happen during sports, usually during contact or twisting injuries to the knee. Symptoms associated with a meniscus tear include pain, swelling, stiffness, catching, and locking of the knee. Radio-graphs are typically obtained to assess for a concomitant bony injury, the presence of (early) osteoarthritis, and leg alignment abnormalities. However, since menisci are radiolucent and are not seen on radiographs, an"

            "content": "The clinical picture of PVNS is characterized by the insidious onset of persistent swelling and pain in affected joints, most commonly the knee. Other joints affected include the hips, ankles, calcaneocuboid joints, elbows, and small joints of the fingers or toes. The disease may also involve the common flexor sheath of the hands or fingers. Less often, tendon sheaths in the wrist, ankle, or foot may be involved. Symptoms of pain, a catching sensation, or stiffness may initially be mild and intermittent and may be present for years before the patient seeks medical attention. Radiographs may show joint space narrowing, erosions, and subchondral cysts. The diagnosis of PVNS is strongly suggested by gradient echo MRI, which reveals a synovial mass lesion of low signal intensity typical of tissue containing hemosiderin (Fig. 397-3). The joint fluid contains blood and is dark red or almost black in color. Lipid-containing macrophages may be present in the fluid. The joint fluid may be"

            "content": "Another source of anatomic abnormality is malalignment across the joint (Fig. 394-5). This factor has been best studied in the knee, which is the fulcrum of the longest lever arm in the body. Varus (bowlegged) knees with OA are at exceedingly high risk of cartilage loss in the medial or inner compartment of the knee, whereas valgus (knockkneed) malalignment predisposes to rapid cartilage loss in the lateral compartment. Malalignment causes this effect by increasing stress on a focal area of cartilage, which then breaks down. There is evidence that malalignment in the knee not only causes cartilage loss but leads FIGUrE 394-5 The two types of limb malalignment in the frontal plane: varus, in which the stress is placed across the medial compartment of the knee joint, and valgus, which places excess stress across the lateral compartment of the knee."

Focused History: Ten days ago, CR had her spleen removed following a bicycle accident in which she fractured her tibial eminence, necessitating immobilization of the right knee. She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."
