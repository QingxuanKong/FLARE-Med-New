He also has a 2-month history of post-prandial fullness and recurrent nonbilious vomiting. He appears pale. Abdominal examination shows hepatosplenomegaly and shifting dullness; there is mild tenderness to palpation. Examination of the skin shows multiple nonblanching maculae. A CT scan of the abdomen shows mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement and nodular thickening of the omentum. A photomicrograph of a biopsy specimen from an enlarged mesenteric lymph node is shown. Immunohistochemical staining of the Ki-67 nuclear antigen shows that the proliferation index of the specimen is > 99%. The structure indicated by the arrows is most likely which of the following?",

The patient presents with abdominal distention, fatigue, night sweats, post-prandial fullness, and recurrent nonbilious vomiting. These symptoms are suggestive of an abdominal malignancy. 2. The presence of hepatosplenomegaly and shifting dullness indicates ascites, which is a common complication of abdominal malignancies, particularly those involving the gastrointestinal tract. 3. The CT scan findings of mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement and nodular thickening of the omentum further support the suspicion of an abdominal malignancy. 4. The presence of nonblanching maculae on the skin suggests a paraneoplastic syndrome, which is a condition caused by substances produced by a tumor that affect other parts of the body. 5. The high proliferation index (>99%) on immunohistochemical staining of the Ki-67 nuclear antigen suggests a highly aggressive malignancy. ### Answer: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with a highly aggressive abdominal malignancy. The presence of hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, and nonblanching maculae on the skin, along with the high proliferation index on Ki-67 staining, suggest a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

Examination should also include careful assessment of other nodal regions, including the supraclavicular fossae, the axillae, the retroperitoneum, and the inguinal regions. Further examination may include digestive tract endoscopy, chest radiography, and body CT scanning. Most cervical lymph nodes are easily palpable and suitable for biopsy to establish a tissue diagnosis. Biopsy can be performed using ultrasound for guidance and good samples of lymph nodes may be obtained."

            "content": "obstruction due to mechanical factors can be differentiated from pancreatitis by the history of crescendo-decrescendo pain, findings on abdominal examination, and CT of the abdomen showing changes characteristic of mechanical obstruction. Acute mesenteric vascular occlusion is usually suspected in elderly debilitated patients with brisk leukocytosis, abdominal distention, and bloody diarrhea, confirmed by CT or magnetic resonance angiography. Vasculitides secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus and polyarteritis nodosa may be confused with pancreatitis, especially because pancreatitis may develop as a complication of these diseases. Diabetic ketoacidosis is often accompanied by abdominal pain and elevated total serum amylase levels, thus closely mimicking acute pancreatitis. However, the serum lipase level is not elevated in diabetic ketoacidosis."

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

Blood may be detected in diarrheal stool. Older children and adults are more likely than younger children to present with abdominal pain, which can be localized to the right iliac fossa\u2014a situation that often leads to laparotomy for presumed appendicitis (pseudoappendicitis). Appendectomy is not indicated for Yersinia infection causing pseudoappendicitis. Thickening of the terminal ileum and cecum is seen on endoscopy and ultrasound, with elevated round or oval lesions that may overlie Peyer\u2019s patches. Mesenteric lymph nodes are enlarged. Ulcerations of the mucosa are noted on endoscopy. Gastrointestinal complications include granulomatous appendicitis, a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the appendix that is responsible for \u22642% of cases of appendicitis; Yersinia is"

Mediastinal lymphadenopathy producing cough or shortness of breath is another frequent initial presentation. The presence of one of three B symptoms has prognostic value: fever (>38\u00b0 C for 3 consecutive days), drenching night sweats, and unintentional weight loss of 10% or more within 6 months of diagnosis. The sporadic (North American) form of Burkitt lymphoma more commonly has an abdominal presentation (typically with pain), whereas the endemic (African) form frequently presents with tumors of the jaw. The anterior mediastinum and cervical nodes are the usual primary sites for T-cell lymphomas. These lymphomas may cause airway or superior vena cava obstruction, pleural effusion, or both."

This complication has also been seen in patients with other forms of cancer treated with taxanes, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, vinorelbine, cisplatin, carboplatin, and high-dose chemotherapy (Fig. 331-5). It also has been reported in patients with AIDS, aplastic anemia, cyclic neutropenia, idiosyncratic drug reactions involving antibiotics, and immunosuppressive therapies. The patient develops right lower quadrant abdominal pain, often with rebound tenderness and a tense, distended abdomen, in a setting of fever and neutropenia. Watery diarrhea (often containing sloughed mucosa) and bacteremia are common, and bleeding may occur. Plain abdominal films are generally of little value in the diagnosis; CT scan may show marked bowel wall thickening, particularly in the cecum, with bowel wall edema, mesenteric stranding, and ascites, and may help to"
