She reports that the child cries several times per day, but sleeps 7-8 hours at night, uninterrupted. She has been breastfeeding the infant but feels the latch has been poor and is unsure how much milk he has been consuming but feels it is not enough. A lactation consult was called for the patient and it was noted that despite proper instruction the observed latch was still poor. When asked the mother stated that the baby is currently making stools 2 times per day. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of the patient's presentation?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely etiology of the patient's presentation, let's analyze the given information step by step. The patient is a three-day-old, full-term infant born by uncomplicated vaginal delivery, presenting with yellow skin and crying several times per day, but sleeping 7-8 hours at night. The mother reports a poor latch and uncertainty about the amount of milk the infant is consuming. The lactation consult noted a poor latch despite proper instruction. The infant makes stools 2 times per day. We need to consider the possible causes of jaundice in a newborn, which include breast milk jaundice, breastfeeding jaundice, sepsis, and physiologic hyperbilirubinemia. Breast milk jaundice typically occurs 2-7 days after birth and is not directly related to the latch or feeding issues. Breastfeeding jaundice is also unlikely as the primary cause given the short duration of breastfeeding and the presence of stools. Sepsis would likely present with more severe symptoms such as fever, lethargy, and refusal to feed, which are not mentioned in the scenario. Physiologic hyperbilirubinemia is the most common cause of jaundice in newborns, especially in the first 24 hours of life, and is not directly related to the latch or feeding issues. Given the age of the infant and the duration of breastfeeding, physiologic hyperbilirubinemia is the most likely etiology of the patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Each voiding should soak, notmerely moisten, a diaper, and urine should be colorless. By5 to 7 days, loose yellow stools should be passed at least fourtimes a day. Rate of weight gain provides the most objectiveindicator of adequate milk intake. Total weight loss after birthshould not exceed 7%, and birth weight should be regained by10 days. The mean feeding frequency during the early weekspostpartum is 8 to 12 times per day. An infant may be adequately hydrated while not receiving enough milk to achieveadequate energy and nutrient intake. Telephone follow-up isvaluable during the interim between discharge and the firstdoctor visit to monitor the progress of lactation. A follow-upvisit should be scheduled by 3 to 5 days of age, and again by 2 weeks of age."

Engorgement, one of the most common causes oflactation failure, should receive prompt attention because milk supply can decrease quickly if the breasts are not adequately emptied. Applying warm or cold compresses to thebreasts before nursing and hand expression or pumping ofsome milk can provide relief to the mother and make the areola easier to grasp by the infant. Nipple tenderness requiresattention to proper latch-on and positioning of the infant.Supportive measures include nursing for shorter periods,beginning feedings on the less sore side, air drying the nipples well after nursing, and applying lanolin cream after eachnursing session. Severe nipple pain and cracking usually indicate improper latch-on. Temporary pumping, which is well tolerated, may be needed.

Direct skin-to-skin contact with the mother and drying and covering the newborn with a warm blanket will help maintain euthermia (36.5 to 37.5\u00b0C). A vigorously crying newborn does not require routine oral suctioning (Carrasco, 1997; Gungor, 2006). Instead, bulb suctioning to remove secretions is best reserved for those who cannot clear secretions on their own due to apnea or copious secretions. Additional routine care steps include drying, gentle stimulation by rubbing the newborn's back, and continued observation during the transition period."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

In these instances, enteral feeds can be administered either a nasojejunal or a gastrostomy tube.When the gastrointestinal tract cannot be used because of mechanical, ischemic, inflammatory, or functional disorders, parenteral alimentation must be given. Prolonged parenteral nutrition is delivered via a central venous catheter. Peripheral IV alimentation can be given, utilizing less concentrated but greater volumes of solutions. Long-term parenteral nutrition should include supplemental copper, zinc, and iron to prevent the development of trace metal deficiencies. A major complica-tion of long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is the devel-opment of parenteral nutrition\u2013associated cholestasis, which can eventually progress to liver failure. To prevent this major complication, concomitant enteral feedings should be instituted, and"

Therefore, if the woman is remote from delivery, strong consideration should be given to prompt cesarean delivery, especially when cephalopelvic disproportion is suspected or either hypotonic or hypertonic dysfunctional labor is evident. Some practitioners choose to avoid oxytocin use in these cases. Until recently, it was taught-including at Parkland Hospital -that aspiration of meconium could be minimized but not eliminated by suctioning the pharynx as soon as the head was delivered. According to the American Heart Association guidelines, this in no longer recommended (Wyckof, 2015). The merican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017a) does not recommend routine intrapartum suctioning. Alternatively, if the depressed newborn has meconium-stained fluid, then intubation is carried out."

She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative."
