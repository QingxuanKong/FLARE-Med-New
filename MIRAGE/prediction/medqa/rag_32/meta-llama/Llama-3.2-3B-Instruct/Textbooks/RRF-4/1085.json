    "question": "A 3-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her mother 30 minutes after the sudden onset of shortness of breath, dizziness, abdominal pain, and urticaria. The symptoms began 5 minutes after she ate a peanut butter sandwich. Her respirations are 36/min and blood pressure is 84/50 mm Hg. There is stridor on auscultation of the chest. She is intubated and mechanical ventilation is begun. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and the appropriate pharmacotherapy are begun. The drug administered to this patient most likely has which of the following effects on cardiac pacemaker cells during an action potential?",

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to identify the drug administered to the patient and its effects on cardiac pacemaker cells during an action potential. The patient's symptoms, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, abdominal pain, and urticaria, began after eating a peanut butter sandwich, suggesting an allergic reaction. The patient is a 3-year-old girl, and given her symptoms, it is likely that she has anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that requires immediate medical attention. In anaphylaxis, the administration of epinephrine is a standard treatment to help alleviate symptoms. Epinephrine is a \\u00b11-adrenergic agonist, which means it stimulates the \\u00b11-adrenergic receptors. The effects of epinephrine on cardiac pacemaker cells during an action potential include increased heart rate and contractility. Specifically, epinephrine increases the influx of sodium ions (Na+) during phase 3 of the action potential, which depolarizes the cardiac cell and increases the heart rate. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Increased Na+ influx in phase 3.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

The tip of the catheter is then placed more inferiorly at the junction of the right atrium and the superior vena cava. The reason for placing the catheter in such a position relates to the agents that are infused. Most chemotherapeutic agents are severely cytotoxic (kill cells), and enabling good mixing with the blood prevents thrombosis and vein wall irritation. A 15-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of productive cough with copious purulent sputum, increasing shortness of breath, fatigue, fever around 38.5\u00b0 C, and no response to oral amoxicillin prescribed to her by a family physician. The patient was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis shortly after birth and had multiple admissions to the hospital for pulmonary and gastrointestinal manifestations of the disease."

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of \u201closs of vision.\u201d Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver\u2019s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"
