During surgery, the inferior thyroid arteries were ligated as close to the poles as possible to prevent intraoperative hemorrhage. Two weeks later, the patient presents with hoarseness. To determine the most likely cause of her hoarseness, we need to consider the anatomy of the thyroid gland and the nerves surrounding it. The recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) is closely related to the thyroid gland and can be damaged during surgery, especially if the superior pole vessels are ligated en masse. The RLN is responsible for innervating the muscles of the larynx, including the cricothyroid muscle, which is involved in voice production. The internal laryngeal nerve and external laryngeal nerve are also present in the neck, but they are less likely to be affected by the surgical procedure. Laryngeal edema is also possible, but it is less likely to cause persistent hoarseness. Given the close proximity of the RLN to the thyroid gland and the fact that the inferior thyroid arteries were ligated as close to the poles as possible, the most likely cause of the patient's hoarseness is an injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The first successful para-thyroidectomy for HPT in the United States was performed on a 56-year-old woman in 1928 by Isaac Y. Olch at the Barnes Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri.

Various novel techniques using indocyanine fluo-rescence angiography and near-infrared autofluorescence have shown utility in the identification and viability assessment of parathyroid glands; however, they are not routinely used at the present time.63,64 If a subtotal thyroidectomy is to be performed, once the superior pole vessels are divided and the thyroid lobe mobilized anteriorly, the thyroid lobe is cross-clamped with a Mayo clamp, leaving approximately 4 g of the posterior por-tion of the thyroid. The thyroid remnant is suture ligated, taking care to avoid injury to the RLN. Routine drain placement rarely is necessary. After adequate hemostasis is obtained, the strap muscles are reapproximated in the midline. The platysma is approximated in a similar fashion.

Patients with a nodule that is suspicious for papillary cancer should be treated by thyroid lobectomy, isthmu-sectomy, and removal of any pyramidal lobe or adjacent lymph nodes. If intraoperative frozen-section examination of a lymph node or primary tumor confirms carcinoma, completion total or near-total thyroidectomy is performed.

The inferior thyroid vessels are dissected, skeletonized, ligated, and divided as close to the surface of the thyroid gland as possible to minimize devascular-ization of the parathyroids (extracapsular dissection) or injury to the RLN. The RLN is most vulnerable to injury in the vicinity of the ligament of Berry. The nerve often passes through this structure along with small crossing arterial and venous branches (Fig. 38-22E). Any bleeding in this area should be controlled with gentle pressure before carefully identifying the vessel and ligating it. Use of the electrocautery should be avoided in prox-imity to the RLN. Once the ligament is divided, the thyroid can be separated from the underlying trachea by sharp dissection.

A TSH level should be measured to exclude subclinical hyperor hypothyroidism, but thyroid function is usually normal. Tracheal deviation is common, but compression must usually exceed 70% of the tracheal diameter before there is significant airway compromise. Pulmonary function testing can be used to assess the functional effects of compression, which characteristically causes inspiratory stridor. CT or MRI can be used to evaluate the anatomy of the goiter and the extent of substernal extension or tracheal narrowing. A barium swallow may reveal the extent of esophageal compression.
