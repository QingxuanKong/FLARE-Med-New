Ubiquitous organisms causing pulmonary and disseminated infection in several demographic groups. The 1\u00b0 form occurs in apparently healthy nonsmokers (Lady Windermere syndrome); a 2\u00b0 pulmonary form affects patients with preexisting pulmonary disease such as COPD, TB, or CF. Disseminated infection occurs in AIDS patients with a CD4+ < 50. There is no evidence that behavioral change affects exposure. Disseminated M. avium infection in AIDS is associated with fever, weakness, and weight loss in patients who are not on HAART or chemoprophylaxis for MAC. Hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy are occasionally seen."

            "content": "Symptoms of HIV disease can appear at any time during the course of HIV infection. Generally speaking, the spectrum of illnesses that one observes changes as the CD4+ T cell count declines. The more severe and life-threatening complications of HIV infection occur in patients with CD4+ T cell counts <200/\u03bcL. A diagnosis of AIDS is made in individuals age 6 years and older with HIV infection and a CD4+ T cell count <200/\u03bcL (Stage 3, Table 226-2) and in anyone with HIV infection who develops one of the HIV-associated diseases considered to be indicative of a severe defect in cell-mediated immunity (Table 226-1). While the causative agents of the secondary infections are characteristically opportunistic organisms such as P. jiroveci, atypical mycobacteria, CMV, and other organisms that do not ordinarily cause disease in the absence of a compromised immune system, they also include common bacterial and mycobacterial pathogens. Following the widespread use of cART and implementation of"

            "content": "The CD4+ T cell count often is useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis. As a rule of thumb, bacterial and tubercular infections occur with mildly suppressed CD4+ counts (more than 200 cells/\u00b5L); Pneumocystis pneumonia usually occurs at CD4+ T cell counts below 200 cells/\u00b5L, while CMV and M. avium complex infections are uncommon until the very late stages of the disease (CD4+ T cell counts below 50 cells/\u00b5L). Finally, an important point is that pulmonary disease in HIV-infected individuals may result from more than one cause, and that even common pathogens may be responsible for disease with atypical manifestations."

(The CSF VDRL may remain positive for many years after treatment.) If, however, CSF serology is negative, there is no pleocytosis, the CSF protein content is normal, and there is no evidence of cardiovascular or other types of syphilis, antisyphilitic treatment may not be necessary. We are uncertain of the proper course of treatment in patients with tabes who have survived many decades with HIV. Residual symptoms in the form of lightning pains, gastric crises, Charcot joints, or urinary incontinence frequently continue long after all signs of active neurosyphilitic infection have disappeared. These should be treated symptomatically rather than by antisyphilitic drugs."

Focused History: LT is a widower and lives alone in a suburban community on the East Coast. He no longer drives. His two children live on the West Coast and come east infrequently. Since the death of his wife 11 months ago, he has been isolated and finds it hard to get out of the house. His appetite has changed, and he is content with cereal, coffee, and packaged snacks. Chewing is difficult."

Cold agglutinins were markedly elevated, and the patient responded to erythromycin. This radiographic pattern of reticulonodular interstitial disease is observed in 25% to 30% of patients with pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. (From Baltimore RS: Pneumonia.

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

A reactive CSF FTA-ABS is not definitive evidence of neurosyphilis. The CSF FTA-ABS can be falsely positive from blood contamination. A negative CSF VDRL does not rule out neurosyphilis. A negative CSF FTA-ABS or MHA-TP rules out neurosyphilis."
