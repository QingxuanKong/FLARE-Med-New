Her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 48 years. She has hypertension for which she takes ramipril. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at the femoral neck shows a T-score of -2.7 SD. The physician considers treatment with raloxifene. This medication would put her at increased risk of developing which of the following conditions?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the properties and side effects of raloxifene, a medication used to prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that mimics the effects of estrogen in some parts of the body, such as the bones, but blocks estrogen in other parts, like the breasts and uterus. The question asks about a potential side effect of raloxifene, so we need to identify the correct option among the given choices. Let's analyze each option: Option A: Pulmonary embolism - There is no direct association between raloxifene and an increased risk of pulmonary embolism. Option B: Cellulitis - Raloxifene is not associated with an increased risk of cellulitis. Option C: Breast cancer - Raloxifene can increase the risk of breast cancer, especially in the first 5 years of treatment. This is a known side effect of SERMs like raloxifene. Option D: Hypercholesterolemia - Raloxifene is not associated with an increased risk of hypercholesterolemia. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is Option C: Breast cancer, as raloxifene increases the risk of breast cancer, especially in the first 5 years of treatment. answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

There is little evidence that regular monitoring of BMD improves the prediction of fractures.

Hypertension: Blood pressure should be determined at least once a year or more often in patients with hypertension. Diabetes: Serum glucose and hemoglobin A1c should be checked every 3 years or more often in patients who are obese or hypertensive. Lipid disorders: A lipid panel should be done every 5 years or more often in patients with diabetes or any cardiovascular disease.

A T-score below \u20132.5 in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip has been defined as a diagnosis of osteoporosis. As noted above, because more than 50% of fractures occur in individuals with low bone mass rather than BMD osteoporosis, attempts are ongoing to redefine the disease as a fracture risk rather than a specific BMD. Consistent with this concept, fractures of the spine and hip that occur in the absence of major trauma would be considered to be sufficient to diagnose osteoporosis, regardless of BMD. Fractures of other sites, such as pelvis, proximal humerus, and wrist, would be tantamount to an osteoporosis diagnosis in the presence of low BMD. CT can also be used to measure the spine"

As the population continues to age, the number of individuals with osteoporosis and fractures will also continue to increase, despite a recognized reduction in age-specific risk.

Height loss >2.5\u20133.8 cm (>1\u20131.5 in.) is an indication for VFA by DXA or radiography to rule out asymptomatic vertebral fractures, as is the presence of significant kyphosis or back pain, particularly if it began after menopause.

For patients who present with fractures, it is important to ensure that the fractures are not caused by an underlying malignancy. Usually this is clear on routine radiography, but on occasion, CT, MRI, or radionuclide scans may be necessary."

DXA is a highly accurate x-ray technique that has become the standard for measuring bone density. Although it can be used for measurement in any skeletal site, clinical determinations usually are made of the lumbar spine and hip. DXA also can be used to measure body composition. In the DXA technique, two x-ray energies are used to estimate the area of mineralized tissue, and the mineral content is divided by the area, which partially corrects for body size. However, this correction is only partial because DXA is a two-dimensional scanning technique and cannot estimate the depth or posteroanterior length of the bone.

When hip measurements are performed by DXA, the spine can be measured at the same time. In younger individuals such as perimenopausal or early postmenopausal women, spine measurements may be the most sensitive indicator of bone loss. A risk assessment tool (FRAX) incorporates femoral neck BMD to assess 10-year fracture risk (see below)."

Similarly, bone density in the extremities can be quantified by densitometry of the hip or of the distal radius at a site chosen to be primarily cortical. Computed tomography (CT) is a very sensitive technique for estimating spinal bone density, but reproducibility of standard CT is no better than 5%. Newer CT techniques (spiral, \u201cextreme\u201d CT) are more reproducible but are currently available in a limited number of medical centers. Cortical bone density is reduced while cancellous bone density, especially in the spine, is relatively preserved. In symptomatic patients, dysfunctions of the CNS, peripheral nerve and muscle, gastrointestinal tract, and joints also occur. It has been reported that severe neuropsychiatric manifestations may be reversed by parathyroidectomy. When present in symptomatic patients, neuromuscular manifestations may"

These complaints are new since she used to always feel \u201chot,\u201d noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to \u201cprotect her bones\u201d and omeprazole for \u201cheartburn.\u201d On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm.
