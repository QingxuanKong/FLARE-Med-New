He also complains that the nurse practitioner at the facility started him on 4 new medications, in addition to his existing prescriptions. On physical examination, tense axillary bullae are noted that do not rupture with light, gloved touch. On direct immunofluorescence, linear C3 and IgG deposits are seen along the basement membrane.

The patient presents with itchy blisters in the axilla and tense bullae that do not rupture with light, gloved touch. This suggests a subepidermal blistering disease. 2. The patient is an 81-year-old man, and the disease is more common in older adults, which supports the diagnosis of a subepidermal blistering disease. 3. The patient attributes the symptoms to a poor diet, but this is unlikely to be the cause of the blistering disease. 4. The patient has recently started new medications, which could be a contributing factor to the development of the disease. 5. Direct immunofluorescence microscopy shows linear C3 and IgG deposits along the basement membrane, which is a characteristic feature of bullous pemphigoid. 6. The disease is less likely to be pemphigus vulgaris, as it typically shows intraepidermal blisters and deposits of IgG on the surface of keratinocytes. 7. Cicatricial pemphigoid is also less likely, as it typically involves scarring and the presence of eosinophils in the dermis. 8. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is a bacterial infection that typically presents with widespread blistering and erythema, which is not consistent with this patient's presentation. Based on the above analysis, the most likely diagnosis is bullous pemphigoid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Neutrophils, fibrin, edema, and microvesicle formation at these sites are characteristic of early disease. Older lesions may demonstrate nonspecific features of a subepidermal bulla or an excoriated papule. Because the clinical and histologic features of this disease can be variable and resemble those of other subepidermal blistering disorders, the diagnosis is confirmed by direct immunofluorescence microscopy of normal-appearing perilesional skin. Such studies demonstrate granular deposits of IgA (with or without complement components) in the papillary dermis and along the epidermal basement membrane zone. IgA deposits in the skin are unaffected by control of disease with medication; however, these immunoreactants diminish in intensity or disappear in patients maintained for long periods on a strict gluten-free diet (see below).

Because many patients with MMP exhibit no evidence of circulating basement membrane autoantibodies, testing of perilesional skin is important diagnostically. Although MMP was once thought to be a single nosologic entity, it is now largely regarded as a disease phenotype that may develop as a consequence of an autoimmune reaction to a variety of molecules in the epidermal basement membrane (e.g., BPAG2, laminin-332, type VII collagen, and other antigens yet to be completely defined).

            "content": "Individuals with the characteristics listed in Table 97-3 are at particular risk for nutritional deficiencies. Physical Examination Physical findings that suggest vitamin, mineral, and protein-energy deficiencies and excesses are outlined in Table 97-4. Most of the physical findings are not specific for individual nutrient deficiencies and must be integrated with historic, anthropometric, and laboratory findings. For example, follicular hyperkeratosis on the back of the arms is a fairly common, normal finding. However, if it is widespread in a person who consumes few fruits and vegetables and smokes regularly (increasing ascorbic acid requirements), vitamin C deficiency is likely. Similarly, easily pluck-able hair may be a consequence of chemotherapy but suggests acute malnutrition/kwashiorkor in a hospitalized patient who has poorly healing surgical wounds and hypoalbuminemia."

            "content": "The following three brief scenarios of a patient with hemoptysis demonstrate three distinct patterns: A 46-year-old man presents to his internist with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

The glomerular tuft shows proliferative changes with numerous poly-morphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), with a crescentic reaction (arrow) in severe cases (A). These deposits localize in the mesangium and along the capillary wall in a subepithelial pattern and stain dominantly for C3 and to a lesser extent for IgG (B). Subepithelial hump-shaped deposits are seen by electron microscopy (arrow) (C). (ABF/Vanderbilt Collection.)"

            "content": "Focused History: BJ reports episodes of exertional chest pain in the last few months, but they were less severe and of short duration. He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

The patient\u2019s temperature was normal. He explained that the episode had occurred following a birthday party at which he had participated in an ice cream\u2013eating contest. The patient reported prior episodes of a similar nature following ingestion of a significant amount of dairy products. This clinical picture is most probably due to a deficiency in the activity of: A. isomaltase. B. lactase. C. pancreatic \u03b1-amylase. D. salivary \u03b1-amylase. E. sucrase. Correct answer = B. The physical symptoms suggest a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for carbohydrate degradation. The symptoms observed following the ingestion of dairy products suggest that the patient is deficient in lactase as a result of the age-dependent reduction in expression of the enzyme."
