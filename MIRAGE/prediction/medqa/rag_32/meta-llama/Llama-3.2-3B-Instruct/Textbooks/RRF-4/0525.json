He reports that he gets tired easily compared to his baseline and feels dizzy when he exerts himself (e.g., when he walks long distances). His past medical history is significant for hypertension that is controlled with lisinopril. A physical examination demonstrates moderate hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy. His laboratory studies are shown below.\n\nLeukocyte count and differential:\nLeukocyte count: 11,500/mm^3\nSegmented neutrophils: 40%\nBands: 3%\nEosinophils: 1%\nBasophils: 0%\nLymphocytes: 50%\nMonocytes: 8%\n\nHemoglobin: 11.2 g/dL\nPlatelet count: 120,000/mm^3\nMean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration: 31%\nMean corpuscular volume: 80 \u00b5m^3\nReticulocyte count: 3%\nLactate dehydrogenase: 45 U/L\n\nA subsequent flow cytometry test demonstrates CD20+ cells.

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: ``` { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with fatigue, dizziness, moderate hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. The laboratory studies show a high lymphocyte count with a low reticulocyte count, which suggests a lymphoproliferative disorder. The CD20+ cells on flow cytometry test are indicative of a B-cell disorder. The presence of moderate hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy can be seen in various B-cell disorders, including hairy cell leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is normal, which makes anemia due to bone marrow failure less likely. The low lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level also suggests a less aggressive disease process. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is hairy cell leukemia, which is a type of B-cell leukemia that is characterized by the presence of hairy cells on flow cytometry.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" } ``` The reasoning behind this answer is as follows: * The patient's symptoms of fatigue and dizziness, combined with moderate hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy, suggest a lymphoproliferative disorder. * The high lymphocyte count with a low reticulocyte count is consistent with a B-cell disorder, as lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell produced by the bone marrow. * The presence of CD20+ cells on flow cytometry test is a hallmark of B-cell disorders, including hairy cell leukemia and CLL. * The normal MCV and low LDH level suggest that the anemia is not due to bone marrow failure, and the disease process is not very aggressive. * Hairy cell leukemia is a type of B-cell leukemia that is characterized by the presence of hairy cells on flow cytometry, and it is a common cause of lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly in adults.",

Many patients are asymptomatic at presentation, and the disease is usually detected by the discovery of splenic enlargement and/or abnormal blood counts during a routine examination. However, in contrast to its companion MPN, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss are common presenting complaints. A blood smear will show the characteristic features of extramedullary hematopoiesis: teardrop-shaped red cells, nucleated red cells, myelocytes, and promyelocytes; myeloblasts may also be present (Fig. 131-1). Anemia, usually mild initially, is the rule, whereas the leukocyte and platelet counts are either normal or increased, but either can be depressed. Mild hepatomegaly may accompany the splenomegaly but is unusual in the absence of splenic enlargement; isolated lymphadenopathy should suggest another diagnosis. Both serum lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase levels can be elevated. The LAP score can be low, normal, or high. Marrow is"

            "content": "Laboratory testing is likely to identify the cause of chronic fatigue in only about 5% of cases. Beyond a few standard screening tests, laboratory evaluation should be guided by the history and physical examination; extensive testing is more likely to lead to false-positive results that require explanation and unnecessary investigation and should be avoided in lieu of frequent clinical follow-up. A reasonable approach to screening includes a complete blood count with differential (to screen for anemia, infection, and malignancy), electrolytes (including sodium, potassium, and calcium), glucose, renal function, liver function, and thyroid function. Testing for HIV and adrenal function can also be considered. Published guidelines defining chronic fatigue syndrome also recommend an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) as part of the evaluation for mimics, but unless the value is very high, such nonspecific testing in the absence of other features is unlikely to clarify the situation."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

Plasma Na+ concentration was initially 129 meq/L, decreasing within 3 days to 118\u2013120 meq/L despite fluid restriction to 1 L/d. A chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a right 2.8 \u00d7 1.6 cm infrahilar mass and postobstructive pneumonia. The patient was an active smoker. Past medical history was notable for laryngeal carcinoma treated 15 years prior with radiation therapy, renal cell carcinoma, peripheral vascular disease, and hypothyroidism. On review of systems, he denied headache, nausea, and vomiting. He had chronic hip pain, managed with acetaminophen with codeine. Other medications included cilostazol, amoxicillin/clavulanate, digoxin, diltiazem, and thyroxine. He was euvolemic on examination, with no lymphadenopathy and a normal chest examination.

            "content": "The thoughtful use of screening tests (e.g., measurement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) may be of great value. A group of laboratory values can conveniently be obtained with a single specimen at relatively low cost. Screening tests are most informative when they are directed toward common diseases or disorders and when their results indicate whether other useful\u2014but often costly\u2014tests or interventions are needed. On the one hand, biochemical measurements, together with simple laboratory determinations such as blood count, urinalysis, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, often provide a major clue to the presence of a pathologic process. On the other hand, the physician must learn to evaluate occasional screening-test abnormalities that do not necessarily connote significant disease. An in-depth workup after the report of an isolated laboratory abnormality in a person who is otherwise well is almost invariably wasteful and unproductive. Because so many tests are performed"

            "content": "Anemia is unusual, but a mild neutrophilic leukocytosis is not. The blood smear is most remarkable for the number of platelets present, some of which may be very large. The large mass of circulating platelets may prevent the accurate measurement of serum potassium due to release of platelet potassium upon blood clotting. This type of hyperkalemia is a laboratory artifact and not associated with electrocardiographic abnormalities. Similarly, arterial oxygen measurements can be inaccurate unless thrombocythemic blood is collected on ice. The prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times are normal, whereas abnormalities of platelet function such as a prolonged bleeding time and impaired platelet aggregation can be present. However, despite much study, no platelet function abnormality is characteristic of ET, and no platelet function test predicts the risk of clinically significant bleeding or thrombosis."

He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

Laboratory Findings The white blood cell count is usually elevated and peaks at 10,000\u201320,000/\u03bcL during the second or third week of illness. Lymphocytosis is usually demonstrable, with >10% atypical lymphocytes. The latter cells are enlarged lymphocytes that have abundant cytoplasm, vacuoles, and indentations of the cell membrane (Fig. 218-2). CD8+ cells predominate among the atypical lymphocytes. Low-grade neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are common during the first month of illness. Liver function is abnormal in >90% of cases. Serum levels of aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase are usually mildly elevated. The serum concentration of bilirubin is elevated in ~40% of cases."

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension.
