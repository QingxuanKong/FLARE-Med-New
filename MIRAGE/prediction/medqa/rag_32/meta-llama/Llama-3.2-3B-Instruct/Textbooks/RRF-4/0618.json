The patient\u2019s son adds that his father has been having some behavioral problems, as well, and that he was complaining about bugs crawling over his skin this morning even though there were no insects. Past medical history is unremarkable. No current medications. The patient was an alcoholic for several years but abruptly quit drinking 5 days ago.

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Based on the provided medical history and physical examination, the patient presents with symptoms of delirium tremens (DTs), a severe form of alcohol withdrawal. The patient's history of recent alcohol cessation, fever, agitation, confusion, and hallucinations (as evidenced by the complaint of bugs crawling over his skin) are consistent with DTs. The patient's vital signs, such as the elevated temperature, tachycardia, and hypertension, are also indicative of a severe withdrawal syndrome. The appropriate initial treatment for DTs typically involves the use of benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are effective in reducing the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including agitation, hallucinations, and delirium. Let's evaluate the options: A. Chlorpromazine: This is an antipsychotic medication, which may be used to treat hallucinations but is not the first-line treatment for DTs. B. Clonidine: This medication is often used to treat hypertension and anxiety but is not typically used as a first-line treatment for DTs. C. Diazepam: This is a benzodiazepine that is commonly used to treat DTs and is the preferred initial treatment for this patient. D. Haloperidol: This is an antipsychotic medication that may be used to treat agitation and hallucinations but is not the first-line treatment for DTs. Given the patient's presentation, the most appropriate initial course of treatment is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of delirium tremens, a severe form of alcohol withdrawal. The appropriate initial treatment for DTs is a benzodiazepine. Among the options, Diazepam is a commonly used benzodiazepine for treating DTs and is the preferred initial treatment for this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The idea that 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F) is the normal human body temperature dates back to the nineteenth century and was initially based on axillary measurements. Rectal temperatures more accurately reflect the core body temperature and are 0.4\u00b0C (0.7\u00b0F) and 0.8\u00b0C (1.4\u00b0F) higher than oral and axillary temperatures, respectively. Although the definition of fever varies greatly throughout the medical literature, the most common definition, which is based on studies defining fever of unknown origin (Chap. 26), uses a temperature \u226538.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F). Although fever is very commonly associated with infection, it is also documented in many other diseases (Chap. 23). For every 1\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) increase in core temperature, the heart rate typically rises by 15\u201320 beats/min. Table 144-1 lists infections that are associated with relative"

Case 4: Hypoglycemia, Hyperketonemia, and Liver Dysfunction Patient Presentation: AK, a 59-year-old male with slurred speech, ataxia (loss of skeletal muscle coordination), and abdominal pain, was dropped off at the Emergency Department (ED). Focused History: AK is known to the ED staff from previous visits. He has a 6year history of chronic, excessive alcohol consumption. He is not known to take illicit drugs. At this ED visit, AK reports that he has been drinking heavily in the past day or so. He cannot recall having eaten anything in that time. There is evidence of recent vomiting, but no blood is apparent."

In more severe HF, the patient must sit upright, may have labored breathing, and may not be able to finish a sentence because of shortness of breath. Systolic blood pressure may be normal or high in early HF, but it generally is reduced in advanced HF because of severe LV dysfunction. The pulse pressure may be diminished, reflecting a reduction in stroke volume. Sinus tachycardia is a nonspecific sign caused by increased adrenergic activity. Peripheral vasoconstriction leading to cool peripheral extremities and cyanosis of the lips and nail beds is also caused by excessive adrenergic activity."

Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."

His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented.

Fever is most often the result of a systemic infection such as pneumonia or bacterial meningitis or viral encephalitis. An excessively high body temperature (42\u00b0C [107.6\u00b0F] or 43\u00b0C [109.4\u00b0F]) associated with dry skin should arouse suspicion of heat stroke or intoxication by a drug with anticholinergic activity. Fever should not be too easily ascribed to a brain lesion that has disturbed the temperature-regulating center, so-called central fever, which is a rare occurrence. Hypothermia is observed in patients with alcohol or barbiturate intoxication, drowning, exposure to cold, peripheral circulatory failure, advanced tuberculous meningitis, and myxedema."

Older patients with comorbidities (including cardiovascular disease) or predisposing factors often require inpatient fluid and electrolyte replacement, monitoring, and reassessment. The clinical manifestations of heatstroke reflect a total loss of thermo-regulatory function. Typical vital-sign abnormalities include tachypnea, various tachycardias, hypotension, and a widened pulse pressure. Although there is no single specific diagnostic test, the historical and physical triad of exposure to a heat stress, CNS dysfunction, and a core temperature >40.5\u00b0C helps establish the preliminary diagnosis."

The patient\u2019s temperature is \u226539\u00b0C and may be as high as 43\u00b0C. The first fever episode often ends in a crisis lasting ~15\u201330 min and consisting of rigors, a further elevation in temperature, and increases in pulse and blood pressure. The crisis phase is followed by profuse diaphoresis, falling temperature, and hypotension, which usually persist for several hours. In LBRF, the first episode of fever is unremitting for 3\u20136 days; it is usually followed by a single milder episode. In TBRF, multiple febrile periods last 1\u20133 days each. In both forms, the interval between fevers ranges from 4 to 14 days, sometimes with symptoms of malaise and fatigue."
