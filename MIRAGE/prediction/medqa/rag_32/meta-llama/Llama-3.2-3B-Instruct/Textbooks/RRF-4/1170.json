    "question": "A 33-year-old man presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. He was at work as a construction worker when his coworkers found him down at the work site. The patient recently underwent anesthesia for an appendectomy several months ago. He also has a past medical history of schizophrenia well controlled with haloperidol and is currently taking phenytoin for epilepsy. He is also currently taking propranolol for anxiety and hyperthyroidism. His temperature is 106\u00b0F (41.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 109/62 mmHg, pulse is 170/min, respirations are 23/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an altered man with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 10. He has minimal muscle tone and is incoherent when answering questions. The patient is covered in sweat and dirt. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with altered mental status, high fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, which are classic symptoms of a severe systemic illness. The patient's history of recent anesthesia for an appendectomy and current medication regimen, including phenytoin, haloperidol, and propranolol, suggests a potential link to a medication-related adverse reaction. The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10 indicates severe impairment of consciousness. The patient's symptoms of excessive sweating and dirtiness on the body also suggest a hyperthermic state. Considering the combination of altered mental status, fever, tachycardia, and muscle rigidity, the most likely diagnosis is Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a rare but life-threatening side effect of antipsychotic medications like haloperidol. The patient's history of schizophrenia and current medication regimen make NMS a plausible explanation for his symptoms. The other options, Exertional Heat Stroke, Malignant Hyperthermia, and Thyroid Storm, are less likely given the patient's presentation and medical history.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"} ``` The final answer is C.",

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

Occurring, as it often does, during an infection with fever or in the course of a toxic or metabolic disorder (such as renal or hepatic failure) or as an effect of medication, drugs, or alcohol, it never fails to create problems for the physician, nurses, and family. The physician has to cope with the problem of diagnosis, often without the advantage of a lucid history, and any program of therapy is constantly impeded by the patient\u2019s inattention, agitation, sleeplessness, and inability to cooperate. Nurses are burdened with the need to provide satisfactory care and a safe environment for the patient, and at the same time, maintain a tranquil atmosphere for other patients. The family must be supported as it faces the frightening prospect of a deranged mind with peculiar behaviors and all it signifies."

One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC).

Persons who accompany the comatose patient to the hospital should be encouraged to remain until they have been questioned. In addition to the basic laboratory tests that apply to coma, a toxicology screen is usually appropriate."

Circulation can be assessed via observation (heart rate, skin color, mental status) and palpation (pulse quality, capillary refill, skin temperature) and restored (via two large peripheral intravenous lines, when possible) while control of bleeding is accomplished through the use of direct pressure. Assessment for disabilities (D),including neurologic status, includes examination of pupil size and reactivity, a brief mental status assessment (AVPU\u2014alert; responds to voice; responds to pain; unresponsive), and examination of extremity movement to assess for spinal cord injury. The Glasgow Coma Scale can direct decisions regarding the initiation of cerebral resuscitation in patients with suspected closed head injuries (Table 42-1). E, which stands for exposure,requires a full assessment of the patient by completely disrobing the child for a detailed examination of the entire body. The examiner should ensure a neutral thermal environment to prevent hypothermia."

As halothane or a similar inhalational anesthesia is induced, or succinylcholine is given for muscular relaxation, the jaw muscles unexpectedly become tense rather than relaxed and soon rigidity extends to all of the muscles. Thereafter, the body temperature rises to 42\u00e7C or 43\u00e7C and there is tachypnea and tachycardia. Blood pH may fall to 7 or below. There may be gross myoglobinuria and serum CK reaches extraordinarily high levels. Circulatory collapse and death may ensue in approximately 10 percent of cases, or the patient may survive with gradual recovery. In some cases there is the same sequence of events (increased temperature and acidosis) without muscular spasm. In cases of early death, the muscle may appear normal by light microscopy. With survival for several days, samples of muscle reveal scattered segmental necrosis and phagocytosis of"
