She is sexually active with multiple partners and admits to using barrier protection inconsistently. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago.

The patient presents with vaginal discharge, pruritus, and painful micturition, which are common symptoms of a vaginal infection. The presence of a profuse, greenish-yellow, purulent, malodorous discharge is highly suggestive of an anaerobic infection, which is consistent with trichomoniasis. The patient's history of inconsistent barrier protection and multiple sexual partners further increases the likelihood of a sexually transmitted infection. The vaginal pH of 5.5 is also consistent with trichomoniasis, as the normal vaginal pH is typically less than 4.5. The absence of fever, chills, abdominal pain, menorrhagia, or flank pain helps to rule out other potential diagnoses such as urinary tract infection or pelvic inflammatory disease. The fact that the patient is afebrile and has normal vital signs also supports this diagnosis. Therefore, based on the patient's presentation, the most likely diagnosis is trichomoniasis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

The parasite, which exists only in trophozoite form, is an anaerobe that has the ability to generate hydrogen to combine with oxygen to create an anaerobic environment. It often accompanies BV, which can be diagnosed in as many as 60% of patients with trichomonas vaginitis (17).

Her vital signs include the following: temperature 99.8\u00b0F, blood pressure 132/64 mm Hg, pulse 78 bpm, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, she had left upper abdominal tenderness with evidence of hepatomegaly and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory data revealed the following: alanine aminotransferase, 527 IU/L (normal 10\u201335 IU/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 425 IU/L (normal < 35 IU/L); and bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL (normal 0.1\u20130.3 mg/dL).

KH, a 55-year-old woman, presents to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and complaints of new-onset flu symptoms over the past several days. Her past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis and chronic lower back pain secondary to a work-related fall 2 years ago. Her"

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

When a speculum examination is required,it must be performed before bimanual palpation of internalgenitalia because lubricants interfere with the evaluationof microscopic and microbiologic samples. The speculumallows visualization of the vaginal walls and cervical os forcollection of appropriate specimens, such as cultures orPapanicolaou (Pap) smears. A Pap smear is not needed untilthe adolescent is sexually active, unless there is a history ofsexual abuse or vulvar infection with human papillomavirus. In the rare circumstance that a vaginal examination isnecessary in a virginal girl, a Huffman (0.5 in. \u00d7 4.5 in.) orPederson (0.9 in. \u00d7 4.5 in.) speculum should be used. A non-virginal introitus frequently admits a small to medium-sizedadult speculum."

An adolescent who presents with excessive bleeding should have a pelvic examination if she had intercourse, if the results of a pregnancy test are positive, if she has abdominal pain, if she is markedly anemic, or if she is bleeding heavily enough to compromise hemodynamic stability. The pelvic examination occasionally may be deferred in young teenagers who have a classic history of irregular cycles soon after menarche, who have normal hematocrit levels, who deny sexual activity, and who will reliably return for follow-up. A pelvic examination may be deferred in adolescents who present to the office requesting oral contraceptives before the initiation of intercourse or at the patient\u2019s request, even if she has had intercourse.
