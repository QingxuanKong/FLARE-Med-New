    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's analyze the given information step by step.\\n\\nThe patient is a 28-year-old man who presents with dizziness and palpitations after attending a bachelor party where he lost several drinking games. This suggests that alcohol consumption may have played a role in his symptoms.\\n\\nThe electrocardiogram (ECG) findings are not explicitly described, but we can make some inferences based on the options provided.\\n\\nLet's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: This condition is characterized by rapid and irregular heart rhythms, often caused by atrial fibrillation. While it can cause dizziness and palpitations, it is less likely to be directly related to alcohol consumption.\\n\\nB. Brugada syndrome: This is a genetic disorder that affects the heart's electrical system, leading to abnormal heart rhythms. It is often associated with a specific ECG pattern, but the description does not match the provided ECG findings.\\n\\nC. Ventricular tachycardia: This is a fast heart rhythm that originates in the ventricles. It can be caused by various factors, including alcohol consumption. The ECG pattern for ventricular tachycardia is often wide and irregular, but it is not specifically mentioned in the question.\\n\\nD. Sick sinus syndrome: This condition affects the sinoatrial node, leading to abnormal heart rhythms. While it can cause dizziness and palpitations, it is less likely to be directly related to alcohol consumption.\\n\\nGiven the context of recent alcohol consumption and the symptoms of dizziness and palpitations, the most likely diagnosis is ventricular tachycardia (C). The ECG pattern is not explicitly described, but the options suggest that a wide and irregular rhythm is present, which is consistent with ventricular tachycardia.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is C. Ventricular tachycardia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

The test consists of a standardized incremental increase in external workload (Table 293-2) while symptoms, the ECG, and arm blood pressure are monitored. Exercise duration is usually symptom-limited, and the test is discontinued upon evidence of chest discomfort, severe shortness of breath, dizziness, severe fatigue, ST-segment depression >0.2 mV (2 mm), a fall in systolic blood pressure >10 mmHg, or the development of a ventricular tachyarrhythmia. This test is used to discover any limitation in exercise performance, detect typical ECG signs of myocardial ischemia, and establish their relationship to chest discomfort. The ischemic ST-segment response generally is defined as flat or downsloping depression of the ST segment >0.1 mV below baseline (i.e., the PR"

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Dyspnea may occur with multiple conditions considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain and thus is not discriminative, but the presence of dyspnea is important because it suggests a cardiopulmonary etiology.

The patient had no significant adverse effects from this dosage. At age 21, she had a second tonic-clonic seizure while in college; further discussion with her room-mate at that time revealed a history of two recent episodes of 1\u20132 minutes of altered consciousness with lip smacking (focal impaired awareness seizure, formerly complex partial seizure). A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid. Four days later, electroencephalography (EEG)"

            "content": "A 76-year-old retired banker complains of a shuffling gait with occasional falls over the last year. He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

            "content": "In this patient, compression of the left external iliac veins by the gravid uterus was the likely cause of stasis, which led to the deep vein thrombosis. The chest pain was due to pulmonary emboli. Small emboli were thrown off from the leading edge of the thrombus through the heart to lodge in the lungs. Small emboli cause typical pleuritic chest pain, which is exacerbated by breathing. In isolation these small pulmonary emboli may affect respiratory function, but they may be the precursor to a large and potentially fatal pulmonary embolus (eFig. 6.143). Anticoagulation was instituted and the patient had an uneventful delivery. A 45-year-old man had recently taken up squash. During a game he attempted a forehand shot and noticed severe sudden pain in his heel. He thought his opponent had hit him with his racket. When he turned, though, he realized his opponent was too far away to have hit him."

Interestingly, the height of the patient and the previous lens surgery would suggest a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and a series of blood tests and review of the family history revealed this was so. A 35-year-old male patient presented to his family practitioner because of recent weight loss (14 lb over the previous 2 months). He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets."
