His past medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which was diagnosed last year. He also experienced a head trauma 5 years ago, which has been complicated by residual seizures. His only medication is daily phenytoin, which was restarted after he had a seizure 3 months ago. His temperature is 36.8\u2103 (98.2\u2109). On physical examination, multiple non-tender lymph nodes, averaging 2 cm in diameter, are found to be palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. No other lymphadenopathy is noted. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show the following:\nHemoglobin 14 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 8000/mm3 with a normal differential\nPlatelet count 250,000/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 40 mm/h\nAn excisional biopsy of one of the cervical lymph nodes is performed.

He has been experiencing painless swelling of the neck for the past week, with multiple non-tender lymph nodes averaging 2 cm in diameter in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. The patient's temperature is normal, and he has no recent fevers, night sweats, or weight loss.\\n\\nThe patient's past medical history is significant for head trauma 5 years ago, which has been complicated by residual seizures, and he is currently taking daily phenytoin for seizure control.\\n\\nThe physical examination and laboratory studies show a normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.\\n\\nThe excisional biopsy of one of the cervical lymph nodes has been performed, and the histopathologic analysis is pending.\\n\\nNow, let's evaluate the potential choices:\\n\\nA. Acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL): ALL is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow that is characterized by the overproduction of immature white blood cells. While ALL can cause lymphadenopathy, it is more commonly associated with fever, weight loss, and bone marrow failure.\\n\\nB. Classical Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (HL): HL is a type of lymphoma that is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells. It is more common in older adults, and the patient's age and lack of systemic symptoms make this a less likely diagnosis.\\n\\nC. HIV lymphadenopathy: HIV lymphadenopathy is a common finding in patients with HIV infection, but it is typically associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The patient's normal temperature and lack of these symptoms make this a less likely diagnosis.\\n\\nD. Phenytoin-induced adenopathy: Phenytoin can cause lymphadenopathy as a side effect, especially with long-term use. The patient's history of seizure control with phenytoin and the presence of painless lymphadenopathy make this a possible diagnosis.\\n\\nBased on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory studies, the most likely diagnosis is phenytoin-induced adenopathy.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"D\"}}",

            "content": "The physician will be aided in the pursuit of an explanation for the lymphadenopathy by a careful medical history, physical examination, selected laboratory tests, and perhaps an excisional lymph node biopsy. The medical history should reveal the setting in which lymphadenopathy is occurring. Symptoms such as sore throat, cough, fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, or pain in the nodes should be sought. The patient\u2019s age, sex, occupation, exposure to pets, sexual behavior, and use of drugs such as diphenylhydantoin are other important historic points. For example, children and young adults usually have benign (i.e., nonmalignant) disorders that account for the observed lymphadenopathy such as viral or bacterial upper respiratory infections; infectious mononucleosis; toxoplasmosis; and, in some countries, tuberculosis. In contrast, after age 50, the incidence of malignant disorders increases and that of benign disorders decreases."

It is also a common manifestation of diffuse diseases of the body, which include lymphoma, sarcoidosis, and certain types of viral infection such as glandular fever and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Evaluation of cervical lymph nodes is extremely important in determining the nature and etiology of the primary disease process that has produced nodal enlargement. Clinical evaluation includes a general health assessment, particularly relating to symptoms from the head and neck. Examination of the nodes themselves often gives the clinician a clue as to the nature of the pathological process. Soft, tender, and inflamed lymph nodes suggest an acute inflammatory process, which is most likely to be infective."

At least 80% of patients present with extranodal disease, and a similar percentage have B-type symptoms of fever, night sweats, or weight loss. Virtually any site in the body may be involved. The most common extranodal site is the CNS, which is involved in approximately one-third of all patients with lymphoma. Approximately 60% of these cases are primary CNS lymphoma. Primary CNS lymphoma generally presents with focal neurologic deficits, including cranial nerve findings, headaches, and/or seizures. MRI or CT generally reveals a limited number (one to three) of 3to 5-cm lesions (Fig. 226-44). The lesions often show ring enhancement on contrast administration and may occur in any location. Contrast enhancement is usually less pronounced than that seen with toxoplasmosis."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

Hematogenous and lymphatic dissemination (stage 1 disease) is marked by the onset of fever. Typically, bouts of high temperatures lasting several days are separated by afebrile periods. Lymphadenopathy is prominent in T. b. gambiense trypanosomiasis. The nodes are discrete, movable, rubbery, and nontender. Cervical nodes are often visible, and enlargement of the nodes of the posterior cervical triangle, or Winterbottom\u2019s sign, is a classic finding. Pruritus and maculopapular rashes are common. Inconstant findings include malaise, headache, arthralgias, weight loss, edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and tachycardia. The differential diagnosis of stage 1 HAT includes many diseases that are common in the tropics and are associated with fevers. HIV infection, malaria, and typhoid fever are common in populations at risk for HAT and need to be considered."

The primary lesion, a small (0.3to 1-cm) painless erythematous papule or pustule, develops at the inoculation site (usually the site of a scratch or a bite) within days to 2 weeks in about one-third to two-thirds of patients (Fig. 197\u20131A, B). Lymphadenopathy develops 1\u20133 weeks or longer after cat contact. The affected lymph node(s) are enlarged and usually painful, sometimes have overlying erythema, and suppurate in 10\u201315% of cases (Fig. 197\u20131C, D, and E). Axillary/epitrochlear nodes are most commonly involved; next in frequency are head/neck nodes and then inguinal/femoral nodes. Approximately 50% of patients have fever, malaise, and anorexia. A smaller proportion experience weight loss and night sweats mimicking the presentation of lymphoma. Fever is usually low-grade but infrequently rises to \u226539\u00b0C. Resolution is slow, requiring weeks (for fever, pain, and accompanying signs and symptoms) to months (for node shrinkage)."

Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice?

Acute cervical lymphadenopathy associated with pharyngitis is characterized by small and rubbery lymph nodes in the anterior cervical chain with minimal to moderate tenderness. Suppurative cervical lymphadenitis, frequently caused by S. aureus or group A streptococcus, shows erythema and warmth of the overlying skin with moderate to exquisite tenderness."

The clinical manifestations of TB in HIV-infected patients are quite varied and generally show different patterns as a function of the CD4+ T cell count. In patients with relatively high CD4+ T cell counts, the typical pattern of pulmonary reactivation occurs: patients present with fever, cough, dyspnea on exertion, weight loss, night sweats, and a chest x-ray revealing cavitary apical disease of the upper lobes. In patients with lower CD4+ T cell counts, disseminated disease is more common. In these patients the chest x-ray may reveal diffuse or lower-lobe bilateral reticulonodular infiltrates consistent with miliary spread, pleural effusions, and hilar and/or mediastinal adenopathy. Infection may be present in bone, brain, meninges, GI tract, lymph nodes (particularly cervical lymph nodes), and viscera. Some patients with advanced HIV infection and active TB may"

While indicated in patients with CD4+ T cell counts <200/\u03bcL, lymph node biopsy is not indicated in patients with early-stage disease unless there are signs and symptoms of systemic illness, such as fever and weight loss, or unless the nodes begin to enlarge, become fixed, or coalesce.
