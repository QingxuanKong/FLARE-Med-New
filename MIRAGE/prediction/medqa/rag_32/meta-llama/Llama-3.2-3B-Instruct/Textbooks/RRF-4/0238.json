    "question": "A group of researchers decided to explore whether the estimates of incidence and prevalence rates of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were influenced by the number of years it took to examine administrative data. These estimates were not only based on hospital discharges, but also on physician billing codes. For study purposes, the researchers labeled incident cases at the initial occurrence of SLE diagnosis in the hospital database, while prevalent cases were those that were coded as harboring SLE at any time, with patients maintaining their diagnosis until death. Which statement is true regarding the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates during the time period that might be chosen for this specific study?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.",
        "B": "The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated.",
        "C": "The inclusion of attack rates would increase incidence estimates in longer time periods.",
        "D": "The inclusion of attack rates would decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods."
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's first define incidence and prevalence rates in the context of epidemiology. Incidence rate refers to the number of new cases that develop in a specified time period among a population at risk. Prevalence rate, on the other hand, refers to the total number of cases (new and existing) present in a population at a given time. The choice of time period for studying incidence and prevalence can significantly impact the estimates of these rates. If the time period is too short, it may not capture all the cases that develop during the study period, leading to underestimation of incidence. Conversely, a longer time period may capture more cases but also include some existing cases, potentially leading to overestimation of prevalence. Given that the researchers are examining the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates during a specific time period, it is likely that they are trying to determine whether the choice of time period affects these estimates. The correct answer can be determined by understanding how the inclusion of attack rates (i.e., new cases) in the time period affects the estimates of incidence and prevalence. Attack rates are typically higher in shorter time periods, as they include only the new cases that develop during the study period. Including attack rates in a longer time period would decrease the incidence estimates, as it would capture fewer new cases. In contrast, the prevalence rate would be higher in a longer time period, as it would include both new and existing cases. Therefore, the correct answer is that the inclusion of attack rates would decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

These antibodies form immune complexes that become trapped in the microvasculature, leading to inflammation and ischemia. Although SLE affects primarily women of childbearing age, approximately 5% of cases present in childhood, mainly around puberty. SLE is rare in children younger than 9 years of age. Although there is a female predominance of this disease in adolescence and adulthood, there is an equal gender distribution in children.

Or, the disease may irst be multisystem. Frequent findings are malaise, fever, arthritis, rash, pleuropericarditis, photosensitivity, anemia, and cognitive dysfunction. At least half of patients have renal involvement. SLE is also associated with declines in attention, memory, and reasoning (Hahn, 2015; Kozora, 2008)."

            "content": "Patients with any of the above lesions also can transform to another lesion; hence patients often require reevaluation, including repeat renal biopsy. Lupus patients with class VI lesions have greater than 90% sclerotic glomeruli and end-stage renal disease with interstitial fibrosis. As a group, approximately 20% of patients with lupus nephritis will reach end-stage disease, requiring dialysis or transplantation. Systemic lupus tends to become quiescent once there is renal failure, perhaps due to the immunosuppressant effects of uremia. However, patients with lupus nephritis have a markedly increased mortality compared with the general population. Renal transplantation in renal failure from lupus, usually performed after approximately 6 months of inactive disease, results in allograft survival rates comparable to patients transplanted for other reasons."

Evidence that glucocorticoid therapy is life-saving comes from retrospective studies from the predialysis era; survival was significantly better in people with DPGN treated with high-dose daily glucocorticoids (40\u201360 mg of prednisone daily for 4\u20136 months) versus lower doses. Currently, high doses are recommended for much shorter periods; recent trials of interventions for severe SLE use 4\u20136 weeks of 0.5\u20131 mg/kg per day of prednisone or equivalent.

            "content": "The term subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus refers to a group intermediate between SLE and lupus erythematosus localized only to skin. The skin rash in this disease tends to be widespread and superficial. Most patients have mild systemic symptoms similar to those in SLE. There is a strong association with antibodies to the SS-A antigen and with the HLA-DR3 genotype. An SLE-like syndrome may develop in patients receiving a variety of drugs, including hydralazine, procainamide, isoniazid, and D-penicillamine. Surprisingly, anti-TNF therapy, which is effective in rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, also can cause drug-induced lupus. Many of these drugs are associated with the development of ANAs, especially antibodies specific for his-tones. The disease remits after withdrawal of the offending drug. http://ebooksmedicine.net SLEisasystemicautoimmunediseasecausedbyautoantibodiesproducedagainstnumerousselfantigensandtheformationofimmunecomplexes."

Age-and gender-adjusted mortality rates are fivefold to eightfold higher compared to the general population, and more than half of all patients with SSc die from their disease. In one population-based study of SSc, the median survival was 11 years. In patients with dcSSc, 5-and 10-year survival rates are 70% and 55%, respectively, whereas in patients with lcSSc, 5-and 10-year survival rates are 90% and 75%, respectively. The prognosis correlates with the extent of skin involvement, which itself is a surrogate for visceral organ involvement. Major causes of death are PAH, pulmonary fibrosis, gastrointestinal involvement, and cardiac disease. Scleroderma renal crisis is associated with a 30% 3-year mortality. Lung cancer and excess cardiovascular deaths also contribute to increased mortality. Markers of poor prognosis include male gender, African-American race, older age at disease onset, extensive skin thickening with"
