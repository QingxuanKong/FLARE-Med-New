The officer state that the man has been arrested multiple times for public alcohol intoxication, but recently became homeless. On exam, the man is behaving erratically. His vitals are all within normal limits. He appears confused and has a slurred speech. On gait exam, the patient is ataxic and cannot stand without support for more than a few seconds. Labs return with the following values: Na 140, K 4, Cl 106, BUN 8, Cr 2. His ABG has pH 7.3, PaCO2 13mm, PaO2 130mm, HCO3 7. His urinalysis is shown in Figure 1. Blood salicylate levels return as normal. While you await other diagnostic tests, which of the following should be administered next to treat this patient?",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the given question: The patient presents with symptoms of intoxication, including confusion, slurred speech, ataxia, and altered mental status, which are consistent with acute alcohol intoxication. However, the patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and the blood salicylate levels are normal, ruling out the possibility of salicylate poisoning. The patient's laboratory results show a metabolic acidosis with a low pH (7.3), low PaCO2 (13mmHg), and high PaO2 (130mmHg), which is consistent with a respiratory alkalosis. The anion gap is elevated at 10 meq/L, indicating the presence of an unmeasured anion, likely lactate or ketones. The patient's urinalysis shows a presence of ketones, which is consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or alcoholic ketoacidosis. However, the patient's history of homelessness and multiple arrests for public intoxication suggests chronic alcohol use, which is more likely to cause alcoholic ketoacidosis. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most appropriate treatment would be to administer ethanol (A) to treat the suspected alcoholic ketoacidosis. Ethanol is a specific antidote for alcoholic ketoacidosis, as it can help to drive the equilibrium of the ketoacidosis towards the formation of acetate, which is a less toxic compound. Naltrexone (B) is an opioid antagonist used to treat opioid dependence, which is not relevant in this case. Naloxone (C) is an opioid antagonist used to treat opioid overdose, which is also not relevant. Fomepizole (D) is a specific antidote for methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning, which is not indicated in this case. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Ethanol. Here's the output in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of intoxication, including confusion, slurred speech, ataxia, and altered mental status, which are consistent with acute alcohol intoxication.

            "content": "Similarly, normal values for [HCO3 -], Paco2, and pH do not ensure the absence of an acid-base disturbance. For instance, an alcoholic who has been vomiting may develop a metabolic alkalosis with a pH of 7.55, Paco2 of 47 mmHg, [HCO3 -] of 40 mmol/L, [Na+] of 135, [Cl-] of 80, and [K+] of 2.8. If such a patient were then to develop a superimposed alcoholic ketoacidosis with a \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate concentration of 15 mM, arterial pH would fall to 7.40, [HCO3 -] to 25 mmol/L, and the Paco2 to 40 mmHg. Although these blood gases are normal, the AG is elevated at 30 mmol/L, indicating a mixed metabolic alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. A mixture of high-gap acidosis and metabolic alkalosis is recognized easily by comparing the differences (\u2206 values) in the normal to prevailing patient values. In this example, the \u2206HCO3 is 0 (25 25 mmol/L), but the \u2206AG is 20 (30 \u2013 10 mmol/L). Therefore, 20 mmol/L is unaccounted for in the \u2206/\u2206 value (\u2206AG to \u2206HCO3 -)."

At first the patient merely appears drunk, but after a period of 4 to 12 h, hyperventilation and severe metabolic acidosis develop, followed by confusion, convulsions, coma, and renal failure and death in rapid succession. Cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis is a common but not invariable feature. The metabolic acidosis is a result of the conversion of ethylene glycol by ADH into glycolic acid, thus producing an anion gap that reflects the presence of this additional substance in the blood. (The anion gap has been defined in different ways, but the most convenient is the difference between the positive ion Na+ and the sum of negative ions, Cl\u2212 plus HCO3\u2212 [venous CO2 is used for the latter]; a value greater than 12 is considered a gap.)

            "content": "Clinical Manifestations of Concussion In its fullest form, the characteristic clinical signs of concussive brain injury are the immediate abolition of consciousness, suppression of supportive reflexes (falling to the ground if standing), transient arrest of respiration, a brief period of bradycardia, and fall in blood pressure following a momentary rise at the time of impact. Rarely, if these abnormalities are sufficiently intense, death may occur at the moment of impact, presumably from respiratory arrest. In its mildest form, there is no apparent loss of consciousness or collapse, only a brief period of stunned disorientation, staggering, and amnesia during which the individual appears outwardly normal. The vital signs usually return to normal and stabilize within a few seconds even if the patient remains unconscious."

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

Tossing about in the bed, reaching up toward the face, crossing legs, yawning, swallowing, coughing, or moaning reflect a drowsy state that is close to normal awakeness. Lack of restless movements on one side or an outturned leg suggests a hemiplegia. Intermittent twitching movements of a foot, finger, or facial muscle may be the only sign of seizures. Multifocal myoclonus almost always indicates a metabolic disorder, particularly uremia, anoxia, drug intoxication (especially with lithium or haloperidol), or a prion disease (Chap. 453e). In a drowsy and confused patient, bilateral asterixis is a certain sign of metabolic encephalopathy or drug intoxication."

Past medical history included schizophrenia, for which he required institutional care; treatment had included neuroleptics and intermittent lithium, the latter restarted 6 months before admission. The patient was treated with antibiotics and intubated for several days, with the development of polyuria (3\u20135 L/d), hypernatremia, and acute renal insufficiency; the peak plasma Na+ concentration was 156 meq/L, and peak creatinine was 2.6 mg/dL. Urine osmolality was measured once and reported as 157 mOsm/kg, with a coincident plasma osmolality of 318 mOsm/kg. Lithium was stopped on admission to the ICU. On physical examination, the patient was alert, extubated, and thirsty. Weight was 97.5 kg. Urine output for the previous 24 h had been 3.4 L, with an IV intake of 2 L/d of D5W."

In the remainder, certain points are useful: (1) the circumstances and rapidity with which neurologic symptoms developed; (2) the antecedent symptoms (confusion, weakness, headache, fever, seizures, dizziness, double vision, or vomiting); (3) the use of medications, drugs, or alcohol; and (4) chronic liver, kidney, lung, heart, or other medical disease. Direct interrogation of family, observers, and ambulance technicians on the scene, in person or by telephone, is an important part of the evaluation when possible."

            "content": "Laboratory examinations are highly informative in the investigation of the acquired metabolic diseases. In patients with symptoms suggestive of a metabolic encephalopathy the following determinations are usually made: serum Na, K, Cl, Ca, Mg, glucose, HCO3, renal function tests (blood urea nitrogen [BUN] and creatinine), liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], bilirubin, NH3), thyroid function tests (T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]), and osmolality and, in certain cases, oxygen saturation and blood gas determinations. These are almost always supplemented by toxicology tests and measurement of the serum concentrations of relevant medications as discussed in the next chapter. Serum osmolality can be measured directly or calculated from the values of Na, glucose, and BUN (in mg/dL), using the following formula:"

Of more practical value is the fact that almost all generalized convulsions produce a rise in serum creatine kinase activity that persists for hours, a finding that could be used to greater advantage in emergency departments to assist in distinguishing seizures from fainting. Of course, extensive muscle injury from a fall or prolonged compression during a period of unconsciousness can produce the same abnormality."

This is obvious in most cases but, as pointed out earlier, the mildest forms, particularly when some other alteration of personality is prominent, may be overlooked. Sometimes, the patient\u2019s attention can be best engaged by speaking softly or whispering rather than shouting or using a conversational amplitude of voice. A subtle disorder of orientation may be betrayed by an incorrect response regarding dates (off by more than one day of the month or day of the week), or in misnaming the hospital. The ability to retain a span of digits forward (normally 7) and backward (normally 5), spelling a word such as \u201cworld\u201d or \u201cearth\u201d forward and then backward, reciting the months of the year in their reverse order, and serial subtraction of 3s from 30 or 7s from 100 are useful bedside tests of the patient\u2019s capacity for attentiveness and sustained mental activity, though some of these presuppose that the patient is"

He is rushed to a nearby level 1 trauma center where he is found to have multiple facial fractures, a severe, unstable cervical spine injury, and significant left eye trauma. Further examination of his left eye reveals rupture of his globe. The ophthalmolo-gist requests emergency surgery to repair and save his eye. Because the patient has suffered a recent trauma, you decide to perform a rapid sequence intubation in preparation for the surgical procedure. What muscle relaxant would you use to facilitate tracheal intubation? What is the proper dose for your chosen muscle relaxant? After intravenous infusion of your chosen muscle relaxant, you are unable to adequately visualize the patient\u2019s larynx and vocal cords and cannot successfully pass an endotracheal tube.

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"
