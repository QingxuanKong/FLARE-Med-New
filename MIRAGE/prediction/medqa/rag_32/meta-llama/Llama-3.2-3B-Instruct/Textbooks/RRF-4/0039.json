After acute treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the patient is able to recover most of his speech. Subsequent neurologic exam finds that the patient is fluent while speaking and is able to comprehend both one and two step instructions. Noticeably the patient remains unable to complete tasks involving verbal repetition. Residual damage to which of the following structures is most likely responsible for this patient's syndrome?",

This suggests that the damage to the brain is not limited to the area responsible for speech production, but also affects the area responsible for speech comprehension and repetition. The patient's ability to comprehend one and two-step instructions indicates that the damage is not severe enough to affect the Wernicke's area, which is responsible for comprehension. The patient's fluent speech suggests that the Broca's area is intact. The inability to complete tasks involving verbal repetition suggests damage to the arcuate fasciculus, which connects the Broca's and Wernicke's areas. The arcuate fasciculus is responsible for the integration of speech production and comprehension, and damage to this area can result in difficulties with verbal repetition. The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and test results.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

In fact, reading of any material is greatly impaired. When the patient with alexia also has difficulty in auditory comprehension and in repeating spoken words, the syndrome corresponds more closely to Wernicke aphasia. In such cases, the individual loses the ability to understand written script, and, often, to name colors, that is, to match a seen color to its spoken name, visual verbal color anomia. Such a person can no longer name or point on command to words, although he is sometimes able to read letters or numbers. However, understanding spoken language, repetition of what is heard, writing spontaneously and to dictation, and conversation are all intact.

The fact that varying amounts of language function may remain after dominant hemispherectomy in adults with glioma also suggests a definite though limited capacity of the adult nondominant hemisphere for language production.

Comprehension is relatively preserved, but repetition is strikingly intact, distinguishing this syndrome from pure word mutism. Transcortical motor aphasia occurs in two clinical contexts: (1) in a mild or partially recovered Broca aphasia in which repetition remains superior to conversational speech (repeating and reading aloud are generally easier than self-generated speech) and (2) in states of abulia and akinetic mutism with frontal lobe damage. Several cases under our observation have resulted from infarctions in the watershed zone between the anterior and middle cerebral arteries after cardiac arrest or shock."

            "content": "Language is clearly affected in a restricted way in Broca aphasia. Speech is sparse (10 to 15 words per minute as compared with the normal 100 to 115 words per minute) and consists mainly of nouns, transitive verbs, or important adjectives; phrase length is abbreviated and many of the small words (articles, prepositions, conjunctions) are omitted, giving the speech an abbreviated, telegraphic character (so-called agrammatism). The substantive content of the patient\u2019s language permits the crude communication of ideas, sometimes despite gross expressive difficulties. Repetition of the examiner\u2019s spoken language is as abnormal as the patient\u2019s own speech. If a patient with nonfluent Broca aphasia has no difficulty in repetition, the condition is termed transcortical motor aphasia (see further on). Furthermore, a true defect in language production is evidenced by impairment in the content of written words and sentences. Should the right hand be paralyzed, the patient cannot print with the"

They must be able to observe with objectivity the patient\u2019s attention, intelligence, memory, judgment, mood, character, and other attributes of cognitive performance, and personality in much the same fashion as they observe the patient\u2019s movements, gait, and reflexes. The systematic examination of these intellectual and affective functions permits the physician to reach conclusions regarding the patient\u2019s mental status and its relationship to his illness. Without such data, there are likely to be errors in the diagnosis and treatment of the patient\u2019s neurologic, general medical, and psychiatric disease."

Treatment within 3 h of the onset of symptoms led to a 30 percent increase in the number of patients who remained with little or no neurologic deficit when examined 3 months after the stroke; this benefit persisted when assessed 1 year later in the study by Kwiatkowski and associates. Two aspects are notable: the benefits extended to all types of ischemic strokes, including those caused by occlusion of small vessels (lacunes), and improvement was not apparent in the days immediately following treatment, only when patients were examined at 3 months."

We have seen these episodes mainly with meningiomas and subdural hematomas; they have consisted of transient aphasia or speech arrest lasting from 2 min to several hours, but sensory symptoms with or without spread over the body, arm weakness, and hemiparesis have also been reported. Some remarkable cases of meningioma have involved repeated transient attacks for decades. Seizures are always suspected in these cases but are rarely proved. It has been speculated that a local vascular disturbance of some kind is operative, but the mechanism is not understood. As far as we can determine, mass lesions have not caused episodes that simulate posterior circulation TIAs."

Voss and colleagues, using sophisticated MRI diffusion tensor imaging, have shown axonal sprouting in the posterior parietal and midline cerebellar regions. They compared the results of tensor imaging to a patient who had been in a minimally conscious state for 6 years without improvement and to 20 normal individuals. Their findings are subject to several interpretations, but axonal growth in the parietal lobes offers a potential explanation for the few instances in which recovery from severe injury does occur. When combined with the findings of Laureys and colleagues, a case can be made for the posterior parietal regions as necessary for integrated consciousness and also raise the possibility that"
