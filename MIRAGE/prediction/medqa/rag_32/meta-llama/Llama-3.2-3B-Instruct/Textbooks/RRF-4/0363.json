            "content": "In addition to the examination of the thyroid itself, the physical examination should include a search for signs of abnormal thyroid function and the extrathyroidal features of ophthalmopathy and dermopathy (see below). Examination of the neck begins by inspecting the seated patient from the front and side and noting any surgical scars, obvious masses, or distended veins. The thyroid can be palpated with both hands from behind or while facing the patient, using the thumbs to palpate each lobe. It is best to use a combination of these methods, especially when nodules are small. The patient\u2019s neck should be slightly flexed to relax the neck muscles. After locating the cricoid cartilage, the isthmus, which is attached to the lower one-third of the thyroid lobes, can be identified and then followed laterally to locate either lobe (normally, the right lobe is slightly larger than the left). By asking the patient to swallow sips of water, thyroid consistency can be better appreciated as the"

            "content": "Focal thyroiditis is present in 20\u201340% of euthyroid autopsy cases and is associated with serologic evidence of autoimmunity, particularly the presence of TPO antibodies. The most common clinically apparent cause of chronic thyroiditis is Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, an autoimmune disorder that often presents as a firm or hard goiter of variable size (see above). Riedel\u2019s thyroiditis is a rare disorder that typically occurs in middle-aged women. It presents with an insidious, painless goiter with local symptoms due to compression of the esophagus, trachea, neck veins, or recurrent laryngeal nerves. Dense fibrosis disrupts normal gland architecture and can extend outside the thyroid capsule. Despite these extensive histologic changes, thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The goiter is hard, nontender, often asymmetric, and fixed, leading to suspicion of a malignancy. Diagnosis requires open biopsy as FNA biopsy is usually inadequate. Treatment is directed to surgical relief of compressive"

Of note, palpable epitrochlear nodes are always pathologic. Of patients presenting with lymphadenopathy, 75% have localized findings, and the remaining 25% have generalized lymphadenopathy (i.e., that involving more than one anatomic region). Localized lymphadenopathy in the head and neck region is found in 55% of patients, inguinal lymphadenopathy in 14%, and axillary lymphadenopathy in 5%. Determining whether the patient has generalized versus localized lymphadenopathy can help narrow the differential diagnosis, as various infections present differently."

            "content": "Soft, tender, and inflamed lymph nodes suggest an acute inflammatory process, which is most likely to be infective. Firm multinodular large-volume rubbery nodes often suggest a diagnosis of lymphoma. Examination should also include careful assessment of other nodal regions, including the supraclavicular fossae, the axillae, the retroperitoneum, and the inguinal regions. Further examination may include digestive tract endoscopy, chest radiography, and body CT scanning. Most cervical lymph nodes are easily palpable and suitable for biopsy to establish a tissue diagnosis. Biopsy can be performed using ultrasound for guidance and good samples of lymph nodes may be obtained."

Women are more commonly affected, and the majority of tumors present in the seventh and eighth decade of life. The typical patient has a long-standing neck mass, which rapidly enlarges and may be painful. Associated symptoms such as dys-phonia, dysphagia, and dyspnea are common. The tumor is large and may be fixed to surrounding structures or may be ulcerated with areas of necrosis (Fig. 38-21). Lymph nodes usually are palpable at presentation. Evidence of metastatic spread also may be present. Diagnosis is confirmed by FNAB revealing char-acteristic giant and multinucleated cells. Differential diagnoses on"

Neither the patient nor the family physician had any concerns about the pregnancy. However, the patient did complain of unilateral swelling of her left leg, which had gradually increased over the previous 2 days. Furthermore, the evening before her visit she developed some sharp chest pain, which was exacerbated by deep breaths. The family physician ordered a duplex ultrasound scan of the left leg venous system. Ultrasound scanning of the vascular tree can demonstrate flow and occlusion of arteries and veins."
