    "question": "A 40-year-old businessman who was previously well is brought into the emergency department by his assistant with a complaint of left-sided weakness after a chiropractic neck manipulation. He has never felt like this before. Past medical history is insignificant. His blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg, pulse 86/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F). A T2-weighted MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. The patient is treated with cervical immobilization, a course of steroids, and physical therapy. What other finding will most likely be seen in this patient?",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's analyze the information provided in the question stem and the documents. The patient presents with left-sided weakness after a chiropractic neck manipulation. The MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. This suggests that the lesion is located in the spinal cord, specifically at the C5 level. The patient is treated with cervical immobilization, a course of steroids, and physical therapy. The question asks what other finding will most likely be seen in this patient. Let's consider the potential choices: A. Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion: This is unlikely, as the lesion is a hemicord lesion, which means it affects half of the spinal cord. Spastic paralysis would typically be seen at the level of the lesion, but it's not the most likely finding. B. Right-sided Horner's syndrome: Horner's syndrome is a condition characterized by ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis on one side of the face. It is typically caused by disruption of the sympathetic nerves to the eye. However, the lesion is located at the C5 level, and Horner's syndrome is not typically associated with spinal cord lesions at this level. C. Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement: The corticospinal tract is a descending tract in the spinal cord that carries motor signals from the brain to the muscles. A lesion at the C5 level can affect the corticospinal tract on the opposite side of the lesion, leading to weakness on the opposite side of the body. This is a likely finding in this patient. D. Right-sided analgesia: Analgesia refers to a lack of pain sensation. While a spinal cord lesion can cause sensory disturbances, analgesia is not typically seen as a finding in this context. Based on the analysis, the most likely finding in this patient is contralateral corticospinal tract involvement, which would result in right-sided weakness. Here is the output in the required json format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a left C5 hemicord lesion, which affects the corticospinal tract. A lesion at this level can cause weakness on the opposite side of the body, so the patient is likely to have right-sided weakness. The other options are less likely or unrelated to the lesion location.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B).

The pain began after a fall on his outstretched hand approximately 6 months previously. The patient recalled having some minor shoulder tenderness but no other specific symptoms. He was otherwise fit and well. On examination of the shoulder, there was marked wasting of the muscles in the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae. The patient found initiation of abduction difficult and there was a weakness of lateral rotation of the humerus. The wasted muscles were the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The cause of the muscle wasting was disuse. Muscle atrophy (wasting) occurs through a variety of disorders. Disuse atrophy is one of the most common causes. Examples of disuse atrophy include the loss of muscle bulk after fracture immobilization in a plaster cast. The opposite effect can also be demonstrated\u2014when muscles are overused they become bulkier (hypertrophy)."

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

Interestingly, the height of the patient and the previous lens surgery would suggest a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and a series of blood tests and review of the family history revealed this was so. A 35-year-old male patient presented to his family practitioner because of recent weight loss (14 lb over the previous 2 months). He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets."

            "content": "A patient complaining of back pain and an inability to move the legs may have a spine fracture or dislocation; with fractures above L1 the spinal cord is at risk for compression. Care must be taken to avoid further damage to the spinal cord or nerve roots by immobilizing the back or neck pending the results of radiologic studies. Vertebral fractures frequently occur in the absence of trauma in association with osteoporosis, glucocorticoid use, osteomyelitis, or neoplastic infiltration. Sprains and Strains The terms low back sprain, strain, and mechanically induced muscle spasm refer to minor, self-limited injuries associated with lifting a heavy object, a fall, or a sudden deceleration such as in an automobile accident. These terms are used loosely and do not clearly describe a specific anatomic lesion. The pain is usually confined to the lower back, and there is no radiation to the buttocks or legs. Patients with paraspinal muscle spasm often assume unusual postures."

A 33-year-old man was playing cricket for his local Sunday team. As the new bowler pitched the ball short, it bounced higher than he anticipated and hit him on the side of his head. He immediately fell to the ground unconscious, but after about 30 seconds he was helped to his feet and felt otherwise well. It was noted he had some bruising around his temple. He decided not to continue playing and went to watch the match from the side. Over the next hour he became extremely sleepy and was eventually unrousable. He was rushed to hospital. When he was admitted to hospital, the patient\u2019s breathing was shallow and irregular and it was necessary to intubate him. A skull radiograph demonstrated a fracture in the region of the pterion. No other abnormality was demonstrated other than minor soft tissue bruising over the left temporal fossa. A CT scan was performed."

            "content": "The natural history of neck pain with acute radiculopathy due to disk disease is favorable, and many patients will improve without specific therapy. Although there are no randomized trials of NSAIDs for neck pain, a course of NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or both, with or without muscle relaxants, is reasonable as initial therapy. Other nonsurgical treatments are commonly used, including opioid analgesics, oral glucocorticoids, cervical traction, and immobilization with a hard or soft cervical collar. However, there are no randomized trials that establish the effectiveness of these treatments. Soft cervical collars can be modestly helpful by limiting spontaneous and reflex neck movements that exacerbate pain."
