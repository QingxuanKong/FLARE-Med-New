    "question": "An 11-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother after she observed jerking movements of his arms and legs for about 30 seconds earlier that morning. He has not had fever, cough, or a runny nose. He has been healthy, except for occasional eczema. He was delivered at home in Romania. His mother had no prenatal care. She reports that he has required more time to reach developmental milestones compared to his older brother. The patient's immunization records are not available. He takes no medications. He appears pale with blue eyes and has a musty odor. He has poor eye contact. Which of the following would have most likely prevented the patient's symptoms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Levothyroxine therapy during pregnancy",
        "B": "Dietary restriction of phenylalanine",
        "C": "Daily allopurinol intake",
        "D": "Avoidance of fasting states"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Let's break down the case and analyze it step by step: 1. The patient is an 11-month-old boy with jerking movements of his arms and legs for about 30 seconds, which suggests a neurological disorder. 2. The boy has not had fever, cough, or a runny nose, which makes an infectious cause less likely. 3. The patient has been healthy, except for occasional eczema, and has no known allergies or sensitivities. 4. The boy was delivered at home in Romania, and his mother had no prenatal care, which increases the risk of undiagnosed congenital disorders. 5. The patient's symptoms, such as pale skin, blue eyes, musty odor, and poor eye contact, are suggestive of a metabolic disorder. 6. The boy's developmental delays and poor eye contact also point towards a neurological disorder. Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is Phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. PKU is characterized by the inability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine, which can lead to intellectual disability, developmental delays, and other neurological symptoms if left untreated. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Levothyroxine therapy during pregnancy: This would not prevent PKU, as it is a separate disorder that affects thyroid function. B. Dietary restriction of phenylalanine: This is the primary treatment for PKU, as it involves a strict diet that limits phenylalanine intake to prevent accumulation of toxic metabolites. C. Daily allopurinol intake: Allopurinol is used to treat gout, not PKU. D. Avoidance of fasting states: Fasting states can actually worsen PKU, as it increases phenylalanine levels. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient most likely has Phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. The primary treatment for PKU is dietary restriction of phenylalanine. Among the options, the correct answer is B. Dietary restriction of phenylalanine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Treatment: \u2022 phenylalanine and \u008f tyrosine in diet, tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation. Maternal PKU\u2014lack of proper dietary therapy during pregnancy. Findings in infant: microcephaly, intellectual disability, growth retardation, congenital heart defects. Autosomal recessive. Incidence \u2248 1:10,000. Screening occurs 2\u20133 days after birth (normal at birth because of maternal enzyme during fetal life). Phenyl ketones\u2014phenylacetate, phenyllactate, and phenylpyruvate. Disorder of aromatic amino acid metabolism \u008e musty body odor. PKU patients must avoid the artificial sweetener aspartame, which contains phenylalanine. Autosomal recessive. Presentation: vomiting, poor feeding, urine smells like maple syrup/burnt sugar. Causes severe CNS defects, intellectual disability, death. I Love Vermont maple syrup from maple trees (with B1ranches)."

            "content": "As the months pass, the weakness and hypotonia progress gradually and spread to all the skeletal muscles except the ocular ones. Intercostal paralysis with a degree of collapse of the chest is the rule. Respiratory movements become paradoxical (abdominal protrusion with chest retraction). The cry becomes feeble, and sucking and swallowing are less efficient. Such infants are unable to sit unless propped, and they cannot hold up their heads without support and cannot roll over or support their weight when placed on their feet. Their posture is characteristic: arms abducted and flexed at the elbow, legs in the \u201cfrog position\u201d with external rotation and abduction at hips and flexion at hips and knees. If the effects of gravity are removed, all muscles continue to contract; that is there is paresis, not paralysis. Until late in the illness, these children appear bright-eyed, alert, and responsive."

Most cases had been preceded within days by an erythematous rash spreading from the limbs to the trunk and face, somewhat similar to the eruption of fifths disease caused by this virus in children. One of our patients had no premonitory features, but her child had just recovered from fifth disease (parvovirus) by the pediatrician. Some reported patients have had preceding influenza-like symptoms and adenopathy as well. A summary of cases that have appeared in the literature can be found in the paper by Maas and coworkers. Duchowny and colleagues described a patient in whom a typical brachial neuritis occurred as part of a febrile illness that proved to be caused by a CMV infection and the same has been observed (albeit rarely) in patients with HIV. A few outbreaks of brachial neuritis have been recorded and prompted the suggestion that the Coxsackievirus"

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

The patient underwent a radiologically guided drainage of the psoas abscess and was treated for over 6 months with a long-term antibiotic regimen. She made an excellent recovery with no further symptoms, although the cavities within the lungs remain. It healed with sclerosis. A 72-year-old fit and healthy man was brought to the emergency department with severe back pain beginning at the level of the shoulder blades and extending to the midlumbar region. The pain was of relatively acute onset and was continuous. The patient was able to walk to the gurney as he entered the ambulance; however, at the emergency department the patient complained of inability to use both legs."
