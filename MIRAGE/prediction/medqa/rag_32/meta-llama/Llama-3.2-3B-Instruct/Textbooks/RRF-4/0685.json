In individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the equal pressure point is closer to the alveolus at any lung volume. Expiratory flow limitation occurs at the equal pressure point. Given that the subject is a healthy 21-year-old man, we can assume that his lungs are normal.

Dynamic mechanics is the study of physical systems in motion, and for the respiratory system it is the study of the properties of a lung whose volume is changing with time. Air flows into and out of an airway when there is a pressure difference at the two ends of the airway. By way of review, during inspiration the diaphragm contracts, pleural pressure becomes more negative, and gas flows into the lung (see"

Specifically, as lung volume and elastic recoil decrease, the equal pressure point moves toward the alveolus in normal individuals. In individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the equal pressure point at any lung volume is closer to the alveolus. Expiratory flow limitation occurs at the equal pressure point. 5. Energy is expended during breathing to overcome the inherent mechanical properties of the lung. Respiratory muscle fatigue is the most common cause of respiratory failure. Individuals breathe at a respiratory rate to minimize work. For individuals with increased airway resistance, work is minimized by breathing at lower frequencies. For individuals with restrictive lung diseases, work is minimized by shallow breathing at high frequencies. 6."

This increase in lung volume eventually results in such a degree of hyperinflation that the affected person is no longer able to do the work needed to overcome the decreased compliance of the lung at this high lung volume. In such individuals, it is a major cause of shortness of breath with activity. FRC, functional residual capacity."
