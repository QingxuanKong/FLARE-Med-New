Although these children often have normal birth weight, they have growth delay, manifesting short stature. They have a distinctive facial appearance (\u201celfin facies\u201d), with median flare of the eyebrows, fullness of the perioral and periorbital region, blue irides with a stellate pattern of pigment, and depressed nasal bridge with anteversion of the nares. Moderate intellectual disability (average IQ in the 50 to 60 range) is common, but developmental testing reveals strength in personal social skills and deficiencies in cognitive areas. Hypercalcemia is present in neonates."

            "content": "Newborn weight exceeding 4000 g (8 lb 13 oz) is also a frequently used threshold to deine macrosomia. Others use 4250 g or even 4500 g (10 lb). As shown in Table 44-2, birthweights ::4500 g are uncommon. During a 30-year period at Parkland Hospital, during which there were more than 350,000 singleton births, only 1.4 percent of newborns weighed 4500 g or more. We are of the view that the upper limit of fetal growth, above which growth can be deemed abnormal, is likely two standard deviations above the mean, representing perhaps 3 percent of births. At 40 weeks, such a threshold would correspond to approximately 4500 g. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2016a) concludes that the term macrosomia was an appropriate appellation for newborns who weigh 4500 g or more at birth. Total 354,509 15,501 Some factors associated with fetal overgrowth are listed in Table 44-3. Many are interrelated and thus likely are additive."

            "content": "Gestational age assessment permits the detection of abnormal fetal growth patterns, aiding in predicting the neonatal complications of largeness or smallness for gestational age (Fig. 58-6). Infants born at a weight greater than the 90th percentile for age are considered large for gestational age. Among therisks associated with being large for gestational age are all the risks of the infant of a diabetic mother and risks associated with postmaturity. Infants born at a weight less than 10th percentile for age (some growth curves use <2 standard deviations or the 5th percentile) are small for gestational age and have IUGR. Problems associated with small for gestational age infants include congenital malformations, in addition to the problems listed in Table 58-2."

Midline facial defects such as cyclopia (singleorbit), cebocephaly (single nostril), and cleft lip and palate arecommon, as are midline central nervous system anomalies, suchas alobar holoprosencephaly. The forehead is generally sloping,ears are often small and malformed, and microphthalmia oranophthalmia may occur. Postaxial polydactyly of the hands iscommon, as is clubfeet or rocker-bottom feet. Hypospadias andcryptorchidism are common in boys, whereas girls generallyhave hypoplasia of the labia minora. Most infants with trisomy13 also have congenital heart disease. Many infants with thiscondition have a punched-out scalp lesion over the occiputcalled aplasia cutis congenita; when seen in conjunction with polydactyly and some or all of the facial findings, this findingis essentially pathognomonic for the diagnosis of trisomy 13."
