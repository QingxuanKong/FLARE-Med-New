He does not make eye contact and sits very close to his mother. Physical examination shows a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the cardiac apex. Neurological examination shows decreased strength in the right lower leg with normal strength in the other extremities.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the symptoms and signs presented in the case and correlate them with the potential genetic mutations listed in the options. The patient is a 16-year-old boy with a seizure disorder, cognitive delay, progressively worsening right lower extremity weakness, a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the cardiac apex, and fundoscopic examination showing several multinodular, calcified lesions in the retina bilaterally. These symptoms suggest a neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) diagnosis. NF1 is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17. The NF1 gene is a tumor suppressor gene that regulates cell growth and division. Mutations in this gene can lead to the development of multiple neurofibromas, caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions, Lisch nodules, and optic gliomas, among other features. The presence of a cardiac rhabdomyoma, which is a common cardiac anomaly in NF1 patients, further supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the patient's condition is most likely due to a mutation in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

At about 2 to 3 years of age, boys develop an awkward gait and an inability to run properly. Some have an antecedent history of mild slowness in attaining motor milestones or poor head control during infancy. Examination shows firm calf hypertrophy and mild to moderate proximal leg weakness with a hyperlordotic, waddling gait. The child typically arises from a lying position on the floor by using his arms to climb up his legs and body (Gower sign). Arm weakness is evident by age 6 years, and most boys are wheelchair dependent by age 12 years. Other manifestations include cardiomyopathy, scoliosis, respiratory decline, and, in some boys, cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. Many boys with Duchenne live into adulthood. Most die in their 20s or early 30s, usually as a result of progressive respiratory decline or cardiac dysfunction."

            "content": "The neurologic examination reveals nystagmus, loss of fast saccadic eye movements, truncal titubation, dysarthria, dysmetria, and ataxia of trunk and limb movements. Extensor plantar responses (with normal tone in trunk and extremities), absence of deep tendon reflexes, and weakness (greater distally than proximally) are usually found. Loss of vibratory and proprioceptive sensation occurs. The median age of death is 35 years. Women have a significantly better prognosis than men. Cardiac involvement occurs in 90% of patients. Cardiomegaly, symmetric hypertrophy, murmurs, and conduction defects are reported. Moderate mental retardation or psychiatric syndromes are present in a small percentage of patients. A high incidence of diabetes mellitus (20%) is found and is associated with insulin resistance and pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction. Musculoskeletal deformities are common and include pes cavus, pes equinovarus, and scoliosis. MRI of the spinal cord shows atrophy (Fig. 450-2)."

            "content": "In the second (childhood) form, onset is during the second year, with delay in walking and slowly progressive weakness of shoulder, pelvic girdle, and trunk muscles. The toe walking, waddling gait, enlargement of calf muscles, and lumbar lordosis resemble those of Duchenne dystrophy. Cardiomyopathy is exceptional, hepatomegaly is less frequent than in the infantile form, and developmental delay is present in a minority. Death occurs between 3 and 24 years of age, usually from ventilatory failure and recurrent pulmonary infections."

            "content": "The Hoover sign and the trunk\u2013thigh sign of Babinski are helpful in distinguishing hysterical from organic hemiplegia. The Hoover test is undertaken in the recumbent patient and is based on the downward pressure of one leg that is required to forcefully lift the opposite one. By placing the examiner\u2019s hand under the heel of the unaffected leg, the sign is elicited when there is an absence of downward pressure as the patient attempts to raise the weak leg, thereby indicating a lack of voluntary effort. A second version of this test, also attributed to Hoover, is to detect downward pressure from the ostensibly paralyzed leg, as the good leg is raised. In a similar maneuver, the examiner tells the patient that he is testing the normal limb, while asking the patient to try to push the knees together. In hysterical weakness, the paralyzed limb adducts with normal power. One can take advantage of midline motor actions in the upper extremity by asking the patient to push his hands together"

            "content": "Hearing loss has also been observed with other retinal changes, 2 of which are Norrie disease, with retinal malformation, hearing loss, and mental retardation (oculoacousticocerebral degeneration), and Small disease, with recessive hearing loss, mental retardation, narrowing of retinal vessels, and muscle atrophy. In the former, the infant is born blind, with a white vascularized retinal mass behind a clear lens; later the lens and cornea become opaque. The eyes are small, and the iris is atrophied. In the latter, the optic fundi shows tortuosity of vessels, telangiectases, and retinal detachment. The nature of the progressive generalized muscular weakness has not been ascertained. Susac syndrome should be considered in the broad differential diagnosis of this group of disorders. This is a microvasculopathy that causes characteristic changes in the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, retinal vasculopathy, and progressive deafness as discussed in"

            "content": "Hemiparesis or other focal neurologic deficits suggest vascular dementia or brain tumor. Dementia with a myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy suggests vitamin B12 deficiency. Peripheral neuropathy could also indicate another vitamin deficiency, heavy metal intoxication, thyroid dysfunction, Lyme disease, or vasculitis. Dry, cool skin, hair loss, and bradycardia suggest hypothyroidism. Fluctuating confusion associated with repetitive stereotyped movements may indicate ongoing limbic, temporal, or frontal seizures. In the elderly, hearing impairment or visual loss may produce confusion and disorientation misinterpreted as dementia. Profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss in a younger patient with short stature or myopathy, however, should raise concern for a mitochondrial disorder."

            "content": "In most patients, the weakness remains restricted to facial, upper extremity, and distal lower extremity muscles. In 20% of patients, weakness progresses to involve the pelvic girdle muscles, and severe functional impairment and possible wheelchair dependency result. Characteristically, patients with FSHD do not have involvement of other organ systems, although labile hypertension is common, and there is an increased incidence of nerve deafness. Coats\u2019 disease, a disorder consisting of telangiectasia, exudation, and retinal detachment, also occurs. Laboratory Features The serum CK level may be normal or mildly elevated. EMG usually indicates a myopathic pattern. The muscle biopsy shows nonspecific features of a myopathy. A prominent inflammatory 462e-11 infiltrate, which is often multifocal in distribution, is present in some biopsy samples. The cause or significance of this finding is unknown."
