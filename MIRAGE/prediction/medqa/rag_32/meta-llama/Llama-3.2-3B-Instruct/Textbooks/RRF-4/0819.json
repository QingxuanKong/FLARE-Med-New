    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has not attained menarche, has scant axillary hair, and has a firm, nontender left inguinal mass. The pelvic examination shows a blind vaginal pouch, and ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries. The patient's height and weight are within normal limits, and her BMI is 22.3 kg/m^2. The presence of scant axillary hair and the absence of a uterus or ovaries on ultrasonography suggest a disorder of sex development. The blind vaginal pouch is a characteristic feature of Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, which is a condition where the vagina and uterus are absent or underdeveloped. MRKH syndrome is often associated with other abnormalities of sex chromosome structure or function, such as Turner syndrome (45,X) or Swyer syndrome (47,XXY). The patient's symptoms are most consistent with Swyer syndrome, which is a form of sex chromosome monosomy, specifically X chromosome monosomy X (45,X). This condition is characterized by the presence of a Y chromosome in some cells, which can lead to the development of ovarian tissue and the production of androgens, resulting in scant axillary hair. The blind vaginal pouch and the absence of a uterus or ovaries on ultrasonography are also consistent with Swyer syndrome. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is sex chromosome monosomy, specifically X chromosome monosomy (45,X).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The diagnosis of ovarian masses in prepubertal girls is difficult because the condition is rare in this age group and, consequently, there is a low index of suspicion. Many symptoms are nonspecific, and acute symptoms are more likely to be attributed to more common entities such as appendicitis. Abdominal palpation and bimanual rectoabdominal examination are important in any child who has nonspecific abdominal or pelvic symptoms. An ovarian mass that is abdominal in location can be confused with other abdominal masses occurring in children, such as Wilms\u2019 tumor or neuroblastoma. Acute pain is often associated with torsion. The ovarian ligament becomes elongated as a result of the abdominal location of ovarian tumors, thus creating a predisposition to torsion. Adnexal torsion is more likely to occur with an ovarian mass than with a normal size ovary. While torsion of a normal ovary is rare in adolescents and adults, it is more likely to occur in"

It is argued that a girl must reach a critical body weight (47.8 kg) before menarche can occur (7). Body fat must increase to 23.5% from the typical 16% of the prepubertal state, which presumably is in\ufb02uenced by nutritional status (8). This hypothesis is supported by observations that menarche occurs earliest in obese girls, followed by normal-weight girls, then underweight girls, and lastly anorectic girls (Fig. 29.1). The importance of other factors is indicated by observations that menarche is often delayed in morbidly obese girls, those with diabetes, and those who exercise intensely but are of normal body weight and body fat percentage. Girls with precocious puberty may undergo menarche even if they have a low body fat percentage, and other girls show no pubertal development with a body fat percentage of 27% (9).

A pelvic mass may be gynecologic in origin, or it may arise from the urinary tract or bowel. The gynecologic causes of a pelvic mass may be uterine, adnexal, or more specifically ovarian. Because of the small pelvic capacity of a prepubertal child, a pelvic mass very quickly becomes abdominal in location as it enlarges and may be palpable on abdominal examination. Ovarian masses in this age group may be asymptomatic, associated with chronic pressure-related bowel or bladder symptoms, or may present with acute pain caused by rupture or torsion. Abdominal or pelvic pain is one of the most frequent initial symptoms.

            "content": "Physical Examination The physical examination should include measurements of vital signs and examination of the abdomen and pelvis. Frequently, the findings before rupture and hemorrhage are nonspecific, and vital signs are normal. The abdomen may be nontender or mildly tender, with or without rebound. The uterus may be slightly enlarged, with findings similar to a normal pregnancy (103,104). Cervical motion tenderness may or may not be present. An adnexal mass may be palpable in up to 50% of cases, but the mass varies markedly in size, consistency, and tenderness. A palpable mass may be the corpus luteum and not the ectopic pregnancy. With rupture and intra-abdominal hemorrhage, the patient develops tachycardia followed by hypotension. Bowel sounds are decreased or absent. The abdomen is distended, with marked tenderness and rebound tenderness. Cervical motion tenderness is present. Frequently, the findings of the pelvic examination are inadequate because of pain and guarding."

            "content": "Polycystic ovarian syndrome (formerly called Stein-Leventhal syndrome) is a complex endocrine disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, menstrual abnormalities, polycystic ovaries, chronic anovulation, and decreased fertility. It usually comes to attention after menarche in teenage girls or young adults who present with oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, infertility, and sometimes with obesity. The ovaries are usually twice the normal size, gray-white with a smooth outer cortex, and studded with subcortical cysts 0.5 to 1.5 cm in diameter. Histologic examination shows a thickened, fibrotic ovarian capsule overlying innumerable cystic follicles lined by granulosa cells with a hyperplastic luteinized theca interna. There is a conspicuous absence of corpora lutea in the ovary. Damage to or obstruction of the tubal lumina may produce permanent sterility."

            "content": "For all women, the evaluation of excessive and abnormal menses includes a thorough medical and gynecologic history, the exclusion of pregnancy, the consideration of possible malignancy, and a careful gynecologic examination. For women of normal weight between the ages of approximately 20 and 35 years who do not have clear risk factors for STDs, who have no signs of androgen excess, who are not using exogenous hormones, and who have no other findings on examination, management may be based on a clinical diagnosis. Additional laboratory or imaging studies may be indicated if the diagnosis is not apparent on the basis of examination and history."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

A BMI >25 kg/m2 is indicative of excess weight for height, and values >30 kg/m2 are often seen in association with hirsutism, probably the result of increased conversion of androgen precursors to testosterone. Notation should be made of blood pressure, as adrenal causes may be associated with hypertension. Cutaneous signs sometimes associated with androgen excess and insulin resistance include acanthosis nigricans and skin tags. Body fat distribution should also be noted."

            "content": "Adnexal masses measuring 2 cm or larger in premenarcheal girls or 8 cm or larger in other premenopausal patients will usually require surgical exploration. For young patients, blood tests should include serum hCG and AFP and LDH. A CT scan of the chest is important because germ cell tumors can metastasize to the lungs or mediastinum. A karyotype should be obtained preoperatively for all premenarcheal girls, particularly those with dysgerminomas, because of the propensity of these tumors to arise in dysgenetic gonads (343,349). A preoperative CT scan or MRI may document the presence and extent of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy or liver metastases; however, because these patients require surgical exploration, preoperative imaging is not usually required. If postmenarcheal patients have predominantly cystic lesions up to 8 cm in diameter, they may be observed or given oral contraceptives for two menstrual cycles (350).
