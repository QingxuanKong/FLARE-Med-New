The patient states that he has no difficulty initiating swallowing but occasionally food is stuck in his throat. He does not complain of pain while swallowing but has noticed minor unintentional weight loss. The patient has no history of speech-related pain or nasal regurgitation. His family history is unremarkable. During the examination, the patient appears ill, malnourished, and slightly pale. He is not jaundiced nor cyanotic. Physical examination is unremarkable.

The patient has a 1-year history of dysphagia for solids, which has progressed to dysphagia for liquids. The patient reports that food is occasionally stuck in his throat, but does not complain of pain while swallowing. He is malnourished, slightly pale, and has a small outpouching in the posterior neck on swallowing study. These findings suggest a motility disorder, as the patient does not have difficulty initiating swallowing (CN IX, glossopharyngeal nerve) or speech-related pain (CN VII, facial nerve). The presence of a small outpouching in the posterior neck is highly suggestive of a Zenker's diverticulum, which is a common complication of achalasia. Zenker's diverticulum is a herniation of the mucosa through a weakness in the muscular wall of the pharynx, typically occurring in the area supplied by the vagus nerve (CN X). Therefore, the nerve most likely involved in this patient's symptoms is CN X, the vagus nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Careful history-taking often points to a presumptive diagnosis and leads to the appropriate use of diagnostic tests. Esophageal strictures (Fig. 345-39) typically cause progressive dysphagia, first for solids, then for liquids; motility disorders often cause intermittent dysphagia for both solids and liquids. Some underlying disorders have characteristic historic features: Schatzki\u2019s ring (Fig. 345-40) causes episodic dysphagia for solids, typically at the beginning of a meal; oropharyngeal motor disorders typically present with difficulty initiating deglutition (transfer dysphagia) and nasal reflux or coughing with swallowing; and achalasia may cause nocturnal regurgitation of undigested food."

Odynophagia refers to painful swallowing, typically resulting from mucosal ulceration within the oropharynx or esophagus. It commonly is accompanied by dysphagia, but the converse is not true.

Dysphagia initially occurs with solid foods and gradually progresses to include semisolids and liquids. By the time these symptoms develop, the disease is already very advanced, because difficulty in swallowing does not occur until >60% of the esophageal circumference is infiltrated with cancer. Dysphagia may be associated with pain on swallowing (odynophagia), pain radiating to the chest and/or back, regurgitation or vomiting, and aspiration pneumonia. The disease most commonly spreads to adjacent and supraclavicular lymph nodes, liver, lungs, pleura, and bone. Tracheoesophageal fistulas may develop, primarily in patients with upper and mid-esophageal tumors. As with other squamous cell carcinomas, hypercalcemia may occur in the absence of osseous metastases, probably from parathormone-related peptide secreted by tumor cells (Chap. 121)."

Important distinctions are between uniquely solid food dysphagia as opposed to liquid and solid, episodic versus constant dysphagia, and progressive versus static dysphagia. If the dysphagia is for liquids as well as solid food, it suggests a motility disorder such as achalasia. Conversely, uniquely solid food dysphagia is suggestive of a stricture, ring, or tumor. Of note, a patient\u2019s localization of food hang-up in the esophagus is notoriously imprecise. Approximately 30% of distal esophageal obstructions are perceived as cervical dysphagia. In such instances, the absence of concomitant symptoms generally associated with oropharyngeal dysphagia such as aspiration, nasopharyngeal regurgitation, cough, drooling, or obvious neuromuscular compromise should suggest an esophageal etiology."

The type of food causing dysphagia is a crucial detail. Intermittent dysphagia that occurs only with solid food implies structural dysphagia, whereas constant dysphagia with both liquids and solids strongly suggests a motor abnormality. Two caveats to this pattern are that despite having a motor abnormality, patients with scleroderma generally develop mild dysphagia for solids only and, somewhat paradoxically, that patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia often have greater difficulty managing liquids than solids.

Even when not attributable to malignancy, dysphagia is usually a manifestation of an identifiable and treatable disease entity, making its evaluation beneficial to the patient and gratifying to the practitioner. The specific diagnostic algorithm to pursue is guided by the details of the history (Fig. 53-2).

The movement of the bolus by the tongue, the timing of reflex swallowing, and the closure of the pharyngeal and palatal openings are judged directly by observation of a bolus of food mixed with barium or of liquid barium alone. However, authorities in the field, such as Wiles, whose reviews are recommended (see also Hughes and Wiles), warn that unqualified dependence on videofluoroscopy is unwise. They remark that observation of the patient swallowing water and repeated observation of the patient while eating can be equally informative. Having the patient swallow water is a particularly effective test of laryngeal closure; the presence of coughing, wet hoarseness or breathlessness, and the need to swallow small volumes slowly are indicative of a high risk of aspiration."

In our experience, palatal elevation in response to touching the posterior pharynx only demonstrates that cranial nerves IX and X and the local musculature are not entirely dysfunctional; in other words, the presence of the reflex does not ensure the smooth coordination of the swallowing mechanism and, more importantly, does not obviate aspiration. Difficulties with swallowing may begin subtly and express themselves as weight loss or as a noticeable increase in the time required to eat a meal.

Esophageal dysphagia: Usually involves solids more than liquids for most obstructive causes (strictures, Schatzki rings, webs, carcinoma) and is generally progressive. Motility disorders (achalasia, scleroderma, esophageal spasm) present with both liquid and solid dysphagia. Examine for masses (e.g., goiter, tumor) and anatomic defects. Oropharyngeal dysphagia: Cine-esophagram."

Following a sleepless night with significant dyspnea, the patient develops nausea and vomiting and collapses. He presents to the emergency department in cardiac arrest and is unable to be resuscitated. His autopsy shows a posterior wall myocardial infarction and a fresh thrombus in an atherosclerotic right coronary artery. What went wrong? The clinician had decided, based on the patient\u2019s appearance, even before starting the history, that the patient\u2019s complaints were not serious. Therefore, he felt confident that he could perform an abbreviated and focused examination by using the URI assessment protocol rather than considering the broader range of possibilities and performing appropriate tests to confirm or refute his initial hypotheses. In particular, by concentrating on the URI, the clinician failed to elicit the full dyspnea history, which would have"

In patients that present with back pain at the time of esophageal cancer diagnosis, there is usually distant metastasis or celiac encasement.Dysphagia usually presents late in the natural history of the disease because the lack of a serosal layer on the esopha-gus allows the smooth muscle to dilate with ease. As a result, the dysphagia becomes severe enough for the patient to seek medical advice only when more than 60% of the esophageal circumference is infiltrated with cancer. Consequently, the dis-ease is usually advanced if symptoms herald its presence. Tra-cheoesophageal fistula may be present in some patients on their first visit to the hospital, and more than 40% will have evidence of distant metastases. With tumors of the cardia, anorexia and weight loss usually precede the onset of dysphagia. The physical signs of esophageal tumors are those associated with the pres-ence of distant metastases.General Approach to Esophageal CancerTherapy of"

He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"
