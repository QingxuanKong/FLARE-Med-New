The use of sigmoidoscopy was based on the historical finding that the majority of colorectal cancers occurred in the rectum and left colon and that patients with right-sided colon cancers had left-sided polyps.

Colectomy remains the primary therapy/prevention. The offspring of patients with polyposis coli, who often are prepubertal when the diagnosis is made in the parent, have a 50% risk for developing this premalignant disorder and should be carefully screened by annual flexible sigmoidoscopy until age 35. Proctosigmoidoscopy is a sufficient screening procedure because polyps tend to be evenly distributed from cecum to anus, making more invasive and expensive techniques such as colonoscopy or barium enema unnecessary. Testing for occult blood in the stool is an inadequate screening maneuver. If a causative germ-line AP C mutation has been identified in an affected family member, an alternative method for identifying"

Colonoscopy is currently the most accurate and most complete method for examining the large bowel. This procedure is highly sensitive for detecting even small polyps (<1 cm) and allows biopsy, polypectomy, control of hemor-rhage, and dilation of strictures. However, colonoscopy does require mechanical bowel preparation, and the discomfort asso-ciated with the procedure requires conscious sedation in most patients. Colonoscopy is also considerably more expensive than other screening modalities and requires a well-trained endos-copist. The risk of a major complication"

These tests rely on monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies to react with the intact globin portion of human hemoglobin and are more specific for identifying occult bleeding from the colon or rectum. Any positive FOBT or FIT mandates further investigation, usually by colonoscopy.6 More recently, stool DNA testing has been proposed for early detec-tion of colorectal cancer.7Stool Studies. Stool studies are often helpful in evaluating the etiology of diarrhea. Wet-mount examination reveals the pres-ence of fecal leukocytes, which may suggest colonic inflamma-tion or the presence of an invasive organism such as invasive E coli or Shigella species. Stool cultures can detect pathogenic bacteria, ova, and/or parasites. C difficile colitis is diagnosed by"
