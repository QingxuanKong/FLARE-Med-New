    "question": "A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because of difficulty discarding items in her home. She says that the accumulation of things in her kitchen and dining room makes regular use of these spaces incredibly difficult. Her behavior started when she was in high school. She feels anxious when she tries to discard her possessions and her husband tries to clean and organize the home. This behavior frustrates her because most of the items she saves have little emotional or monetary value. She reports that there has been no improvement despite attending cognitive behavioral therapy sessions for the past 6 months. She now feels that her behavior is \u201ctaking over\u201d her life. She does not drink, smoke, or use illicit drugs. She takes no medications. Her temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 116/80 mm Hg. On mental status examination, she is calm, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time. Her mood is depressed; her speech is organized, logical, and coherent; and there are no psychotic symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

        "A": "Fluoxetine",
        "B": "Lamotrigine",

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with difficulty discarding items in her home, which started in high school and has persisted despite cognitive behavioral therapy sessions. This behavior is characterized by hoarding, which is a symptom of Hoarding Disorder (HD) in the DSM-5. The patient's mood is depressed, but there are no psychotic symptoms. The most appropriate next step in management would be to consider medication options that are commonly used to treat HD. Among the options provided, fluoxetine (A) is an SSRI that can be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety associated with HD. However, it is not the first-line treatment for HD. Buspirone (C) is an anxiolytic that may not be effective in addressing the core symptoms of HD. Methylphenidate (D) is a stimulant that is not typically used to treat HD. Lamotrigine (B) is an anticonvulsant that may have some off-label use in treating HD, but it is not a first-line treatment for the disorder. Therefore, fluoxetine is a reasonable option to consider, but it is essential to note that medication is often used in conjunction with other treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to address the core symptoms of HD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

            "content": "The manic state is in most ways the opposite of the depressed state, being characterized by a euphoric flight of ideas, motor and speech hyperactivity, and an increased appetite and sex urge. When such a state is fully developed, it qualifies as a psychosis. After a minimum of sleep, the patient awakes with enthusiasm and expectation. The manic individual appears to possess great drive and confidence yet lacks the ability to carry out plans. Often headstrong, impulsive, socially intrusive behavior is characteristic. Judgment may be so impaired that reckless investments are made; fortunes are spent in gambling or on extravagant shopping sprees. Setbacks do not perturb the patient, but rather act as goads to new activities. Euphoria and expansiveness sometimes bubble over into delusions of power and grandeur, which, in turn, may make the patient offensively aggressive. Up to a point, the patient\u2019s mirth and good spirits may be contagious, and others may join in; however, if the patient"

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep). More talkative than usual or pressured to keep talking. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.

In psychological fac- tors affecting other medical conditions, the emphasis is on the exacerbation of the medical condition (e.g., an individual with angina that is precipitated whenever he becomes anx- ious). In somatic symptom disorder, the emphasis is on maladaptive thoughts, feelings, and behavior (e.g., an individual with angina who worries constantly that she will have a heart attack, takes her blood pressure multiple times per day, and restricts her activities)."

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

The latter includes changes in sleep, eating, \ufb02uid intake, bowel movements, social activities, exercise, or work. Note the dates the patient discontinued her work or took to bed. Is she continuously confined to bed? c. Determine the patient\u2019s psychological reaction to her illness (anxiety, depression, irritability, fear) by observing how she relates her story as well as her nonverbal behavior. The response to a question such as, \u201cHave you any particular theories about or fear of what may be the matter with you?\u201d may yield important clues relative to the patient\u2019s understanding and feeling about her illness. The reply may help in the management of the patient\u2019s problem and allow the physician to give advice according to the patient\u2019s understanding of her ailment."

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"
