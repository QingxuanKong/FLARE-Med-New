    "question": "A 67-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for urinary incontinence. She has been waking up every morning with her underwear soaked in urine. She notices that at work if she does not take regular bathroom breaks her underwear will have some urine in it. She urinates 5 to 11 times per day but she claims it is a small volume. Her current medications include lisinopril, metformin, insulin, aspirin, atorvastatin, sodium docusate, and loratadine. Her temperature is 98.2\u00b0F (36.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 167/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for decreased pinprick sensation in the lower extremities and a systolic murmur along the right upper sternal border. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?",

The patient's symptoms of waking up with soiled underwear and the need for frequent bathroom breaks during the day suggest an overactive bladder or an overactive bladder syndrome. The patient's medications, including lisinopril, metformin, insulin, aspirin, atorvastatin, sodium docusate, and loratadine, do not appear to be directly related to the urinary incontinence. The physical exam findings of decreased pinprick sensation in the lower extremities and a systolic murmur along the right upper sternal border are not directly related to the urinary incontinence. The patient's blood pressure is elevated at 167/108 mmHg, which may be contributing to the urinary incontinence. The patient's age and symptoms suggest that the best treatment option is to reduce fluid intake and discontinue diuretics, which can exacerbate overactive bladder symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

The nights have been cold, and they have used a small char-coal burner to keep warm inside the vehicle. What is the most likely diagnosis? What treatment should be instituted immediately?

Daily follow-up by telephone or visit is important and the patient should be reassessed if she notes worsening of the symptoms or if her weight gain increases to more than 2 lb per day. Indications for hospitalization include an inability to tolerate oral hydration, hemodynamic instability, respiratory compromise, tense ascites, hemoconcentration, leukocytosis, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, abnormal renal or liver function, and decreased oxygen saturation. Fluid intake and urine output need to be carefully measured, and admission to an intensive care setting can be considered if the patient has hyperkalemia, renal failure, respiratory failure, or thromboembolic disease. Although intravenous \ufb02uids may worsen ascities, they are essential to correct"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"
