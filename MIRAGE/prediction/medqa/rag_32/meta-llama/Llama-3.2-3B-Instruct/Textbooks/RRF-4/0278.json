The patient has a past medical history of COPD and a 44-pack-year smoking history. The patient has been admitted before for a similar presentation. His temperature is 98.7\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 177/118 mmHg, pulse is 123/min, respirations are 33/min, and oxygen saturation is 80% on room air. The patient is started on 100% oxygen, albuterol, ipratropium, magnesium, and prednisone. The patient claims he is still short of breath. Physical exam reveals bilateral wheezes and poor air movement. His oxygen saturation is 80%. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",

The patient has been admitted before for a similar presentation, indicating a possible exacerbation of COPD. The initial treatment with 100% oxygen, albuterol, ipratropium, magnesium, and prednisone is appropriate for acute bronchospasm and inflammation. However, the patient's oxygen saturation remains low at 80\\% on room air, indicating continued respiratory distress. The next step should focus on improving oxygenation and addressing the underlying cause of the exacerbation.\\n\\nGiven the patient's history of COPD and the severity of symptoms, the use of BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) may be necessary to improve oxygenation and reduce work of breathing. BiPAP can help increase oxygen saturation and reduce respiratory effort by providing a more tailored level of support for both inspiratory and expiratory phases of breathing. This can be particularly beneficial in patients with severe COPD who have difficulty maintaining adequate oxygenation and are not responding to conventional oxygen therapy.\\n\\nChest tube placement (B) may be considered if there is evidence of pneumothorax or significant air leak, but there is no indication of these conditions in the provided information. Intubation (C) may be necessary in severe cases of respiratory failure, but it is not the next best step without further evaluation of the patient's respiratory status. Needle decompression (D) is not a standard treatment for COPD exacerbation and is not indicated in this scenario.\\n\\nTherefore, the best next step in management is to initiate BiPAP therapy to improve oxygenation and reduce respiratory distress.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"A\"}",

It is important to assess oxygenation in severe cases of bronchiolitis. Pulse oximetry is adequate for monitoring oxygen saturation.

A careful history, however, usually reveals the presence of symptoms prior to the acute exacerbation.

            "content": "A 65-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe central chest pain that radiated to the neck and predominantly to the left arm. He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

The patient has signs of imminent respiratory failure, including her refusal to lie down, her fear, and her tachycardia, which can-not be attributed to her minimal treatment with albuterol. Critically important immediate steps are to administer high-flow oxygen and to start albuterol by nebulization. Adding ipratropium (Atrovent) to the nebulized solution is recom-mended. A corticosteroid (0.5\u20131.0 mg/kg of methylpred-nisolone) should be administered intravenously. It is also advisable to alert the intensive care unit, because a patient with severe bronchospasm who tires can slip into respiratory failure quickly, and intubation can be difficult. Fortunately, most patients treated in hospital emergency departments do well. Asthma mortality is rare (fewer than 4000 deaths"

            "content": "The majority of the manifestations of respiratory disease present as abnormalities of auscultation. Wheezes are a manifestation of airway obstruction. While most commonly a sign of asthma, peribronchial edema in the setting of congestive heart failure can also result in diffuse wheezes, as can any other process that causes narrowing of small airways. For this reason, clinicians must take care not to attribute all wheezing to asthma. Rhonchi are a manifestation of obstruction of medium-sized airways, most often with secretions. In the acute setting, this manifestation may be a sign of viral or bacterial bronchitis. Chronic rhonchi suggest bronchiectasis or COPD. Stridor, a high-pitched, focal inspiratory wheeze, usually heard over the neck, is a manifestation of upper airway obstruction and should prompt expedited evaluation of the patient, as it can precede complete upper airway obstruction and respiratory failure."

Focused History: As noted on her medical alert bracelet, MW has had type 1 diabetes (T1D) for the last 24 years. Her husband reports that this is her first medical emergency in 2 years. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): MW displayed signs of dehydration (such as dry mucous membranes and skin, poor skin turgor, and low blood pressure) and acidosis (such as deep, rapid breathing [Kussmaul respiration]).

Most commonly, physical examination reveals tachypnea and bibasilar end-inspiratory dry crackles, which are common in most forms of ILD associated with inflammation but are less likely to be heard in the granulomatous lung diseases. Crackles may be present in the absence of radiographic abnormalities on the chest radiograph. Scattered late inspiratory high-pitched rhonchi\u2014so-called inspiratory squeaks\u2014are heard in patients with bronchiolitis. The cardiac examination is usually normal except in the middle or late stages of the disease, when findings of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale may become evident (Chap. 304). Cyanosis and clubbing of the digits occur in some patients with advanced disease."

Shallow and irregular respirations, stertorous breathing (indicating obstruction to inspiration), and cyanosis require the establishment of a clear airway and delivery of oxygen. The patient should initially be placed in a lateral position so that secretions and vomitus do not enter the tracheobronchial tree. Secretions and vomitus should be removed by suctioning as soon as they accumulate; otherwise they will lead to atelectasis and bronchopneumonia. Arterial blood gases should be measured and further observed by monitoring of oxygen saturation. A patient\u2019s inability to protect against aspiration and the presence of either hypoxia or hypoventilation dictate the use of endotracheal intubation and a positive-pressure respirator. 2. The management of shock, if present, takes precedence over all other diagnostic and therapeutic measures."

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"
