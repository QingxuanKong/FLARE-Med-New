    "question": "A 5-year-old boy of African descent is presented to the emergency department by his parents. The child is clutching his abdomen and crying about pain in his belly. His mother reports intermittent episodes of jaundice with joint and bone pain since he was 5 months old. At presentation, the patient\u2019s vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals slight jaundice and pale conjunctiva. The spleen is tender and easily palpable. After a complete blood count with differential and an abdominal ultrasound, the patient is found to have sickle-cell disease with splenic infarct. A partial splenectomy is performed. After the operation, the physician provides vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The picture shows a slide obtained from the resected portion of the patient\u2019s spleen. Dysfunction of the zone marked with which number predisposes the patient to the aforementioned infections?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to understand the role of the spleen in the immune system and how its dysfunction affects the patient's susceptibility to certain infections. The spleen is responsible for filtering the blood and removing pathogens, including encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. These bacteria are often referred to as \\\"encapsulated organisms\\\" because they have a protective outer layer (capsule) that helps them evade the immune system. In individuals with a functional spleen, the spleen can recognize and remove these encapsulated bacteria from the bloodstream. However, in patients with asplenia (spleen dysfunction) or splenectomy (spleen removal), the spleen is no longer able to perform this function, leaving the patient vulnerable to overwhelming infections by these bacteria.\\n\\nIn the context of the patient in the scenario, the partial splenectomy performed to treat the patient's sickle-cell disease has compromised the patient's splenic function. The patient is now at increased risk of infections by encapsulated organisms, specifically Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. These infections are the hallmark of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI).\\n\\nBased on this information, the correct answer can be determined by identifying the zones of the spleen responsible for immune function. The zones of the spleen involved in immune function are zone I, II, and III, which are responsible for filtering the blood and removing pathogens, including encapsulated bacteria. Therefore, dysfunction of zones 1, 2, and 3 predisposes the patient to infections by these bacteria.\\n\\nThe correct answer is D. 1, 2, and 3.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

By that time, splenic dysfunction is caused by sickling of the RBCs within the spleen, resulting in an inability to filter microorganisms from the bloodstream in most patients. Splenic dysfunction is followed, eventually, by splenic infarction, usually by 2 to 4 years of age. The loss of normal splenic function makes the patient susceptible to overwhelming infection by encapsulated organisms, especially Streptococcus pneumoniae and other pathogens (Table 150-8).The hallmark of infection is fever. A febrile patient with a sickle cell syndrome (temperature >38.5\u00b0C) must be evaluated immediately (see Chapter 96). Current precautions to prevent infections include prophylactic daily oral penicillin begun at diagnosis and vaccinations against pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B virus, and influenza virus."

Massive splenomegaly may cause early satiety. Pain may result from acute swelling of the spleen with stretching of the capsule, infarction, or inflammation of the capsule. For many years, it was believed that splenic infarction was clinically silent, which, at times, is true. However, Soma Weiss, in his classic 1942 report of the self-observations by a Harvard medical student on the clinical course of subacute bacterial endocarditis, documented that severe LUQ and pleuritic chest pain may accompany thromboembolic occlusion of splenic blood flow. Vascular occlusion, with infarction and pain, is commonly seen in children with sickle cell crises. Rupture of the spleen, from either trauma or infiltrative disease that breaks the capsule, may result in intraperitoneal bleeding, shock, and death. The rupture itself may be painless."

Patients under age 20 years are particularly susceptible to overwhelming sepsis with S. pneumoniae, and the overall actuarial risk of sepsis in patients who have had their spleens removed is about 7% in 10 years. The case\u2013fatality rate for pneumococcal sepsis in splenectomized patients is 50\u201380%. About 25% of patients without spleens will develop a serious infection at some time in their life. The frequency is highest within the first 3 years after splenectomy. About 15% of the infections are polymicrobial, and lung, skin, and blood are the most common sites. No increased risk of viral infection has been noted in patients who have no spleen. The susceptibility to bacterial infections relates to the inability to remove opsonized bacteria from the bloodstream"

The true incidence may be underreported, however. Recent case reports abound in the lit-erature regarding spontaneous splenic rupture due to a variety of infectious causes (malaria, Listeria infection, fungal infec-tions, dengue, and Q fever, to name a few) as well as a vari-ety of neoplastic and other noninfectious causes (lymphoma, angiosarcoma, amyloidosis, pregnancy). The presumed patho-physiologic mechanism is infiltration of the splenic paren-chyma with inflammatory cells, which distorts the architecture and fibrous support system of the spleen and thins the splenic capsule.86 In this setting, splenic rupture can occur spontane-ously or after a seemingly minor external trauma or even a Valsalva maneuver.Abscesses of the spleen"
