    "question": "A previously healthy 18-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for evaluation of an abdominal mass noticed a few days ago. He appears markedly pale and lethargic. Examination shows a 6-cm, nonmobile mass in the left upper quadrant that crosses the midline. 24-hour urine collection shows elevated homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid. Further evaluation including biopsy confirms the diagnosis of intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. The physician recommends the established standard treatment, which is initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection, if possible. After a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of chemotherapy, the likelihood of unresectability without neoadjuvant treatment, and the prognosis without it, the patient's parents steadily refuse chemotherapy because they do not want their son to suffer the side effects. They prefer to take their son home for supportive care only. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The physician should first ensure that the parents understand the risks and benefits of chemotherapy, as well as the potential consequences of not treating the neuroblastoma. The parents' refusal of chemotherapy may be due to lack of understanding or misconceptions about the treatment. The physician should take the time to explain the established standard treatment and the potential outcomes without chemotherapy, including the risk of unresectability and poor prognosis. The physician should also consider the potential benefits of chemotherapy, such as increasing the rate of resectability and killing tumor cells before they can be spread intraoperatively. If the parents still refuse chemotherapy after a thorough discussion, the physician should seek support from other healthcare professionals, such as a social worker or a pediatric oncologist, to help the family make an informed decision. If the parents still refuse, the physician may need to consider seeking a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy to ensure the child receives necessary treatment. However, this should be a last resort and after exhausting all other options. The physician should not refer the patient to another oncologist or recommend that the parents wait two weeks to think about the decision, as this may delay the child's treatment and potentially worsen the prognosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The patients are rarely jaundiced but may complain of anorexia and weight loss. Most liver function tests are normal. AFP levels are increased in 90% of children with hepatoblastomas but much less commonly in other liver malignancies. Radiographic evaluation of these children should include an abdominal CT scan to identify the lesion and to determine the degree of local invasiveness (Fig. 39-40). For malignant appearing lesions, a biopsy should be performed unless the lesion can be completely resected easily. Hepatoblastoma is most often unifocal, while hepatocellular carcinoma is often extensively invasive or multi-centric. If a hepatoblastoma is completely removed, the majority of patients survive, but only a minority of patients have lesions amenable to complete resection at diagnosis.A staging system based on postsurgical extent of tumor and surgical"

After an initial diagnostic biopsy, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy is delivered to reduce the size of the tumor and clinically control undetected metastatic disease. Such therapy is followed by a surgical procedure to remove residual masses; this is called neoadjuvant therapy. Because the sequence of treatment is critical to success and is different from the standard surgery-first approach, coordination among the surgical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and medical oncologist is crucial."

A postoperative MRI study of the brain should be obtained within 24 to 48 hours of surgery to assess the extent of resection. During follow-up, magnetic resonance spectroscopy can help distinguish recurrent tumor from radiation necrosis. The differential diagnosis of a CNS mass lesion includes malignant tumor, benign tumor, arteriovenous malformation, aneurysm, brain abscess, cysticercosis, granulomatous disease (tuberculosis, sarcoid), intracranial hemorrhage, pseudotumor cerebri, vasculitis, and, rarely, metastatic tumor."

The approach depends in part on the nature of the lesion and its location. Lesions high in the pelvis may be approached via a transabdominal route, whereas low lesions may be resected transsacrally. Intermediate lesions may require a combined abdominal and sacral operation. Although survival is excellent after resection of benign lesions, local recurrence is not uncommon. Prognosis after resection of malignant lesions is highly variable and reflects the biology of the underlying tumor.The role of biopsy in this setting has been controversial. Historically, the recommendation was to avoid biopsy because of the risk of infection or needle tract seeding. This recommen-dation has recently been challenged, especially for large and/or unusual tumors that would be better treated with multimodality neoadjuvant therapy"

More recent results with FOLFIRINOX in the setting of metastatic disease have encouraged clinical tri-als using this regimen in the adjuvant setting, which are cur-rently underway (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02172976). Nevertheless, pending further study, it is typical in the United States for patients with acceptable functional status to receive some form of adjuvant chemotherapy and sometimes chemora-diotherapy after surgery.Neoadjuvant Treatment. There are several potential advan-tages to the use of chemotherapy or chemoradiation before an attempt at surgical resection. For example, it avoids the risk that adjuvant treatment is delayed by complications of surgery. Neoadjuvant treatment also may decrease the tumor burden at operation, increasing the rate of resectability and killing some tumor cells before they can be spread intraoperatively. Another potential advantage is that it allows patients with occult"
