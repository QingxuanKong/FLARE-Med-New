    "question": "A 3-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for delayed passage of meconium. His mother is breastfeeding and has started to produce milk. The patient has been feeding well every two hours and is urinating over eight times per day. The patient was born at 35 weeks gestation to a 27-year-old gravida 4. The patient is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and the patient\u2019s parents denied all prenatal genetic testing. The pregnancy was uncomplicated until the patient\u2019s mother had spontaneous rupture of membranes at 35 weeks gestation. The patient\u2019s three older siblings are all healthy. In the hospital nursery, the patient\u2019s temperature is 98.2\u00b0F (36.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 48/32 mmHg, pulse is 164/min, and respirations are 48/min. On physical exam, he appears to be in moderate distress. He has no dysmorphic features, and his abdomen is distended and non-tender. Bowel sounds are absent.\n\nWhich of the following is the best next step in management?",

He was born at 35 weeks gestation and has a history of spontaneous rupture of membranes at 35 weeks gestation. The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible diagnosis of meconium ileus, which is a common complication in newborns with cystic fibrosis (CF). The patient's parents are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, which increases the risk of CF. The fact that the patient's siblings are healthy does not rule out the possibility of CF, as many individuals with CF have asymptomatic siblings. Given the patient's symptoms and risk factors, the best next step in management would be to perform an abdominal radiograph to evaluate for intestinal obstruction and confirm the presence of meconium ileus.

The parents are both in good health, and their family histories are unremarkable. Pertinent Findings: DW has a distended abdomen. She recently vomited small amounts of bilious (green-colored) material. Diagnosis: Meconium ileus (obstruction of the ileum by meconium, the first stool produced by newborns) was confirmed by abdominal x-rays. About 98% of full-term newborns with meconium ileus have cystic fibrosis (CF). Diagnosis of CF was subsequently confirmed with a chloride sweat test. Treatment: The ileus was successfully treated nonsurgically. For management of the CF, the family was referred to the CF center at the regional children\u2019s hospital."

If membranes have been ruptured for many hours before labor onset or if there is a borderline temperature elevation, the temperature is checked hourly. Although uterine contractions are usually assessed with electronic monitoring, they can be quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated manually (Chap. 24, p. 478). With the palm of the hand resting lightly on the uterus, the time of contraction onset is determined. Its intensity is gauged from the degree of irm ness the uterus achieves. At the acme of efective contractions, the finger or thumb cannot readily indent the uterus during a \"irm\" contraction. he time at which the contraction disap pears is noted next. his sequence is repeated to evaluate the frequency, duration, and intensity of contractions."

Train all staf in skills necessary to implement this policy 3. Inform all pregnant about the beneits and management of breastfeeding 4. Help mothers initiate breastfTeding within an hour of birth 5. Show mothers how to breastfeed and how to sustain lactation, even if they should be separated from their infants 6. Feed newborns nothing but breast milk, unless medi cally indicated, and under no circumstances provide breast milk substitutes, feeding bottles, or paCiiers free of charge or at low cost 7. Practice rooming-in, which allows mothers and newborns to remain together 24 hours a day 8. 9."

Meconium ileus occurs when this thick, highly viscous meco-nium becomes impacted in the ileum and leads to high-grade intestinal obstruction.

Meconium ileus can be either uncomplicated, in which there is no intestinal perforation, or complicated, in which prenatal perforation of the intestine has occurred or vascular compromise of the distended ileum devel-ops. Antenatal US may reveal the presence of intra-abdominal or scrotal calcifications, or distended bowel loops. These infants present shortly after birth with progressive abdominal disten-tion and failure to pass meconium with intermittent bilious emesis. Abdominal radiographs show dilated loops of intestine.

Delivery may be the best option for the compromised fetus yet may result in death from immaturity of the cotwin. If fetal lung maturity is conirmed, salvage of both the healthy fetus and its jeopardized sibling is possible. Unfortunately, ideal management if twins are immature is problematic but should be based on the chances of intact survival for both fetuses. Often the compromised fetus is severely growth restricted or anomalous. Thus, performing amniocentesis for fetal chromosomal analysis in women of advanced maternal age carrying twin pregnancies is advantageous, even for those who would continue their pregnancies regardless of the diagnosis. Chromosomal abnormality identification in one fetus allows rational decisions regarding interventions."
