    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the characteristics of the selective alpha-1 agonist and the potential conditions listed in the options. Selective alpha-1 agonists are known to relax smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, which can help alleviate symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). On the other hand, alpha-1 agonists can cause vasodilation, which is not typically used for blood pressure management prior to pheochromocytoma excision, as it may worsen hypotension. Bronchospasm due to asthma is typically treated with bronchodilators, not alpha-1 agonists. Nasal congestion due to a viral infection is typically treated with decongestants, not alpha-1 agonists. Therefore, the most likely condition for which a selective alpha-1 agonist was prescribed is urinary hesitancy due to benign prostatic hyperplasia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung.

For example, clonidine is an antihypertensive agent that is a centrally acting \u03b12 agonist that inhibits sympathetic outflow. Rebound hypertension may occur with the abrupt cessation of clonidine therapy, probably as a consequence of upregulation of \u03b11 receptors."

A frequently overlooked source of additional drug exposure is topical therapy; for example, a patient complaining of bronchospasm may not mention that an ophthalmic beta blocker is being used unless specifically asked. A history of previous adverse drug effects in patients is common. Since these patients have shown a predisposition to drug-induced illnesses, such a history should dictate added caution in prescribing new drugs."

Katzung, MD, PhD A healthy 45-year-old physician attending a reunion in a vacation hotel developed dizziness, redness of the skin over the head and chest, and tachycardia while eating. A short time later, another physician at the table developed similar signs and symptoms with marked orthostatic hypotension. The menu included a green salad, saut\u00e9ed fish with rice, and apple pie. What is the probable diagnosis? How would you treat these patients?"

            "content": "An enuretic episode is most likely to occur 3 to 4 h after sleep onset, and usually, but not necessarily, in stages 3 and 4 sleep. It is preceded by a burst of rhythmic delta waves associated with a general body movement. If the patient is awakened at this point, he does not report any dreams. Imipramine (10 to 75 mg at bedtime) has proved to be an effective agent in reducing the frequency of enuresis. A series of training exercises designed to increase the functional bladder capacity and sphincter tone may also be helpful. Sometimes all that is required is to proscribe fluid intake for several hours prior to sleep and to awaken the patient and have him empty his bladder about 3 h after going to sleep. One interesting patient, an elderly physician with lifelong enuresis, reported that he had finally obtained relief (after all other measures had failed) by using a nasal spray of an analogue of antidiuretic hormone (desmopressin) at bedtime. This has now been adopted for the treatment"
