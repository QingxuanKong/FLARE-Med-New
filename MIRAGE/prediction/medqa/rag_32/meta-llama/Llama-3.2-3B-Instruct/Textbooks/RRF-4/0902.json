    "question": "An otherwise healthy 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of pain and swelling of her right knee joint and left wrist. She went camping with her new boyfriend 3 weeks ago but does not recall any tick bites. Her temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100.0\u00b0F). Examination of the right knee shows swelling, warmth, and tenderness on passive movement. There is a tender pustule on the sole of the left foot. Arthrocentesis of the right knee joint yields 8 mL of cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 45,000/mm3 (90% segmented neutrophils with intracellular organisms). Which of the following is the strongest risk factor for this patient's condition?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of arthritis, such as pain, swelling, and warmth in the right knee joint and left wrist, which are accompanied by a tender pustule on the sole of the left foot. The arthrocentesis of the right knee joint reveals cloudy fluid with a high leukocyte count (45,000/mm3) and 90% segmented neutrophils with intracellular organisms. These findings suggest a bacterial infection, specifically Lyme disease, which is transmitted by tick bites. The patient's recent camping trip with her new boyfriend increases the likelihood of a tick bite. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with early disseminated Lyme disease, which often presents with arthritis, skin rash (erythema migrans), and other systemic symptoms. The strongest risk factor for this patient's condition is the recent camping trip and the presence of a tick bite, which increases the risk of Lyme disease transmission. HLA-B27 positivity is associated with an increased risk of certain types of arthritis, such as ankylosing spondylitis, but it is not directly related to Lyme disease. Autoantibody production is not a relevant risk factor in this case. Intravenous drug use is not mentioned in the patient's history, and there is no indication of a sexually transmitted infection. Therefore, the correct answer is not among the options A, B, or C. D is not the strongest risk factor for Lyme disease, but it is not the correct answer in this case. The correct answer is not explicitly listed, but the strongest risk factor is the recent camping trip and the presence of a tick bite, which increases the risk of Lyme disease transmission. However, based on the options provided, the closest answer is C. Sexually transmitted infection is not relevant to this case, but Lyme disease can be transmitted through tick bites, which is a sexually transmitted behavior in this context. Therefore, the closest answer is C.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Patients with transient synovitis are often afebrile, walk with a painful limp, and have normal to minimally elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate compared with bacterial diseases of the hip (Table 199-1).

Inflammatory arthritis is likely if there is prolonged morning stiffness and many other joints are affected. Bursitis occurs commonly around knees and hips. A physical examination should focus on whether tenderness is over the joint line (at the junction of the two bones around which the joint is articulating) or is outside of it. Anserine bursitis, medial and distal to the knee, is an extremely common cause of chronic knee pain that may respond to a glucocorticoid injection. Prominent nocturnal pain in the absence of end-stage OA merits a distinct workup. For hip pain, OA can be detected by loss of internal rotation on passive movement, and pain isolated to an area lateral to the hip joint usually reflects the presence of trochanteric bursitis.

She is obese (body mass index [BMI] 33), does not exercise, and spends a good portion of her work day in a seated position. She eats a low-sugar diet and regularly eats packaged frozen meals for dinner because she doesn\u2019t have time to cook regularly. Her most recent laboratory values include a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that is above goal at 160 mg/dL (goal < 100 mg/dL) and a hemo-globin A1c that is well controlled at 6%. Her blood pressure is high at 160/100 mm Hg. Her prescription medications include simvastatin, metformin, and benazepril. She also takes over-the-counter ibuprofen for occasional knee pain and a multivitamin supplement once daily. She has heard good things about natural products and asks you if taking a garlic supplement daily could help to bring her blood"

Fever, anorexia, irritability, and lethargy may accompany the focal findings. Weight bearing and active and passive motion of the affected extremity are decreased, mimicking paralysis (pseudoparalysis). Muscle spasm may make the extremity difficult to examine. The adjacent joint space may be involved in young children, suggested by pain with minimal joint range of motion (see Chapter 118)."

He is then switched to celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily, and on this regimen his joint symptoms and heartburn resolve. Two years later, he returns with increased joint symptoms. His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor. With the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, he is started on a regimen"

In early congenital syphilis, periarticular swelling and immobilization of the involved limbs (Parrot\u2019s pseudoparalysis) complicate osteochondritis of long bones. Clutton\u2019s joint, a late manifestation of congenital syphilis that typically develops between ages 8 and 15 years, is caused by chronic painless synovitis with effusions of large joints, particularly the knees and elbows. Secondary syphilis may be associated with arthralgias, with symmetric arthritis of the knees and ankles and occasionally of the shoulders and wrists, and with sacroiliitis. The arthritis follows a subacute to chronic course with a mixed mononuclear and neutrophilic synovial-fluid pleocytosis (typical cell counts, 5000\u201315,000/\u03bcL). Immunologic mechanisms may contribute to the arthritis, and symptoms usually improve rapidly with penicillin therapy. In tertiary syphilis, Charcot\u2019s joint results from sensory loss due to tabes dorsalis."

Blood cultures are positive in up to 50\u201370% of S. aureus infections but are less frequently positive in infections due to other organisms. The synovial fluid is turbid, serosanguineous, or frankly purulent. Gram-stained smears confirm the presence of large numbers of neutrophils. Levels of total protein and lactate dehydrogenase in synovial fluid are elevated, and the glucose level is depressed; however, these findings are not specific for infection, and measurement of these levels is not necessary for diagnosis. The synovial fluid should be examined for crystals, because gout and pseudogout can resemble septic arthritis clinically, and infection and crystal-induced disease occasionally occur together. Organisms are seen on synovial fluid smears in nearly three-quarters of infections with S. aureus and streptococci and in 30\u201350% of infections due to"

In such cases, synovial fluid analysis with microbial cultures is essential to rule out the possibility of infection. In fact, infection in a joint with any microcrystalline deposition process can lead to crystal shedding and subsequent synovitis from both crystals and microorganisms. The leukocyte count in synovial fluid in acute CPPD can range from several thousand cells to 100,000 cells/\u03bcL, with the mean being about 24,000 cells/\u03bcL and the predominant cell being the neutrophil. CPP crystals may be seen inside tissue fragments and fibrin clots and in neutrophils (Fig. 395-2). CPP crystals may coexist with MSU and apatite in some cases."
