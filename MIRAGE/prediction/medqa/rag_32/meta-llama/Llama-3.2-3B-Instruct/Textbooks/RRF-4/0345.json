    "question": "A 52-year-old man comes to the physician because of generalized pruritus and raised, erythematous plaques on the skin over his hands, chest, and legs for 6 hours. He reports having clear liquid discharge from his nose and sneezing. He says that his symptoms began suddenly the previous night, 30 minutes after he had dinner at a seafood restaurant. He has had similar symptoms occasionally in the past as well. Four months ago, he had an episode of narrow-angle glaucoma. He takes no medications. His vital signs are within normal limits. Nasal exam shows clear, serous secretions, with edematous and erythematous mucosa and turbinates. Paranasal sinuses are not tender to palpation. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the question: **Step 1: Analyze the patient's symptoms** The patient presents with generalized pruritus (itching) and raised, erythematous plaques on the skin over his hands, chest, and legs, which began suddenly after dinner at a seafood restaurant. He also reports clear liquid discharge from his nose and sneezing. **Step 2: Consider possible causes** The symptoms of pruritus, erythematous plaques, and nasal discharge are suggestive of an allergic reaction, possibly to the seafood. The recent episode of narrow-angle glaucoma and the use of no medications by the patient suggest an allergic reaction to a food or environmental allergen. **Step 3: Review potential treatment options** The options provided are: A. Diphenhydramine B. Fexofenadine C. Vitamin K D. Calamine lotion **Step 4: Eliminate options** Vitamin K (C) is not typically used to treat allergic reactions or skin conditions. Calamine lotion (D) is a topical treatment for skin irritation, but it's not the most effective treatment for an allergic reaction. **Step 5: Choose between remaining options** Diphenhydramine (A) is an antihistamine that can help relieve itching and reduce the allergic response, but it may not be the most effective option for this patient's symptoms. Fexofenadine (B) is a non-sedating antihistamine that is effective for treating allergic reactions, including skin symptoms and itching. **Step 6: Select the best option** Based on the patient's symptoms and the need to relieve itching and reduce the allergic response, Fexofenadine (B) is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy. The final answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of generalized pruritus, erythematous plaques, and nasal discharge are suggestive of an allergic reaction, possibly to the seafood. Fexofenadine is a non-sedating antihistamine that is effective for treating allergic reactions, including skin symptoms and itching. It is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

Dx: Classic presentations with a history of repeated attacks over an extended period of time require no evaluation. First episodes require a workup to exclude disorders associated with Horner\u2019s syndrome (e.g., carotid artery dissection or cavernous sinus infection). Tx: Acute therapy: High-\ufb02 ow O2 (100% non-rebreather), dihydroergotamine, octreotide, sumatriptan or zolmitriptan. Prophylactic therapy: Transitional (prednisone, ergotamine), maintenance (verapamil, methysergide, lithium, valproic acid, topiramate). Considered by some to be a milder form of migraine headache. More common in females than in males."

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian"
