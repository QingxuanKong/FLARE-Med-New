    "question": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to a pediatrician by his parents for evaluation of frequent bed wetting during the night. A detailed history reveals that there has been no history of urinary incontinence during the day since the boy was 4 years of age, but that he has never been dry at night continuously for 1 week. There is no history of urinary tract infections, urgency, frequency, or hesitancy. On physical examination, the boy\u2019s vital signs are stable. His neurologic and abdominal examinations are completely normal. His laboratory investigations are as follows:\nUrine-specific gravity (first-morning sample) 1.035\nUrine red blood cells Absent\nUrine pus cells Absent\nUrine culture Negative\nWhich of the following is the next step in the management of this patient?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with frequent bed wetting at night without a history of urinary tract infections, urgency, frequency, or hesitancy. The laboratory investigations show a normal urine specific gravity and no red or white blood cells or pus in the urine. This suggests that the patient does not have an infection or significant urinary tract abnormalities. The patient is also dry during the day, which rules out a neurogenic cause of enuresis. The next step in management would be to consider non-medication and behavioral interventions to address the enuresis. An enuresis alarm is a common and effective treatment for nocturnal enuresis in children who are otherwise healthy and have no underlying medical conditions. Reassuring the parents and using an enuresis alarm is a reasonable approach in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" } ``` The answer is B. Reassuring the parents and use of an enuresis alarm. This is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient, given the absence of any underlying medical conditions or urinary tract abnormalities. The enuresis alarm is a non-pharmacological intervention that can be effective in helping the child learn to recognize and respond to the sensation of a full bladder, thereby reducing the frequency of bed wetting.",

            "content": "The history focuses on elucidating the pattern of voiding: How often does wetting occur? Does it occur during the day, night, or both? Are there any associated conditions with wetting episodes (e.g., bad dreams, consumption of caffeinated beverages, or exhausting days)? Has the child had a period of dryness in the past? Did a stressful event precede the change in wetting pattern? A review of systems should include a developmental history and detailed information about the neurologic, urinary, and gastrointestinal systems (including patterns of defecation). A history of sleep patterns also is important, including snoring, parasomnias, and timing of nighttime urination. A family history often reveals that one or both parents had enuresis as children. Although enuresis is rarely associated with child abuse, physical and sexual abuse history should be included as part of the psychosocial history. Many families have tried numerous interventions before seeking a physician\u2019s help."

            "content": "A diagnosis of ASB can be considered only when the patient does not have local or systemic symptoms referable to the urinary tract. The clinical presentation is usually that of a patient who undergoes a screening urine culture for a reason unrelated to the genitourinary tract and is incidentally found to have bacteriuria. The presence of systemic signs or symptoms such as fever, altered mental status, and leukocytosis in the setting of a positive urine culture does not merit a diagnosis of symptomatic UTI unless other potential etiologies have been considered. The typical symptoms of cystitis are dysuria, urinary frequency, and urgency. Nocturia, hesitancy, suprapubic discomfort, and gross hematuria are often noted as well. Unilateral back or flank pain is generally an indication that the upper urinary tract is involved. Fever also is an indication of invasive infection of either the kidney or the prostate."

            "content": "when chronic kidney disease is detected during routine evaluation or during pregnancy. Affected adults are frequently asymptomatic, but may give a history of prolonged bed-wetting or recurrent UTIs during childhood, and exhibit variable renal insufficiency, hypertension, mild to moderate proteinuria, and unremarkable urine sediment. When both kidneys are affected, the disease often progresses inexorably over several years to ESRD, despite the absence of ongoing urinary infections or reflux. A single affected kidney may go undetected, except for the presence of hypertension. Renal ultrasound in adults characteristically shows asymmetric small kidneys with irregular outlines, thinned cortices, and regions of compensatory hypertrophy (Fig. 340-4)."

In this age group, the most commonly identified serious bacterial infection is a UTI. A blood culture to evaluate for occult bacteremia, and urinalysis and urine culture to evaluate for a UTI, should be considered for all children younger than 3 years of age with fever without localizing signs. Stool culture should be obtained in those with diarrhea marked by blood or mucous. Ill-appearing children should be admitted to the hospital and treated with empirical antibiotics. Approximately 0.2% of well-appearing febrile children 3 to 36 months of age vaccinated against S. pneumoniae and"

            "content": "Diagnostic Approach The history should focus on the presence or absence of thirst, polyuria, and/or an extrarenal source for water loss, 304 such as diarrhea. The physical examination should include a detailed neurologic exam and an assessment of the ECFV; patients with a particularly large water deficit and/or a combined deficit in electrolytes and water may be hypovolemic, with reduced JVP and orthostasis. Accurate documentation of daily fluid intake and daily urine output is also critical for the diagnosis and management of hypernatremia. Laboratory investigation should include a measurement of serum and urine osmolality, in addition to urine electrolytes. The appropriate response to hypernatremia and a serum osmolality >295 mOsm/kg is an increase in circulating AVP and the excretion of low volumes (<500 mL/d) of maximally concentrated urine, i.e., urine with osmolality >800 mOsm/kg; should this be the case, then an extrarenal source of water loss is primarily responsible for the"

This condition afflicts approximately 10 percent of children between 4 and 14 years of age, boys more than girls, and continues in many cases to be a problem even into adolescence and adulthood. Although developmentally delayed children are notably late in acquiring sphincter control (some never do), the majority of enuretic individuals are normal in other respects."
