A clinical research study has enrolled 1,200 patients, half of whom have the disease.

    "predict": "To determine the test's overall specificity, we need to calculate the number of patients without PD who test positive (false positives) and divide it by the sum of the number of patients without PD who test positive and the number of patients with PD who test positive. Number of patients without PD who test positive (false positives) = 20 Number of patients with PD who test positive (true positives) = 590 Total number of patients who test positive = 20 + 590 = 610 Specificity = (Number of patients without PD who test positive) / (Total number of patients who test positive) = 20 / 610 = 0.0326 (or approximately 3.26%) However, this is not among the answer options. Let's re-evaluate the calculation. Specificity = (Number of patients without PD who test positive) / (Total number of patients who test positive) = 20 / 610 = 0.0326 = 3.26% Since specificity is typically expressed as a percentage, we can convert it to a percentage: Specificity = 3.26% \u2248 3.26 / 100 = 0.0326 Now, let's re-evaluate the answer options: A. 580 / (20 + 590) = 580 / 610 \u2248 0.95 (or 95%) B. 580 / (10 + 580) = 580 / 590 \u2248 0.986 (or 98.6%) C. 590 / (590 + 10) = 590 / 600 \u2248 0.983 (or 98.3%) D. 580 / (580 + 20) = 580 / 600 \u2248 0.967 (or 96.7%) The correct answer is B. 580 / (10 + 580) = 580 / 590 \u2248 0.986 (or 98.6%).",

It is noteworthy that James Parkinson was a general physician who captured the essence of this condition based on a visual inspection of a mere handful of patients.

PD affects men and women of all races, all occupations, and all countries. The mean age of onset is about 60 years.

            "content": "both bone and liver scanning. PET scanning is becoming a popular means of total body scanning for breast cancer, but there have been concerns that this modality may miss some bony metastasis. A study found that PET scan is highly concordant (81%) with bone scan in a study of 132 paired studies of breast cancer patients (31). Of 31 (19%) discordant pairs, 12 patients had pathology proven metastatic disease. Nine of these 12 patients had a positive PET scan but negative bone scan, supporting the use of PET scan in detecting osseous metastasis in breast cancer, although further studies are needed to ascertain whether this modality should supplant the use of bone scan in this setting."

            "content": "Approximately half of the patients have a mild pleocytosis and some of these have PAS-positive material in the CSF. A variety of brain imaging abnormalities have been recorded, none characteristic, but either enhancing focal lesions or a normal scan may be found. The diagnosis is made mainly from PAS staining of an intestinal (jejunal) biopsy, as already mentioned, supplemented by PCR testing of the bowel tissue or biopsy material from brain or lymph node. In cases of subacute progressive limb and gait ataxia occurring in middle-aged or older men in whom no cause is uncovered by less-invasive means, it is justifiable to perform these tests (see Chap. 5). Rarely, the neurologic symptoms may occur in the absence of gastrointestinal disease (Adams et al, 1987). In the review of 84 cases of cerebral Whipple disease by Louis and colleagues, 71 percent had cognitive changes, half with psychiatric features; 31 percent had myoclonus; 18 percent had ataxia; and 20 percent had the"

The standard scintigraphic evaluation of gastric emptying involves the ingestion of a test meal with one or two isotopes and scanning the patient under a gamma camera. A curve for gastric emptying is plotted, and the half-time is calcu-lated. Normal standards exist at each facility. Duodenogastric reflux can be quantitated by the IV administration of hepato-biliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA scan), which is concentrated and excreted by the liver into the duodenum. Software allows a semiquantitative assessment of how much of the isotope refluxes into the stomach. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan or CT/PET scan is useful in staging certain patients with gastric malignancy.Tests for Helicobacter pylori. A variety of tests can help the clinician to determine whether the patient has active H pylori infection.73 The predictive value (positive and negative) of any of these tests when used as a screening tool depends on the prevalence of H pylori infection in the"
