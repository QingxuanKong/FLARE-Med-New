Two weeks after the conditioning regimen, he develops a fever of 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F). Laboratory studies show a low hemoglobin level, low leukocyte count, low percentage of segmented neutrophils, low platelet count, and a high percentage of lymphocytes. The patient is likely experiencing febrile neutropenia, a condition characterized by fever and a low neutrophil count. The goal of pharmacotherapy is to treat the underlying infection and stimulate the production of neutrophils. Among the options, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a growth factor that stimulates the production of neutrophils and is commonly used to treat febrile neutropenia. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) is involved in the regulation of immune responses, but it is not typically used to treat febrile neutropenia. Erythropoietin is a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production, but it is not relevant to this patient's condition. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a cytokine involved in the regulation of eosinophil production, but it is not typically used to treat febrile neutropenia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

He was recently incarcerated near Bakersfield, California and returned to Oakland about 3 months ago. He is currently experiencing one month of severe headache and double vision. He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

            "content": "The principles of therapy for HIV infection have been articulated by a panel sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as a working group of the NIH Office of AIDS Research Advisory Council. These principles are summarized in Table 226-23. As noted in these guidelines, cART of HIV infection does not lead to eradication or cure of HIV. The single possible exception to this is an individual with HIV infection who received an allogeneic stem cell transplant for treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia. His conditioning regimen included cytotoxic chemotherapy, total-body irradiation, and antithymocyte immunoglobulin. The donor cells were homozygous for the CCR5\u039432 mutation (see above) and thus resistant to HIV infection. Despite cART being stopped the day of the transplant, the patient has exhibited no signs of active HIV infection for more than 8 years."

            "content": "Patients with ALL are classified into four prognostic risk groups (low, standard, high, and very high) based on age, initial WBC count, genetic characteristics, and response to induction therapy. Classification systems are complex and evolving (Table 155-2). In general low-risk patients are 1 to 9 years old with an initial WBC count less than 50,000/mm3 and favorable cytogenetic findings such as t(12;21). High-risk patients are younger than 1 year of age or 10 years of age and older, have an initial WBC count greater than 50,000/mm3, have CNS or testicular disease at diagnosis, or have unfavorable cytogenetics such as t(4;11). Very high-risk patients have a hypodiploid DNA index, a t(9;22) translocation, or fail to achieve remission after 4 weeks of therapy. All other patients are considered to have standard-risk ALL. Immunophenotype, minimal residual disease, and early response to therapy are other factors that influence risk stratification. Infants with ALL generally have a highly"

            "content": "Secondary prophylaxis refers to the administration of CSFs in patients who have experienced a neutropenic complication from a prior cycle of chemotherapy; dose reduction or delay may be a reasonably considered alternative. G-CSF or GM-CSF is conventionally started 24\u201372 h after completion of chemotherapy and continued until a PMN count of 10,000/\u03bcL is achieved, unless a \u201cdepot\u201d preparation of G-CSF such as pegfilgrastim is used, where one dose is administered at least 14 days before the next scheduled administration of chemotherapy. Also, patients with myeloid leukemias undergoing induction therapy may have a slight reduction in the duration of neutropenia if G-CSF is commenced after completion of therapy and may be of particular value in elderly patients, but the influence on long-term outcome has not been defined. GM-CSF probably has a more restricted utility than G-CSF, with its use currently limited to patients after autologous bone marrow transplants, although proper head-to-head"

            "content": "In general, these malignancies arise either from lymphoid tissues-lymphoblastic or lymphocytic leukemias, or from bone marrow-myeloid leukemias. hey can be acute or chronic. Although adult leukemias are more prevalent after age 40, they still are among the most common malignancies of young women (see Fig. 63-1). Leukemia was diagnosed in 1 in 40,000 pregnancies reported to the California Cancer Registry (Smith, 2003). In a review of 72 pregnancies complicated by leukemia from 1975 until 1988, 44 had acute myelogenous leukemia; 20 had acute lymphocytic leukemia; and eight had one of the chronic leukemias (Caligiuri, 1989). Acute leukemias almost always cause marked peripheral blood count abnormalities, and often the white blood cell count is elevated with readily recognizable circulating blast cells. The diagnosis is made from bone marrow biopsy."

            "content": "Peripheral blood counts usually reach their nadir several days to a week after transplant as a consequence of the preparative regimen; then cells produced by the transplanted stem cells begin to appear in the peripheral blood. The rate of recovery depends on the source of stem cells, the use of posttransplant growth factors, and the form of GVHD prophylaxis used. If marrow is the source of stem cells, recovery to 100 granulocytes/\u03bcL occurs on average by day 16 and to 500/\u03bcL by day 22. Use of G-CSF\u2013mobilized peripheral blood stem cells speeds the rate of recovery by ~1 week when compared to marrow, whereas engraftment following cord blood transplantation is typically delayed by ~1 week compared to marrow. Use of a myeloid growth factor (G-CSF or GM-CSF) after transplant can accelerate recovery by 3\u20135 days, whereas use of methotrexate to prevent GVHD delays engraftment by a similar"

Features that suggest bone marrow failure and mandate an examination of bone marrow include a low reticulocyte count, teardrop forms of RBCs(implying marrow replacement, not just failure), presenceof abnormal forms of leukocytes or myeloid elements lessmature than band forms, small platelets, and an elevatedmean corpuscular volume in the face of a low reticulocytecount. Pancytopenia resulting from bone marrow failure isusually a gradual process, starting with one or two cell lines, but later involving all three cell lines. Features suggestingincreased destruction include reticulocytosis, jaundice,immature erythroid or myeloid elements on the blood smear,large platelets, and increased serum bilirubin and lactic dehydrogenase.
