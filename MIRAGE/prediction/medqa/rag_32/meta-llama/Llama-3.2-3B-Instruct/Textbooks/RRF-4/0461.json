    "question": "A 58-year-old man comes to the physician because he is unable to achieve erections during sexual intercourse. He first noticed the problem 8 months ago, when he became sexually active with a new girlfriend. He states that his relationship with his girlfriend is good, but his inability to engage in sexual intercourse has been frustrating. He has hyperlipidemia and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder 3 years ago. He works as a lawyer and enjoys his job, but he has had a great deal of stress lately. He had not been sexually active for the previous 3 years, since the death of his wife. He does not smoke. He drinks 4\u20136 beers on weekends. Current medications include simvastatin and citalopram. His temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 135/82 mm Hg. BMI is 30 kg/m2. Pedal pulses are difficult to palpate. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a history of major depressive disorder and is currently taking citalopram, an SSRI. The patient's inability to achieve erections during sexual intercourse is a common symptom of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction, which can occur in up to 50\\% of patients taking SSRIs. The patient's relationship with his girlfriend is good, and there is no indication of other underlying medical conditions that could be causing his erectile dysfunction (ED). The patient's stress levels have increased recently, which could be contributing to his ED. Given the patient's history of major depressive disorder and the recent increase in stress levels, it is likely that his ED is related to his antidepressant medication. Switching to a different antidepressant may be a viable option. Considering the options provided, switching citalopram to bupropion is a reasonable next step, as bupropion is less commonly associated with sexual dysfunction compared to SSRIs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

It is also important to address libido, as decreased sexual drive and ED are sometimes the earliest signs of endocrine abnormalities (e.g., increased prolactin, decreased testosterone levels). It is useful to ask whether the problem is confined to coitus with one partner or also involves other partners; ED not uncommonly arises in association with new or extramarital sexual relationships. Situational ED, as opposed to consistent ED, suggests psychogenic causes. Ejaculation is much less commonly affected than erection, but questions should be asked about whether ejaculation is normal, premature, delayed, or absent.

Prior to puberty, cross-dress- ing produces generalized feelings of pleasurable excitement. With the arrival of puberty, dressing in women\u2019s clothes begins to elicit penile erection and, in some cases, leads di- rectly to first ejaculation. In many cases, cross-dressing elicits less and less sexual ex- citement as the individual grows older; eventually it may produce no discernible penile response at all. The desire to cross-dress, at the same time, remains the same or grows even stronger. Individuals who report such a diminution of sexual response typically report that the sexual excitement of cross-dressing has been replaced by feelings of comfort or well-being."

            "content": "Christian L\u00fcscher, MD A 15-year-old high school student is brought to the emergency department after his parents found him in his room staring at the ceiling and visibly frightened. Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."

Past experiences, intimacy, knowledge, and partner availability should also be ascertained. Medical disorders that may affect sexual health should be delineated. They include diabetes, cardiovascular disease, gynecologic conditions, obstetric history, depression, anxiety disorders, and neurologic disease. Medications should be reviewed as they may affect arousal, libido, and orgasm. The need for counseling and recognizing life stresses should be identified. The physical examination should assess the genitalia, including the clitoris. Pelvic floor examination may identify prolapse or other disorders. Laboratory studies are needed, especially if menopausal status is uncertain. Estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) are usually obtained, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) should be considered as it reflects adrenal androgen"

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

He saw his PCP for evaluation of low back pain. X-rays of the spine showed some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine plus several wedge deformities in the thoracic spine. The patient is a long-time smoker (up to two packs per day) and has two to four glasses of wine with dinner, more on the weekends. He has chronic bronchitis, presumably from smoking, and has been treated on numerous occasions with oral prednisone for exacerba-tions of bronchitis. He is currently on 10 mg/d prednisone. Examination shows kyphosis of the thoracic spine, with some tenderness to fist percussion over the thoracic spine. The dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measure-ment of the lumbar spine is \u201cwithin the normal limits,\u201d but the radiologist noted that the reading may be misleading because of degenerative changes.
