The patient has a past medical history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is a common cause of pernicious anemia. The hematocrit is 29%, which is low, and the peripheral blood smear shows neutrophils with 7 lobes and large oval-shaped red blood cells, which is consistent with megaloblastic anemia. The patient also has decreased position sense and loss of vibratory sensation in her lower extremities, which suggests a neurological component to the anemia. The presence of megaloblastic anemia and neurological symptoms suggests a deficiency in vitamin B12, which is a key component of the treatment for pernicious anemia. The correct answer is B. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies, as this is a hallmark of pernicious anemia, where the body's immune system attacks the cells in the stomach that produce intrinsic factor, a protein necessary for vitamin B12 absorption.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

It is useful to ask the laboratory to generate a Wright\u2019s-stained peripheral blood smear and examine it.
