Contact sports may also result in ACL injury due to sudden twisting, hyperextension, and valgus force related to direct collision. The injury usually affects the mid-portion of the ligament and manifests itself as a complete or partial discontinuity of the fibers or abnormal orientation and contour of the ligament. With an acute ACL tear, a sudden click or pop can be heard and the knee becomes rapidly swollen. Several tests are used to clinically assess the injury, and the diagnosis is usually confirmed by MRI. A full thickness ACL tear causes instability of the knee joint. The treatment depends on the desired level of activity of the patient. In those with high activity levels, surgical reconstruction of the ligament is required. Those with low activity levels may opt for knee bracing and"

Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

            "content": "Case 2: Skin Rash Patient Presentation: KL is a 34-year-old woman who presents with a red, nonitchy rash on her left thigh and flu-like symptoms. Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

A 67-year-old man was noted to have a mass at the back of his knee. The mass measured approximately 4 cm in transverse diameter. The patient was otherwise fit and well and had no other history of note. The mass was arising from one of the structures in the popliteal fossa. Within the popliteal fossa there is a neurovascular bundle that contains the sciatic nerve (and its two divisions), the popliteal artery and the popliteal vein. There are also numerous small bursae associated with the posterior aspect of the knee joint and the muscles and tendons in this region. It is possible that this mass is arising from the posterior structures of the knee joint, which include synovial outpouchings, the menisci, and the muscles and tendons of this region."

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

Patients will usually complain of pain over the medial elbow with throwing that may last for a few days afterward. There may be associated swelling and lateral or posterior elbow pain. Radiation of pain may be secondary to ulnar neuropathy. There is often a flexion contracture of the elbow when compared to the opposite side. Palpation of the medial epicondyle, radial head, capitellum, lateral epicondyle, and olecranon process often reveals tenderness. Ulnar (medial) collateral ligament stability should be assessed. Radiographs should include the contralateral elbow for comparison. Radiographic findings in Little Leaguer\u2019s elbow can vary and may include normal anatomy, medial humeral epicondyle apophyseal avulsion fracture, osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum, radial head abnormalities, and"

The least severe, types I and II, are typically treated conservatively. Treatment of type III injuries, where the clavicle is displaced up to 100%, is controversial. Some advo-cate for early surgical intervention, while others recommend symptomatic treatment followed by ligament reconstruction if symptoms persist. Types IV to VI, where the coracoclavicular ligaments are completely torn and the clavicle is significantly displaced, are often treated surgically.KNEEThe knee is the largest joint in the human body and is a pivotal hinge joint, which allows flexion and extension as well as some medial and lateral rotation. The knee bears tremendous axial loads as well as torsional and sheer forces, making it vulnerable to both acute injury and the development of osteoarthritis. In sports, the major stabilizing structures such as the ACL"
