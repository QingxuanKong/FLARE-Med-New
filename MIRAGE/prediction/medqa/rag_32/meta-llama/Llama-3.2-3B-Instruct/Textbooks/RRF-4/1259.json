    "question": "A 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department 1 hour after falling from his bicycle. The boy was racing with his cousin when he lost control and fell onto his right side. He has nausea and severe pain in the right shoulder. He is in acute distress. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. Examination shows swelling and tenderness over the right clavicle and pain exacerbated by movement; range of motion is limited. The skin over the clavicle is intact. The radial pulse in the right arm is intact. Sensory examination of the right upper limb shows no abnormalities. An x\u2011ray of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's shoulder?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 15-year-old boy who has fallen from his bicycle and is experiencing severe pain in the right shoulder. The symptoms include swelling and tenderness over the right clavicle, limited range of motion, and pain exacerbated by movement. The skin over the clavicle is intact, and the radial pulse in the right arm is intact. The patient is in acute distress, but the temperature, pulse, respirations, and blood pressure are within normal limits. The clinical presentation suggests a clavicular fracture, which is a common injury in adolescents. The fact that the skin over the clavicle is intact suggests that the fracture is not a displaced or open fracture. The next step in management for a clavicular fracture in a child is to immobilize the affected arm to prevent further injury and promote healing. A simple shoulder sling can be used to immobilize the arm and provide support. Performing tension banding (option A) is typically used for displaced or open fractures, which is not the case in this scenario. Obtaining an MRI of the right shoulder (option C) may be useful to rule out other injuries, but it is not the immediate next step in management. Performing arteriography (option D) is not necessary for a clavicular fracture and is more typically used to evaluate vascular injuries. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to apply a simple shoulder sling (option B) to immobilize the arm and provide support.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The pain began after a fall on his outstretched hand approximately 6 months previously. The patient recalled having some minor shoulder tenderness but no other specific symptoms. He was otherwise fit and well. On examination of the shoulder, there was marked wasting of the muscles in the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae. The patient found initiation of abduction difficult and there was a weakness of lateral rotation of the humerus. The wasted muscles were the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The cause of the muscle wasting was disuse. Muscle atrophy (wasting) occurs through a variety of disorders. Disuse atrophy is one of the most common causes. Examples of disuse atrophy include the loss of muscle bulk after fracture immobilization in a plaster cast. The opposite effect can also be demonstrated\u2014when muscles are overused they become bulkier (hypertrophy)."

Because the radial head is not as bulbous in infants and young children, the annular ligament that passes around it can partially slip off the radial head with traction across the elbow (Fig. 203-1). The subluxation is usually caused by a quick pull on the extended elbow when a child is forcefully lifted by the hand or when the child falls while holding hands with an adult. After a subluxation, the child usually holds the hand in a pronated position and will refuse to use the hand or move the elbow.

The younger the patient is at presentation, the more likely it is that the patient will have recurrent dislocation. Anterior dislocation is the most common. If assessment of the neurovascular status of the affected extremity reveals any compromise, urgent reduction is needed to prevent further complications. Patients will need radiographs to assess for fractures of the glenoid (Bankhart lesion) and humeral head (Hill-Sachs lesion). Most patients will require a brief period of protection in a sling or shoulder immobilizer, as well as pain control. As symptoms resolve, a gentle range-of-motion program, followed by an aggressive strengthening program, should be done.

It is important to test the nerves that supply the arm and hand, although this is extremely difficult to do in an unconscious patient. However, some muscle reflexes can be determined using a tendon hammer. Also, it may be possible to test for pain reflexes in patients with altered consciousness levels. Palpation of the axillary artery, brachial artery, radial artery, and ulnar artery pulses is necessary because a fracture of the first rib can sever and denude the subclavian artery, which passes over it. A chest drain was immediately inserted because the lung had collapsed. The fractured first rib had damaged the visceral and parietal pleurae, allowing air from a torn lung to escape into the pleural cavity. The lung collapsed, and the pleural cavity filled with air, which impaired lung function. A tube was inserted between the ribs, and the air was sucked out to re-inflate the lung."

He had no history of IV drug use or previous catheter placement. Jaundice and a painful swollen area over his left sternoclavicular joint were evident on physical examination. Cultures of blood drawn at admission grew group B Streptococcus. The patient recovered after treatment with IV penicillin. (Courtesy of Francisco M.

Plasma Na+ concentration was initially 129 meq/L, decreasing within 3 days to 118\u2013120 meq/L despite fluid restriction to 1 L/d. A chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a right 2.8 \u00d7 1.6 cm infrahilar mass and postobstructive pneumonia. The patient was an active smoker. Past medical history was notable for laryngeal carcinoma treated 15 years prior with radiation therapy, renal cell carcinoma, peripheral vascular disease, and hypothyroidism. On review of systems, he denied headache, nausea, and vomiting. He had chronic hip pain, managed with acetaminophen with codeine. Other medications included cilostazol, amoxicillin/clavulanate, digoxin, diltiazem, and thyroxine. He was euvolemic on examination, with no lymphadenopathy and a normal chest examination.

He noted that there was reduced sensation in both legs, and there was virtually no power in extensor or flexor groups. The patient was tachycardic, which was believed to be due to pain, and the blood pressure obtained in the ambulance measured 120/80 mm Hg. It was noted that the patient\u2019s current blood pressure was 80/40 mm Hg; however, the patient did not complain of typical clinical symptoms of hypotension. On first inspection, it is difficult to \u201cadd up\u201d these clinical symptoms and signs. In essence we have a progressive paraplegia associated with severe back pain and an anomaly in blood pressure measurements, which are not compatible with the clinical state of the patient. It was deduced that the blood pressure measurements were obtained in different arms, and both were reassessed."

It is characterized by pain in the extremities, a red-purple skin rash (generalized angiokeratomas), and kidney and cardiac complications. Protein in his urine indicates kidney damage.

On further questioning, he reported that the pain also radiated over the lateral part of the foot, particularly around the lateral malleolus. The areas of pain correspond to dermatomes L4 to S3 nerves. Over the following weeks, the patient began to develop muscular weakness, predominantly footdrop. These findings are consistent with loss of the motor function and sensory change in the common fibular nerve, which is a branch of the sciatic nerve in the lower limb. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a mass in the posterior aspect of the right side of the pelvis. The mass was anterior to the piriformis muscle and adjacent to the rectum."

Fever, anorexia, irritability, and lethargy may accompany the focal findings. Weight bearing and active and passive motion of the affected extremity are decreased, mimicking paralysis (pseudoparalysis). Muscle spasm may make the extremity difficult to examine. The adjacent joint space may be involved in young children, suggested by pain with minimal joint range of motion (see Chapter 118)."
