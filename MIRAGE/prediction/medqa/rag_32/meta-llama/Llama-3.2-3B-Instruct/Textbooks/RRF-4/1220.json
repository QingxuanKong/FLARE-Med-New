These symptoms are indicative of a bleeding disorder. The patient's symptoms are most likely due to defective synthesis of a substance that is composed primarily of a specific amino acid. The patient's symptoms are consistent with hemophilia A, a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of clotting factor VIII, which is composed primarily of the amino acid lysine. Clotting factor VIII is a glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in the blood clotting process. A deficiency in this protein leads to impaired blood clotting, resulting in easy bruising, bleeding, and petechiae.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Symptoms of anemia are also frequent, including lassitude, weakness, shortness of breath, and a pounding sensation in the ears. Infection is an unusual first symptom in aplastic anemia (unlike in agranulocytosis, where pharyngitis, anorectal infection, or frank sepsis occurs early). A striking feature of aplastic anemia is the restriction of symptoms to the hematologic system, and patients often feel and look remarkably well despite drastically reduced blood counts.

Patients with chronic pain. The association of chronic pain and depression has long been appreciated. This is far from a homogeneous group. The special case of chronic headache, confronted often by neurologists, is discussed below and in Chap. 9. In some patients with chronic pain, the symptoms and signs of depression are quite apparent. If the pain has been present for less than 1 year and had its onset at the same time as other depressive symptoms, response to antidepressant treatment is likely to be favorable. Far more difficult to understand, and to manage, are patients with persistent pain as the only complaint; the head, face, and lower back are the most common loci. Weeks or months of unremitting daily tension-type headaches in the context of a normal examination are highly suggestive of depression at any age. If"

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"
