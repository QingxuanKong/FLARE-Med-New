Since then, she has been feeling sick, and she is concerned that she has been getting worse over time. On presentation, her temperature is 100.7\u00b0F (38.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 115/78 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 14/min. Physical exam reveals abdominal discomfort with uterine tenderness, and laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count with many plasma cells. The most likely cause of this patient's disorder has which of the following characteristics?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, and a history of recent childbirth, which suggests a postpartum complication. The elevated white blood cell count with many plasma cells and the presence of uterine tenderness are indicative of an infection. Considering the timing and symptoms, the most likely cause is a postpartum endometritis, which is typically caused by a bacterial infection, most commonly Group B streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae), followed by other organisms such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus. The elevated white blood cell count with many plasma cells is consistent with a bacterial infection. The options provided do not include Staphylococcus aureus, but we can analyze the remaining options to determine the most likely cause.\\n\\nGroup B streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae) is a Gram-positive coccus in chains, which matches option A. It is a common cause of postpartum endometritis and is known to cause alpha-hemolytic infections, which are characterized by partial hemolysis of red blood cells.\\n\\nThe other options can be eliminated as follows:\\n\\nB. Beta-hemolytic cocci in chains refers to Streptococcus pyogenes, which is more commonly associated with pharyngitis and skin infections.\\n\\nC. Coagulase-positive cocci in clusters refers to Staphylococcus aureus, which is more commonly associated with skin and soft tissue infections.\\n\\nD. Gamma-hemolytic cocci in chains is not a specific term used to describe a common bacterial pathogen.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely cause of this patient's disorder is Group B streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae), which is characterized by alpha-hemolytic infections.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Frequently, the findings before rupture and hemorrhage are nonspecific, and vital signs are normal. The abdomen may be nontender or mildly tender, with or without rebound. The uterus may be slightly enlarged, with findings similar to a normal pregnancy (103,104). Cervical motion tenderness may or may not be present. An adnexal mass may be palpable in up to 50% of cases, but the mass varies markedly in size, consistency, and tenderness. A palpable mass may be the corpus luteum and not the ectopic pregnancy. With rupture and intra-abdominal hemorrhage, the patient develops tachycardia followed by hypotension. Bowel sounds are decreased or absent. The abdomen is distended, with marked tenderness and rebound tenderness. Cervical motion tenderness is present.

            "content": "On physical examination, the presence of findings such as hypertension, jugular venous distention, laterally displaced point of maximum impulse, irregular pulse, third heart sound, pulmonary rales, heart murmurs, peripheral edema, or vascular bruits should prompt a more complete evaluation. Laboratory evaluation of patients with known or suspected heart disease should include a blood count and serum chemistry analysis. Patients with heart disease tolerate anemia poorly. Serum sodium and potassium levels are particularly important in patients taking diuretics and digitalis. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine values provide information on renal function and hydration status. Assessment of blood glucose levels may detect undiagnosed DM. Chest radiography and electrocardiography are mandatory as part of the preoperative evaluation, and the results may be particularly helpful when compared with those of previous studies."

            "content": "A 45-year-old man with no significant medical history was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 10 days ago after suffering third-degree burns over 40% of his body. He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

            "content": "Fever is the most important criterion or the diagnosis of postpartum metritis. Intuitively, the degree of fever is believed proportional to the extent of infection and sepsis syndrome. Temperatures commonly are 38 to 39\u00b0C. Chills that accompany fever suggest bacteremia or endotoxemia. Women usually complain of abdominal pain, and parametrial tenderness is elicited on abdominal and bimanual examination. Leukocytosis may range from 15,000 to 30,000 cells/\ufffdL, but recall that delivery itself increases the leukocyte count (Hartmann, 2000). Although an ofensive odor may develop, many women have foul-smelling lochia without evidence for infection, and vice versa. Some other infections, notably those caused by group A j-hemolytic streptococci, may be associated with scant, odorless lochia (Anderson, 2014)."

            "content": "With later diagnosis, the classic triad is delayed menstruation, pain, and vaginal bleeding or spotting. With tubal rupture, lower abdominal and pelvic pain is usually severe and frequently described as sharp, stabbing, or tearing. Abdominal palpation elicits tenderness. Bimanual pelvic examination, especially cervical motion, causes exquisite pain. The posterior vaginal fornix may bulge from blood in the rectouterine cul-de-sac, or a tender, boggy mass may be felt beside the uterus. The uterus can also be slightly enlarged due to hormonal stimulation. Symptoms of diaphragmatic irritation, characterized by neck or shoulder pain, especially on inspiration, develop in perhaps half of women with sizable hemoperitoneum."

The patient had Crohn\u2019s disease and was maintained on 6-mercaptopurine and prednisone. She presented with abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, and small-bowel obstruction. The image reveals a 7to 10-cm long stricture at the terminal ileum (white arrows) causing obstruction and significant dilatation of the proximal small bowel (white asterisk). A fetus is seen in the uterus (dashed white arrows). (Courtesy of Drs. J. F. B. Chick and"

            "content": "The pain of primary dysmenorrhea usually begins a few hours before or just after the onset of a menstrual period and may last 48 to 72 hours. The pain is similar to labor, with suprapubic cramping, and may be accompanied by lumbosacral backache, pain radiating down the anterior thigh, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and rarely syncopal episodes. The pain of dysmenorrhea is colicky in nature and, unlike abdominal pain that is caused by chemical or infectious peritonitis, is relieved by abdominal massage, counter-pressure, or movement of the body. On examination, the vital signs are normal. The suprapubic region may be tender to palpation. Bowel sounds are normal, and there is no upper abdominal tenderness and no abdominal rebound tenderness. Bimanual examination at the time of the dysmenorrheic episode often reveals uterine tenderness; severe pain does not occur with movement of the cervix or palpation of the adnexal structures. The pelvic organs are normal in primary dysmenorrhea."

Hematocrit assessment, along with cross-matching of packed red blood cells, should be performed immediately. Examination may reveal tenderness and dullness in the \ufb02ank. In cases of intraperitoneal bleeding, abdominal distention may occur. Diagnostic radiologic studies can be used to confirm the presence of retroperitoneal or intra-abdominal bleeding. Ultrasonography is one option for viewing low pelvic hematomas; CT provides better visualization of retroperitoneal spaces and can delineate a hematoma."

Cervical motion tenderness is produced by stretching of the adnexal attachments on the side toward which the cervix is pushed. Bimanual examination reveals uterine fundal tenderness due to endometritis and abnormal adnexal tenderness due to salpingitis that is usually, but not necessarily, bilateral. Adnexal swelling is palpable in about one-half of women with acute salpingitis, but evaluation of the adnexae in a patient with marked tenderness is not reliable. The initial temperature is >38\u00b0C in only about one-third of patients with acute salpingitis. Laboratory findings include elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in 75% of patients with acute salpingitis and elevation of the peripheral white blood cell count in up to 60%."
