    "question": "A 34-year-old woman comes to the physician requesting prenatal care. For the past 2 months, she has had increasing breast tenderness, nausea, 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight gain, and urinary frequency. She is not sure about the date of her last menstrual period. She has been trying to conceive with her husband since she stopped taking oral contraceptives 6 months ago; she was happy to tell him last week that she is pregnant. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows mild, nontender abdominal enlargement. The cervical os is closed. Urine \u03b2-hCG is negative. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and history: 1. Increasing breast tenderness, nausea, and weight gain over 2 months. 2. Self-reported pregnancy, but urine \\u03b2-hCG is negative. 3. Mild, nontender abdominal enlargement. 4. Closed cervical os. 5. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Given these points, let's evaluate the options: A. Delusion of pregnancy: This is a psychological condition where a person believes they are pregnant, but there is no actual pregnancy. However, the patient's physical examination and ultrasound results do not support this diagnosis. B. Pseudocyesis: This is a rare condition where a person believes they are pregnant, but there is no actual pregnancy. Again, the patient's physical examination and ultrasound results do not support this diagnosis. C. Pregnancy: The patient reports being pregnant, but the urine \\u03b2-hCG is negative. However, early pregnancy \\u03b2-hCG levels can be low or undetectable in some cases, especially if the pregnancy is ectopic or if the patient is under stress. D. Incomplete abortion: This is a condition where a woman experiences a miscarriage, but some tissue remains in the uterus. However, the patient's physical examination and ultrasound results do not suggest an incomplete abortion. Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is C. Pregnancy, as the patient reports being pregnant and the ultrasound shows no abnormalities. However, the negative urine \\u03b2-hCG result warrants further investigation to rule out ectopic pregnancy or other causes of false-negative \\u03b2-hCG results. Further testing, such as a repeat \\u03b2-hCG level or a transvaginal ultrasound with Doppler, may be necessary to confirm or rule out pregnancy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Frequently, the findings before rupture and hemorrhage are nonspecific, and vital signs are normal. The abdomen may be nontender or mildly tender, with or without rebound. The uterus may be slightly enlarged, with findings similar to a normal pregnancy (103,104). Cervical motion tenderness may or may not be present. An adnexal mass may be palpable in up to 50% of cases, but the mass varies markedly in size, consistency, and tenderness. A palpable mass may be the corpus luteum and not the ectopic pregnancy. With rupture and intra-abdominal hemorrhage, the patient develops tachycardia followed by hypotension. Bowel sounds are decreased or absent. The abdomen is distended, with marked tenderness and rebound tenderness. Cervical motion tenderness is present. Frequently, the findings of the pelvic examination are inadequate because of pain and guarding."

She is comatose, tachypneic (25 breaths per minute), and tachycardic (150 bpm), but she appears flushed, and fingertip pulse oximetry is normal (97%) breathing room air. Questioning of her parents reveals that they are homeless and have been living in their car (a small van). The nights have been cold, and they have used a small char-coal burner to keep warm inside the vehicle. What is the most likely diagnosis? What treatment should be instituted immediately? If her mother is pregnant, what additional measures should be taken?"

Daily follow-up by telephone or visit is important and the patient should be reassessed if she notes worsening of the symptoms or if her weight gain increases to more than 2 lb per day. Indications for hospitalization include an inability to tolerate oral hydration, hemodynamic instability, respiratory compromise, tense ascites, hemoconcentration, leukocytosis, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, abnormal renal or liver function, and decreased oxygen saturation. Fluid intake and urine output need to be carefully measured, and admission to an intensive care setting can be considered if the patient has hyperkalemia, renal failure, respiratory failure, or thromboembolic disease.

Maternal blood pressure and weight and their extent of change are examined. Symptoms such as headache, altered vision, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, bleeding, vaginal luid leakage, and dysuria are sought. Mter 20 weeks' gestation, uterine examination measures size from the symphysis to the fundus. In late pregnancy, vaginal examination often provides valuable information that includes conirmation of the presenting part and its station, clinical estimation of pelvic capacity and configuration, amnionic luid volume adequacy, and cervical consistency, efacement, and dilatation (Chap. 22, p. 435)."

Qualitative uri-nary pregnancy tests for human chorionic gonadotropin (b-hCG) are standard prior to any surgery in a woman of reproductive age and potential, regardless of contraception history. In addition, serum quantitative b-hCG testing is appropriate for evaluation of suspected ectopic pregnancy, gestational trophoblastic dis-ease, or ovarian mass in a young woman. In the case of ectopic pregnancy, serial levels are required when a pregnancy cannot be identified in the uterine cavity by imaging. As a general rule, 85% of viable, very early intrauterine pregnancies will have at least a 66% rise in the b-hCG level over 48 hours.Table 41-2Features of common causes of vaginitis BACTERIAL VAGINOSISVULVOVAGINAL"

Laboratory evaluation of patients with known or suspected heart disease should include a blood count and serum chemistry analysis. Patients with heart disease tolerate anemia poorly. Serum sodium and potassium levels are particularly important in patients taking diuretics and digitalis. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine values provide information on renal function and hydration status. Assessment of blood glucose levels may detect undiagnosed DM. Chest radiography and electrocardiography are mandatory as part of the preoperative evaluation, and the results may be particularly helpful when compared with those of previous studies."
