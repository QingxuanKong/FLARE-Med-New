    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Based on the patient's history of chronic glomerulonephritis due to IgA nephropathy, we can deduce the following: 1. Chronic glomerulonephritis can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism due to chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). 2. CKD-MBD is characterized by disturbances in calcium-phosphate metabolism, vitamin D metabolism, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulation. 3. In CKD-MBD, the parathyroid glands become overactive in response to the decreased phosphate levels and increased phosphate reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to increased PTH production. 4. Elevated PTH increases calcium levels in the blood by increasing calcium release from bones, increasing calcium absorption from the gut, and increasing calcium reabsorption in the kidneys. 5. The increased calcium levels can lead to hypercalcemia, which can further exacerbate the CKD-MBD cycle. Therefore, we would expect the following laboratory findings: * Increased PTH (hyperparathyroidism) * Increased calcium (hypercalcemia) * Increased phosphate (hyperphosphatemia) * Decreased calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) due to impaired renal conversion of vitamin D to its active form. The correct answer is A. Increased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, decreased calcitriol.",

In the presence of glomerulonephritis, autoimmune diseases such as lupus and underlying infectious etiologies such as hepatitis B and C and HIV should be tested.

            "content": "Once GFR reduction has been established, the physician must decide if it represents acute or chronic renal injury. The clinical situation, history, and laboratory data often make this an easy distinction. However, the laboratory abnormalities characteristic of chronic renal failure, including anemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia, often are present as well in patients presenting with acute renal failure. Radiographic evidence of renal osteodystrophy (Chap. 335) can be seen only in chronic renal failure but is a very late finding, and these patients are usually undergoing dialysis. The urinalysis and renal ultrasound can facilitate distinguishing acute from chronic renal failure. An approach to the evaluation of azotemic patients is shown in Fig. 61-1. Patients with advanced chronic renal insufficiency often have some proteinuria, nonconcentrated urine (isosthenuria; isosmotic with plasma), and small kidneys on ultrasound, characterized by increased echogenicity and cortical"

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).
