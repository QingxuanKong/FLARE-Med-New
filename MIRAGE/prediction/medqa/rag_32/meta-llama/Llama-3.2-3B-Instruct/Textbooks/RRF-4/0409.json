    "question": "A 44-year-old woman with hypothyroidism comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of tingling in her feet and poor balance. Her only medication is levothyroxine. Physical examination shows conjunctival pallor and an ataxic gait. Proprioception and sense of vibration are decreased in her toes bilaterally. Laboratory studies show macrocytic anemia and normal thyroid hormone levels. Histological evaluation of tissue samples obtained by esophagogastroduodenoscopy reveals atrophic changes of the gastric body and fundus with normal antral mucosa.

The patient has hypothyroidism, and the only medication she takes is levothyroxine. She presents with tingling in her feet, poor balance, conjunctival pallor, and ataxic gait. Laboratory studies show macrocytic anemia and normal thyroid hormone levels. Histological evaluation of tissue samples from esophagogastroduodenoscopy reveals atrophic changes of the gastric body and fundus with normal antral mucosa. This suggests that the patient may have an autoimmune disorder affecting the stomach. The presence of macrocytic anemia and atrophic changes in the gastric body and fundus are indicative of pernicious anemia, which is an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the parietal cells in the stomach, leading to a deficiency in intrinsic factor, which is necessary for vitamin B12 absorption. The presence of antibodies against parietal cells is a hallmark of pernicious anemia. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Parietal cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Because antibodies to Tg alone are uncommon, it is reasonable to measure only TPO antibodies. About 5\u201315% of euthyroid women and up to 2% of euthyroid men have thyroid antibodies; such individuals are at increased risk of developing thyroid dysfunction.

A woman who was abused as a child frequently feels outside of or detached from her body. A man has repeated, intense urges to rub his body against unsuspecting passengers on a bus. A schizophrenic patient takes haloperidol for one year and develops uncontrollable tongue movements. Diagnosis? Treatment?"

The onset is usually insidious, and the patient may become aware of symptoms only when euthyroidism is restored. Patients with Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis may present because of goiter rather than symptoms of hypothyroidism. The goiter may not be large, but it is usually irregular and firm in consistency. It is often possible to palpate a pyramidal lobe, normally a vestigial remnant of the thyroglossal duct. Rarely is uncomplicated Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis associated with pain."

On examination the thyroid gland moved during swallowing. Characteristically, an enlarged thyroid gland is evident as a neck mass arising on one or both sides of the trachea. The enlarged thyroid gland moves on swallowing because it is attached to the larynx by the pretracheal fascia. The patient was hypothyroid. Hypothyroidism refers to the clinical and biochemical state in which the thyroid gland is underactive (hyperthyroidism refers to an overactive thyroid gland). Some patients have thyroid masses and no clinical or biochemical abnormalities\u2014these patients are euthyroid."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

Physical examination shows hyperpigmentation, hepatomegaly, and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory tests are remarkable for elevated serum transaminases (liver function tests) and fasting blood glucose. Results of other tests are pending. Correct answer = B. The patient has hereditary hemochromatosis, a disease of iron overload that results from inappropriately low levels of hepcidin caused primarily by mutations to the HFE (high iron) gene. Hepcidin regulates ferroportin, the only known iron export protein in humans, by increasing its degradation. The increase in iron with hepcidin deficiency causes hyperpigmentation and hyperglycemia (\u201cbronze diabetes\u201d). Phlebotomy or use of iron chelators is the treatment. [Note: Pending lab tests would show an increase in serum iron and transferrin saturation.] UNIT VII Storage and Expression of Genetic Information"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"
