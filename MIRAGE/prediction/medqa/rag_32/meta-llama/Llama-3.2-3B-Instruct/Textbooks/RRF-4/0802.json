In the first, the essential characteristic is that, almost from birth, the infant is delayed in all aspects of development. There is a tendency to sleep more, to be less demanding of nourishment, to move less than normal, and to suck poorly and regurgitate. Parents comment on how good their baby is, how little he troubles them by crying. As the months pass, every expected achievement is late. The baby is usually more hypotonic and turns over, sits unsupported, and walks later than the normal infant. Yet despite these obvious motor delays, there is later no sign of paralysis, ataxia, chorea, or athetosis. These babies do not smile at the usual time and take little notice of the mother or other persons or objects in their environment.

Second, subtle CNS abnormalities are best detected by carefully comparing a patient\u2019s performance on tasks that require simultaneous activation of both cerebral hemispheres (e.g., eliciting a pronator drift of an outstretched arm with the eyes closed; extinction on one side of bilaterally applied light touch, also with eyes closed; or decreased arm swing or a slight asymmetry when walking). Third, if the patient\u2019s complaint is brought on by some activity, reproduce the activity in the office. If the complaint is of dizziness when the head is turned in one direction, have the patient do this and also look for associated signs on examination (e.g., nystagmus or dysmetria).

            "content": "Evaluating a child over time, coupled with a careful history and physical examination, helps determine whether the growth pattern is normal or abnormal. Parental heights may be useful when deciding whether to proceed with a further evaluation. Children, in general, follow their parents\u2019 growth pattern, although there are many exceptions. For a girl, midparental height is calculated as follows: \u22122.5 2 For a boy, midparental height is calculated as follows: +2.5 2 Actual growth depends on too many variables to makean accurate prediction from midparental height determination for every child. The growth pattern of a child with lowweight, length, and head circumference is commonly associated with familial short stature (see Chapter 173). Thesechildren are genetically normal but are smaller than most Discrepant percentiles (e.g., weight 5th, length 5th, head circumference 50th, or other discrepancies)"

Parents may report that the child has diarrhea because of soiling of liquid stool. Soiling may be frequent or continuous. On further questioning, the clinician learns that the child is passing large-caliber bowel movements that may occasionally block the toilet. Children younger than 3 years of age often present with painful defecation, impaction, and withholding. The history should include a complete review of systems for gastrointestinal, endocrine, and neurologic disorders and a developmental and psychosocial history."

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

These problems usually come to light in the school-age child (hence the term school dysfunction), whose aptitude for classroom learning is poorer than the child\u2019s general intelligence. The medical referral may be from a parent, teacher, or psychologist. The clinician\u2019s objective is to determine by history and examination whether there is (1) a general congenital developmental abnormality impairing intelligence; (2) a specific deficit in reading, writing, arithmetic, or attention, any one of which may interfere with the child\u2019s ability to learn; (3) a primary sensory defect, particularly in audition; or (4) neither of these\u2014for example, a behavior disorder or home situation that interferes with schooling."

Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of \u201closs of vision.\u201d Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver\u2019s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"
