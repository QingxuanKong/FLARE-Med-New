A week ago, she returned from India, where she was working with an NGO to build houses in rural areas. The patient took one dose of chloroquine one week before her trip. She also took a further dose during her trip. She has no history of a serious illness. Her temperature is 39.3\u00b0C (102.7\u00b0F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 112/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows jaundice. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 10 g/dL and a blood smear shows fragmented erythrocytes and occasional ring-shaped inclusion bodies within erythrocytes. Which of the following is the most likely cause of infection in this patient?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely cause of infection in this patient, we need to consider the symptoms and travel history presented. The patient has high-grade fever, headache, muscle pain, jaundice, and a blood smear showing fragmented erythrocytes and ring-shaped inclusion bodies within erythrocytes. The patient also has a travel history to India, where she was working with an NGO to build houses in rural areas. She took one dose of chloroquine one week before her trip and a further dose during her trip. Chloroquine is effective against Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale, but not against Plasmodium falciparum. The presence of ring-shaped inclusion bodies within erythrocytes is characteristic of Plasmodium vivax. Therefore, the most likely cause of infection in this patient is Plasmodium vivax, which is a type of malaria. The patient's symptoms and travel history support this diagnosis. Chikungunya virus is a mosquito-borne disease that causes fever, headache, and muscle pain, but it does not cause jaundice or ring-shaped inclusion bodies within erythrocytes. Hepatitis A virus is a liver disease that causes jaundice, but it does not cause the other symptoms presented. Plasmodium falciparum is a type of malaria that is resistant to chloroquine and can cause severe symptoms, but the presence of ring-shaped inclusion bodies within erythrocytes is characteristic of Plasmodium vivax.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Assessment of the patient\u2019s general appearance and vital signs, skin and soft tissue examination, and the neurologic evaluation are of particular importance. The patient may appear either anxious and agitated or lethargic and apathetic. Fever is usually present, although elderly patients and compromised hosts (e.g., patients who are uremic or cirrhotic and those who are taking glucocorticoids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be afebrile despite serious underlying infection. Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate helps determine the degree of hemodynamic and metabolic compromise. The patient\u2019s airway must be evaluated to rule out the risk of obstruction from an invasive oropharyngeal infection."

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg.

The fever is usually irregular at first (that of falciparum malaria may never become regular); the temperature of nonimmune individuals and children often rises above 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F) in conjunction with tachycardia and sometimes delirium. Although childhood febrile convulsions may occur with any of the malarias, generalized seizures are specifically associated with falciparum malaria and may herald the development of encephalopathy (cerebral malaria). Many clinical abnormalities have been described in acute malaria, but most patients with uncomplicated infections have few abnormal physical findings other than fever, malaise, mild anemia, and (in some cases) a palpable spleen. Anemia is common among young children living in areas with stable transmission, particularly where resistance has compromised the efficacy of antimalarial drugs.

The febrile stage lasts 3 or 4 days and is identified by the abrupt onset of fever, headache, severe myalgia, thirst, anorexia, and often nausea and vomiting. Photophobia, retroorbital pain, and pain on ocular movement are common, and the vision may become blurred with ciliary body inflammation. Flushing over the face, the V area of the neck, and the back is characteristic, as are pharyngeal injection, periorbital edema, and conjunctival suffusion. Petechiae often develop in areas of pressure, the conjunctivae, and the axillae. Back pain and tenderness to percussion at the costovertebral angle reflect massive retroperitoneal edema. Laboratory evidence of mild to moderate DIC is present. Other laboratory findings of HFRS include proteinuria and active urinary sediment. The hypotensive stage lasts from a few hours to 48 h and begins with falling blood pressure and sometimes shock. The relative bradycardia typical of the febrile"
