    "question": "A 28-year-old gravida 1 at 32 weeks gestation is evaluated for an abnormal ultrasound that showed fetal microcephaly. Early in the 1st trimester, she had fevers and headaches for 1 week. She also experienced myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic maculopapular rash. The symptoms resolved without any medications. A week prior to her symptoms, she had traveled to Brazil where she spent most of the evenings hiking. She did not use any mosquito repellents. There is no personal or family history of chronic or congenital diseases. Medications include iron supplementation and a multivitamin. She received all of the recommended childhood vaccinations. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. The IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis were negative. Which of the following is the most likely etiologic agent?",

She also experienced fetal microcephaly at 32 weeks gestation. The patient's symptoms and fetal ultrasound findings suggest a congenital infection. The patient's travel history to Brazil, where she spent most of her evenings hiking without using mosquito repellents, increases the risk of mosquito-borne illnesses. The patient's symptoms and travel history suggest a viral etiology. The patient's IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis were negative, making toxoplasmosis less likely. Dengue virus and Zika virus are both transmitted by mosquitoes, but Zika virus is more commonly associated with neurological symptoms and microcephaly. Rubella virus can cause congenital abnormalities, but the patient's symptoms and travel history do not strongly suggest rubella. Therefore, the most likely etiologic agent is Zika virus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right).

            "content": "The severity of fetal disease varies inversely with the gestational age at which maternal infection occurs. Most infants have subclinical infection with no overt disease at birth; however, specific ophthalmologic and central nervous system (CNS) evaluations may reveal abnormalities. The classic findings of hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, and intracerebral calcifications suggest the diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis. Affected infants tend to be small for gestational age, develop early-onset jaundice, have hepatosplenomegaly, and present with a generalized maculopapular rash. Seizures are common, and skull films may reveal diffuse cortical calcifications in contrast to the periventricular pattern observed with CMV. These infants are at increased risk for long-term neurologic and neurodevelopmental complications."

During the year before presentation, her scholastic performance in school deteriorated, she gained 25 lb, she became increasingly lethargic, and nocturia and polydypsia were noted. Initial evaluation documented low follicle-stimulating hormone, elevated prolactin, and a bone age of 10.5 years. Computed tomography scanning documented a large hypothalamic neoplasm that proved to be an ectopic germinoma. The patient was also documented to be hypothyroid and hypoadrenal and to have diabetes insipidus. Despite the elevated prolactin, she had no galactorrhea because of the minimal breast development.

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy.

            "content": "Routine laboratory findings are nonspecific and generally do not aid in diagnosis. The white blood cell count usually is normal or low, and thrombocytopenia rarely occurs. Diagnosis is confirmed by serologic testing for IgM antibodies (typically positive 5 days after symptom onset) or by a fourfold or greater increase in specific IgG antibodies in paired acute and convalescent sera. CRS cases can have detectable IgM until 3 months of age, and stable or rising IgG titers over the first 7 to 11 months of age. False-positive IgM results can occur. Cases of suspected congenital rubella syndrome and postnatal rubella infection should be reported to the local and state health department. The rash must be differentiated from measles, roseola, enteroviral or adenoviral infection, infectious mononucleosis, toxoplasmosis, scarlet fever, rickettsial disease, Kawasaki disease, serum sickness, and drug rash."

She is comatose, tachypneic (25 breaths per minute), and tachycardic (150 bpm), but she appears flushed, and fingertip pulse oximetry is normal (97%) breathing room air. Questioning of her parents reveals that they are homeless and have been living in their car (a small van). The nights have been cold, and they have used a small char-coal burner to keep warm inside the vehicle. What is the most likely diagnosis? What treatment should be instituted immediately? If her mother is pregnant, what additional measures should be taken?"

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis.

Advise the pregnant woman to eat food types she wants in reasonable amounts and salted to taste. 2. Ensure that food is amply available for socioeconomically deprived women. 3. Monitor weight gain, with a goal of approximately 25 to 35elb in women with a normal BMI. 4. Explore food intake by dietary recall periodically to discover the occasional nutritionally errant diet. 5. Give tablets of simple iron salts that provide at least 27 mg of elemental iron daily. Give folate supplementation before and in the early weeks of pregnancy. Provide iodine supplementation in areas of known dietary insuiciency. 6. Recheck the hematocrit or hemoglobin concentration at 28 to 32 weeks' gestation to detect signiicant anemia. TABLE 9-6. Some Contraindications to Exercise During Pregnancy"

Parvovirus B19 infections usually begin with a mild,nonspecific illness characterized by fever, malaise, myalgias, andheadache. In some cases, the characteristic rash appears 7 to 10days later. Erythema infectiosum is manifested by rash, low-grade or no fever, and occasionally pharyngitis and mild conjunctivitis. The rash appears in three stages. The initial stage istypically a \u201cslapped cheek\u201d rash with circumoral pallor. An erythematous symmetric, maculopapular, truncal rash appears 1 to4 days later, then fades as central clearing takes place, giving adistinctive lacy, reticulated rash that lasts 2 to 40 days (mean, 11days). This rash may be pruritic, does not desquamate, and mayrecur with exercise, bathing, rubbing, or stress. Adolescents andadults may experience myalgia, significant arthralgias or arthritis, headache, pharyngitis, coryza, and gastrointestinal upset."
