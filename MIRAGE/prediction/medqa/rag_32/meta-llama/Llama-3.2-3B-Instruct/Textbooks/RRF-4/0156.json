    "question": "A 22-year-old male presents to the emergency room complaining of neck stiffness. He reports that his neck started \u201clocking\u201d three hours ago. He is now unable to move it. His past medical history is notable for schizophrenia and asthma and he currently takes albuterol as well as another medication whose name he does not remember. His temperature is 99.0\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. He speaks in full sentences and is oriented to person, place, and time. The patient\u2019s neck is flexed and rotated to the right approximately 40 degrees. The right sternocleidomastoid and trapezius are firm and contracted. Extraocular movements are full and intact. Upon further questioning, he reports that he took more medication four hours ago because he was hearing voices. Which of the following should most likely be administered to this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Glycopyrrolate",
        "B": "Benztropine",
        "C": "Levodopa",
        "D": "Dantrolene"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario and the relevant medical knowledge. 1. **Clinical Presentation**: The patient presents with neck stiffness that has \"locked\" in place for three hours, with the neck flexed and rotated to the right approximately 40 degrees. The sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles are firm and contracted. 2. **Past Medical History**: The patient has schizophrenia and takes albuterol for asthma. Additionally, he mentions taking another medication he doesn't remember. 3. **Physical Examination Findings**: The patient appears anxious and diaphoretic, with full extraocular movements. The key finding is the contracted sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. 4. **Recent Medication Use**: The patient reports taking more medication four hours ago because he was experiencing hearing voices. Given these points, the most likely diagnosis is **Torticollis**, which is characterized by a twisted neck, often caused by muscle spasms or spasticity. This condition can be a side effect of antipsychotic medication, particularly typical antipsychotics, which can cause muscle rigidity and spasms. **Step-by-Step Rationale**: - **Eliminate options**: - **C. Levodopa**: Primarily used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, which doesn't fit the clinical presentation. - **D. Dantrolene**: A muscle relaxant used for malignant hyperthermia and certain muscle spastic conditions, but not typically used for acute torticollis. - **C. Levodopa**: Not typically used for acute management of torticollis. - **Consider the options**: - **A. Glycopyrrolate** and **B. Benztropine** are both anticholinergic agents, which can be used to manage extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) caused by antipsychotic medications. EPS include dystonia, akathisia, and parkinsonism, which can manifest as muscle spasms or rigidity, including torticollis. - **Decision**: Given the patient's recent use of antipsychotic medication and the presence of torticollis, an anticholinergic agent is most appropriate for managing the EPS. - **Conclusion**: Between Glycopyrrolate and Benztropine, **Benztropine** is often preferred for managing EPS due to its longer duration of action and less sedative effects compared to Glycopyrrolate. Therefore, the answer is **B. Benztropine**.",

Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."

He is rushed to a nearby level 1 trauma center where he is found to have multiple facial fractures, a severe, unstable cervical spine injury, and significant left eye trauma. Further examination of his left eye reveals rupture of his globe. The ophthalmolo-gist requests emergency surgery to repair and save his eye. Because the patient has suffered a recent trauma, you decide to perform a rapid sequence intubation in preparation for the surgical procedure. What muscle relaxant would you use to facilitate tracheal intubation? What is the proper dose for your chosen muscle relaxant? After intravenous infusion of your chosen muscle relaxant, you are unable to adequately visualize the patient\u2019s larynx and vocal cords and cannot successfully pass an endotracheal tube. You switch to mask ventilation but are barely able to mask ventilate the patient, and you become worried"

Plasma Na+ concentration was initially 129 meq/L, decreasing within 3 days to 118\u2013120 meq/L despite fluid restriction to 1 L/d. A chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a right 2.8 \u00d7 1.6 cm infrahilar mass and postobstructive pneumonia. The patient was an active smoker. Past medical history was notable for laryngeal carcinoma treated 15 years prior with radiation therapy, renal cell carcinoma, peripheral vascular disease, and hypothyroidism. On review of systems, he denied headache, nausea, and vomiting. He had chronic hip pain, managed with acetaminophen with codeine. Other medications included cilostazol, amoxicillin/clavulanate, digoxin, diltiazem, and thyroxine. He was euvolemic on examination, with no lymphadenopathy and a normal chest examination.

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

Case 4: Hypoglycemia, Hyperketonemia, and Liver Dysfunction Patient Presentation: AK, a 59-year-old male with slurred speech, ataxia (loss of skeletal muscle coordination), and abdominal pain, was dropped off at the Emergency Department (ED). Focused History: AK is known to the ED staff from previous visits. He has a 6year history of chronic, excessive alcohol consumption. He is not known to take illicit drugs. At this ED visit, AK reports that he has been drinking heavily in the past day or so. He cannot recall having eaten anything in that time.

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

He saw his PCP for evaluation of low back pain. X-rays of the spine showed some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine plus several wedge deformities in the thoracic spine. The patient is a long-time smoker (up to two packs per day) and has two to four glasses of wine with dinner, more on the weekends. He has chronic bronchitis, presumably from smoking, and has been treated on numerous occasions with oral prednisone for exacerba-tions of bronchitis. He is currently on 10 mg/d prednisone. Examination shows kyphosis of the thoracic spine, with some tenderness to fist percussion over the thoracic spine. The dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measure-ment of the lumbar spine is \u201cwithin the normal limits,\u201d but the radiologist noted that the reading may be misleading because of degenerative changes.
