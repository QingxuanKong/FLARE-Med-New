The patient was unable to answer questions and collapsed in transit. Her vitals are: temperature, 33.0\u00b0C (91.4\u00b0F); pulse, 40/min; respirations,12/min; blood pressure, 80/50 mm Hg; and oxygen saturation, 85% on room air. Physical examination shows decorticate posturing, incomprehensible speech, eyes opening to pain, dry hair, coarse and waxy skin, and non-pitting edema around the face and all extremities. Electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia. Laboratory studies show:\nCalcium 9.0 mg/dL\nHematocrit (female) 34%\nPotassium 4.0 mEq/L\nSodium 120 mEq/L\nTSH 110.0 \u00b5U/mL\nThyroxine (T4) 1.2 \u00b5g/dL\nTriiodothyronine (T3) 70 ng/dL\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

The patient is a 75-year-old woman with altered mental status, decorticate posturing, and coarse and waxy skin, which are indicative of severe hypothyroidism. The laboratory findings of low calcium, low sodium, and high TSH and T4 levels further support this diagnosis. The patient's low oxygen saturation, bradycardia, and hypotension may be related to the severe hypothyroidism. Myxedema coma is a life-threatening complication of untreated or undertreated hypothyroidism, characterized by altered mental status, hypothermia, and cardiovascular instability. Given the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is myxedema coma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

There is a variable relation from one patient to the next between the severity of hypercalcemia and the symptoms. Generally, symptoms are more common at calcium levels >2.9\u20133.0 mmol/L (11.6\u201312.0 mg/dL), but some patients, even at this level, are asymptomatic. When the calcium level is >3.2 mmol/L (12.8 mg/dL), calcification in kidneys, skin, vessels, lungs, heart, and stomach occurs and renal insufficiency may develop, particularly if blood phosphate levels are normal or elevated due to impaired renal excretion. Severe hypercalcemia, usually defined as \u22653.7\u20134.5 mmol/L (14.8\u201318.0 mg/dL), can be a medical emergency; coma and cardiac arrest can occur."

In more severe HF, the patient must sit upright, may have labored breathing, and may not be able to finish a sentence because of shortness of breath. Systolic blood pressure may be normal or high in early HF, but it generally is reduced in advanced HF because of severe LV dysfunction. The pulse pressure may be diminished, reflecting a reduction in stroke volume. Sinus tachycardia is a nonspecific sign caused by increased adrenergic activity. Peripheral vasoconstriction leading to cool peripheral extremities and cyanosis of the lips and nail beds is also caused by excessive adrenergic activity."

Pericardial effusions are present in about one-third of patients, rarely progress to tamponade, and probably result from increased capillary permeability. Other clinical signs include cardiomegaly, bradycardia, weak arterial pulses, distant heart sounds, and pleural effusions. Although the signs and symptoms of myxedema may mimic those of CHF, in the absence of other cardiac disease, myocardial failure is uncommon. The ECG generally reveals sinus bradycardia and low voltage and may show prolongation of the QT interval, decreased P-wave voltage, prolonged AV conduction time, intraventricular conduction disturbances, and nonspecific ST-Twave abnormalities. Chest x-ray may show cardiomegaly, often with a \u201cwater bottle\u201d configuration; pleural effusions; and, in some cases, evidence of CHF. Pathologically, the heart is pale"

Clinical manifestations include reduced level of consciousness, sometimes associated with seizures, as well as the other features of hypothyroidism (Table 405-6). Hypothermia can reach 23\u00b0C (74\u00b0F). There may be a history of treated hypothyroidism with poor compliance, or the patient may be previously undiagnosed. Myxedema coma almost always occurs in the elderly and is usually precipitated by factors that impair respiration, such as drugs (especially sedatives, anesthetics, and antidepressants), pneumonia, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal bleeding, or cerebrovascular accidents. Sepsis should also be suspected. Exposure to cold may also be a risk factor. Hypoventilation, leading to hypoxia and hypercapnia, plays a major role in pathogenesis; hypoglycemia and dilutional hyponatremia also contribute to the development of"

Undoubtedly the trauma of removal of such a large thyroid gland produced a change within the parathyroid gland, which failed to function appropriately. The secretion of parathyroid hormone rapidly decreased over the next 24 hours, resulting in increased excitability of peripheral nerves, manifest by carpopedal spasm and orofacial tingling. Muscle spasms can also be elicited by tapping the facial nerve [VII] as it emerges from the parotid gland to produce twitching of the facial muscles (Chvostek\u2019s sign). The patient recovered from these symptoms due to a low calcium level over the next 24 hours. At her return to the clinic the patient was placed on supplementary oral thyroxine, which is necessary after removal of the thyroid gland. The patient also complained of a hoarse voice."
