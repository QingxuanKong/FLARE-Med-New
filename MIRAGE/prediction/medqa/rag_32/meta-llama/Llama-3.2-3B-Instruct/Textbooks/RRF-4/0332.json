    "question": "A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with complaints of nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and dizziness, which have lasted for the past 3 hours. He was diagnosed with heart failure 1 year ago. During his last visit to his primary care physician, he was doing well and the lab results were normal. He reports that he has been taking low-dose aspirin and digoxin regularly for 1 year, and verapamil was recently added to prevent his frequent migraine headaches. An electrocardiogram is performed urgently and shows paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with block. Suspecting digitalis toxicity, the emergency medicine physician sends blood to the lab for a serum digoxin level, which is 3.7 ng/mL (therapeutic range: 0.8\u20132 ng/mL). Which of the following mechanisms most likely explains the development of digitalis toxicity in this patient?",

The serum digoxin level is 3.7 ng/mL, which is above the therapeutic range of 0.8\u20132 ng/mL.\\n\\nVerapamil is a calcium channel blocker that can increase digoxin levels by inhibiting its elimination through the CYP3A4 isoenzyme.

Measurement of plasma digoxin levels is useful in patients who appear unusually resistant or sensitive; a level of 1 ng/mL or less is appropriate; higher levels may be required in patients with atrial fibrillation. Because it has a moderate but persistent positive inotropic effect, digitalis can, in theory, reverse all the signs and symptoms of heart failure. Although the net effect of the drug on mortality is mixed, it reduces hospitalization and deaths from progressive heart failure at the expense of an increase in sudden death. It is important to note that the mortality rate is reduced in patients with serum digoxin concentrations of less than 0.9 ng/mL but increased in those with digoxin levels greater than 1.5 ng/mL.

Toxicity may occur as a result of acute overdose or from accumulation of digoxin in a patient with renal insufficiency or from taking a drug that interferes with digoxin elimination. Patients receiving long-term digoxin treatment are often also taking diuretics, which can lead to electrolyte depletion (especially potassium). Vomiting is common in patients with digitalis overdose. Hyperkalemia may be caused by acute digitalis overdose or severe poisoning, whereas hypokalemia may be present in patients as a result of long-term diuretic treatment. (Digitalis does not cause hypokalemia.) A variety of cardiac rhythm disturbances may occur, including sinus bradycardia, AV block, atrial tachycardia with block, accelerated junctional rhythm, premature ventricular beats, bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, and other ventricular arrhythmias."

            "content": "In contrast, the calcium-blocking drugs appear to have no role in the treatment of patients with heart failure. Their depressant effects on the heart may worsen heart failure. On the other hand, slowing of heart rate with ivabradine (an If blocker, see Chapter 12) may be of benefit. Digoxin is indicated in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation. It is usually given only when diuretics and ACE inhibitors have failed to control symptoms. Only about 50% of patients with normal sinus rhythm (usually those with documented systolic dysfunction) will have relief of heart failure from digitalis. If the decision is made to use a cardiac glycoside, digoxin is the one chosen in most cases (and the only one available in the USA). When symptoms are mild, slow loading (digitalization) with 0.125\u20130.25 mg/d is safer and just as effective as the rapid method (0.5\u20130.75 mg every 8 hours for three doses, followed by 0.125\u20130.25 mg/d)."

Verapamil and diltiazem appear to produce less hypotension and may be better tolerated in these circumstances. In patients with a history of atrial tachycardia, flutter, and fibrillation, verapamil and diltiazem provide a distinct advantage because of their antiarrhythmic effects. In the patient receiving digitalis, verapamil should be used with caution, because it may increase digoxin blood levels through a pharmacokinetic interaction. Although increases in digoxin blood level have also been demonstrated with diltiazem and nifedipine, such interactions are less consistent than with verapamil."

These effects decrease serum norepinephrine levels, plasma renin levels, and possibly aldosterone levels. The DIG trial demonstrated a reduction in heart failure hospitalizations in the treatment group but no reduction in mortality or improvement in quality of life. Importantly, treatment with digoxin resulted in a higher mortality rate in women than men. Furthermore, the effects of digoxin in reducing hospitalizations were lower in women than in men. It should be noted that low doses of digoxin are sufficient to achieve any potentially beneficial outcomes, and higher doses breach the therapeutic safety index. Although digoxin levels should be checked to minimize toxicity and although dose reductions are indicated for higher levels, no adjustment is made for low levels. Generally, digoxin is now relegated as therapy for patients who remain profoundly"

Serum digitalis level, potassium level, and the electrocardiogram should always be monitored during therapy of significant digitalis toxicity. Electrolytes should be monitored and corrected if abnormal. Digitalis-induced arrhythmias are frequently made worse by cardioversion; this therapy should be reserved for ventricular fibrillation if the arrhythmia is digitalis-induced."

The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy. One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC). He undergoes surgical resection and is found to have high-risk stage III CRC with five positive lymph nodes. After surgery, he feels entirely well with no symptoms. Of note, he has no other illnesses. What is this patient\u2019s overall prognosis? Based on his prognosis, what"

He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

Examination of patients experiencing stable angina is generally unremarkable. Look for carotid and peripheral bruits suggesting atherosclerosis and hypertension. Rule out pulmonary, GI, or other cardiac causes of chest pain. Angina may be diagnosed from the history alone, but significant ST-segment changes on exercise stress test with ECG monitoring is diagnostic of CAD. Women and diabetics classically experience \u201csilent\u201d ischemic events and present \u201catypically\u201d; for this reason, it is necessary to maintain a high index of suspicion in this patient population. Treat acute symptoms with ASA, O2 and/or IV nitroglycerin, and IV morphine, and consider IV \u03b2-blockers. The efficacy of nondihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem, verapamil) and ACEIs has also been validated."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"
