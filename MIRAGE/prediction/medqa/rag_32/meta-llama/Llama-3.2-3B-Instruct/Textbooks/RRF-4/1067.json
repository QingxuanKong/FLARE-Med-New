This type of delivery can increase the risk of perineal trauma.\\n\\nPostpartum examination shows a third-degree laceration in the vagina extending into the perineum at the 6 o'clock position. Third-degree lacerations can cause significant damage to the anal sphincter muscle, leading to fecal incontinence.\\n\\nGiven this information, the most likely complication the patient will experience is fecal incontinence.\\n\\nNow, let's evaluate the answer choices:\\n\\nA. Urge incontinence: This type of incontinence is characterized by a sudden, intense urge to urinate. It is not directly related to the patient's condition.\\n\\nB. Vesicovaginal fistula: A fistula is an abnormal connection between the bladder and vagina. While it is a possible complication of childbirth, it is not directly related to the patient's third-degree laceration.\\n\\nC. Fecal incontinence: This type of incontinence is characterized by the involuntary loss of stool. Given the patient's third-degree laceration, this is the most likely complication.\\n\\nD. Stress incontinence: This type of incontinence occurs when physical movement or pressure on the bladder causes involuntary urination. It is not directly related to the patient's condition.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Fecal incontinence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

The median duration is approximately 50 minutes for nulliparas and about 20 minutes for multiparas, but it is highly variable (Kilpatrick, 1989). In a woman of higher parity with a previously dilated vagina and perineum, two or three expulsive eforts after full cervical dilation may suice to complete delivery. Conversely, in a woman with a contracted pelvis, with a large fetus, or with impaired expulsive eforts from conduction analgesia or sedation, the second stage may be longer. Higher maternal body mass index does not interfere with second-stage labor length (Carlhall, 2013; Robinson, 2011). Abnormalities of this labor stage are described in Chapter 23 (p. 446)."

The mother must be thoroughly counseled, particularly regarding the potential for serious, life-threatening infection. The range of gestational age in which the beneits outweigh the risks for delayed delivery is likely narrow. Avoidance of delivery from 23 to 26 weeks would seem most beneficial. In our experience, good candidates for delayed delivery are rare. A litany of complications may be encountered during labor and delivery of multiple fetuses. In addition to preterm birth, rates of uterine contractile dysfunction, abnormal fetal presentation, umbilical cord prolapse, placenta previa, placental abruption, emergent operative delivery, and postpartum hemorrhage from uterine atony are higher. All of these must be anticipated, and thus certain precautions and special arrangements are prudent. These should include the following. 1."

            "content": "Maternal blood pressure, temperature, pulse, and respiratory rate are recorded. Fetal heart rate is evaluated using a portable Doppler device, sonography, or fetoscope. The pregnancy record is promptly reviewed to identiY complications. Problems identiied or anticipated during prenatal care should be displayed prominently in the pregnancy record. Most often, unless there has been bleeding in excess of bloody show, a cervical examination is performed. he gloved index and second ingers are introduced into the vagina while avoiding the anal region. During prenatal care, the woman is instructed to be aware of luid leakage from the vagina and to report such an event promptly. Rupture of the membranes is signiicant for three reasons. First, if the presenting part is not ixed in the pelvis, the umbilical cord can prolapse and be compressed. Second, labor is likely to begin soon if the pregnancy is at or near term."

            "content": "Pregnant women with gestational diabetes are at increased risk of stillbirth, preeclampsia, and delivery of infants who are large for their gestational age, with resulting birth lacerations, shoulder dystocia, and birth trauma including brachial plexus injury. These fetuses are at risk of hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and polycythemia. Tight control of blood sugar during pregnancy and labor can reduce these risks."

Those of the perineum oten follow vaginal delivery, and most are irst-and second-degree lacerations. Lacerations are classified by their depth, and complete deinitions and visual examples are given in Figure 27-13. Of these, third-degree lacerations relect anal sphincter injury and are now subcategorized as: (3c) EAS plus internal anal sphincter (lAS) tears. FIGURE 27-12 Manual removal of placenta. A.

When the placenta detaches, it is grasped and removed."

The most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage (90%). Manual and visual inspection of the lower genital tract for any laceration > 2 cm long. Manual and visual inspection of the placenta and uterine cavity for missing cotyledons. Ultrasound may also be used to inspect the uterus. Treatmenta Bimanual uterine massage (usually successful).

            "content": "Thus, even in the best of circumstances, some etal outcomes wil be impaire. he Utah experiences are instructive here (Holmgren, 2012). Of the 35 laboring patients with uterine rupture, the decision-to-delivery time was < 18 minutes in 17, and none of these infants had an adverse neurological outcome. Of the 18 born > 18 minutes from decision time, the three infants with long-term neurological impairments were delivered at 31, 40, and 42 minutes. There were no deaths, thus severe neonatal neurological morbidity developed in 8 percent of this group of 35 women with uterine rupture. In a study using the Swedish Birth Registry, Kaczmarczyk and coworkers (2007) found that the risk of neonatal death following uterine rupture was 5 percent. In the Network study cited earlier, seven of the 114 uterine ruptures associated with TOAC-6 percent-were complicated by development of neonatal HIE (Spong, 2007)."

            "content": "Hendricks (1968) observed that \"the clinician makes great demands upon the uterus.\" The uterus is expected to remain well relaxed during pregnancy, to contract efectively but intermittently during labor, and then to remain in a state of almost constant contraction for several hours postpartum. Figure 24-28 demonstrates an example of normal uterine activity during labor. Uterine activity progressively and gradually rises from early through late labor. Interestingly, uterine contractions after birth are identical to those resulting in delivery of the newborn. Logically, the uterus that performs poorly before delivery is also prone to atony and puerperal hemorrhage.

            "content": "The ideal management of labor and delivery requires two potentially opposing viewpoints on the part of clinicians. First, birthing should be recognized as a normal physiological process that most women experience without complications. Second, intrapartum complications, often arising quickly and unexpectedly, should be anticipated. Thus, clinicians must simultaneously make every woman and her supporters feel comfortable, yet ensure safety for the mother and newborn if complications suddenly develop. he American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017) have collaborated in the development of Guidelines or Perinatal Care. These provide detailed information on the appropriate content of intrapartum care, including both personnel and facility requirements (Table 22-2). Labor and delivery outside the hospital is elected by some parturients. This option and its risks and benefits are discussed in Chapter 27 (p. 524)."
