She has a history of regular menstruation every 4 weeks that lasts about 4 days with mild to moderate bleeding, but she missed her last period 2 weeks ago. A home pregnancy test was positive. She has a 6-year history of hyperthyroidism that is well-controlled with daily methimazole. She is currently asymptomatic and has no complaints or concerns. A blood specimen is taken and confirms the diagnosis. Additionally, her thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is 2.0 \u03bcU/mL. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",

The next best step in the management of this patient is to continue the current treatment with methimazole, as it is the preferred medication for pregnant women with hyperthyroidism due to its safety profile and efficacy. Discontinuing methimazole or switching to propylthiouracil may increase the risk of thyroid crisis during pregnancy. Adding glucocorticoids is not indicated in this case, and referring for radioiodine therapy is not necessary as the patient is asymptomatic and the TSH level is within the normal range.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

For nonpregnant patients, the American hyroid Association recommends that methimazole be used at an initial higher daily dose of 10 to 20 mg orally followed by a lower maintenance dose of 5 to 10 mg. If PTU is selected, a dose of 50 to 150 mg orally three times daily may be initiated depending on clinical severity (Bahn, 2011). At Parkland Hospital, we usually initially give 300 or 450 mg of PTU daily in three divided doses for pregnant women. Occasionally, daily doses of 600 mg or higher are necessary. As discussed, we generally do not transition women to methimazole during the second trimester. he goal is treatment with the lowest possible thionamide dose to maintain thyroid hormone levels slightly above or in the high normal range, while TSH levels remains suppressed (Bahn, 2011).

During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

JP presents with the typical signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism following RAI despite levothyroxine replacement. Either radioactive iodine or thyroidectomy are reasonable and effective strategies for definitive treat-ment of her hyperthyroidism, especially before becoming pregnant to avoid an acute hyperthyroid exacerbation during pregnancy or following delivery. Her hypothy-roid symptoms should have been easily corrected by the addition of levothyroxine dosed correctly at 1.7 mcg/kg/ day or 100 mcg daily. Because she is young and has no cardiac disease, full replacement doses were appropriate to start. However, her elevated TSH level indicates inad-equate levothyroxine replacement which may be related to nonadherence, or concomitant calcium and omeprazole co-administration. For optimal absorption,"

The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative."

Pregnancy is associated with reversible changes in thyroid physiology that should be noted before diagnosing thyroid abnormalities (see Fig. 31.12 for pregnancy associated changes in TBG, total T4, hCG, TSH, and free T4) (403). Women with a history of hypothyroidism often require increased thyroxine replacement during pregnancy, and patients should have thyroid function tests performed at the first prenatal visit and during each trimester thereafter. Evidence suggests that optimal fetal and infant neurodevelopmental outcomes may require careful titration of replacement thyroxine that meets the frequently increased requirements of pregnancy (413,414)."

Obtain platelet count, bleeding time, and PT/PTT to rule out von Willebrand\u2019s disease and factor XI def ciency. Order an ultrasound to evaluate the ovaries, uterus, and endometrium. Look for uterine masses, polycystic ovaries, and thickness of the endometrium. If the endometrium is \u2265 4 mm in a postmenopausal woman, obtain an endometrial biopsy. An endometrial biopsy should also be obtained if the patient is > 35 years of age, obese (BMI > 35), and diabetic. Heavy bleeding: Since heavy or prolonged uterine bleeding has likely denuded the endometrial cavity, estrogen is needed to rapidly promote endometrial growth."
