The episodes of lesions started at the age of 2 months and multiple treatment options have been attempted without success. He has also had several episodes of respiratory tract infections, enlarged lymph nodes, and recurrent fevers since birth. The boy attends daycare. His older brother has asthma. The patient's immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 5th percentile for length and 10th percentile for weight. He appears ill. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. Examination shows several raised, erythematous lesions of different sizes over the face, neck, groins, and extremities; some secrete pus. Cervical and axillary lymph nodes are enlarged bilaterally. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's consider the key points from the patient's history and physical examination. The patient is a 3-year-old boy with recurrent skin lesions, respiratory tract infections, enlarged lymph nodes, and recurrent fevers since birth. He attends daycare and has an older brother with asthma. The patient's immunizations are up-to-date, but he is at the 5th percentile for length and 10th percentile for weight, indicating growth failure. The physical examination reveals several raised, erythematous lesions of different sizes over the face, neck, groins, and extremities, some of which secrete pus. Cervical and axillary lymph nodes are enlarged bilaterally. Considering the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, we need to think about conditions that are associated with recurrent infections, lymphadenopathy, and skin lesions. Let's evaluate each option: A. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a condition characterized by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections due to an inability to produce reactive oxygen species. While CGD can cause recurrent infections, it is not typically associated with skin lesions or lymphadenopathy. B. Atopic dermatitis is a common skin condition characterized by itchy, inflamed skin, but it is not typically associated with recurrent infections or lymphadenopathy. C. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive disorder characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections. The condition is associated with skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, and recurrent infections, making it a strong candidate for the diagnosis. D. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by albinism, immunodeficiency, and recurrent infections. While it can cause recurrent infections, it is not typically associated with skin lesions or lymphadenopathy. Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. The patient's history of recurrent skin lesions, respiratory tract infections, enlarged lymph nodes, and recurrent fevers since birth, along with his growth failure, are all consistent with this condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Lymphadenopathy develops 1\u20133 weeks or longer after cat contact. The affected lymph node(s) are enlarged and usually painful, sometimes have overlying erythema, and suppurate in 10\u201315% of cases (Fig. 197\u20131C, D, and E). Axillary/epitrochlear nodes are most commonly involved; next in frequency are head/neck nodes and then inguinal/femoral nodes. Approximately 50% of patients have fever, malaise, and anorexia. A smaller proportion experience weight loss and night sweats mimicking the presentation of lymphoma. Fever is usually low-grade but infrequently rises to \u226539\u00b0C. Resolution is slow, requiring weeks (for fever, pain, and accompanying signs and symptoms) to months (for node shrinkage)."

This illness is marked by a prominent sore throat and the gradual onset of fever, which often reaches 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F) on the second or third day of illness. Cough is almost always present, and coryza and regional lymphadenopathy are frequently seen. Physical examination may show pharyngeal edema, injection, and tonsillar enlargement with little or no exudate. If pneumonia has developed, auscultation and x-ray of the chest may indicate areas of patchy infiltration."

Also typical is a lilac- colored (heliotrope) change in the skin over the eyelids, on the bridge of the nose, on the cheeks, and over the forehead; it may have a scaly component. Itching may be a troublesome symptom in regions of the other skin eruptions. A predominance of rash over the neck and upper shoulders has been termed the V sign, while rash over the shoulders and upper arms, the shawl sign. This distribution suggests that the skin changes reflect heightened photosensitivity (a feature shared with pellagra). Periorbital and perioral edema are additional findings but mainly in fulminant cases. Skin changes may be transient and in some instances are restricted to 1 or more patches of dermatitis; they are difficult to appreciate in dark-skinned individuals. Evanescent and restricted skin manifestations are emphasized because they are frequently overlooked and provide clues to diagnosis. In"

The fluid progresses from clear to cloudy,and the vesicles ulcerate, crust, and heal.

There may be atotal of 100 to 500 lesions, with all forms of lesions being presentat the same time. Pruritus is universal and marked. Lesions maybe present on mucous membranes. Lymphadenopathy may begeneralized. The severity of the rash varies, as do systemic signsand fever, which generally abate after 3 to 4 days."

Early in the illness, the patient appears flushed, and the skin is hot and dry, although diaphoresis and mottled extremities are sometimes evident, particularly in older patients. Examination of the pharynx may yield surprisingly unremarkable results despite a severe sore throat, but injection of the mucous membranes and postnasal discharge are apparent in some cases. Mild cervical lymphadenopathy may be noted, especially in younger individuals. The results of chest examination are largely negative in uncomplicated influenza, although rhonchi, wheezes, and scattered rales have been reported with variable frequency in different outbreaks. Frank dyspnea, hyperpnea, cyanosis, diffuse rales, and signs of consolidation are indicative of pulmonary complications.

It is important to distinguish persistent fever from recurrent or periodic fevers, which usually represent serial acute illnesses. The initial evaluation of FUO requires a thorough history and physical examination supplemented with a few screening laboratory tests (Fig. 96-2). Additional laboratory and imaging tests are guided by abnormalities on initial evaluation. Figure 96-1 Approach to a child younger than 36 months of age with fever without localizing signs.

Hematogenous and lymphatic dissemination (stage 1 disease) is marked by the onset of fever. Typically, bouts of high temperatures lasting several days are separated by afebrile periods. Lymphadenopathy is prominent in T. b. gambiense trypanosomiasis. The nodes are discrete, movable, rubbery, and nontender. Cervical nodes are often visible, and enlargement of the nodes of the posterior cervical triangle, or Winterbottom\u2019s sign, is a classic finding. Pruritus and maculopapular rashes are common. Inconstant findings include malaise, headache, arthralgias, weight loss, edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and tachycardia. The differential diagnosis of stage 1 HAT includes many diseases that are common in the tropics and are associated with fevers. HIV infection, malaria, and typhoid fever are common in populations at risk for HAT and need to be considered."

A detailed history and physical examination often helps determine the likely etiology of the lymph node and the need for excisional biopsy. Enlarged tender lymph nodes are usually the result of a bacterial infection (Staphy-lococcus or Streptococcus). Treatment of the primary cause (e.g., otitis media or pharyngitis) with antibiotics often is all that is necessary. However, when the involved nodes become fluctuant, incision and drainage are indicated. In many North American institutions, there has been an increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection of the skin and soft tissues, leading to increased staphylococcal lymphadenitis in children. More chronic forms of lymphadeni-tis, including infections with atypical mycobacteria, as well as cat-scratch fever, are diagnosed based on serologic findings or excisional biopsy. The"
