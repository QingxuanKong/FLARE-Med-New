    "question": "A 23-year-old woman is seen by her primary care physician for fatigue. She says that she has always felt a little short of breath compared to her friends; however, she did not think that it was abnormal until she started trying a new exercise regimen. On physical exam, she is found to have mild conjunctival pallor and a peripheral blood smear is obtained showing echinocytes but no intracellular accumulations. Upon further questioning, she recalls that several relatives have had similar issues with fatigue and pallor in the past. Which of the following is true about the rate limiting enzyme of the biochemical pathway that is affected by this patient's most likely condition?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to identify the patient's likely condition based on the provided symptoms and test results. The patient is a 23-year-old woman who has been experiencing fatigue and shortness of breath, particularly after starting a new exercise regimen. She has mild conjunctival pallor and a peripheral blood smear showing echinocytes (abnormal red blood cells with an irregular shape) but no intracellular accumulations. These findings suggest a condition that affects the production or function of red blood cells. Given the family history of similar issues, a genetic disorder is a possibility. The most likely condition is hereditary spherocytosis, a disorder characterized by the production of abnormal red blood cells that are more prone to premature destruction. The rate-limiting enzyme of the biochemical pathway affected in hereditary spherocytosis is 5'-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), which is stimulated by AMP (adenosine monophosphate). PRPP is a key regulator of nucleotide synthesis, and its activity is increased in response to low ATP levels, which can occur in conditions where red blood cell turnover is increased, such as hereditary spherocytosis. Therefore, the correct answer is D. It is inhibited by AMP.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

A reasonable approach to screening includes a complete blood count with differential (to screen for anemia, infection, and malignancy), electrolytes (including sodium, potassium, and calcium), glucose, renal function, liver function, and thyroid function. Testing for HIV and adrenal function can also be considered. Published guidelines defining chronic fatigue syndrome also recommend an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) as part of the evaluation for mimics, but unless the value is very high, such nonspecific testing in the absence of other features is unlikely to clarify the situation."

In the context of clinical medicine, fatigue is most typically and practically defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining voluntary mental or physical activity. Nearly everyone who has ever been ill with a self-limited infection has experienced this near-universal symptomatology, and fatigue is usually brought to medical attention only when it is either of unclear cause or the severity is out of proportion with what would be expected for the associated trigger.

The correct conclusion can usually be reached by keeping these illnesses in mind as one elicits the history from patient and family. Difficulty arises when symptoms of the psychiatric illness are so inconspicuous as not to be appreciated; one comes then to suspect the diagnosis only by having eliminated the common medical causes. Repeated observation may bear out the existence of an anxiety state or gloomy mood. Reassurance in combination with a therapeutic trial of antidepressant drugs may suppress symptoms of which the patient was barely aware, thus clarifying the diagnosis. The best that can be done is to assist the patient in adjusting to the adverse circumstances that have brought him under medical surveillance."

The examining physician discovers postural hypotension and moderate vitiligo (depigmented areas of skin) and obtains routine blood tests. She finds hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis and suspects Addison\u2019s disease. She performs a standard ACTH 1\u201324 stimulation test, which reveals an insufficient plasma cortisol response compatible with primary adrenal insuf-ficiency. The diagnosis of autoimmune Addison\u2019s disease is made, and the patient must start replacement of the hormones he cannot produce himself. How should this patient be treated? What precautions should he take?"

It may, on medical investigation, prove to be a systemic manifestation of infection, metabolic or endocrine disorder, severe anemia, reduced cardiopulmonary function, or neoplasia. More often, when expressed as a feeling of poor endurance, weariness, and disinclination to undertake or sustain mental and physical activity, it is indicative of neurasthenia, a psychiatric manifestation common to states of chronic anxiety and depression. On the other hand, a rare example of a physiologic muscle disorder that simulates lassitude is lifelong exercise intolerance, often accompanied by muscle cramps during exercise, which has been traced to mutations in the cytochrome b gene of the mitochondrial DNA (Andreu et al). The subject of fatigue as a physiologic phenomenon and as a clinical feature of many psychiatric and medical diseases,"

The demonstration of reduced power, reflex changes, fasciculations, and atrophy sets the case analysis along different lines, bringing up for particular consideration diseases of the peripheral nervous system or of the musculature. Rare, difficult-to-diagnose diseases that cause inexplicable muscle weakness and exercise intolerance are otherwise inevident hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, ossifying hemangiomas with hypophosphatemia, some of the periodic paralyses, hyperinsulinism, disorders of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and the mitochondrial myopathies, all of which are discussed in later chapters of the book on disease of muscle.

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

Clues to the mechanisms of anemia may be provided on physical examination by findings of infection, blood in the stool, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, or petechiae. Splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy suggest an underlying lymphoproliferative disease, whereas petechiae suggest platelet dysfunction. Past laboratory measurements are helpful to determine a time of onset."

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."
