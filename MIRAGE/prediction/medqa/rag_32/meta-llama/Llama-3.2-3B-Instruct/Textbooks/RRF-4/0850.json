According to bystanders, the cable struck him on his right arm, after which the man slumped to the ground with his arms and legs shaking. In the emergency department, the man is alert but in severe pain localizing bilaterally in the flanks as well as in his right arm where contact with the power line occurred. A 6 cm burn is present on the right arm. His vitals are within normal limits except for mild tachypnea at 21/min. Which of the following diagnostic tests should be conducted first to evaluate this patient?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To evaluate the patient who has been struck by a high-voltage power line, the first step is to assess for any immediate life-threatening conditions. The patient is alert but in severe pain, which suggests that there may be an internal injury. The presence of a 6 cm burn on the right arm is also a concern. The patient's vitals are within normal limits except for mild tachypnea, which could indicate respiratory distress or cardiac issues. Given the mechanism of injury, there is a high suspicion for cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) ultrasound assessment is the most appropriate initial diagnostic test in this scenario because it is quick, non-invasive, and can help identify free fluid in the pericardial space, which is indicative of cardiac tamponade. The other options, while potentially useful in other contexts, are not the first line of evaluation in this situation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"",

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

Blood pressure and heart rate should be measured in the supine position and after 3 min of standing to determine whether orthostatic hypotension is present. An ECG should be performed if there is suspicion of syncope due to an arrhythmia or underlying cardiac disease. Relevant electrocardiographic abnormalities include bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias, AV block, ischemia, old myocardial infarction, long QT syndrome, and bundle branch block.

If current flow continues long enough, it generates enough heat to produce burns at the site of entry and exit as well as in internal organs. An important characteristic of alternating current, the type available in most homes, is that it induces tetanic muscle spasm, so that when a live wire or switch is grasped, irreversible clutching is likely to occur, prolonging the period of current flow. This results in a greater likelihood of extensive electrical burns and, in some cases, spasm of the chest wall muscles, producing death from asphyxia.

Blood obtained for analysis was brown. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A. Carboxyhemoglobinemia B. Hemoglobin SC disease C. Methemoglobinemia D.

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

A treatment goal for the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) caused by acute bronchitis is to insure appropriate nutrition without increasing the respiratory quotient (RQ), which is the ratio of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced to oxygen consumed, thereby minimizing the production of CO2. Less CO2 is produced from the metabolism of fat (RQ = 0.7) than from the catabolism of carbohydrate (RQ =1.0). Fat contains fewer oxygen atoms. Fat is calorically denser than is carbohydrate.

            "content": "Lead neuropathy is uncommon, but it can be seen in children who accidentally ingest lead-based paints in older buildings and in industrial workers exposed to lead-containing products. The most common presentation of lead poisoning is an encephalopathy; however, symptoms and signs of a primarily motor neuropathy can also occur. The neuropathy is characterized by an insidious and progressive onset of weakness usually beginning in the arms, in particular involving the wrist and finger extensors, resembling a radial neuropathy. Sensation is generally preserved; however, the autonomic nervous system can be affected. Laboratory investigation can reveal a microcytic hypo-chromic anemia with basophilic stippling of erythrocytes, an elevated serum lead level, and an elevated serum coproporphyrin level. A 24-h urine collection demonstrates elevated levels of lead excretion. The NCS may reveal reduced CMAP amplitudes, while the SNAPs are typically normal. The pathogenic basis may be related to"
