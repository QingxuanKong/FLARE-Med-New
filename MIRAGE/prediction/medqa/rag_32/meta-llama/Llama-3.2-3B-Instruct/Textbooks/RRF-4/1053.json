    "question": "A 28-year-old woman presents with facial flushing, weakness, and chronic diarrhea for the past month. She denies any history of smoking, alcohol use, or recreational drug use. The patient was on a trip to Thailand 2 years ago with her family but denies any recent travel. Her blood pressure is 120/88 mm Hg, pulse is 78/min, temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), and respiratory rate is 16/min. Laboratory findings are unremarkable, except for a potassium level of 3.3 mmol/L and serum calcium of 11 mg/dL. The attending physician suspects that this might be a case of a genetic mutation in the menin 1 gene on chromosome 11 and orders a genetic analysis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Vibrio cholera infection",
        "B": "VIPoma",
        "C": "Rotavirus",
        "D": "Campylobacter jejuni"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Given the symptoms of facial flushing, weakness, and chronic diarrhea, and the laboratory findings of low potassium and high serum calcium, the most likely diagnosis is a rare disorder affecting the regulation of calcium and potassium levels. Step 1: The patient's symptoms of facial flushing and diarrhea are suggestive of a disorder that affects the gastrointestinal system and causes excessive secretion of a hormone that leads to these symptoms. Step 2: The low potassium level (hypokalemia) and high serum calcium level are indicative of a disorder that affects the regulation of calcium and potassium levels in the body. Step 3: The genetic mutation in the menin 1 gene on chromosome 11 is a clue that points towards a genetic disorder. The menin 1 gene is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), a disorder that affects the regulation of multiple endocrine glands. Step 4: MEN1 is characterized by the occurrence of tumors in multiple endocrine glands, including the parathyroid glands, pancreas, and pituitary gland. The most common feature of MEN1 is hyperparathyroidism, which leads to hypercalcemia (elevated serum calcium levels). Step 5: The patient's symptoms of facial flushing and diarrhea are consistent with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which is a feature of MEN1. SIADH leads to excessive secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), causing water retention and dilutional hyponatremia (low sodium levels). However, in this case, the patient has hypokalemia, which is not typical of SIADH. Step 6: Considering the genetic mutation in the menin 1 gene and the combination of hypokalemia and hypercalcemia, the most likely diagnosis is a rare disorder that affects the regulation of calcium and potassium levels, such as Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia (FHH) or Familial Hypoparathyroidism (FHP). Step 7: Among the options provided, the most likely diagnosis is B. VIPoma, which is a rare tumor of the pancreas that causes excessive secretion of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), leading to hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, and diarrhea. The final answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the symptoms of facial flushing, weakness, and chronic diarrhea, and the laboratory findings of low potassium and high serum calcium, the most likely diagnosis is a rare disorder affecting the regulation of calcium and potassium levels. The genetic mutation in the menin 1 gene on chromosome 11 points towards Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1).

Case 3: Hyperglycemia and Hyperketonemia Patient Presentation: MW, a 40-year-old woman, was brought to the hospital in a disoriented, confused state by her husband. Focused History: As noted on her medical alert bracelet, MW has had type 1 diabetes (T1D) for the last 24 years. Her husband reports that this is her first medical emergency in 2 years. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): MW displayed signs of dehydration (such as dry mucous membranes and skin, poor skin turgor, and low blood pressure) and acidosis (such as deep, rapid breathing [Kussmaul respiration]). Her breath had a faintly fruity odor. Her temperature was normal."

In addition, she is on hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol for hypertension. The patient has a history of one depressive episode after a divorce that was treated successfully with fluoxetine. Medical workup including complete blood cell count, thyroid func-tion tests, and a chemistry panel reveals no abnormalities. She is started on fluoxetine for a presumed major depressive episode and referred for cognitive behavioral psychotherapy. What CYP450 and pharmacodynamic interactions might be associated with fluoxetine use in this patient? Which class of antidepressants would be contraindicated in this patient? A 47-year-old woman"

The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL).

Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months.
