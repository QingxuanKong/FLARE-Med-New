    "question": "A 25-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for pain in his back. The patient describes the pain as feeling worse in the morning. He says it is a general stiffness that improves when he goes to the gym and lifts weights. He also states that his symptoms seem to improve when he leans forward or when he is cycling. The patient is a current smoker and is sexually active. He admits to having unprotected sex with many different partners this past year. The patient has no significant past medical history and is not currently taking any medications. On physical exam, the patient demonstrates notable kyphosis of the thoracic spine and decreased mobility of the back in all 4 directions. The patient\u2019s strength is 5/5 in his upper and lower extremities. The rest of his physical exam is within normal limits. Which of the following findings is associated with this patient\u2019s presentation?",

This pattern of pain is suggestive of \\u201creferred pain\\u201d, which is pain that is felt in an area other than the site of the painful stimulus. In this case, the pain is referred to the back.\\n\\nThe patient also has notable kyphosis of the thoracic spine and decreased mobility of the back in all 4 directions. This suggests that the patient may have a condition that affects the muscles or ligaments in the spine, such as ankylosing spondylitis.\\n\\nNow, let's evaluate the potential choices:\\n\\nA. Diminished pulses in the lower extremity: This could be a sign of peripheral artery disease or aortic stenosis, but it is not directly related to the patient's back pain.\\n\\nB. Narrowing of the spinal canal when standing upright: This is a classic sign of ankylosing spondylitis, a condition that causes the spine to fuse together and narrow the spinal canal.\\n\\nC. Pain with elevation of his leg while laying down: This is a characteristic feature of spinal stenosis, a condition that causes narrowing of the spinal canal and compression of the spinal cord.\\n\\nD. Punctate bleeding spots when dermatologic scales are removed: This is a characteristic feature of pseudoxanthoma elasticum, a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin and connective tissue.\\n\\nBased on the patient's presentation, the most likely diagnosis is ankylosing spondylitis, which is associated with narrowing of the spinal canal when standing upright (choice B).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

A 50-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with severe lower back pain that had started several days ago. In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."

After a short period of rest, he could walk another 100 yards before the same symptoms recurred. He also noticed that over the past year he was unable to obtain an erection.

No advantage accrues from determining how much pain the patient can tolerate. More important is to determine when and under what conditions the pain begins or worsens. Observation of the patient\u2019s gait may disclose a subtle limp, a pelvic tilt, a shortening of step, or a stiffness of bearing\u2014indicative of a disinclination to bear weight on a painful leg. One looks for limitation of motion while the patient is standing, sitting, and reclining. When standing, the motion of forward bending normally produces flattening and reversal of the lumbar lordotic curve and exaggeration of the thoracic curve. With lesions of the lumbosacral region that involve the posterior ligaments, articular facets, or sacrospinalis muscles and with ruptured lumbar discs, protective reflexes prevent flexion, which stretches these structures (\u201csplinting\u201d).

Many patients with CLBP have a history of psychiatric illness (depression, anxiety states) or childhood trauma (physical or sexual abuse) that antedates the onset of back pain.

The venous drainage of the testis is via the pampiniform plexus of veins that runs within the spermatic cord. A varicocele is a collection of dilated veins that arise from the pampiniform plexus. In many ways, they are similar to varicose veins that develop in the legs. Typically, the patient complains of a dragging feeling in the scrotum and around the testis, which is usually worse toward the end of the day.

The pain began after a fall on his outstretched hand approximately 6 months previously. The patient recalled having some minor shoulder tenderness but no other specific symptoms. He was otherwise fit and well. On examination of the shoulder, there was marked wasting of the muscles in the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae. The patient found initiation of abduction difficult and there was a weakness of lateral rotation of the humerus. The wasted muscles were the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The cause of the muscle wasting was disuse. Muscle atrophy (wasting) occurs through a variety of disorders. Disuse atrophy is one of the most common causes. Examples of disuse atrophy include the loss of muscle bulk after fracture immobilization in a plaster cast. The opposite effect can also be demonstrated\u2014when muscles are overused they become bulkier (hypertrophy)."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

After admission a bronchoscopy was carried out and sputum was aspirated from the left upper lobe bronchus. This was cultured in the laboratory and also viewed under the microscope and tuberculous bacilli (TB) were identified. A 68-year-old man came to his family physician complaining of discomfort when swallowing (dysphagia). The physician examined the patient and noted since his last visit he had lost approximately 18 lb over 6 months. Routine blood tests revealed the patient was anemic and he was referred to the gastroenterology unit. A diagnosis of esophageal cancer was made and the patient underwent a resection, which involved a chest and abdominal incision. After 4 years the patient remains well though still subject to follow-up."

Patient history should include loca-tion, quality, severity, timing, and radiation of pain along with any referred pain, associated signs and symptoms, modify-ing factors, or prior treatments, including both conservative and surgical measures.
