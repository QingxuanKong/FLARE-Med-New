He has been treated for otitis media 4 times and bronchiolitis 3 times since birth. He was born at 37 weeks' gestation, and the neonatal period was uncomplicated. He is at the 10th percentile for height and 3rd percentile for weight. His temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F), pulse is 126/min, and respirations are 35/min. Examination shows an erythematous scaly rash over his trunk and extremities. The white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa bleed when scraped. Inspiratory crackles are heard in the right lung base. An X-ray of the chest shows an infiltrate in the right lower lobe and an absent thymic shadow.

The presence of an absent thymic shadow on the chest X-ray suggests thymic hypoplasia or aplasia, which is a key feature of DiGeorge syndrome. The patient's symptoms and examination findings, including the white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa that bleed when scraped, are also consistent with DiGeorge syndrome. The patient's history of recurrent infections, including otitis media and bronchiolitis, is also consistent with DiGeorge syndrome. The patient's low birth weight and growth parameters (10th percentile for height and 3rd percentile for weight) are also consistent with DiGeorge syndrome. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is DiGeorge syndrome. The definitive treatment for DiGeorge syndrome is hematopoietic cell transplantation, which would replace the defective thymus and restore immune function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

The most striking lesions affect the mucocutaneous tissues and bones. Early signs of infection may be poor feeding and snuffles (syphilitic rhinitis). Snuffles are more severe and persistent than the common cold and are often bloody. A maculopapular desquamative rash develops over the palms and soles and around the mouth and anus. The rash may progress to become vesicular with bullae. Severely ill infants may be born with hydrops and have profound anemia. Severe consolidated pneumonia may be present at birth, and there may be laboratory findings consistent with a glomerulonephritis. CSF evaluation may reveal a pleocytosis and elevated protein. More than 90% of symptomatic infants exhibit radiographic abnormalities of the long bones consistent with osteochondritis and perichondritis."

            "content": "The history may suggest a diagnosis and direct the evaluation, which should include a full examination as well as a thorough abdominal examination. Extraintestinal disorders may produce GI manifestations (e.g., emesis with group A streptococcal pharyngitis, abdominal pain with lower lobe pneumonia). The examination should begin with a careful external inspection for abdominal distention, bruising or discoloration, abnormal veins, jaundice, surgical scars, and ostomies. Abnormalities of intensity and pitch of bowel sounds can occur with bowel obstruction. When palpating for tenderness, the examiner should note location, facial expression, guarding, and rebound tenderness. Palpation can also detect enlargement of the liver or spleen as well as feces and masses. If detected, organomegaly should be measured (with a tape measure), noting abnormal firmness or contour. A rectal examination, including inspection for fissures, skin tags, abscesses, and fistulous openings, should be performed"

            "content": "The clinical presentation varies depending on the age of the patient, duration of infestation, and immune status of the patient. Severe and paroxysmal itching is the hallmark, with complaints of itching that is frequently worse than the eruption would suggest. Most children exhibit an eczematous eruption composed of red, excoriated papules and nodules. The classic linear papule or burrow is often difficult to find. Distribution is the most diagnostic finding; the papules are found in the axillae, umbilicus, groin, penis, instep of the foot, and web spaces of the fingers and toes (Fig. 196-1). Infants infested with scabies have diffuse erythema, scaling, and pinpoint papules. Pustules, vesicles, and nodules are much more common in infants and may be more diffusely distributed. The face and scalp usually are spared in adults and older children, but these areas are usually involved in infants. Nodular lesions may represent active infection or prolonged hypersensitivity lesions following"

Her vital signs include the following: temperature 99.8\u00b0F, blood pressure 132/64 mm Hg, pulse 78 bpm, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, she had left upper abdominal tenderness with evidence of hepatomegaly and mild scleral icterus.

            "content": "Most children recover from pneumonia rapidly and completely, although radiographic abnormalities may take 6 to 8 weeks to return to normal. In a few children, pneumonia may persist longer than 1 month or may be recurrent. In such cases, the possibility of underlying disease must be investigated further, such as with tuberculin skin test, sweat chloride determination for cystic fibrosis, serum immunoglobulin and IgG subclass determinations, bronchoscopy to identify anatomic abnormalities or foreign body, and barium swallow for gastroesophageal reflux. Severe adenovirus pneumonia may result in bronchiolitis obliterans, a subacute inflammatory process in which the small airways are replaced by scar tissue, resulting in a reduction in lung volume and lung compliance. Unilateral hyper-lucent lung, or Swyer-James syndrome, is a focal sequela of severe necrotizing pneumonia in which all or part of a lung has increased translucency radiographically; it has been linked to adenovirus type 21."

Clinical manifestations vary from mild conjunctivitis to intense inflammation and swelling. Both eyes are almost always involved; however, one eye may appear to be more swollen and infected than the other. The cornea is rarely involved, and preauricular adenopathy is rare. Pneumonia in a young infant can occur between 2 and 19 weeks of age and is characterized by an afebrile illness with a repetitive staccato cough, tachypnea, and rales. Wheezing is uncommon. Hyperinflation with diffuse infiltrates can be seen on chest radiograph. Nasal stuffiness and otitis media can occur."
