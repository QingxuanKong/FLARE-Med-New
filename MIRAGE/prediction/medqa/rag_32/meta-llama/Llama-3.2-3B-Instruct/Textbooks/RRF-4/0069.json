    "question": "A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension, obesity, and alcoholic cirrhosis is seen in clinic for follow-up. He feels well and currently drinks 5 glasses of wine each night. Medications include atenolol and lisinopril. On physical exam, temperature is 98.1 deg F (36.7 deg C), blood pressure is 151/82 mmHg, pulse is 71/min, and respirations are 14/min. He has spider angiomata on his chest; no asterixis, jaundice, ascites, or peripheral edema is noted. Screening ultrasound reveals a new liver nodule, and follow up CT demonstrates a 2 cm right hepatic lobe lesion with enhancement in the arterial phase. No hypodense attenuation is seen on the venous or delayed phase. What is the next step in management?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the next step in management, we need to consider the patient's symptoms, medical history, and imaging findings. The patient has a history of hypertension, obesity, and alcoholic cirrhosis, and presents with a new liver nodule and enhancement in the arterial phase on CT scan. This suggests that the nodule is likely a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The patient's symptoms are not severe, and he feels well, which suggests that the tumor is not causing significant symptoms at this time. The presence of spider angiomata on physical exam is also consistent with liver disease. Given these findings, the next step in management should be to confirm the diagnosis and assess the tumor's characteristics. Proceeding with liver biopsy (Option A) would be the most appropriate next step, as it would provide tissue diagnosis and help determine the tumor's characteristics, such as its histology and potential aggressiveness. This information would inform further management decisions, such as whether surgical resection (Option B) or radiofrequency ablation (Option C) may be considered. Observing and getting follow-up imaging in 3 months (Option D) would not provide sufficient information to guide management and may lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment of the tumor.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Right pleural effusion in the absence of clinically apparent ascites may be seen in advanced cirrhosis. The abdominal examination should focus on the size and consistency of the liver, on whether the spleen is palpable and hence enlarged, and on whether ascites is present. Patients with cirrhosis may have an enlarged left lobe of the liver, which is felt below the xiphoid, and an enlarged spleen. A grossly enlarged nodular liver or an obvious abdominal mass suggests malignancy. An enlarged tender liver could signify viral or alcoholic hepatitis; an infiltrative process such as amyloidosis; or, less often, an acutely congested liver secondary to right-sided heart failure. Severe right-upper-quadrant tenderness with respiratory arrest on inspiration (Murphy\u2019s sign) suggests cholecystitis. Ascites in the presence of jaundice suggests either cirrhosis or malignancy with peritoneal spread."

In dark-skinned individuals, examination of the mucous membranes below the tongue can demonstrate jaundice. Jaundice is rarely detectable if the serum bilirubin level is <43 \u03bcmol/L (2.5 mg/dL) but may remain detectable below this level during recovery from jaundice (because of protein and tissue binding of conjugated bilirubin)."

Perhaps the most reliable physical finding in the liver examination is hepatic tenderness. Discomfort when the liver is touched or pressed upon should be carefully sought with percussive comparison of the right and left upper quadrants.

            "content": "A 66-year-old obese Caucasian man presented to an academic Diabetes Center for advice regarding his diabetes treatment. His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

Ascites is best appreciated by attempts to detect shifting dullness by careful percussion. Ultrasound examination will confirm the finding of ascites in equivocal cases. Peripheral edema can occur with or without ascites. In patients with advanced liver disease, other factors frequently contribute to edema formation, including hypoalbuminemia, venous insufficiency, heart failure, and medications."

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT: The history is important in evaluating putative predisposing factors, including a history of hepatitis or jaundice, blood transfusion, or use of intravenous drugs. A family history of HCC or hepatitis should be sought and a detailed social history taken to include job descriptions for industrial exposure to possible carcinogenic drugs as well as contraceptive hormones. Physical examination should include assessing stigmata of underlying liver disease such as jaundice, ascites, peripheral edema, spider nevi, palmar erythema, and weight loss. Evaluation of the abdomen for hepatic size, masses or ascites, hepatic nodularity and tenderness, and splenomegaly is needed, as is assessment of overall performance status and psychosocial evaluation."

Simply stated, the initial step is to perform appropriate blood tests in order to determine whether the patient has an isolated elevation of serum bilirubin. If so, is the bilirubin elevation due to an increased unconjugated or conjugated fraction? If the hyperbilirubinemia is accompanied by other liver test abnormalities, is the disorder hepatocellular or cholestatic? If cholestatic, is it intraor extrahepatic? All of these questions can be answered with a thoughtful history, physical examination, and interpretation of laboratory and radiologic tests and procedures."

In previously undiagnosed patients, any of these features should prompt further evaluation to determine the presence of portal hypertension and liver disease. Varices should be identified by endoscopy. Abdominal imaging, either by computed tomography (CT) or MRI, can be helpful in demonstrating a nodular liver and in finding changes of portal hypertension with intraabdominal collateral circulation. If necessary, interventional radiologic procedures can be performed to determine wedged and free hepatic vein pressures that will allow for the calculation of a wedged-to-free gradient, which is equivalent to the portal pressure. The average normal wedged-to-free gradient is 5 mmHg, and"

Weakness, anorexia, and weight loss are also seen in advanced disease. Exam may reveal an enlarged, palpable, or firm liver. Stigmata of portal hypertension and signs of liver failure may be present (see Figures 2.6-12 and 2.6-13). Lab studies show \u2193 albumin, \u2191 PT/PTT, and \u2191 bilirubin. Anemia or thrombocytopenia (2\u00b0 to hypersplenism) may also be seen. Abdominal ultrasound with Doppler can assess liver size, the presence of ascites, and the patency of splenic and hepatic veins. The etiology of ascites can be established through measurement of the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG = serum albumin \u2013 ascites albumin); see Table 2.6-9.
