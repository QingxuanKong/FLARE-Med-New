This suggests that the patient has allergic asthma. The goal is to find an effective treatment for this patient. Let's analyze the options: Beta-2 antagonists (e.g. albuterol) are commonly used to treat bronchospasm in asthma. Histone deacetylase inhibitors are not typically used to treat asthma. Muscarinic antagonists (e.g. ipratropium) are used to treat COPD, not asthma. Anticoagulants are not typically used to treat asthma. Considering the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, a Beta-2 antagonist is the most appropriate treatment option.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

            "content": "NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKING DRUGS A 70-kg, 45-year-old single, unrestrained male driver, is involved in a motor vehicle crash. He is rushed to a nearby level 1 trauma center where he is found to have multiple facial fractures, a severe, unstable cervical spine injury, and significant left eye trauma. Further examination of his left eye reveals rupture of his globe. The ophthalmolo-gist requests emergency surgery to repair and save his eye. Because the patient has suffered a recent trauma, you decide to perform a rapid sequence intubation in preparation for the surgical procedure. What muscle relaxant would you use to facilitate tracheal intubation? What is the proper dose for your chosen muscle relaxant? After intravenous infusion of your chosen muscle relaxant, you are unable to adequately visualize the patient\u2019s larynx and vocal cords and cannot successfully pass an endotracheal tube. You switch to mask ventilation but are barely able to mask ventilate the patient, and you become worried"

            "content": "Brittle Asthma Some patients show chaotic variations in lung function despite taking appropriate therapy. Some show a persistent pattern of variability and may require oral corticosteroids or, at times, continuous infusion of \u03b22-agonists (type 1 brittle asthma), whereas others have generally normal or near-normal lung function but precipitous, unpredictable falls in lung function that may result in death (type 2 brittle asthma). These latter patients are difficult to manage because they do not respond well to corticosteroids, and the worsening of asthma does not reverse well with inhaled bronchodilators. The most effective therapy is subcutaneous epinephrine, which suggests that the worsening is likely to be a localized airway anaphylactic reaction with edema. In some of these patients, there may be allergy to specific foods. These patients should be taught to self-administer epinephrine and should carry a medical warning accordingly."

            "content": "The goals of EoE management are symptom control and the prevention of complications. Once esophageal eosinophilia is demonstrated, patients typically undergo a trial of PPI therapy as a practical means of excluding a contribution of GERD to the esophageal mucosal inflammation. PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia, characterized by elimination of mucosal eosinophilia, occurs in 30\u201350% of cases of suspected EoE. Patients with persistent symptoms and eosinophilic inflammation following PPI therapy are subsequently considered for EoE treatments such as elimination diets or swallowed topical glucocorticoids. Elemental formula diets are a highly effective therapy that have primarily been studied in children but are limited by palatability. Notably, allergy testing by means of either serum IgE or skin prick testing has demonstrated poor sensitivity and specificity in the identification of foods that incite the esophageal inflammatory response. Allergy testing combining skin prick and atopy"

The patient is afebrile and normotensive but anxious, tachycardic, and markedly tachy-pneic. Auscultation of the chest reveals diffuse wheezes. The physician provisionally makes the diagnosis of bronchial asthma and administers epinephrine by intramuscular injec-tion, improving the patient\u2019s breathing over several minutes. A normal chest X-ray is subsequently obtained, and the medical history is remarkable only for mild hypertension that is being treated with propranolol. The physician instructs the patient to discontinue use of propranolol, and changes the patient\u2019s antihypertensive medication to verapamil. Why is the physician correct to discontinue propranolol? Why is verapamil a better choice for managing hypertension in this patient? What alternative treatment change might the physi-cian consider?"
