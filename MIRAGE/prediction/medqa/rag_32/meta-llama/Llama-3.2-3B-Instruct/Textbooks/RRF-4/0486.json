They state that approximately one hour after putting their child to sleep, a \"hacking\" cough was heard from his bedroom. After entering his room the parents state their child appeared to be in distress, making a high pitched noise with every breath. Beyond a runny nose for the past few days, the child has been healthy. He has no toys in his bed or access to any other small objects. Physical exam demonstrates a 2-year-old child in respiratory distress.\n\nWhich of the following choices is the proper management for this patient?",

The child was found in respiratory distress approximately one hour after going to sleep, and the parents have no toys or small objects in the bed. This presentation suggests a possible foreign body aspiration. The child's symptoms and history suggest a possible airway obstruction, which requires immediate attention. The symptoms of a 'hacking' cough and high-pitched noise with every breath are classic signs of foreign body aspiration. The child's age and presentation also make it more likely that the foreign body is a small object, such as a coin or a button, that was placed in the mouth while the child was sleeping. The appropriate management for this patient is to perform bronchoscopy to remove the foreign body from the upper airway. This will help to relieve the airway obstruction and prevent further complications. The patient should be admitted for observation and monitoring after the procedure.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Signs of upper airway obstruction, such as labored breathing and marked suprasternal, intercostal, and subcostal retractions, may be evident on examination (see Chapter 135).

The airway collapse may cause recurrent coarse expiratory wheeze and a prolonged expiratory phase. Secretions may be retained behind the segment of malacia, predisposing to infection. Infants with severe tracheomalacia may completely collapse their tracheas during agitation, resulting in cyanotic episodes that resemble breath-holding spells. The voice is normal, as is inspiratory effort. In older children, the hallmark sign is a brassy, barky cough due to the vibration of the tracheal walls.

A more conspicuous failure comes somewhat later, when babbling fails to give way to word formation.

Speech, however, is harsh, poorly modulated, and unpleasant, and accompanied by many peculiar squeals and snorting or grunting noises.

Lateral radiograph reveals thickened and bulging epiglottis (thumb sign) and swelling of the aryepiglottic folds. The diagnosis is confirmed by direct observation of the inflamed and swollen supraglottic structures and swollen, cherry-red epiglottitis, which should be performed only in the operating room with an anesthesiologist and a competent surgeon prepared to place an endotracheal tube or perform a tracheostomy if needed. Epiglottitis requires antibiotic therapy and endotracheal intubation to maintain the airway. Clinical recovery is rapid, and most children can be extubated safely within 48 to 72 hours."

Classically thefemoral pulses are weaker and delayed compared with theright radial pulse. The blood pressure in the lower extremities is lower than that in the upper extremities. If cardiac function is poor, however, these differences may not be asapparent until appropriate resuscitation is accomplished. Inthis situation, there may be no murmur, but an S3 is often present."

Otherwise, an appropriate positive-pressure device is attached to the endotracheal tube. Air pufs are delivered at a rate of 40 to 60 per minute with a force adequate to stabilize the heart rate. In term infants, opening pressures of 30 to 40 cm H20 typically will expand the alveoli without causing barotrauma. Once the lung is inflated, less pressure is typically needed (20 to 25 cm H20). For preterm infants, pressures of 20 to 25 cm Term? Good tone? Breathing/crying? H20 are typically used. An increase in heart rate and peripheral oxygen saturation (Sp02) levels within acceptable ranges reflect a positive response."

He was recently incarcerated near Bakersfield, California and returned to Oakland about 3 months ago. He is currently experiencing one month of severe headache and double vision. He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"
