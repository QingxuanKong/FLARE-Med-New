    "question": "A 64-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus is referred to a urologist. The patient has had pain when urinating and difficulty starting a stream of urine for over 4 months now. He is bothered because he has to urinate about 9 times every day, including several times when he wakes up at night. A digital rectal examination revealed multiple hard nodules in the prostate gland. A CT scan shows a nodule in the right lung that measures 3 cm. An ultrasound scan of his urinary bladder and prostate shows residual urine of > 200 mL and heterogeneous findings of the prostate gland. Biopsy reveals grade 2 prostate adenocarcinoma. Follow-up 9 months later shows his prostate cancer is well controlled with goserelin. If one considers pulmonary nodules that are the same size as this patient\u2019s, which of the following additional findings on CT scans would most likely prompt the removal of such nodules?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we first need to understand the context of the patient's condition and the characteristics of pulmonary nodules that warrant removal. The patient has prostate cancer that is well-controlled with goserelin, and a CT scan shows a 3 cm nodule in the right lung. To determine which additional findings on CT scans would most likely prompt the removal of such nodules, we need to consider the characteristics of pulmonary nodules that are similar in size to the patient's nodule and are associated with a higher risk of malignancy. The options provided are 'Popcorn' pattern, subsolid component, extending fine striations, and doubling time of < 1 month. We should consider the following: The 'Popcorn' pattern is a characteristic of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, which is a type of lung cancer that is more common in non-smokers and is often associated with genetic mutations. Subsolid components refer to small, solid areas within a larger nodule that may indicate malignancy. Extending fine striations are a sign of invasive adenocarcinoma. A doubling time of less than 1 month is a rapid growth rate that is often associated with malignancy. Given these characteristics, the most likely finding that would prompt the removal of a pulmonary nodule similar in size to the patient's nodule would be a subsolid component, as it indicates a higher risk of malignancy and may require further evaluation and possible removal to rule out lung cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

In addition, many men with PSA levels below this cut point harbor cancer cells in their prostate. Information from the PCPT demonstrates that there is no PSA below which the risk of prostate cancer is zero. Thus, the PSA level establishes the likelihood that a man will harbor cancer if he undergoes a prostate biopsy. The goal is to increase the sensitivity of the test for younger men more likely to die of the disease and to reduce the frequency of detecting cancers of low malignant potential in elderly men more likely to die of other causes.

            "content": "Active Surveillance Although prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer affecting men in the United States, patients are being diagnosed earlier and more frequently present with early-stage disease. Active surveillance, described previously as watchful waiting or deferred therapy, is the policy of monitoring the illness at fixed intervals with DREs, PSA measurements, and repeat prostate biopsies as indicated until histopathologic or serologic changes correlative of progression warrant treatment with curative intent. It evolved from studies that evaluated predominantly elderly men with well-differentiated tumors who demonstrated no clinically significant progression for protracted periods, recognition of the contrast between incidence and disease-specific mortality, the high prevalence of autopsy cancers, and an effort to reduce overtreatment. A recent screening study estimated that between 50\u2013100 men with low-risk disease would need to be treated to prevent one prostate"

Serial AUASI is particularly useful in following patients as they are treated with various forms of therapy. Asymptomatic patients do not require treatment regardless of the size of the gland, whereas patients with an inability to urinate, gross hematuria, recurrent infection, or bladder stones may require surgery. In patients with 587 symptoms, uroflowmetry can identify those with normal flow rates who are unlikely to benefit from treatment, and bladder ultrasound can identify those with high postvoid residuals who may need intervention. Pressure-flow (urodynamic) studies detect primary bladder dysfunction. Cystoscopy is recommended if hematuria is documented and to assess the urinary outflow tract before surgery. Imaging of the"

He has hypertension, and during the last 8 years, he has been adequately managed with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH\u2019s problem?

On follow-up the patient had no complications. A 25-year-old man complained of significant swelling in front of his right ear before and around mealtimes. This swelling was associated with considerable pain, which was provoked by the ingestion of lemon sweets. On examination he had tenderness around the right parotid region and a hard nodule was demonstrated in the buccal mucosa adjacent to the right upper molar teeth. A diagnosis of parotid duct calculus was made."

A difficulty with predicting the risk of metastatic spread, symptoms, or death from disease in the rising PSA state is that most patients receive some form of therapy before the development of metastases. Nevertheless, predictive models continue to be refined. METASTATIC DISEASE: NONCASTRATE The state of noncastrate metastatic prostate cancer includes men with metastases visible on an imaging study and noncastrate levels of testosterone (>150 ng/dL). The patient may be newly diagnosed or have a recurrence after treatment for localized disease. Symptoms of metastatic disease include pain from osseous spread, although many patients are asymptomatic despite extensive spread. Less common are symptoms related to marrow compromise (myelophthisis), spinal cord compression, or a coagulopathy."
