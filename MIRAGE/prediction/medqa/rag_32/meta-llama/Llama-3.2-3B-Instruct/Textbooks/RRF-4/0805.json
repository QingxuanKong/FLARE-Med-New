The pelvic speculum examination in the lithotomy position shows a pink structure at the vaginal introitus that protrudes from the anterior vaginal wall when the patient is asked to cough. This suggests a prolapse of the bladder into the vagina. The most common type of pelvic organ prolapse is a cystocele, which is a bulging of the bladder into the vagina. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings are more consistent with a cystocele. The patient's age and symptoms are also consistent with a cystocele, which is a common condition in older women. The other options, vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma, rectocele, and uterine leiomyomata, are less likely to present with these symptoms and examination findings. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a cystocele.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Advanced pelvic organ prolapse may contribute to urinary retention, but it is unlikely that prolapse above the level of the vaginal introitus will be the sole cause of retention. When in doubt, the woman can wear a pessary for a week to see whether elevating the prolapse reduces the voiding difficulty. Occasionally pelvic masses\u2014in particular, low anterior myomas\u2014may cause urinary retention. Abnormal findings detected during neurologic examination of the perineum and lower extremities may suggest the need to focus on the spine. Urodynamic evaluation will help determine whether the woman has an obstruction (manifested by high detrusor pressures during voiding or by no urethral relaxation during voiding) or whether the detrusor muscle is not contracting. The latter is not necessarily indicative of a neurogenic disorder in women, because a large minority of normal healthy women void by"

The clinician should use a dry glove to better grasp the pessary and water-soluble lubricants as needed. The size of the pessary is estimated after a digital examination and use of ring forceps to reduce the prolapse or bladder neck. Once the approximate size is determined, the appropriate type is selected based on the patient\u2019s needs and activity level. When fitted, the patient is asked to stand, perform Valsalva, and cough to ensure the pessary is retained. The pessary should be assessed to ensure it is providing the desired support and leakage control. The patient should be able to void with the pessary in place before leaving the office. Proper size is ensured by the ability to sweep the index finger between the pessary and the vaginal wall. The patient should feel comfortable with the pessary in place."

            "content": "Routine urinary cytology is not helpful, but testing may be of value in women older than 50 years with irritative urinary tract symptoms, particularly if those symptoms are of sudden onset. Postvoid Residual Volume Incomplete bladder emptying may cause incontinence. Patients with a large postvoid residual (PVR) urine volume have a diminished functional bladder capacity because of the dead space occupied in the bladder by retained urine. This stagnant pool of urine is a source of urinary tract infections because the major defense of the bladder against infection is frequent, nearly complete emptying."

Am J Obstet Gynecol 1996;175:13, with permission. Pelvic muscle function should be assessed during the pelvic examination. Following bimanual examination with the patient in the lithotomy position, the examiner can palpate the puborectalis and pubococcygeus muscles inside the hymen along the pelvic sidewalls at approximately the 4 and 8 o\u2019clock positions. One can appreciate basal muscle tone and whether there is increased tone with contraction as well as strength, duration, and symmetry of contraction (26). A recto-vaginal examination should also be performed to assess basal and contraction muscle tone of the anal sphincter complex."

            "content": "Pelvic congestion affects women of reproductive age. Typical symptoms include bilateral lower abdominal and back pain that is increased with standing for long periods, secondary dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, abnormal uterine bleeding, chronic fatigue, and irritable bowel symptoms (97). Pain usually begins with ovulation and lasts until the end of menses. The uterus is often bulky, and the ovaries are enlarged with multiple functional cysts. The uterus, parametria, and uterosacral ligaments are tender. Transuterine venography is the primary method for diagnosis, although other modalities, such as pelvic ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and laparoscopy, may disclose varicosities (93). Because of the cost and possible side effects of treatment, further management should be based on related symptoms and not simply on the presence of varicosities."

Sometimes the physician can do this; it depends entirely on the amount of anxiety and apprehension the woman retains. The number of false-positive findings for allodynia can be limited if the patient touches the rim of the vaginal opening. Provoked vestibulodynia or other gynecologic findings should be treated. 8. Once the patient is able to use larger inserts, the following steps can be undertaken: a. Encourage the woman to allow her partner to assist her in placing the insert in her vagina. b. Encourage the couple during their sexual times to brie\ufb02y use the insert\u2014to prove to her that the insert will still go in when her body is physiologically aroused. c."
