However, among patients with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3, no relationship was found between DLBCL risk and cART adherence (RR = 0.96, p = 0.36).

The study found that cART adherence was a significant predictor of DLBCL risk (RR = 0.52, p = 0.01) in patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3, but not in patients with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3 (RR = 0.96, p = 0.36). This suggests that the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk may be influenced by the level of immunosuppression. In other words, the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk may be modified by the level of CD4+ T lymphocyte count. This is an example of effect modification. To confirm this, we need to consider the definition of effect modification. Effect modification occurs when the effect of a risk factor on an outcome differs depending on the level of another variable. In this case, the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk may be different in patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3 compared to those with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3. The other options are not supported by the data. Poor generalizability refers to the extent to which the results of a study can be applied to other populations. While the study may have limitations, there is no indication that the results are not generalizable. Stratified sampling is a research design, not a explanation for the difference observed in the study. Random error refers to random fluctuations in the data that can affect the results, but it does not explain the pattern of effect modification observed in the study. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Effect modification.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

In this regard, the degree and duration of decline of CD4+ T cells at the time of initiation of therapy is an important predictor of the restoration of these cells. A person who maintains a very low CD4+ T cell count for a considerable period of time before the initiation of cART almost invariably has an incomplete reconstitution of such cells. At least two major mechanisms may contribute to the failure of the CD4+ T cell pool to reconstitute itself adequately over the course of HIV infection.

            "content": "Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), once the hallmark of AIDS, has dramatically declined in incidence following the development of effective prophylactic regimens and the widespread use of cART. It is, however, still the single most common cause of pneumonia in patients with HIV infection in the United States and can be identified as a likely etiologic agent in 25% of cases of pneumonia in patients with HIV infection, with an incidence in the range of 2\u20133 cases per 100 person-years. Approximately 50% of cases of HIV-associated PCP occur in patients who are unaware of their HIV status. The risk of PCP is greatest among those who have experienced a previous bout of PCP and those who have CD4+ T cell counts of <200/\u03bcL. Overall, 79% of patients with PCP have CD4+ T cell counts <100/\u03bcL and 95% of patients have CD4+ T cell counts <200/\u03bcL. Recurrent fever, night sweats, thrush, and unexplained weight loss also are associated with an increased incidence of PCP. For these reasons, it is strongly"

            "content": "The CD4+ T cell count often is useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis. As a rule of thumb, bacterial and tubercular infections occur with mildly suppressed CD4+ counts (more than 200 cells/\u00b5L); Pneumocystis pneumonia usually occurs at CD4+ T cell counts below 200 cells/\u00b5L, while CMV and M. avium complex infections are uncommon until the very late stages of the disease (CD4+ T cell counts below 50 cells/\u00b5L). Finally, an important point is that pulmonary disease in HIV-infected individuals may result from more than one cause, and that even common pathogens may be responsible for disease with atypical manifestations."

For these reasons, it is strongly recommended that all patients with CD4+ T cell counts <200/\u03bcL (or a CD4 percentage <15) receive some form of PCP prophylaxis. The incidence of PCP is approaching zero in patients with known HIV infection receiving appropriate cART and prophylaxis. In the United States, primary PCP is now occurring at a median CD4+ T cell count of 36/ \u03bcL, while secondary PCP is occurring at a median CD4+ T cell count of 10/\u03bcL. Patients with PCP generally present with fever and a cough that is usually nonproductive or productive of only scant amounts of white sputum. They may complain of a characteristic retrosternal chest pain that is worse on inspiration and is described as sharp or burning. HIV-associated PCP may have an indolent course characterized by weeks of vague symptoms and should be included in"

Initiation of therapy is recommended for all children 1 to 5 years of age with AIDS or significant HIV-related symptoms or CD4 below 25% (clinical category C or most clinical category B) regardless of symptoms or HIV RNA level. For children older than 5 years with AIDS or significant HIV-related symptoms, CD4 count below 350/mm3 should be treated. Indications for treatment of adolescents and adults include CD4 cell count less than 200 to 350/mm3 or plasma HIV RNA levels above 55,000 copies/mL. Combination therapy with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is recommended based on the risk of disease progression as determined by CD4 percentage or count and plasma HIV RNA copy number; the potential benefits"

            "content": "The most effective method for preventing PCP is to eliminate the cause of immunosuppression by withdrawing immunosuppressive therapy or treating the underlying cause, e.g., HIV infection. Patients who are susceptible to PCP benefit from chemoprophylaxis during the period of susceptibility. For patients with HIV infection, CD4+ T cell counts are a reliable marker of susceptibility, and counts below 200 cells/\u03bcL are an indication to start prophylaxis (Table 244-2). For patients with HIV infection who are not receiving ART, oral candidiasis or prior PCP also is an indication for chemoprophylaxis, regardless of CD4+ T cell count. For such patients not receiving ART, any prior episode of an AIDS-defining illness or pneumonia should encourage the use of chemoprophylaxis. However, patients who are not adherent to ART are not likely to take PCP chemoprophylaxis."
