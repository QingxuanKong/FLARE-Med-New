Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

            "content": "Hyperthyroidism Clinically evident hyperthyroidism was observed in 7% of patients with a complete molar gestation. These women may have tachycardia, warm skin, and tremor, and the diagnosis can be confirmed by detection of elevated serum levels of free thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3). Clinical evidence of hyperthyroidism with complete mole is rare. Anesthesia or surgery may precipitate thyroid storm. Thus, if hyperthyroidism is suspected before the induction of anesthesia for molar evacuation, \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered. Thyroid storm may be manifested by hyperthermia, delirium, convulsions, tachycardia, high-output heart failure, or cardiovascular collapse. Administration of \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agents prevents or rapidly reverses many of the metabolic and cardiovascular complications of thyroid storm. After molar evacuation, thyroid function test results rapidly return to normal."

Meconium staining of the umbilical cord, nails, and skin suggest fetal distress and the possibility of aspiration pneumonia. The level of spontaneous activity, passive muscle tone, quality of the cry, and apnea are useful screening signs to evaluate the state of the nervous system. The examination should proceed with an assessment of vital signs, particularly heart rate (normal rate, 120 to 160 beats/min); respiratory rate (normal rate, 30 to 60 breaths/min); temperature (usually done per rectum and later as an axillary measurement); and blood pressure (often reserved for sick infants). Length, weight, and head circumference should be measured and plotted on growth curves to determine whether growth is normal, accelerated, or retarded for the specific gestational age."

The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists accepted these recommendations for TSH testing (374). Because of the (i) potentially significant neurologic affects on the fetus and other adverse pregnancy events; (ii) physiologic rise in TBG and the TSH-like activity of hCG in pregnancy, and (iii) potential for the targeted screening groups to have overt or subclinical hypothyroidism defined by the reference ranges for pregnancy (TSH <2.5, 3.1, and 3.5 \u03bcIU/mL for the first, second, and third trimesters, respectively), targeted maternal"

There may be FIGURE 405-10 Clinical course of subacute thyroiditis. The release of thyroid hormones is initially associated with a thyrotoxic phase and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). A hypothyroid phase then ensues, with low T4 and TSH levels that are initially low but gradually increase. During the recovery phase, increased TSH levels combined with resolution of thyroid follicular injury lead to normalization of thyroid function, often several months after the beginning of the illness.

The ultrasensitive TSH assay has become the most sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of hyperand hypo-thyroidism and for optimizing T4 therapy.Total T4 (Reference Range 55\u2013150 nmol/L) and T3 (Reference Range 1.5\u20133.5 nmol/L) Total T4 and T3 levels are measured by radioimmunoassay and measure both the free and bound components of the hormones. Total T4 levels reflect the output from the thyroid gland, whereas T3 levels in the nonstimulated thyroid gland are more indicative of peripheral thyroid hor-mone metabolism, and are, therefore, not generally suitable as a general screening test. Total T4 levels are increased not only in hyperthyroid patients, but also in those with elevated Tg levels secondary to pregnancy, estrogen/progesterone use, or congeni-tal diseases. Similarly, total T4 levels decrease in hypothyroidism and in patients with decreased Tg"
