    "question": "A 48-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of lightheadedness, intermittent headaches, and easy bruising. Five months ago, she was treated for an episode of thrombophlebitis. Physical examination shows multiple bruises on her limbs. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 900,000/mm3 and elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid. Treatment with a medication is begun that is also used in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the beneficial effect of this drug in sickle cell disease?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to understand the relationship between the patient's symptoms and the treatment for sickle cell disease. The patient presents with lightheadedness, intermittent headaches, easy bruising, thrombophlebitis, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid levels. These symptoms are consistent with a condition known as sickle cell crisis. The treatment for sickle cell crisis often involves medications that reduce the frequency and severity of these episodes. One such medication is hydroxyurea, which is also used in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Hydroxyurea works by increasing fetal hemoglobin production, which can reduce the frequency and severity of sickle cell crises. The other options are not directly related to the mechanism of action of hydroxyurea in sickle cell disease. Inhibition of thrombocyte aggregation is a mechanism of action for medications such as aspirin, not hydroxyurea. Inhibition of stem cell differentiation is a mechanism of action for some chemotherapeutic agents, not hydroxyurea. Restoration of the body's iron stores is not a known mechanism of action for hydroxyurea. Therefore, the correct answer is B, increase in circulating fetal hemoglobin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Diagnosis is confirmed by hemoglobin electrophoresis, mass spectroscopy, and the sickling tests already discussed. Thorough characterization of the exact hemoglobin profile of the patient is important, because sickle thalassemia and hemoglobin SC disease have distinct prognoses or clinical features. Diagnosis is usually established in childhood, but occasional patients, often with compound heterozygous states, do not develop symptoms until the onset of puberty, pregnancy, or early adult life. Genotyping of family members and potential parental partners is critical for genetic counseling. Details of the childhood history establish prognosis and need for aggressive or experimental therapies.

They presented with recurrent cerebral and systemic thrombotic episodes, often of minor degree and transient. Cytapheresis, to reduce the platelets, and antiplatelet drugs (hydroxyurea anagrelide) to suppress megakaryocyte formation, are helpful in ameliorating the neurologic symptoms. In one of the cases we followed, several small lesions, presumably infarctions, were situated in the white matter and simulated multiple sclerosis.

Some patients remain virtually asymptomatic into or even through adult life, while others suffer repeated crises requiring hospitalization from early childhood. Patients with sickle thalassemia and sickle-HbE tend to have similar, slightly milder symptoms, perhaps because of the ameliorating effects of production of other hemoglobins within the RBC. Hemoglobin SC disease, one of the more common variants of sickle cell anemia, is frequently marked by lesser degrees of hemolytic anemia and a greater propensity for the development of retinopathy and aseptic necrosis of bones. In most respects, however, the clinical manifestations resemble sickle cell anemia. Some rare hemoglobin variants actually aggravate the sickling phenomenon."

In addition, sickle cell disease is associated with bone infarction resulting from vaso-occlusion secondary to the sickling of red cells. Bone infarction also occurs in hemoglobin sickle cell disease and sickle cell thalassemia (Chap. 127). The bone pain in sickle cell crisis is due to infarction of bone and bone marrow. In children, infarction of the epiphyseal growth plate interferes with normal growth of the affected extremity.

            "content": "Uncontrolled erythrocytosis causes hyperviscosity, leading to neurologic symptoms such as vertigo, tinnitus, headache, visual disturbances, and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). Systolic hypertension is also a feature of the red cell mass elevation. In some patients, venous or arterial thrombosis may be the presenting manifestation of PV. Any vessel can be affected; but cerebral, cardiac, or mesenteric vessels are most commonly involved. Intraabdominal venous thrombosis is particularly common in young women and may be catastrophic if a sudden and complete obstruction of the hepatic vein occurs. Indeed, PV should be suspected in any patient who develops hepatic vein thrombosis. Digital ischemia, easy bruising, epistaxis, acid-peptic disease, or gastrointestinal hemorrhage may occur due to vascular stasis or thrombocytosis. Erythema, burning, and pain in the extremities, a symptom complex known as erythromelalgia, are other complications of the thrombocytosis of PV due to increased"

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

These episodes now occur almost nightly and are interfering with her ability to teach.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

            "content": "Granulocytosis is common. The white count can fluctuate substantially and unpredictably during and between painful crises, infectious episodes, and other intercurrent illnesses. Vasoocclusion causes protean manifestations. Intermittent episodes of vasoocclusion in connective and musculoskeletal structures produce ischemia manifested by acute pain and tenderness, fever, tachycardia, and anxiety. These recurrent episodes, called painful crises, are the most common clinical manifestation. Their frequency and severity vary greatly. Pain can develop almost anywhere in the body and may last from a few hours to 2 weeks. Repeated crises requiring hospitalization (>3 episodes per year) correlate with reduced survival in adult life, suggesting that these episodes are associated with accumulation of chronic end-organ damage. Provocative factors include infection, fever, excessive exercise, anxiety, abrupt changes in temperature, hypoxia, or hypertonic dyes."
