He weighed 3005 g (6 lb, 10 oz) at birth and currently weighs 2835 g (6 lb, 4 oz). He has been latching on and breastfeeding well since birth. His mother has a history of Graves' disease and underwent near-total thyroidectomy in the second trimester of her pregnancy after her symptoms could not be controlled with antithyroid drugs. She is currently receiving L-thyroxine therapy. The patient's temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102\u00b0F), pulse is 176/min, and respirations are 42/min. He appears irritable. Examination shows a diaphoretic infant with a paucity of subcutaneous fat. There is swelling of the neck at the midline. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to consider the clinical presentation of the newborn and the mother's medical history. The key details are: the newborn was born at 38 weeks' gestation via normal vaginal delivery, weighing 3005 g at birth and currently 2835 g, has been latching and breastfeeding well since birth, the mother has a history of Graves' disease and underwent near-total thyroidectomy in the second trimester, and the newborn presents with poor weight gain, fever, tachycardia, diaphoresis, paucity of subcutaneous fat, and swelling of the neck at the midline. The most likely cause of this presentation is related to the mother's thyroid status and the potential for transplacental passage of antibodies or hormones. Given that the mother has a history of Graves' disease and underwent thyroidectomy, it is possible that she may have developed TSH receptor antibodies, which can stimulate the fetal thyroid and cause hyperthyroidism in the newborn. This is a well-known phenomenon known as transient neonatal hypothyroidism due to maternal thyroid disease (TNHTD). The symptoms presented by the newborn, such as poor weight gain, fever, and swelling of the neck, are consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely cause of the newborn's presentation is transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies from the mother.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Because administration of thyroid hormone will prevent this, by state law, all newborns are tested for high serum levels ofTSH (Chap. 32, p. 614). Immediately after birth, thyroid function and metabolism undergo major change. Cooling to room temperature evokes sudden and marked increase in TSH secretion. his in turn causes a progressive increase in serum T 4 levels that are maximal 24 to 36 hours after birth. here are nearly simultaneous eleva tions of serum T levels."

The most common GI symptoms include increased frequency of bowel movements and diarrhea. Female patients often develop amenorrhea, decreased fertility, and an increased incidence of miscarriages. Children experience rapid growth with early bone maturation, whereas older patients may present with cardiovas-cular complications such as atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure.On physical examination, weight loss and facial flush-ing may be evident. The skin is warm and moist, and African American patients often note darkening of their skin. Tachycar-dia or atrial fibrillation is present, with cutaneous vasodilation leading to a widening of the pulse pressure and a rapid falloff in the transmitted pulse"

For example, the percentage of fetuses born in 2009 whose birthweight exceeded 4000 g was 8.2 percent at 37 to 41 weeks and increased to 11.0 percent at 42 weeks or more (Martin, 2011).

Although there are theoretical neurological implications, reports of adverse fetal efects seem to have been exaggerated. Available data indicate that thionamides carry an extremely small risk for causing neonatal hypothyroidism (Momotani, 1997; O'Doherty, 1999). For example, in at least 239 treated thyrotoxic women shown in Table 58-1, evidence of hypothyroidism was found in only four newborns. Furthermore, at least four long-term studies report no abnormal intellectual and physical development of these children (Mestman, 1998). If maternal hypothyroidism developed, the fetus can be treated by a reduced maternal antithyroid medication dose and injections of intraamnionic thyroxine if necessary."
