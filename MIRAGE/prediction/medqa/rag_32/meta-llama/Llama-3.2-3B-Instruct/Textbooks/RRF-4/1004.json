    "question": "A 66-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to a productive cough. His cough has been increasing in frequency and severity over the course of 3 days, and his sputum production has increased in volume. The color of his sputum is yellow-green. He denies any chest pain or palpitations but has experienced worsening shortness of breath with exertion and at rest, which is above his baseline. He has not noticed any changes in his weight or edema in his lower extremities. He denies any recent history of long travel. Medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has been hospitalized four times for similar symptoms within the last year. He has smoked approximately 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 45 years. His temperature is 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/94 mmHg, pulse is 101/min, and respirations are 26/min with an oxygen saturation of 85% on room air. On physical exam, the patient has difficulty speaking, and there is asynchronous motion between the chest and abdomen with respiration. Wheezing is appreciated on pulmonary auscultation. An ECG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm. A chest radiograph is obtained, and he is administered supplemental oxygen. He is started on ipratropium, albuterol, and methylprednisolone. Which of the following should be added to this patient's treatment regimen?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a productive cough, yellow-green sputum, and worsening shortness of breath with exertion and at rest, which are classic symptoms of a respiratory infection. The patient's medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and COPD, as well as his recent hospitalizations for similar symptoms, suggest that he may be at risk for a severe respiratory infection. The patient's oxygen saturation is low at 85% on room air, indicating hypoxemia, which is a concerning sign. The patient's difficulty speaking and asynchronous motion between the chest and abdomen with respiration also suggest that the infection may be affecting the respiratory muscles or the diaphragm. The ECG shows normal sinus rhythm, but the chest radiograph is not yet available. The patient is already started on ipratropium, albuterol, and methylprednisolone, which are appropriate treatments for COPD exacerbation. However, given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the risk of respiratory failure, additional antimicrobial coverage should be added to the treatment regimen. The patient's yellow-green sputum production is suggestive of a bacterial infection, and the patient's recent hospitalizations for similar symptoms suggest that he may be at risk for a severe respiratory infection. Therefore, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers a range of bacterial pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, should be added to the treatment regimen. Ceftriaxone is a suitable choice for this patient, as it is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic that is effective against a range of bacterial pathogens and can be used in patients with COPD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

In severe exacerbations, patients may be so breathless that they are unable to complete sentences and may become cyanotic. Examination usually shows increased ventilation, hyperinflation, and tachycardia. Pulsus paradoxus may be present, but this is rarely a useful clinical sign. There is a marked fall in spirometric values and PEF. Arterial blood gases on air show hypoxemia, and PCO2 is usually low due to hyperventilation. A normal or rising PCO2 is an indication of impending respiratory failure and requires immediate monitoring and therapy. A chest roentgenogram is not usually informative but may show pneumonia or pneumothorax."

The physical examination in cardiogenic pulmonary edema is notable for evidence of increased intracardiac pressures (S3 gallop, elevated jugular venous pulse, peripheral edema) and rales and/or wheezes on auscultation of the chest. In contrast, the physical examination in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is dominated by the findings of the precipitating condition; pulmonary findings may be relatively normal in the early stages. The chest radiograph in cardiogenic pulmonary edema typically shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette, vascular redistribution, interstitial thickening, and perihilar alveolar infiltrates; pleural effusions are common. In noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, heart size is normal, alveolar infiltrates are distributed more uniformly throughout the lungs, and pleural effusions are uncommon."

For this reason, clinicians must take care not to attribute all wheezing to asthma. Rhonchi are a manifestation of obstruction of medium-sized airways, most often with secretions. In the acute setting, this manifestation may be a sign of viral or bacterial bronchitis. Chronic rhonchi suggest bronchiectasis or COPD.

A careful history, however, usually reveals the presence of symptoms prior to the acute exacerbation.

It is best elicited by a careful history focused on typical physical activities and how the patient\u2019s ability to perform them has changed.

The patient should be asked about fever; change in character of sputum; any ill contacts; and associated symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias, and chills. Inquiring about the frequency and severity of prior exacerbations can provide important information."

He is then switched to celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily, and on this regimen his joint symptoms and heartburn resolve. Two years later, he returns with increased joint symptoms. His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor. With the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, he is started on a regimen"

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

            "content": "Cough generally indicates disease of the respiratory system. The clinician should inquire about the duration of the cough, whether or not it is associated with sputum production, and any specific triggers that induce it. Acute cough productive of phlegm is often a symptom of infection of the respiratory system, including processes affecting the upper airway (e.g., sinusitis, tracheitis), the lower airways (e.g., bronchitis, bronchiectasis), and the lung parenchyma (e.g., pneumonia). Both the quantity and quality of the sputum, including whether it is blood-streaked or frankly bloody, should be determined. Hemoptysis warrants an evaluation as delineated in Chap. 48."

A chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a right 2.8 \u00d7 1.6 cm infrahilar mass and postobstructive pneumonia. The patient was an active smoker. Past medical history was notable for laryngeal carcinoma treated 15 years prior with radiation therapy, renal cell carcinoma, peripheral vascular disease, and hypothyroidism. On review of systems, he denied headache, nausea, and vomiting. He had chronic hip pain, managed with acetaminophen with codeine.

Inquire about a history of COPD, interstitial lung disease, heart disease, sickle cell anemia, emphysema, and pulmonary emboli. Exam reveals a loud, palpable S2 (often split), a systolic ejection murmur, an S4, or a parasternal heave. CXR shows enlargement of central pulmonary arteries. ECG demonstrates RVH. Echocardiogram and right heart catheterization may show signs of right ventricular overload and may aid in the diagnosis of the underlying cause. Supplemental O2, anticoagulation, vasodilators, and diuretics if symptoms of right-sided CHF are present. Treat underlying causes of 2\u00b0 pulmonary hypertension. Causes of pulmonary hypertension include left heart failure, mitral valve disease, and \u2191 resistance in the pulmonary veins, including hypoxic vasoconstriction."
