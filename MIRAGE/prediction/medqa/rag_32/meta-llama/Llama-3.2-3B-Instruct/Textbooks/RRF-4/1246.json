Her laboratory results show elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone levels, which are indicative of hyperandrogenism. The patient's symptoms and lab results are suggestive of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age and is often associated with insulin resistance, obesity, and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Given the patient's BMI of 25.3 kg/m2, she is at risk for developing these comorbidities. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in screening for comorbidities in this patient is to measure her blood glucose and cholesterol levels to assess for insulin resistance and lipid profile, which are common comorbidities in PCOS patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Because circulating levels of estrogens are not diminished in PCOS and androgen levels are only mildly elevated, affected girls become both feminized and masculinized at puberty. This is an important feature because girls with classic forms of CAH who do not experience precocious puberty (and even those who do) only become masculinized at puberty (i.e., they do not develop breasts). 6."

To assess the symptoms, serum and urine tests for androgens and their metabolites should be obtained along with modern abdominal imaging techniques such as CT, MRI, and ultrasound scans (194). In prepubertal girls, virilizing tumors may cause signs of heterosexual precocious puberty in addition to hirsutism, acne, and virilization.

In girls the estrogeneffect manifests as breast development, uterine increase,and, eventually, menarche. Both boys and girls manifest the androgen effect as adult body odor, pubic and axillary hair,and facial skin oiliness and acne. In boys it is also importantto note whether the testes are enlarged more than 2.5 cm inlength (4 mL volume), which implies gonadarche. If the testes are not enlarged but virilization is progressing, the source of the androgens may be the adrenal glands or exogenous sources."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

            "content": "Girls with secondary amenorrhea have secondary sexual characteristics. The most common causes are pregnancy, anorexia/stress (low LH, FSH, and estradiol), and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In PCOS there may be symptoms of androgen excess, such as acne and hirsutism, and weight gain and, with insulin resistance, acanthosis. If hirsutism or virilization is present, free and total testosterone, androstenedione, and dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate should be measured to rule out ovarian or adrenal tumors. A normal 17-hydroxyprogesterone level rules out late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia. PCOS is diagnosed with two of the following: infrequent menstrual bleeding or secondary amenorrhea, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and polycystic morphology of ovaries on ultrasound. Estradiol may be normal or low; and androgens, including dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate, may be elevated, although not to the extent that a tumor produces. Patients may have impaired glucose tolerance or"

A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative."

            "content": "All other frequently encountered manifestations offer less consistent findings and therefore qualify only as minor diagnostic criteria for PCOS. They include elevated LH-to-FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) ratio, insulin resistance, perimenarchal onset of hirsutism, and obesity. Clinical hyperandrogenism includes hirsutism, male pattern alopecia, and acne (19). Hirsutism occurs in approximately 70% of patients with PCOS in the United States and in only 10% to 20% of patients with PCOS in Japan (20,21). A likely explanation for this discrepancy is the genetically determined differences in skin 5\u03b1-reductase activity (22,23). Nonclassic adrenal hyperplasia and PCOS may present with similar clinical features. It is important to measure the basal follicular phase 17-hydroxyprogesterone level in all women presenting Table 31.4 Revised Diagnostic Criteria of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome 1. 2. Clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism and exclusion of other etiologies."

Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"
