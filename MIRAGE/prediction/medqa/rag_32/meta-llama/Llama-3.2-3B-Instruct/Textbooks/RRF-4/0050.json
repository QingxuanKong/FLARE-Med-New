As a result, the major role of radiation therapy in patients has been palliation of pain. Radiation therapy alone after a complete resection does not prolong survival. In the setting of surgically unresectable disease limited to the epigastrium, patients treated with 3500\u20134000 cGy did not live longer than similar patients not receiving radiotherapy; however, survival was prolonged slightly when 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus leucovorin was given in combination with radiation therapy (3-year survival 50% vs 41% for radiation therapy alone). In this clinical setting, the 5-FU likely functions as a radiosensitizer."

This technique uses computer-generated algorithms that accurately distinguish between target treatment volumes and normal tissue. The radiation beam intensity is modulated to optimize the delivery of radiation to the specified treatment volume while sparing adjacent normal tissue. The result appears to be much more accurate treatment of the tumor with minimal toxicity. Emphasizing this point is a study in 40 gynecologic cancer patients in which IMRT was used. Excellent coverage of the planned treatment volume was obtained, with no patient suffering grade 3 toxicity, and only 60% of patients suffering grade 2 toxicity, compared with a historical rate of 90% toxicity with conventional techniques (120). This technique is especially promising for treating cervical cancer because it allows higher doses to be delivered much more precisely,"

It is important to note, however, that many European centers utilize a \u201cshort course\u201d preoperative radiation regimen consisting of 5 days of radia-tion followed by surgery within 1 to 2 weeks. At present, these modalities have not been compared in any randomized, prospec-tive trial.125,127With advances in chemoradiation, an increasing number pf patients with locally advanced rectal cancer will have com-plete shrinkage of their tumor (a clinical complete response; cCR). In light of the potential morbidity of proctectomy, it has been suggested that select patients can be managed nonopera-tively (\u201cwatch and wait\u201d). However, data from current stud-ies are contradictory and concern"
