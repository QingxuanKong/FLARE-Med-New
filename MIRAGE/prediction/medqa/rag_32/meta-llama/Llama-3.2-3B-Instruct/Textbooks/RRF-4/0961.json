    "question": "A 20-year-old woman comes to the clinic for her first follow-up visit after being diagnosed with bipolar I disorder 1-month ago. At that time, she was acutely severely manic and was brought to the emergency department by her concerned boyfriend. She was started on lithium, and after subsequent improvement, she was discharged. A week after discharge, the patient forgot to take her medication for a few days and quickly began to manifest manic symptoms again which required brought her to the emergency department again. Since then, she has been compliant with her medications and currently has no significant complaints. Which of the following recommendations would be most helpful in minimizing the risk to the fetus in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Adjust dosage of medication throughout the pregnancy",
        "B": "Supplement all patients with 5mg of daily folic acid",
        "C": "Low-dose polytherapy is preferred over monotherapy",
        "D": "Switch to valproate as it has safest pregnancy profile"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has been diagnosed with bipolar I disorder and has a history of manic episodes. She is currently pregnant and is concerned about the risk to the fetus. The patient's medication regimen should be evaluated in this context. Lithium is generally considered safe during pregnancy, but its use requires careful monitoring. Valproate, on the other hand, is associated with a higher risk of birth defects and should be avoided if possible. The patient's compliance with medication is good, so adjusting the dosage of her current medication (lithium) throughout the pregnancy may be a reasonable option. Supplementing with folic acid is recommended for all pregnant women, regardless of the risk of birth defects associated with certain medications. Low-dose polytherapy is not necessarily preferred over monotherapy in this case, as it may increase the risk of side effects and interactions. Switching to valproate is not recommended due to its higher risk of birth defects. Therefore, the most helpful recommendation would be to adjust the dosage of lithium throughout the pregnancy to minimize the risk to the fetus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

It can be particularly difficult to arrest the condition before it progresses to full-blown mania. Acute mania is a life-threatening condition; without treatment, patients fail to maintain essential sleep and nutrition levels and literally exhaust themselves with frantic activity.

            "content": "The recurrent nature of bipolar mood disorder necessitates maintenance treatment. A sustained blood lithium level of at least 0.8 meq/L is important for optimal prophylaxis and has been shown to reduce the risk of suicide, a finding not yet apparent for other mood stabilizers. Combinations of mood stabilizers together or with atypical antipsychotic drugs are sometimes required to maintain mood stability. Quetiapine extended release, olanzapine, risperidone, and lamotrigine have been approved for maintenance treatment as sole agents, in combination with lithium and with aripiprazole and ziprasidone as adjunctive drugs. Lurasidone, olanzapine/fluoxetine, and quetiapine are also approved to treat acute depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. Compliance is frequently an issue and often requires enlistment and education of concerned family members. Efforts to identify and modify psychosocial factors that may trigger episodes are important, as is an emphasis on lifestyle regularity."

Responds well to light therapy +/\u2013 antidepressants. Double depression: MDE in a patient with dysthymia. Has a poorer prognosis than MDE alone. Pharmacotherapy: Effective in 50\u201370% of patients. Allow 2\u20136 weeks to take effect; treat for \u2265 6 months (see Table 2.14-5). Psychotherapy: Psychotherapy combined with antidepressants is more effective than either treatment alone.

Obstetricians have repeatedly observed that the woman may feel extraordinarily well immediately postpartum, only to lapse in the following days into a weepy, depressed state in which she may be distressed by lack of feeling for her newborn infant. Usually this lasts for only a few days (\u201cpostpartum blues\u201d), being quelled by the return home, responsibility for the infant, and nursing. In some patients, the depressive symptoms persist for months (see later). Depression during pregnancy may be a separate entity and is noted in Chap. 48 as well as in the review by Stewart."

For individuals whose symptoms meet full criteria for either mania or hypomania, the diagnosis should be bipolar | or bipolar II disorder. D. The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication or other treatment). Note: Mixed features associated with a major depressive episode have been found to be a significant risk factor for the development of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. As a result, it is clinically useful to note the presence of this specifier for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment. With melancholic features: A.
