The patient has an altered level of consciousness, decreased spontaneous and elicited movements, hypotonia, bulging anterior fontanelle, and cyanosis. Given the clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) due to birth asphyxia, which is a common cause of seizures in premature infants. The patient's low birth weight (1400 grams) and gestational age (31 weeks) increase the risk of HIE. The next step in management would be to evaluate for potential intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), which is a common complication of HIE. Cranial ultrasonography is the most appropriate imaging modality for this patient, as it is non-invasive, bedside, and can be performed quickly to evaluate for IVH and other intracranial abnormalities.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

In childhood, the most common causes of coma are toxins, infections, head trauma, hypoxia-ischemia (cardiac arrest, near-drowning), and seizure (postictal state, subclinical status epilepticus) (Table 184-1). The most common cause of long-term morbidity in a patient with depressed consciousness is hypoxia; therefore, airway, breathing and circulation are addressed first. Vital signs, including pulse oximetry, must be assessed. A glucose level should also be checked immediately because hypoglycemia is a rapidly treatable cause of altered mental status. Physical examination searches for clues as to the cause of altered consciousness, such as unusual odors, needle tracts, trauma, or signs of dehydration or organ system failure."

            "content": "A 76-year-old retired banker complains of a shuffling gait with occasional falls over the last year. He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

This team readies equipment, ensures that adequate personnel are present, delegates roles and responsibilities, and considers contingency plans to stabilize the newborn. Four questions a neonatal provider will ask pertain to expected gestional age, amnionic fluid color, fetal number, and additional fetal risks. Several conditions are associated with a nonvigorous presentation. These may include immaturity, hypoxemia or acidosis from any cause, sepsis syndrome, recent drugs administered to the mother, and central nervous system developmental abnormalities. Those related to the respiratory tract are lung abnormalities, upper airway obstruction, pneumothorax, and meconium aspiration."

            "content": "Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a severe epilepsy syndrome with variable age of onset. Most children present before age 5 years. Frequent, multiple seizure types, including atonic, focal, atypical absence, and generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic varieties, characterize the disorder. Many children have underlying brain injury or malformations. The seizures usually respond poorly to treatment, and most patients have significant intellectual disability. Benign neonatal convulsions are an autosomal dominant genetic disorder linked to abnormal neuronal potassium channels. Otherwise well newborns present with focal seizures toward the end of the first week of life, leading to the colloquial term fifth-day fits. Response to treatment is generally excellent, and the long-term outcome is typically favorable."

The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy. One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC). He undergoes surgical resection and is found to have high-risk stage III CRC with five positive lymph nodes. After surgery, he feels entirely well with no symptoms. Of note, he has no other illnesses. What is this patient\u2019s overall prognosis? Based on his prognosis, what"

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"
