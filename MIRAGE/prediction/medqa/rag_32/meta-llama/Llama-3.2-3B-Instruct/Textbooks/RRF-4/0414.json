    "question": "A 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-day history of diarrhea, moderate abdominal pain, and weakness. Her symptoms began on the return flight from a 2-week yoga retreat in India, where she stayed at a resort. She was mildly nauseous as she boarded the flight, and diarrhea followed immediately after eating the in-flight meal. Since then, she has had up to five watery stools daily. She has a 1-year history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and is allergic to shellfish. Her only medication is ranitidine. She appears lethargic. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 115/72 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. Which of the following is the most likely pathogen?",

        "A": "Giardia intestinalis",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and physical examination. The patient has a 3-day history of diarrhea, moderate abdominal pain, and weakness, which started after eating an in-flight meal on a return flight from India. She has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is allergic to shellfish. Her symptoms began shortly after eating, and she has had up to five watery stools daily. The patient appears lethargic with a normal temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness without guarding or rebound, and bowel sounds are hyperactive. Given these symptoms, we need to consider the most likely pathogen. The patient's travel history to India and exposure to a new environment may have introduced a new pathogen. The fact that the symptoms started after eating suggests a foodborne illness. The presence of watery stools and abdominal pain also points towards a gastrointestinal infection. Considering the options, Giardia intestinalis is a common cause of waterborne and foodborne diarrhea, especially in travelers. It is known to cause symptoms similar to those described by the patient. Shigella species can also cause diarrhea, but it is less commonly associated with travel to India. Staphylococcus aureus can cause food poisoning, but it typically presents with vomiting, nausea, and abdominal cramps, which is not the primary complaint in this case. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a common cause of traveler's diarrhea, but it is less likely given the patient's symptoms and the fact that she has a history of GERD, which may make her more susceptible to other pathogens. Therefore, the most likely pathogen is Giardia intestinalis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Gastroparesis and pyloric obstruction elicit vomiting within an hour of eating. Emesis from intestinal blockage occurs later. Vomiting occurring within minutes of meal consumption prompts consideration of rumination syndrome. With severe gastric emptying delays, the vomitus may contain food residue ingested hours or days before. Hematemesis raises suspicion of an ulcer, malignancy, or Mallory-Weiss tear. Feculent emesis is noted with distal intestinal or colonic obstruction. Bilious vomiting excludes gastric obstruction, whereas emesis of undigested food is consistent with a Zenker\u2019s diverticulum or achalasia. Vomiting can relieve abdominal pain from a bowel obstruction, but has no effect in pancreatitis or cholecystitis. Profound weight loss raises concern about malignancy or obstruction. Fevers suggest"

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

Alternatively, larvae may immediately penetrate the mucosa of the stomach. Within hours, violent upper abdominal pain accompanied by nausea and occasionally vomiting ensues, mimicking an acute abdomen. The diagnosis can be established by direct visualization on upper endoscopy, outlining of the worm by contrast radiographic studies, or histopathologic examination of extracted tissue. Extraction of the burrowing larvae during endoscopy is curative. In addition, larvae may pass to the small bowel, where they penetrate the mucosa and provoke a vigorous eosinophilic granulomatous response. Symptoms may appear 1\u20132 weeks after the infective meal, with intermittent abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and fever resembling the manifestations of Crohn\u2019s disease. The diagnosis may be suggested by barium studies and confirmed by curative"

The illness generally lasts 12\u201360 h and is characterized by one or more of the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. Vomiting is more prevalent among children, whereas a greater proportion of adults develop diarrhea. Constitutional symptoms are common, including headache, fever, chills, and myalgias. The stools are characteristically loose and watery, without blood, mucus, or leukocytes. White cell counts are generally normal; rarely, leukocytosis with relative lymphopenia may be observed. Death is a rare outcome and usually results from severe dehydration in vulnerable persons (e.g., elderly patients with debilitating health conditions)."

Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"
