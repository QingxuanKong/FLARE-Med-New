    "question": "A 60-year-old man with a history of osteoarthritis has been awaiting hip replacement surgery for 3 years. During his annual physical, he reports that he has been taking over the counter pain medications, but that no amount of analgesics can relieve his constant pain. Laboratory results reveal that his renal function has deteriorated when compared to his last office visit 2 years ago. Serum creatinine is 2.0 mg/dL, and urinalysis shows 1+ proteinuria. There are no abnormalities seen on microscopy of the urine. A renal biopsy shows eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's deterioration in renal function?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of osteoarthritis and has been taking over-the-counter pain medications for 3 years. The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with a serum creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL and 1+ proteinuria on urinalysis. The renal biopsy shows eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation. Given these findings, the most likely explanation for the patient's deterioration in renal function is toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis. This condition is often caused by medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are commonly used to treat osteoarthritis. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with NSAID-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis, which can cause renal dysfunction and proteinuria. The other options are less likely explanations for the patient's condition. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a type of kidney disease that affects the glomeruli, but it is not directly related to the patient's use of pain medications. Ischemic acute tubular necrosis and nephrotoxic acute tubular necrosis are types of acute kidney injury caused by reduced blood flow or toxic substances, but they are not supported by the patient's history and biopsy results. \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

            "content": "Flank pain is the most common symptom. Persistent urinary tract infection, persistent proteinuria, or hematuria in patients with cancer should raise suspicion of ureteral obstruction. Total anuria and/or anuria alternating with polyuria may occur. A slow, continuous rise in the serum creatinine level necessitates immediate evaluation. Renal ultrasound is the safest and cheapest way to identify hydronephrosis. The function of an obstructed kidney can be evaluated by a nuclear scan. CT scan can reveal the point of obstruction and identify a retro-peritoneal mass or adenopathy."

            "content": "When confronted with an abnormal urinalysis and elevated serum creatinine, with or without edema or congestive heart failure, one must consider whether the glomerulonephritis is acute or chronic. This assessment is best made by careful history (last known urinalysis or serum creatinine during pregnancy or insurance physical, evidence of infection, or use of medication or recreational drugs); the size of the kidneys on renal ultrasound examination; and how the patient feels at presentation. Chronic glomerular disease often presents with decreased kidney size. Patients who quickly develop renal failure are fatigued and weak and often have uremic symptoms associated with nausea, vomiting, fluid retention, and somnolence. Primary glomerulonephritis presenting with renal failure that has progressed slowly, however, can be remarkably asymptomatic, as are patients with acute glomerulonephritis without much loss in renal function. Once this initial information is collected, selected patients"

Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

Pigmentation of heart valves, larynx, tympanic membranes, and skin occurs, and occasional patients develop pigmented renal or prostatic calculi. Pigment deposition in the heart and blood vessels leads to aortic stenosis necessitating valve replacement, especially after 60 years of age. The diagnosis should be suspected in a patient whose urine darkens to blackness. Homogentisic acid in urine is identified by urine organic acid analysis. Ochronotic arthritis is treated symptomatically with pain medications, spinal surgery, and arthroplasty (Chap. 394). Ascorbic acid and protein restriction are not effective in reducing homogentisic acid production. By contrast, nitisone (2-[2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl]-1,3-cyclohexanedione), a drug used in tyrosinemia type I, reduces urinary excretion of homogentisic acid and, in conjunction with a low-protein diet,"

Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination?

Fluid aspirated from the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb was negative for organisms but positive for needle-shaped monosodium urate (MSU) crystals (see image at right). The inflammatory symptoms have since resolved. IR reports he is in good health otherwise, with no significant past medical history. His body mass index (BMI) is 31. No tophi (deposits of MSU crystals under the skin) were detected in the physical examination."
