The patient has diabetes and is experiencing blurry vision, which is a common complication of diabetes. The fundoscopic examination reveals narrowing of retinal arteries and microaneurysms, which are characteristic of diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is caused by the accumulation of sorbitol in the retina due to the deficiency of sorbitol dehydrogenase, an enzyme necessary for the conversion of sorbitol to fructose. This accumulation of sorbitol leads to osmotic damage to the retina, causing the narrowing of retinal arteries and microaneurysms. Therefore, the enzyme specifically involved in this process is sorbitol dehydrogenase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The retinopathy takes years to develop but eventually appears in nearly all cases. Regular surveillance of the dilated fundus is crucial for any patient with diabetes. In advanced diabetic retinopathy, the proliferation of neovascular vessels leads to blindness from vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, and glaucoma (Fig. 39-17).

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"
