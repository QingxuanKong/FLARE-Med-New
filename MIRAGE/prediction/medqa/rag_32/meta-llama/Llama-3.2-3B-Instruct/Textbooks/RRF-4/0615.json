    "question": "A 31-year-old man, who was hospitalized for substance-induced psychosis two days prior, has had episodic neck stiffness and pain for the past 8 hours. These episodes last for approximately 25 minutes and are accompanied by his neck rotating to the right. During the last episode, he was able to relieve the stiffness by lightly touching his jaw. He has received six doses of haloperidol for auditory hallucinations since his admission. He appears anxious. His temperature is 37.3\u00b0C (99.1\u00b0F), pulse is 108/min, and blood pressure is 128/86 mm Hg. Examination shows a flexed neck rotated to the right. The neck is rigid with limited range of motion. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing symptoms of acute dystonia, which is a type of movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions, leading to abnormal postures and movements. The patient's symptoms of episodic neck stiffness and pain, neck rotation, and limited range of motion are consistent with acute dystonia. The patient's recent hospitalization for substance-induced psychosis and receipt of haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic medication, may have contributed to the development of acute dystonia. The patient's symptoms are responding to the symptom-relieving effect of lightly touching his jaw, which suggests that the dystonia is likely medication-induced. The goal of treatment is to alleviate the symptoms of acute dystonia and prevent further complications. The options for treatment include anticholinergic medications, such as benztropine, which are commonly used to treat acute dystonia. Physical therapy may be helpful in managing the patient's symptoms and preventing future episodes, but it is not the most appropriate immediate treatment. Dantrolene is a muscle relaxant that is used to treat malignant hyperthermia, not acute dystonia. Baclofen is a muscle relaxant that is used to treat muscle spasticity, not acute dystonia. Therefore, the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms is benztropine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

If the patient is unobservant or imprecise in descriptions, a helpful tactic is to provoke sensations by rapid rotation, or by asking the patient to stoop for a minute and straighten up; having him stand relaxed for 3 min and checking his blood pressure for orthostatic effect; and, particularly, having him hyperventilate for 3 min. Should the patient be unable to distinguish among these several types of induced dizziness or to ascertain the similarity of one of the types to his own condition, the history is probably too inaccurate for purposes of diagnosis."

Unlike M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s, vestibular migraine usually has no associated auditory or aural symptoms. Rule out vertebral artery dissection in those with persistent head or neck pain and intermittent isolated dizziness or vertigo. \u25a0Typically follows a prodrome of lightheadedness or dizziness, muff ed sounds, constricting vision, diffuse weakness, diaphoresis, or pallor. Leads to loss of consciousness and muscle tone for < 30 seconds and recovery within seconds. Dx: Structural CNS causes (e.g., basilar TIA, intermittent obstructive hydrocephalus) are rare among patients who return to normal mental status and have a normal neurologic examination after a brief loss of consciousness. Seizures are more likely if limb jerking is unilateral or lasts > 30 seconds; if there is prolonged confusion after the episode; or if the patient bites the lateral aspect of their tongue."

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

Rarely, it radiates into the arms. It is generally self-limited but may persist for years. Lhermitte\u2019s symptom can also occur with other disorders of the cervical spinal cord (e.g., cervical spondylosis). Paroxysmal symptoms are distinguished by their brief duration (10 s to 2 min), high frequency (5\u201340 episodes per day), lack of any alteration of consciousness or change in background electroencephalogram during episodes, and a self-limited course (generally lasting weeks to months). They may be precipitated by hyperventilation or movement. These syndromes may include Lhermitte\u2019s symptom; tonic contractions of a limb, face, or trunk (tonic seizures); paroxysmal dysarthria and ataxia; paroxysmal sensory disturbances; and several other less well-characterized syndromes. Paroxysmal symptoms probably result from spontaneous"

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

            "content": "In outline, the clinical syndrome of aseptic meningitis consists of fever, headache, signs of meningeal irritation, and a predominantly lymphocytic pleocytosis in the spinal fluid with normal glucose. Usually the onset is acute and the temperature is elevated, from 38 to 40\u00b0C (100.4 to 104\u00b0F). Headache that is more severe than that associated with other febrile states is the most frequent symptom. A variable but usually mild degree of lethargy, irritability, and drowsiness may occur. Photophobia and pain on movement of the eyes are common additional complaints. Stiffness of the neck and spine on forward bending attests to the presence of meningeal irritation (meningismus), but at first it may be so slight as to pass unnoticed. When there are accompanying neurologic signs, they too tend to be mild or fleeting: paresthesia in an extremity, or wavering Babinski signs."

The presumed position of the debris within the labyrinth during the maneuver is shown on each panel. The maneuver is a four-step procedure. First, a Dix-Hallpike test is performed with the patient\u2019s head rotated 45 degrees toward the (affected) right ear and the neck slightly extended with the chin pointed slightly upward. A. This position results in the patient\u2019s head hanging to the right. B. Once the vertigo and nystagmus provoked by this maneuver cease, the patient\u2019s head is rotated about the rostral\u2013caudal body axis until the left ear is down. C. Then the head and body are further rotated until the head is almost facing down. The vertex of the head is kept tilted upward throughout the rotation. The patient should be kept in the final, face down position for about 10 to 15 s. D. With the head kept turned toward the left shoulder, the patient is brought"

His physician initially prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic commonly used to treat hyper-tension. His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic. Because the patient had elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, hydrochlorothiazide was replaced with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril lowered his blood pressure to almost normotensive levels. However, after several weeks on enalapril, the patient returned complaining of a persistent cough. In addition, some signs of angioedema were detected. How does enalapril lower blood pressure? Why does it occasionally cause coughing and angioedema? What other drugs could be used to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and decrease blood pressure,"
