    "question": "A 57-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by ambulance for dysarthria and left-sided facial droop. She is accompanied by her son, who states that the patient had just returned home an hour ago from walking the dog when suddenly the patient stated she felt \u201cstrange.\u201d When her son asked her what was wrong, her speech was slurred and her \"face looked funny.\u201d The son quickly called an ambulance. The paramedic upon arrival noted that the patient had left-sided facial droop. Her medical history includes asthma and sickle cell disease. She takes hydroxyurea, uses oxycodone as needed for pain, and an albuterol inhaler as needed for shortness of breath. The patient\u2019s temperature is 97\u00b0F (36.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 145/72 mmHg, pulse is 93/min, and respirations are 14/min with an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. On physical examination, a left-sided facial droop is appreciated. She has trouble articulating her words, and her speech is garbled. She is put on 2 L of oxygen by nasal cannula. Labs are obtained and pending. Which of the following therapies is most likely indicated?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely indicated therapy for the 57-year-old woman, let's analyze the symptoms and medical history provided. The patient presents with dysarthria (slurred speech), left-sided facial droop, and a history of sickle cell disease. These symptoms suggest a possible stroke, particularly given the acute onset of symptoms after walking the dog. The patient's medical history of sickle cell disease increases her risk of stroke, particularly ischemic stroke. The patient's vital signs are stable, but the physical examination findings of left-sided facial droop and dysarthria are concerning for a stroke. Given the patient's history of sickle cell disease and the acute onset of stroke-like symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is a sickle cell stroke or a stroke caused by sickle cell disease. The patient's oxygen saturation is 96% on room air, which is not low enough to suggest hypoxia as the primary concern. The therapies listed as options can be evaluated as follows: A. Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent used to treat acute ischemic stroke within a certain time window. However, it is not indicated for sickle cell stroke, as it may worsen the condition. B. Exchange transfusion is a treatment for sickle cell crisis, which is not the primary concern in this case. C. Hydralazine is an antihypertensive medication that may be used to manage hypertension in patients with sickle cell disease. However, it is not the most appropriate therapy for acute stroke. D. Warfarin is an anticoagulant used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. It is not indicated for acute stroke treatment. Given the patient's history of sickle cell disease and the acute onset of stroke-like symptoms, the most appropriate therapy is not listed among the options. However, if we must choose from the options provided, we can consider the patient's need for anticoagulation to prevent further strokes. However, since none of the options are directly relevant to the treatment of sickle cell stroke, the best answer from the given options would be: D. Warfarin, but only as a long-term preventive measure to reduce the risk of further strokes in patients with sickle cell disease. But since the question does not allow for a long-term answer, the best choice from the options provided is not ideal. The correct answer should be a medication that can rapidly reduce the risk of further strokes in patients with sickle cell disease, such as hydroxyurea, but it is not listed among the options. Therefore, the best answer from the provided options is not ideal, but if we must choose, it would be: D. Warfarin, but please note that it is not the best choice for this scenario.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

            "content": "3.3. A 39-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room complaining of weakness and dizziness. She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

The patient has signs of imminent respiratory failure, including her refusal to lie down, her fear, and her tachycardia, which can-not be attributed to her minimal treatment with albuterol. Critically important immediate steps are to administer high-flow oxygen and to start albuterol by nebulization. Adding ipratropium (Atrovent) to the nebulized solution is recom-mended. A corticosteroid (0.5\u20131.0 mg/kg of methylpred-nisolone) should be administered intravenously. It is also advisable to alert the intensive care unit, because a patient with severe bronchospasm who tires can slip into respiratory failure quickly, and intubation can be difficult. Fortunately, most patients treated in hospital emergency departments do well. Asthma mortality is rare (fewer than 4000 deaths"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."
