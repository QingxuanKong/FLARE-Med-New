Specifically, she says that she was gardening 8 hours prior to presentation when she sustained a laceration over her distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. Since then, they have become red and swollen. She has also had pain in her proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints for several years and reports that this pain is worse in the morning but improves over the day. The cells that are present in this patient's DIP joints and PIP joints are analyzed and compared. Which of the following is most likely to be true about this patient's findings?",

Additionally, the patient's symptoms of joint pain that improves over the day are more consistent with OA.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely finding in the patient's DIP joints and PIP joints is a higher prevalence of monocytes, which is characteristic of OA.\\n\\nThe correct answer is D.

Knowing which areas are wasted identifies the nerve that supplies them. She palpated the individual bones and palpated the scaphoid with the wrist in ulnar deviation. She examined the movement of joints because they may be restricted by joint disease or inability of muscular contraction. Palpation of both radial and ulnar pulses is necessary. The resident looked for capillary return to assess how well the hand was perfused. Examination of the nerves The three main nerves to the hand should be tested."

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease.
