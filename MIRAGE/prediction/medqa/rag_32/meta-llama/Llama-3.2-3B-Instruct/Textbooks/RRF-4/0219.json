    "question": "A 4-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department with a persistent cough, fever, and vomiting. The past year the child has been admitted to the hospital 3 times with pneumonia. For the past 1 week, the child has been experiencing thick purulent cough and says that her chest feels \u2018heavy\u2019. Her stools have been loose and foul-smelling over the past week. Her parents are also concerned that she has not gained much weight due to her frequent hospital visits. She was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. On physical exam, the temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.4\u00b0F). She appears lethargic and uncomfortable. Crackles are heard in the lower lung bases, with dullness to percussion. A small nasal polyp is also present on inspection. Which of the following is the most likely cause for the girl\u2019s symptoms?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Dysfunction in a transmembrane regulator",
        "B": "Inefficient breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine",

        "D": "Deficiency in lymphocytic activity"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of pneumonia, such as a persistent cough, fever, and vomiting, which are indicative of a bacterial infection. The child's history of frequent hospitalizations for pneumonia and the presence of a nasal polyp suggest a possible underlying condition that is predisposing her to recurrent infections. The presence of a thick, purulent cough and foul-smelling stools also suggests a possible connection to a gastrointestinal infection. Considering the child's age and the combination of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, Cystic Fibrosis (CF) should be considered as a potential underlying condition. CF is a genetic disorder that affects the function of the chloride channels in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, leading to thick, sticky mucus production and recurrent infections. The presence of a nasal polyp is also consistent with CF, as it is a common finding in patients with CF. The other options, dysfunction in a transmembrane regulator, inefficient breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine, and deficiency in lymphocytic activity, do not directly relate to the combination of respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms presented in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Neonates may have fever or hypoxia only, with subtle or absent physical examination findings (see Chapter 65). With a young infant, apnea may be the first sign of pneumonia. Fever, chills, tachypnea, cough, malaise, pleuritic chest pain, retractions, and apprehension, because of difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, are common in older infants and children. Physical examination findings cannot reliably distinguish viral and bacterial pneumonias, but complete physical examination may help identify other foci of disease or associated findings to suggest an etiology."

Given the frequency of viral gastroenteritis as the etiology, it is important to be alert for unusual features that suggest another diagnosis. Viral gastroenteritis usually is not associated with severe abdominal pain or headache and does not recur at frequent intervals. Physical examination should include assessment of the child\u2019s hydration status, including examination of capillary refill, moistness of mucous membranes, and skin turgor (see Chapter 38). The chest should be auscultated for evidence of rales or other signs of pulmonary involvement. The abdomen must be examined carefully for distention, organomegaly, bowel sounds, tenderness, and guarding. A rectal examination and testing stool for occult blood should be considered."

Children may present with coryza, sore throat, hoarseness, and cough that may or may not be croupy. In severe croup, fever persists, with worsening coryza and sore throat. A brassy or barking cough may progress to frank stridor. Most children recover over the next 1 or 2 days, although progressive airway obstruction and hypoxia ensue occasionally. If bronchiolitis or pneumonia develops, progressive cough accompanied by wheezing, tachypnea, and intercostal retractions may occur. In this setting, sputum production increases modestly. Physical examination documents nasopharyngeal discharge and oropharyngeal injection, along with rhonchi, wheezes, or coarse breath sounds. Chest x-rays can show air trapping and occasionally interstitial infiltrates."

Depending on the extent of reactivity, the effusion may be small, remain unnoticed, and resolve spontaneously or may be sufficiently large to cause symptoms such as fever, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea. Physical findings are those of pleural effusion: dullness to percussion and absence of breath sounds. A chest radiograph reveals the effusion and, in up to one-third of cases, also shows a parenchymal lesion. Thoracentesis is required to ascertain the nature of the effusion and to differentiate it from manifestations of other etiologies. The fluid is straw colored and at times hemorrhagic; it is an exudate with a protein concentration >50% of that in serum (usually ~4\u20136 g/dL), a normal to low glucose concentration, a pH of ~7.3"

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

Some more mature infants (34 weeks\u2019 gestation) may not show signs of RDS until 3 to 4 hours after birth, correlating with the initial release of stored surfactant at the onset of breathing accompanied by the ongoing inability to replace the surfactant owing to inadequate stores. Manifestations of RDS include cyanosis, tachypnea, nasal flaring, intercostal and sternal retractions, and grunting. Grunting is caused by closure of the glottis during expiration, the effect of which is to maintain lung volume (decreasing atelectasis) and gas exchange during exhalation. Atelectasis is well documented by radiographic examination of the chest, which shows a ground-glass haze in the lung surrounding air-filled bronchi (the air bronchogram) (Fig. 61-2). Severe RDS may show an airless lung field (whiteout) on a radiograph, even obliterating the distinction between the atelectatic lungs"
