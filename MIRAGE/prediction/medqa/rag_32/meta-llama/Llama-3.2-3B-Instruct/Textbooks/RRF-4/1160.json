Her right knee has also been stiff and slightly swollen for the past 6 weeks. She is overall fatigued and has difficulty moving around but has not sought medical attention until now. On physical examination, the distal interphalangeal joints are swollen, warm, and painful; her nails are pitted and cracked. There are also rough, erythematous skin patches seen over her elbows which have been present for the last few months. She reports that herer father has a similar condition.

These symptoms, combined with a family history of a similar condition, suggest a chronic autoimmune disorder. The presence of pitted and cracked nails and rough, erythematous skin patches over her elbows are also indicative of a specific condition. Gout and reactive arthritis typically do not present with these skin manifestations. Dermatomyositis is a condition that affects the muscles and skin but does not typically present with the specific combination of joint symptoms and skin lesions described in this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Psoriatic Arthritis, which is a chronic autoimmune condition characterized by inflammation of the joints and skin lesions, often accompanied by nail changes and other systemic symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

This syndrome is characterized by sub-acute oligoarticular arthritis developing over a period of 1\u20136 weeks and lasting 6 weeks to 6 months. It generally involves the large joints, predominantly the knees and ankles, and is nonerosive with only a mild inflammatory response. X-rays are nonrevealing. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are only marginally helpful; however, relief has been noted with the use of intraarticular glucocorticoids. A second form of arthritis also thought to be secondary to HIV infection is called painful articular syndrome. This condition, reported as occurring in as many as 10% of AIDS patients, presents as an acute, severe, sharp pain in the affected joint.

Sometimes, skin and muscle changes evolve together over a period of 3 weeks or less. A characteristic form of the skin lesions are patches of a scaly roughness over the extensor surfaces of joints (elbows, knuckles, and knees) with varying degrees of pink-purple coloration. Red, raised papules may be present over exposed surfaces such as the elbows, knuckles, and distal and proximal interphalangeal joints (Gottron papules\u2014applied in some writings to all the skin changes over the knuckles and extensor prominences); these are particularly prominent in DM of childhood.

The primary lesion in psoriasis is a scaly papule that soon forms erythematous plaques covered with a white scale, whereas that of dermatitis herpetiformis is an urticarial papule that quickly becomes a small vesicle. In this manner, identification of the primary lesion directs the examiner toward the proper diagnosis. Secondary changes in skin can also be quite helpful. For example, scale represents excessive epidermis, while crust is the result of a discontinuous epithelial cell layer. Palpation of skin lesions can yield insight into the character of an eruption.

This subject is mentioned briefly in other sections of this book in relation to back and extremity pain (see Chap. 10) and to temporal arteritis, to which it is closely connected (see Chap. 9). The muscular soreness may be diffuse or asymmetrical, particularly in the proximal arms and shoulders. Every movement is reported as stiff and painful. The periarticular tissues and their muscular attachments are affected primarily and may be tender, but this is difficult to interpret, because tenderness in these regions may be found in healthy individuals. The sedimentation rate is elevated in the majority of patients, and a 48-h trial of prednisone, by completely alleviating muscle pain, confirms the diagnosis. In the context of muscle pain, systemic symptoms such as weight loss, headache, and fatigue, as well as mild anemia, are particularly suggestive of"

Case 3: Hyperglycemia and Hyperketonemia Patient Presentation: MW, a 40-year-old woman, was brought to the hospital in a disoriented, confused state by her husband. Focused History: As noted on her medical alert bracelet, MW has had type 1 diabetes (T1D) for the last 24 years. Her husband reports that this is her first medical emergency in 2 years. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): MW displayed signs of dehydration (such as dry mucous membranes and skin, poor skin turgor, and low blood pressure) and acidosis (such as deep, rapid breathing [Kussmaul respiration]). Her breath had a faintly fruity odor. Her temperature was normal."

These complaints are new since she used to always feel \u201chot,\u201d noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to \u201cprotect her bones\u201d and omeprazole for \u201cheartburn.\u201d On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm. Her weight is 136 lb (61.8 kg), an increase of 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the last year. Her thyroid gland is not palpable and her reflexes are delayed. Laboratory findings include a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 24.9 \u03bcIU/mL"

Small numbers of papules that progress to hemorrhagic pustules develop on the trunk and the extensor surfaces of the distal extremities. Migratory arthritis and tenosynovitis of the knees, hands, wrists, feet, and ankles are prominent. The cutaneous lesions and articular findings are believed to be the consequence of an immune reaction to circulating gonococci and immune-complex deposition in tissues. Thus, cultures of synovial fluid are consistently negative, and blood cultures are positive in fewer than 45% of patients. Synovial fluid may be difficult to obtain from inflamed joints and usually contains only 10,000\u201320,000 leukocytes/\u03bcL."

Facial involvement includes a smooth, unwrinkled brow, taut skin over the nose, shrinkage of tissue around the mouth, and perioral radial furrowing (Fig. 73-8). Matlike telangiectases are often present, particularly on the face and hands. Involved skin feels indurated, smooth, and bound to underlying structures; hyperand hypopigmentation are common as well.

The involved extremity is warm and edematous, and the joints are tender. Increased sweating and hair growth develop. In phase II (3\u20136 months after onset), thin, shiny, cool skin appears. After an additional 3\u20136 months (phase III), atrophy of the skin and subcutaneous tissue plus flexion contractures complete the clinical picture. Autonomic testing or bone scans are occasionally useful when the diagnosis is in doubt. The natural history of typical CRPS may be more benign and more variable than previously recognized. A variety of surgical and medical treatments have been developed, with conflicting reports of efficacy. Clinical trials suggest that early mobilization with physical therapy or a brief course of glucocorticoids may be helpful for CRPS type I or II. Other medical treatments include the use of adrenergic blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory"
