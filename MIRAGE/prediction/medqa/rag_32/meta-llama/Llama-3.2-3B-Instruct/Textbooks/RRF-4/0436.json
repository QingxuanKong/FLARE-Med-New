Physical examination is notable for frontal bossing and shortened upper and lower extremities. His axial skeleton appears normal. He is at the 7th percentile for height and 95th percentile for head circumference. He demonstrates normal intelligence and is able to speak in three-word sentences. He first sat up without support at twelve months and started walking at 24 months. Genetic analysis reveals an activating mutation in a growth factor receptor.

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with short stature, frontal bossing, and shortened upper and lower extremities, but normal axial skeleton. The genetic analysis reveals an activating mutation in a growth factor receptor. This suggests a disorder of bone growth and development. The activating mutation in a growth factor receptor typically disrupts the normal signaling pathway involved in endochondral ossification, which is the process of bone growth from cartilage. The patient's normal intelligence and ability to speak in three-word sentences suggest that the disorder is not associated with significant central nervous system involvement. The patient's growth pattern, including delayed sitting and walking, also supports this conclusion. The correct answer can be determined by considering the effects of the activating mutation on bone growth and development. The patient's shortened upper and lower extremities, but normal axial skeleton, suggests that the mutation affects the growth of long bones, which are formed through endochondral ossification. Therefore, the most likely disrupted physiologic process is endochondral ossification.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

In children with FTT, malnutrition initially results in wasting (deficiency in weight gain). Stunting (deficiency in linear growth) generally occurs after months of malnutrition, and head circumference is spared except with chronic, severe malnutrition.

FGFR3 mutation results in a constitutively active receptor, thereby exaggerating this effect and suppressing growth. Approximately 90% of cases stem from new mutations, almost all of which occur in the paternal allele. Affected individuals have shortened proximal extremities, a trunk of relatively normal length, and an enlarged head with bulging forehead and conspicuous depression of the root of the nose.

Mean growth velocity is ~6 cm/year in later childhood and usually is maintained within a given range on a standardized percentile chart. Peak growth rates occur during midpuberty when bone age is 12 (girls) or 13 (boys). Secondary sexual development is associated with elevated sex steroids that cause progressive epiphyseal growth plate closure. Bone age is delayed in patients with all forms of true GH deficiency or GH receptor defects that result in attenuated GH action. Short stature may occur as a result of constitutive intrinsic growth defects or because of acquired extrinsic factors that impair growth. In general, delayed bone age in a child with short stature is suggestive of a hormonal or systemic disorder, whereas normal bone age in a short child is more likely to be caused by a genetic cartilage dysplasia or growth plate disorder (Chap. 427)."

He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?"

            "content": "that the UPR is a component of pathology of these conditions. Some CDs are caused by mutations in genes that affect early development of cartilage and related structures. The most common form of short-limbed dwarfism, achondroplasia, is caused by mutations in the gene for a receptor for a fibroblastic growth factor (FGFR3). The mutations in the FGFR3 gene causing achondroplasias are unusual in several respects. The same single-base mutation in the gene that converts glycine to arginine at position 380 in the FGFR3 gene is present in over 90% of patients. Most patients harbor sporadic new mutations, and therefore, this nucleotide change must be one of the most common recurring mutations in the human genome. The mutation causes unregulated signal transduction through the receptor and inappropriate development of cartilage. Mutations that alter other domains of FGFR3 have been found in patients with the more severe disorders of hypochondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia and in a few"

These children become progressively shorter for age and tend to have an elevated weight-to-height ratio, appearing chubby and short. Careful measurements in the first year of life may suggest the diagnosis, but most patients elude diagnosis until several years of age.

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

However, in hypoxia, anaerobic glycolysis is increased. What allosteric activator of glycolysis is responsible for this effect? With hypoxia, what will be the end product of glycolysis? TQ4. One of the reasons for encouraging smoking cessation and exercise for BJ is that these changes raise the level of HDL, and elevated HDL reduces the risk for CHD. How does a rise in HDL reduce the risk for CHD?
