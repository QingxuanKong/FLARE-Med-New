This reduces the pressure of the ejected blood and lowers the blood pressure. The left atrium has to work harder to fill the failing left ventricle. This extra work increases left atrial pressure, which is reflected in an increased pressure in the pulmonary veins, and this subsequently creates a higher pulmonary venular pressure. This rise in pressure will cause fluid to leak from the capillaries into the pulmonary interstitium and then into the alveoli. Such fluid is called pulmonary edema and it markedly restricts gas exchange. This results in shortness of breath. This man had a blocked left coronary artery, as shown in Fig. 3.114B. It is important to know which coronary artery is blocked."

Since the decline in rheumatic disease incidence, aortic stenosis is less common, and the most frequent cause in the United States is a bicuspid valve (Friedman, 2008). A normal aortic valve has an area of 3 to 4 cmr, with a pressure gradient <5 mm Hg. If the valve area is < 1 cmr, there is severe obstruction to flow and a progressive pressure overload on the left ventricle (Roeder, 2011). Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy follows, and if it is severe, enddiastolic pressures become elevated, ejection fraction declines, and cardiac output is reduced (see Table 49-6). Characteristic manifestations develop late' and include chest pain, syncope, heart failure, and sudden death from arrhythmias. Life expectancy averages only 5 years after exertional chest pain develops, and valve replacement is indicated for symptomatic patients."

Contractility is said to increase when the force of ventricular contraction increases at constant preload and afterload. Clinically, contractility is difficult to quantify because virtually all of the available measures are dependent to a certain degree on preload and afterload.

Clark and associates (1989) conducted invasive studies to measure hemodynamic function late in pregnancy (Table 4-4). Right heart catheterization was performed in 10 healthy nulliparas at 35 to 38 weeks' gestation, and again at 11 to 13 weeks postpartum. Late pregnancy was associated with the expected increases in heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output. Systemic vascular and pulmonary vascular resistance both dropped signiicantly, as did colloid osmotic pressure. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and central venous pressure did not change appreciably. Thus, although cardiac output rises, left ventricular function as measured by stroke work index remains similar to the nonpregnant normal range (see Fig. 4-9).

Thus, in cardiac tamponade, the normal inspiratory augmentation of right ventricular volume causes an exaggerated reduction of left ventricular volume, stroke volume, and systolic pressure. Paradoxical pulse also occurs in approximately one-third of patients with constrictive pericarditis (see below), and in some cases of hypovolemic shock, acute and chronic obstructive airway disease, and pulmonary embolus. Right ventricular infarction (Chap. 295) may resemble cardiac tamponade with hypotension, elevated jugular venous pressure, an absent y descent in the jugular venous pulse, and, occasionally, a paradoxical pulse (Table 288-2)."

For given illing pressures, there is appropriate cardiac output so that cardiac function during pregnancy is eudynamic. In nonpregnant subjects with a normal heart who sustain a high-output state, the left ventricle undergoes longitudinal remodeling, and echocardiographic functional indices of its deformation provide normal values. In pregnancy, there instead appears to be spherical remodeling, and these calculated indices that measure longitudinal deformation are depressed. Thus, normal nonpregnant indices are likely inaccurate when used to assess function in studied, respectively. Moreover, a significant proportion of women studied demonstrated a drop in stroke volume index and a tendency toward eccentric remodeling. hese indings suggest cardiovascular maladaptation to the increased volume demands in a substantial"

The remaining patients have a codominant circulation where the posterior descending artery is supplied by both the right and left coronaries.Right heart catheterization is performed by the introduc-tion of catheter through a peripheral vein that is advanced into the right side of the heart.14 Right-sided pressures and structures are assessed in a similar fashion as in the left heart. Extension of the catheter into the pulmonary artery allows measurement of pulmonary artery pressures as well as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (reflecting left ventricular end diastolic pres-sure) with an occlusive balloon. In addition to these measure-ments, cardiac output can be measured using thermodilution or by the Fick method using oxygen saturations of blood sampled from the various locations during the procedure.Brunicardi_Ch21_p0801-p0852.indd 80601/03/19 5:32 PM 807ACQUIRED HEART DISEASECHAPTER 21Figure 21-2.

            "content": "(EDV). In practice, EDV is challenging to measure precisely during the cardiac cycle, and so clinicians utilize the end-diastolic pressure (EDP) as a reasonable surrogate. For the right ventricle, central venous pressure (CVP) approximates right ventricular EDP. For the left ventricle, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP), which is measured by transiently inflating a balloon at the end of a pressure monitoring catheter positioned in a small branch of the pulmonary artery, approxi-mates left ventricular EDP. The presence of atrioventricular val-vular stenosis may alter this relationship.There are limits to the utilization of EDP as a surrogate for EDV when evaluating preload. For example, EDP is deter-mined not only by volume but also by the diastolic compliance of the ventricular chamber. Ventricular compliance is altered by Brunicardi_Ch13_p0433-p0452.indd 43622/02/19 2:20 PM 437PHYSIOLOGIC MONITORING OF THE SURGICAL PATIENTCHAPTER 13Figure 13-2 A-D. Left ventricular"

As the disease progresses, preload reserve may become exhausted, the hypertrophic response may become inadequate, and impaired myocardial contractility may develop so that ejection fraction begins to decline.158 Although left ventricular systolic dysfunction related to excessive afterload is reversible early in the course, irrevers-ible damage occurs once chamber enlargement predominates as the primary cause of diminished myocardial contractility.Clinical Manifestations. In cases of acute severe AI, patients are symptomatic and invariably present with compensatory tachycardia, often associated with acute pulmonary congestion and cardiogenic shock.2 Because the left ventricular and aortic pressures often equalize before the end of diastole, the diastolic murmur of AI may be short and/or soft. The reduced systolic pressure may attenuate the increase in peripheral pulse pressure seen in chronic AI, and early"

It is also a common, isolated finding in patients after cardiac surgery without other hemodynamic abnormalities. Venous hypertension sometimes can be elicited by performance of the abdominojugular reflex or with passive leg elevation. When these signs are positive, a volume-overloaded state with limited compliance of an overly distended or constricted venous system is present. The abdominojugular reflex is elicited with firm and consistent pressure over the upper portion of the abdomen, preferably over the right upper quadrant, for at least 10 s. A positive response is defined by a sustained rise of more than 3 cm in JVP for at least 15 s after release of the hand. Patients must be coached to refrain from breath holding or a Valsalva-like maneuver during the procedure. The"
