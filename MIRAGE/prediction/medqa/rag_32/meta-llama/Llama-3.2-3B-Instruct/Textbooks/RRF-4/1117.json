    "question": "A 68-year-old man presents with difficulty breathing for the last 3 hours. Upon asking about other symptoms, he mentions that he had a cough for the last 4 months which he attributes to his smoking. He says he had frequent nasal stuffiness and headaches over the last 3 months, for which he takes over-the-counter cold medications and analgesics. Over the last 2 months, he often felt that his face was mildly swollen, especially in the morning hours, but he did not consider it to be anything serious. No significant past medical history. He reports a 20-pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse is 96/min, blood pressure is 108/78 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical examination, auscultation of the chest reveals rhonchi and crepitus over the right lung. The remainder of the exam is unremarkable. A chest radiograph reveals a mass in the middle lobe of the right lung. Which of the following clinical signs would most likely be present in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Bilateral pedal edema",
        "B": "Distended veins over lower abdomen",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's analyze the symptoms and findings presented in the case: 1. **Difficulty breathing for 3 hours**: This suggests a respiratory issue that may be acute or chronic. 2. **Cough for the last 4 months**: This indicates a chronic respiratory issue, possibly related to smoking. 3. **Nasal stuffiness and headaches**: These symptoms can be related to various conditions, including respiratory infections, allergies, or other underlying diseases. 4. **Mild swelling of the face, especially in the morning**: This could be related to fluid retention or other systemic issues. 5. **20-pack-year smoking history**: This is a significant risk factor for various respiratory diseases, including lung cancer. 6. **Physical examination findings**: - **Auscultation of the chest reveals rhonchi and crepitus over the right lung**: Rhonchi are high-pitched sounds heard during auscultation, often indicative of bronchitis or other respiratory conditions. Crepitus (crepitus is a crunching or crackling sound) is often heard in conditions affecting the lung parenchyma, such as tuberculosis (TB). - **Chest radiograph reveals a mass in the middle lobe of the right lung**: This finding is highly suggestive of lung cancer. Considering the combination of chronic cough, smoking history, and the radiographic finding of a lung mass, the most likely diagnosis is lung cancer, specifically lung adenocarcinoma, which is a type of non-small cell lung cancer. Now, let's evaluate the options given: A. **Bilateral pedal edema**: This is not typically associated with lung cancer. B. **Distended veins over lower abdomen**: This is more commonly seen in liver disease or portal hypertension. C. **Papilledema**: This is associated with increased intracranial pressure, not directly related to lung cancer. D. **Sensory loss over the ulnar aspect of right forearm and right hand**: This could be related to nerve compression or other conditions, but it is not a typical finding in lung cancer. However, none of the options directly correlates with the symptoms and findings presented. But if we have to choose an option that could be related to the systemic effects of lung cancer, we might consider: **A. Bilateral pedal edema** as a possible indirect consequence of advanced cancer, especially if the patient has liver metastasis or other systemic effects of the cancer. However, without more information about the patient's overall health and potential systemic effects of the cancer, this is a somewhat tenuous connection. Given the options provided, the best answer is: **A. Bilateral pedal edema** Please note that this is a somewhat indirect connection and not a definitive sign of lung cancer. A definitive diagnosis of lung cancer should be made based on a combination of clinical findings, imaging studies, and histopathological examination.",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

In light of the pathobiology of the disease, many of the findings are to be expected. The patient is frequently febrile with tachycardia or may have a history of chills and/or sweats. Cough may be either nonproductive or productive of mucoid, purulent, or blood-tinged sputum. Gross hemoptysis is suggestive of CA-MRSA pneumonia. Depending on severity, the patient may be able to speak in full sentences or may be very short of breath. If the pleura is involved, the patient may experience pleuritic chest pain. Up to 20% of patients may have gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. Other symptoms may include fatigue, headache, myalgias, and arthralgias."

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

            "content": "Physical Examination The clinician\u2019s suspicion of respiratory disease often begins with a patient\u2019s vital signs. The respiratory rate is often informative, whether elevated (tachypnea) or depressed (hypopnea). In addition, pulse oximetry should be measured, as many patients with respiratory disease have hypoxemia, either at rest or with exertion. The classic structure of the respiratory examination proceeds through inspection, percussion, palpation, and auscultation as described below. Often, however, auscultatory findings will lead the clinician to perform further percussion or palpation in order to clarify these findings."

Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"
