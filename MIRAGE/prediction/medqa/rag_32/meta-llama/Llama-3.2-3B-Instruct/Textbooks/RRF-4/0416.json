    "question": "A 25-year-old woman presents to her new family physician for a follow-up appointment. She previously presented with itching, as well as frequent and painful urination. A vaginal swab was taken and sent to the laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. Diplococci were seen on Gram stain and were grown on Thayer-Martin agar. When discussing her infection, the patient says that she uses safe sex practices. Her history is significant for meningitis and for infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. The physician discusses that the reason behind these infections comes from a defect in the innate immune system. Which of the following best describes the component that is likely deficient in this patient?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as itching and frequent/painful urination, which are consistent with gonorrhea. The laboratory results confirm the presence of diplococci on Gram stain and growth on Thayer-Martin agar, which is a specific test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The patient's history of meningitis and Streptococcus pneumoniae infection also suggests a defect in the innate immune system. The most common cause of recurrent infections in patients with a defect in the innate immune system is a deficiency in the complement system. The complement system is a part of the innate immune system that helps to defend against infections. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with a deficiency in the C3 component of the complement system, which is also known as C3. The C3 component plays a role in the alternative complement pathway, which is one of the three pathways of the complement system. The alternative complement pathway is involved in the defense against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and other pathogens. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Induces the alternative complement pathway.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Optimally, the evaluation of a patient with a genital ulcer should include dark-field examination or direct immuno\ufb02uorescence testing for Treponema pallidum, culture or antigen testing for HSV, and culture for Haemophilus ducreyi. Dark-field or \ufb02uorescent microscopes and selective media to culture for H. ducreyi often are not available in most offices and clinics.

True or false: Withdrawing a nonbeneficial treatment is ethically similar to withholding a nonindicated one. When can a physician refuse to continue treating a patient on the grounds of futility? An eight-year-old child is in a serious accident. She requires emergent transfusion, but her parents are not present. Conditions in which confidentiality must be overridden. Involuntary commitment or isolation for medical treatment may be undertaken for what reason? A 10-year-old child presents in status epilepticus, but her parents refuse treatment on religious grounds. A son asks that his mother not be told about her recently discovered cancer. False. Patients may change their minds at any time. Exceptions to the requirement of informed consent include emergency situations and patients without decision-making capacity."

In addition, she is on hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol for hypertension. The patient has a history of one depressive episode after a divorce that was treated successfully with fluoxetine. Medical workup including complete blood cell count, thyroid func-tion tests, and a chemistry panel reveals no abnormalities.

A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative."

Gram\u2019s stain is also excellent for detecting yeasts (less predictive of vulvovaginitis) and pseudomycelia or mycelia (strongly predictive of vulvovaginitis) and for distinguishing normal flora from the mixed flora seen in bacterial vaginosis, but it is less sensitive than the saline preparation for detection of T. vaginalis. dNAAT, nucleic acid amplification test (where available)."

Confirmatory diagnostic tests (for persons with symptoms or signs) or screening tests (for those without symptoms or signs) may involve microscopic examination, culture, antigen detection tests, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), or serology. Initial syndrome-based treatment should cover the most likely causes. For certain syndromes, results of rapid tests can narrow the spectrum of this initial therapy (e.g., saline microscopy of vaginal fluid for women with vaginal discharge, Gram\u2019s stain of urethral discharge for men with urethral discharge, rapid plasma reagin test for genital ulcer). After the institution of treatment, STD management proceeds to the \u201c4 Cs\u201d of prevention and control: contact tracing (see \u201cPrevention and Control of STIs,\u201d below), ensuring compliance with therapy, and counseling on risk reduction, including condom promotion and"

Clinically, patients typically present 1 to 5 weeks after exposure with dysuria with or without urethral discharge. Patients may develop epididymitis, prostatitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, perihepatic inflammation, and, among individuals who engage in anal sex, proctitis. It is the most common cause of epididymitis in young men. Similar to gonococcus, a large percentage of both men and women are asymptomatic. C. trachomatis also causes lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), discussed in the next section. The infection may be transmitted to newborns during vaginal birth, where up to 15% of exposed newborns develop chlamydial pneumonia and 50% develop chlamydial conjunctivitis."
