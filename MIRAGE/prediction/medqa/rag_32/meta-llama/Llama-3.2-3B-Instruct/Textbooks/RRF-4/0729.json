Each time, he becomes irritable while feeding and refuses to finish the bottle. He was born at 37 weeks' gestation and weighed 3300 g (7 lb 4 oz); he currently weighs 4000 g (8 lb 13 oz). He has Down syndrome. His vaccinations are up-to-date. He appears agitated and cries during the examination. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), pulse is 156/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 100/49 mm Hg. Examination shows upward slanting of the eyelids, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a single transverse palmar crease on both hands. The abdomen is soft and nontender. A 2.5-cm (1-inch) epigastric mass is palpated. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis is within normal limits. Further diagnostic evaluation of the patient is most likely to show which of the following?",

The symptoms and physical examination findings suggest pyloric stenosis, a condition where the pyloric muscle thickens and narrows, blocking the passage of food from the stomach to the small intestine. The presence of Down syndrome increases the risk of pyloric stenosis. The infant's symptoms of nonbilious vomiting, irritability, and refusal to feed are consistent with pyloric stenosis. The palpable epigastric mass is also consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis within normal limits suggests that the vomiting is not related to respiratory issues. The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Therefore, the most likely diagnostic finding is an elongated and thickened pylorus on abdominal ultrasound.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Meconium staining of the umbilical cord, nails, and skin suggest fetal distress and the possibility of aspiration pneumonia. The level of spontaneous activity, passive muscle tone, quality of the cry, and apnea are useful screening signs to evaluate the state of the nervous system. The examination should proceed with an assessment of vital signs, particularly heart rate (normal rate, 120 to 160 beats/min); respiratory rate (normal rate, 30 to 60 breaths/min); temperature (usually done per rectum and later as an axillary measurement); and blood pressure (often reserved for sick infants). Length, weight, and head circumference should be measured and plotted on growth curves to determine whether growth is normal, accelerated, or retarded for the specific gestational age."

During a 30-year period at Parkland Hospital, during which there were more than 350,000 singleton births, only 1.4 percent of newborns weighed 4500 g or more. We are of the view that the upper limit of fetal growth, above which growth can be deemed abnormal, is likely two standard deviations above the mean, representing perhaps 3 percent of births. At 40 weeks, such a threshold would correspond to approximately 4500 g. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2016a) concludes that the term macrosomia was an appropriate appellation for newborns who weigh 4500 g or more at birth.

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

Although there is general agreement among obstetricians that neonates weighing < 4000 g are not excessively large, a similar consensus has not been reached for the definition of macrosomia. Newborn weight rarely exceeds 11 pounds (5000 g), and excessively large infants are a curiosity. The largest newborn cited in the Guinness Book of World Records was a 23-lb 12-oz (10,800 g) infant boy born in 1879 to a Canadian woman (Barnes, 1957). In the United States in 2015, of more than 4 million births, 6.9 percent weighed 4000 to 4499 g; 1 percent weighed 4500 to 4999 g; and 0.1 percent were born weighing 5000 g or more 4500-4649 3221 (Martin, 2017) .

Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."
