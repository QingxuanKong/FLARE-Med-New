    "question": "A 76-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine examination. She has a history of hypertension well controlled with diet and exercise. She has no history of smoking or illicit drug use. She walks one mile daily. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 119/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. When compared to a healthy 20-year-old woman, which of the following changes in respiratory function is most likely present in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Increased lung compliance",
        "B": "Decreased residual volume",
        "C": "Increased chest wall compliance",
        "D": "Decreased A-a gradient"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the changes in respiratory function that occur with aging. As people age, there are several changes that affect the lungs and chest cavity, leading to changes in respiratory function. These changes include: reduced lung volume, decreased chest wall compliance, and increased respiratory rate. Additionally, the diaphragm's ability to expand and contract weakens with age, making it more difficult to breathe. Considering the options, we can analyze each choice as follows: A. Increased lung compliance: Lung compliance decreases with age, not increases. B. Decreased residual volume: Residual volume decreases with age due to the loss of lung elasticity and the diaphragm's reduced ability to expand. C. Increased chest wall compliance: Chest wall compliance decreases with age due to the loss of fat and muscle mass, making it more difficult to expand the chest cavity. D. Decreased A-a gradient: The A-a gradient decreases with age due to the decrease in ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Decreased residual volume.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"
