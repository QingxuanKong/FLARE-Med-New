    "question": "A 48-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for sudden onset of difficulty breathing 6 hours ago. For the past several months, he has had shortness of breath on exertion and while lying down on the bed, frequent headaches, and swelling of his feet. He does not take any medications despite being diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago. His pulse is 90/min, respirations are 20/min, blood pressure is 150/110 mm Hg, and temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). Physical examination shows an overweight male in acute distress with audible wheezes. Crackles are heard bilaterally and are loudest at the lung bases. Which of the following findings on cardiac auscultation will most likely be present in this patient?",

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. The patient presents with sudden onset of difficulty breathing, which is a life-threatening symptom that requires immediate attention. 2. The patient has a history of hypertension, which can lead to cardiac issues such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or hypertensive crisis. 3. The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath on exertion and while lying down, frequent headaches, and swelling of the feet are indicative of heart failure, particularly left-sided heart failure. 4. The patient's blood pressure is elevated at 150/110 mmHg, which is consistent with hypertensive crisis. 5. The physical examination shows audible wheezes, crackles bilaterally, and increased respiratory rate, which are signs of pulmonary congestion and edema. 6. Given the patient's presentation, the most likely cardiac finding on auscultation is related to left-sided heart failure. Now, let's analyze the options: A. Loud P2: P2 is the second heart sound, which is related to the closure of the pulmonary valve. While it can be affected in heart failure, it is not the most likely finding in this case. B. S3 gallop: An S3 gallop is a third heart sound, which is associated with ventricular volume overload, such as in heart failure. This is a likely finding in left-sided heart failure. C. Absent S4: S4 is a fourth heart sound, which is related to atrial contraction. Its absence is more commonly associated with conditions like atrial fibrillation or heart block, which is not indicated in this case. D. A loud S1: S1 is the first heart sound, which is related to atrial and ventricular contraction. While it can be affected in various cardiac conditions, it is not the most specific finding for left-sided heart failure. Based on the analysis, the most likely cardiac finding on auscultation in this patient is a B. S3 gallop, which is associated with ventricular volume overload, such as in left-sided heart failure. Here is the answer in the required json format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of heart failure, hypertension, and pulmonary congestion, making S3 gallop the most likely cardiac finding on auscultation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

These auscultatory signs are best appreciated with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position. Aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation (Chap. 283), pulmonary hypertension (Chap. 304), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Chap. 287) must be excluded, since these disorders may cause angina in the absence of coronary atherosclerosis.

The physician provisionally makes the diagnosis of bronchial asthma and administers epinephrine by intramuscular injec-tion, improving the patient\u2019s breathing over several minutes. A normal chest X-ray is subsequently obtained, and the medical history is remarkable only for mild hypertension that is being treated with propranolol. The physician instructs the patient to discontinue use of propranolol, and changes the patient\u2019s antihypertensive medication to verapamil. Why is the physician correct to discontinue propranolol? Why is verapamil a better choice for managing hypertension in this patient? What alternative treatment change might the physi-cian consider?"

            "content": "The initial manifestation of HAPE may be a reduction in exercise tolerance greater than that expected at the given altitude. Although a dry, persistent cough may presage HAPE and may be followed by the production of blood-tinged sputum, cough in the mountains is almost universal and the mechanism is poorly understood. Tachypnea and tachycardia, even at rest, are important markers as illness progresses. Crackles may be heard on auscultation but are not diagnostic. HAPE may be accompanied by signs of HACE. Patchy or localized opacities (Fig. 476e-2) or streaky interstitial edema may be noted on chest radiography. In the past, HAPE was mistaken for pneumonia due to the cold or for heart failure due to hypoxia and exertion. Kerley B lines or a bat-wing appearance are not seen on radiography. Electrocardiography may reveal right ventricular strain or even hypertrophy. Hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis are consistently present unless the patient is taking acetazolamide, in which case"

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension.

Fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and orthopnea are the most prominent complaints in patients with chronic severe MR. Palpitations are common and may signify the onset of AF. Right-sided heart failure, with painful hepatic congestion, ankle edema, distended neck veins, ascites, and secondary TR, occurs in patients with MR who have associated pulmonary vascular disease and pulmonary hypertension. Acute pulmonary edema is common in patients with acute severe MR. In patients with chronic severe MR, the arterial pressure is usually normal, although the carotid arterial pulse may show a sharp, low-volume upstroke owing to the reduced forward CO. A systolic thrill is often palpable at the cardiac apex, the LV is hyperdynamic with a brisk systolic impulse and a palpable rapid-filling wave (S3), and the apex beat is often displaced laterally."
