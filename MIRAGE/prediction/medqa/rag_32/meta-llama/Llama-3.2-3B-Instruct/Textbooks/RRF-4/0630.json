    "question": "A 64-year-old male with a past medical history of two myocardial infarctions presents to the emergency room with shortness of breath. He notes that he stopped taking his furosemide two weeks prior, because he ran out of pills. On exam, his oxygen saturation is 78%, his lungs have crackles throughout, and jugular venous pulsation is located at the earlobe. EKG and troponin levels are normal. Which of the following is consistent with this man's pulmonary physiology?",

        "D": "Increased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of alveolar-arterial (Aa) gradient, diffusion distance, and surface area for gas exchange in the lungs. The Aa gradient refers to the difference in oxygen partial pressure between the alveoli and the arterial blood. A normal Aa gradient is essential for efficient gas exchange. The surface area for diffusion is the area available for gas exchange, and the diffusion distance is the distance between the alveoli and the capillaries. In pulmonary edema, fluid accumulates in the alveoli, increasing the diffusion distance and decreasing the surface area for gas exchange. This can lead to a decreased Aa gradient. The patient in the scenario has pulmonary edema, which would likely result in a decreased Aa gradient, increased diffusion distance, and decreased surface area for diffusion. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Increased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days.

The physical examination in cardiogenic pulmonary edema is notable for evidence of increased intracardiac pressures (S3 gallop, elevated jugular venous pulse, peripheral edema) and rales and/or wheezes on auscultation of the chest. In contrast, the physical examination in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is dominated by the findings of the precipitating condition; pulmonary findings may be relatively normal in the early stages. The chest radiograph in cardiogenic pulmonary edema typically shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette, vascular redistribution, interstitial thickening, and perihilar alveolar infiltrates; pleural effusions are common. In noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, heart size is normal, alveolar infiltrates are distributed more uniformly throughout the lungs, and pleural effusions are uncommon."

What muscle relaxant would you use to facilitate tracheal intubation? What is the proper dose for your chosen muscle relaxant? After intravenous infusion of your chosen muscle relaxant, you are unable to adequately visualize the patient\u2019s larynx and vocal cords and cannot successfully pass an endotracheal tube. You switch to mask ventilation but are barely able to mask ventilate the patient, and you become worried"

            "content": "The patient has a low ejection fraction with systolic heart failure, probably secondary to hypertension. His heart fail-ure must be treated first, followed by careful control of the hypertension. He was initially treated with a diuretic (furo-semide, 40 mg twice daily). On this therapy, he was less short of breath on exertion and could also lie flat without dyspnea. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhib-itor was added (enalapril, 20 mg twice daily), and over the next few weeks, he continued to feel better. Because of continued shortness of breath on exercise, digoxin at 0.25 mg/d was added with a further modest improvement in exercise tolerance. The blood pressure stabilized at 150/90 mm Hg, and the patient will be educated regarding the relation between his hypertension and heart failure and the need for better blood pressure control. Cautious addition of a \u03b2 blocker (metoprolol) will be considered. Blood lipids, which are currently in the normal range, will be monitored."

Which of the eicosanoid agonists have been demonstrated to reduce both morbidity and mortality in patients with such a diagnosis? What are the modes of action? A 40-year-old woman presented to her doctor with a 6-month history of increasing shortness of breath. This was associated with poor appetite and ankle swell-ing. On physical examination, she had elevated jugular venous distention, a soft tricuspid regurgitation murmur, clear lungs, and mild peripheral edema. An echocardio-gram revealed tricuspid regurgitation, severely elevated"
