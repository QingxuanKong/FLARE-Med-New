    "question": "A 81-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he fell asleep at the dinner table and was not able to be roused by his family. His past medical history is significant for Alzheimer disease though he is still relatively functional at baseline. He has also been taking warfarin over the last 3 months after he suffered a deep venous thrombosis. After he was transported to the ED, his family found that the pills his grandson takes for seizures were missing. On presentation, he is found to be somnolent and physical exam reveals ataxia and nystagmus. After determining the cause of this patient's symptoms, his physicians begin monitoring his international normalized ratio, because they are concerned that it will start trending down. Which of the following treatments would most improve the urinary excretion of the substance likely responsible for these symptoms?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing symptoms of somnolence, ataxia, and nystagmus, which are consistent with a toxic or metabolic cause. Given the patient's history of Alzheimer's disease and warfarin therapy, a possible cause of these symptoms could be warfarin toxicity. Warfarin is an anticoagulant that inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, and its levels can be affected by various factors, including food, liver function, and renal function. The patient's symptoms of somnolence and ataxia are consistent with warfarin toxicity, which can cause neurological symptoms. The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is a measure of the time it takes for blood to clot, and a decrease in INR indicates that the patient's blood is clotting too quickly. This could be a sign of warfarin toxicity. To improve the urinary excretion of the substance likely responsible for these symptoms, the patient would need to be treated to reduce warfarin levels. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that can increase urine production and help eliminate warfarin from the body. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Mannitol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

            "content": "A 66-year-old obese Caucasian man presented to an academic Diabetes Center for advice regarding his diabetes treatment. His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

A 50-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with severe lower back pain that had started several days ago. In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

Interestingly, the height of the patient and the previous lens surgery would suggest a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and a series of blood tests and review of the family history revealed this was so. A 35-year-old male patient presented to his family practitioner because of recent weight loss (14 lb over the previous 2 months). He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets."
