    "question": "A 2-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician by his parents for a routine visit. Since his 18-month visit, the parents have become concerned that his speech does not seem to be developing appropriately. The parents report that the patient\u2019s vocabulary is still limited to fewer than 10 words, and he is still only using single words to describe things. The parents say that his motor milestones do not seem to be affected, as the patient is very physically active and can run and kick a ball. At times the patient seems hyperactive and can be difficult to redirect. On exam, his temperature is 98.4\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 14/min. The rest of the exam is unremarkable, except that the patient\u2019s face appears to be abnormally long and narrow. The patient is further referred to a geneticist, as he is believed to have a trinucleotide repeat disorder. Which of the following is the most likely inheritance pattern of this disorder?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Autosomal dominant",
        "B": "Autosomal recessive",
        "C": "Noninherited somatic mutation",
        "D": "X-linked dominant"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the given information and relate it to the provided documents. The key points from the scenario are: the patient is a 2-year-old boy with delayed speech development, limited vocabulary, and single-word descriptions, but no motor milestones are affected. The patient's face appears abnormally long and narrow, and he has a family history of a trinucleotide repeat disorder. We need to consider the characteristics of the disorders mentioned in the documents and relate them to the symptoms presented.\\n\\nThe described symptoms of delayed speech development and limited vocabulary are consistent with several disorders, including Fragile X syndrome, which is characterized by intellectual disability, delayed speech, and physical characteristics such as a long and narrow face. Fragile X syndrome is caused by an expansion of the CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome.\\n\\nThe fact that the patient's face appears abnormally long and narrow is also consistent with Fragile X syndrome, which is often associated with a long and narrow face. Additionally, Fragile X syndrome is known to be caused by a trinucleotide repeat disorder, which matches the patient's family history.\\n\\nConsidering the above information, the most likely inheritance pattern of this disorder is X-linked dominant, as Fragile X syndrome is caused by an expansion of the CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. This pattern of inheritance is consistent with the symptoms and family history presented in the scenario.\\n\\nNow, let's evaluate the answer choices:\\nA. Autosomal dominant: This inheritance pattern is less likely, as Fragile X syndrome is caused by an X-linked gene.\\nB. Autosomal recessive: This inheritance pattern is also less likely, as Fragile X syndrome is caused by an X-linked gene.\\nC. Noninherited somatic mutation: This is not a valid inheritance pattern, as the patient's symptoms are consistent with a genetic disorder.\\nD. X-linked dominant: This is the most likely inheritance pattern, as Fragile X syndrome is caused by an X-linked gene and matches the patient's symptoms and family history.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"D\"}}",

The use of warm and cool water from a tap is adequate and more practical for this purpose. The side of each tube is applied successively to the skin for a few seconds and the patient is asked to report whether the flask feels \u201cless hot\u201d or \u201cless cold\u201d in comparison to a normal part. It is of interest that patients are able to recognize a difference of 1\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) or even less in the range of 28\u00b0C (82.4\u00b0F) to 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F); in the warm range, differences between 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F) and 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F) can be recognized, and in the cold range, between 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F) and 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F). If the temperature of the test object is below 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F) or above 50\u00b0C (122\u00b0F), sensations of cold or heat become confused with pain.

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

Insertion of a pacemaker has become common. We have been impressed with the variability of clinical expression. In many patients, intelligence has been unimpaired and the myotonia and muscle weakness have been so mild that the patients were unaware of any difficulty. Pryse-Philips and associates emphasized these features in their description of a large Labrador kinship in which 27 of 133 patients had only a partial syndrome and only minor muscle symptoms at the time of examination."

Answers to questions about the family help determine if there is an autosomal dominant, AR, X-linked, or sporadic disorder. When a child is affected with the new onset of an AD disorder, it is necessary to closely examine the parents to check for the presence of manifestations. If the parents are unaffected, the child\u2019s condition is most likely the result of a new mutation; the risk of recurrence is extremely low (although not 0, because of the possibility of gonadal mosaicism in one of the parents). When one parent is affected (even mildly so due to varying penetrance), the recurrence risk rises to 50%. With X-linked disorders, the focus is on the maternal family history to determine if there is a significant enough risk to warrant testing."

Babbling tends to be deficient, and, in the second year, in attempting to say something, the child makes noises that do not sound at all like language; in this way the child is unlike the late talker already described. Again, the understanding of language is entirely normal; the comprehension vocabulary is average for age, and the child can appreciate syntax, as indicated by correct responses to questions by nodding or shaking the head and by the execution of complex spoken commands. Usually such patients are shy but otherwise quick in responding, cheerful, and without other behavioral disorders. Some are bright, but a combination of congenital inarticulation and mild mental slowness is also not uncommon. If many of the spontaneous utterances are intelligible, speech correction should be attempted (by a trained therapist). However,"

Characteristically, attacks of weakness occur before breakfast and later in the day, particularly when resting following exercise. In the latter case, the weakness appears after 20 to 30 min of becoming sedentary. The patient notes difficulty that begins in the legs, thighs, and lower back and spreads to the hands, forearms, and shoulders over minutes or more. Only in the severest attacks are the neck and cranial muscles involved; respiratory muscles are usually spared. As the muscles become inexcitable, tendon reflexes are diminished or lost. Attacks usually last 15 to 60 min, and recovery can be hastened by mild exercise. After an attack, mild weakness may persist for a day or 2. In severe cases, the attacks may occur every day; during late adolescence and the adult years, when the patient becomes more sedentary, the attacks may diminish and even cease entirely. In certain"
