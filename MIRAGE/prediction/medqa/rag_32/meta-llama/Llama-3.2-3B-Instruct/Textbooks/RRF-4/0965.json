    "question": "A 52-year-old woman presents to the emergency department due to severe pain of her first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. This pain started acutely, and she describes the pain as sharp. Her medical history is significant for obesity, hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, and extensive alcohol use. She takes a number of medications but does not remember what they are. On physical exam, her right first MTP joint appears warm, swollen, erythematous, and exquisitely painful to the touch. After resolution of this acute episode, the patient is started on a drug to prevent recurrence of the symptoms. One month later on follow-up, she is found to have pancytopenia. Which of the following describes the mechanism of the drug most likely prescribed in this case?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of acute gouty arthritis, which is characterized by sudden onset of excruciating joint pain, localized hyperemia, and warmth. The pain started acutely in the first metatarsophalangeal joint, which is a common location for gout. The patient's medical history is significant for obesity, hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, and extensive alcohol use, which can increase the risk of gout. The patient's symptoms are consistent with acute gouty arthritis, and the warm, swollen, and erythematous joint is a classic sign of this condition. The patient is started on a drug to prevent recurrence of the symptoms, and one month later, she is found to have pancytopenia. Pancytopenia is a condition characterized by a decrease in the number of red and white blood cells, as well as platelets. This can be a side effect of certain medications used to treat gout, such as colchicine. Colchicine is an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization, which can cause bone marrow suppression leading to pancytopenia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

This can be as simple as advising that if the patient has a severe, frightening attack, she can take up to four puffs of albuterol every 15 minutes, but if the first treatment does not bring significant relief, she should take the next four puffs while on her way to an emergency department or urgent care clinic. She should also be given a prescription for prednisone, with instructions to take 40\u201360 mg orally for severe attacks, but not to wait for it to take effect if she remains severely short of breath even after albuterol inhalations.
