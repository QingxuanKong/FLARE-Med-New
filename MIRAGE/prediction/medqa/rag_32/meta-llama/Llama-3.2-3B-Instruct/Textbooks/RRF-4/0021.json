    "question": "A 3-month-old infant is brought to her pediatrician because she coughs and seems to have difficulty breathing while feeding. In addition, she seems to have less energy compared to other babies and appears listless throughout the day. She was born by cesarean section to a G1P1 woman with no prior medical history and had a normal APGAR score at birth. Her parents say that she has never been observed to turn blue. Physical exam reveals a high-pitched holosystolic murmur that is best heard at the lower left sternal border. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following abnormalities?",
    "options": {
        "A": "22q11 deletion",
        "B": "Deletion of genes on chromosome 7",
        "C": "Lithium exposure in utero",
        "D": "Maternal alcohol consumption"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the symptoms and physical exam findings presented in the scenario and correlate them with the potential causes listed in the options. The key findings include a high-pitched holosystolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border, coughing and difficulty breathing while feeding, less energy and listlessness, and a normal APGAR score at birth. These symptoms are suggestive of a congenital heart defect, specifically a ventricular septal defect (VSD). The holosystolic murmur is a hallmark of VSD. The fact that the infant was born by cesarean section and has a normal APGAR score at birth makes it less likely that the infant experienced significant distress during delivery, which could be associated with certain chromosomal abnormalities. The absence of cyanosis also points away from certain cyanotic congenital heart defects. Now, let's consider the options: A. 22q11 deletion syndrome is associated with various congenital heart defects, including VSD, but it is not the most directly related to the symptoms described. B. Deletion of genes on chromosome 7 is associated with Williams syndrome, which is characterized by supravalvular aortic stenosis, not VSD. C. Lithium exposure in utero is associated with Ebstein's anomaly, which is a different congenital heart defect. D. Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, which can include various congenital heart defects, including VSD. Given the symptoms and physical exam findings, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, which is associated with an increased risk of VSD. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}}",

Some infants with less severe forms may present with a mild degree of cyanosis, whereas the onset of clinical symptoms in patients surviving childhood is gradual, with the average age of diagnosis in the mid-teens.However, the infant with severe atrialization and pulmo-nary stenosis will be both cyanotic and acidotic at birth. The chest radiograph may demonstrate the classic appearance, which 7Figure 20-41. Echo showing a patient with Ebsteins anomaly.

            "content": "Clinical manifestations of a PDA usually become apparent on day 2 to 4 of life. Because the left-to-right shunt directs flow to a low-pressure circulation from one of high pressure, the pulse pressure widens; a previously inactive precordium shows an extremely active precordial impulse, and peripheral pulses become easily palpable and bounding. The murmur of a PDA may be continuous in systole and diastole, but usually only the systolic component is auscultated. Heart failure and pulmonary edema result in rales and hepatomegaly. A chest radiograph shows cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema; a two-dimensional echocardiogram shows ductal patency; and Doppler studies show markedly increased left-to-right flow through the ductus."

            "content": "Auscultation In patients with severe AR, the aortic valve closure sound (A2) is usually absent. A systolic ejection sound is audible in patients with BAV disease, and occasionally an S4 also may be heard. The murmur of chronic AR is typically a high-pitched, blowing, decrescendo diastolic murmur, heard best in the third intercostal space along the left sternal border (see Fig. 267-5B). In patients with mild AR, this murmur is brief, but as the severity increases, it generally becomes louder and longer, indeed holodiastolic. When the murmur is soft, it can be heard best with the diaphragm of the stethoscope and with the patient sitting up, leaning forward, and with the breath held in forced expiration. In patients in whom the AR is caused by primary valvular disease, the diastolic murmur is usually louder along the left than the right sternal border. However, when the murmur is heard best along the right sternal border, it suggests that the AR is caused by aneurysmal dilation of the"
