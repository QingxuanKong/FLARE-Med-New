Instead, biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length are measured. Fetal weight in the second and third trimesters is estimated from a combination of these measurements (Chap. 10, p. 184)."

In the absence of malformations, a birthweight < 3rd percentile was seen in 37 percent of pregnancies with oligohydramnios, in 21 percent with borderline amnionic fluid volume, but in only 4 percent with normal volumes. Also, from a recent metaanalysis of 15 studies involving more than 35,000 pregnancies, high-risk pregnancies with oligohydramnios were more likely to be complicated by low birthweight compared with low-risk pregnancies with oligohydramnios (Rabie, 2017).

Combining head, abdomen, and femur dimensions provides optimum accuracy, whereas little incremental improvement is gained by adding other biometrical measurements (Platz, 2008). Of the dimensions, femur length measurement is technically the easiest and the most reproducible. Biparietal diameter and head circumference measurements are dependent on the plane of section and may also be afected by deformative pressures on the skull. Last, abdominal circumference measurements are more variable. However, these are most frequently abnormal with fetal-growth restriction because soft tissue predominates in this dimension (Fig. 44-6). Shown in Figure 44-7 is an example of a severely growth-restricted newborn."

            "content": "Another scenario is that the postterm fetus may continue to gain weight and thus be unusually large at birth. This at least suggests that placental function is not severely compromised. Indeed, continued fetal growth is the norm-albeit at a slower rate beginning at 37 completed weeks (Fig. 43-3). Nahum and colleagues (1995) conirmed that fetal growth continues until at least 42 weeks. However, Link and associates (2007) showed that umbilical blood low did not increase concomitantly. The principal reasons for increased risks to postterm fetuses were described by Leveno and associates (1984). Both antepartum fetal jeopardy and intrapartum fetal distress were found to be the consequence of cord compression associated with oligohydramnios. In their analysis of 727 postterm pregnancies, intrapartum fetal distress detected with electronic monitoring was not associated with late decelerations characteristic of uteroplacental insuiciency.

In some cases, the anus may be mistaken for the mouth and the ischial tuberosities for the malar eminences. With careul examination, however, the inger encounters muscular resistance with the anus, whereas the hard, less yielding jaws are felt through the mouth. The finger, upon removal from the anus, may be stained with meconium. The mouth and malar eminences form a triangular shape, whereas the ischial tuberosities and anus lie in a straight line.
