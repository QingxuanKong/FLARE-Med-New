    "question": "A 67-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a follow up appointment. He was released from the hospital 1 week ago for an appropriately managed ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); however, he has not filled any of his prescriptions and did not attend his follow up appointment as scheduled. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and peripheral vascular disease. His temperature is 97.5\u00b0F (36.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 167/118 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for jugular venous distention and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Echocardiography demonstrates an ejection fraction of 55%. Which of the following medications will have the greatest mortality benefit in this patient?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most beneficial medication for this patient, we need to consider the patient's history and current clinical presentation. The patient has a history of hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He has not filled his prescribed medications and has not attended follow-up appointments, which may indicate non-adherence. The patient presents with signs of heart failure, including jugular venous distention, bilateral lower extremity pitting edema, and an ejection fraction of 55%, indicating reduced left ventricular function. Given these factors, the goal is to improve mortality and reduce morbidity in this patient. The patient's blood pressure is elevated at 167/118 mmHg, which may be due to various factors, including medication non-adherence, underlying hypertension, or heart failure. The patient's ejection fraction is 55%, which is significantly reduced, indicating poor cardiac function. Among the options provided, we need to evaluate the effects of each medication on mortality and cardiac function. A. Atenolol is a beta-blocker that can reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure and post-MI. However, its effect on blood pressure may not be sufficient in this patient, who has uncontrolled hypertension. B. Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which can reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure and post-MI. ACE inhibitors are particularly beneficial in patients with reduced ejection fraction, as they have been shown to improve survival and reduce hospitalization rates. C. Metoprolol succinate is a long-acting beta-blocker that can reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure and post-MI. However, its effect on blood pressure may not be sufficient in this patient, who has uncontrolled hypertension. D. Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that can reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure and post-MI. However, its effect on blood pressure may not be sufficient in this patient, who has uncontrolled hypertension. Considering the patient's reduced ejection fraction, history of STEMI, and uncontrolled hypertension, the most beneficial medication would be B. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, as it has been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure and post-MI, particularly those with reduced ejection fraction. Additionally, ACE inhibitors can help control blood pressure and improve cardiac function. However, it is essential to note that the patient's blood pressure and electrolyte levels need to be monitored closely, as ACE inhibitors can cause hypotension and hyperkalemia. Therefore, close monitoring and adjustment of the medication and other treatments are crucial to ensure the patient's safety and optimal outcomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian"

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated.

He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day.

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

CXR, MRI, and cardiac catheterization may be helpful, but echocardiography is key to diagnosis and reveals rapid early filling with a normal or near-normal EF. Cardiac biopsy may reveal fibrosis or evidence of infiltration. ECG frequently shows LBBB. Therapeutic options are limited and generally are palliative only. Medical treatment includes cautious use of diuretics for \ufb02uid overload, vasodilators to \u2193 filling pressure, and anticoagulation if not contraindicated. Major risk factors for CAD include age, male gender, hyperlipidemia, DM, hypertension, obesity, a family history, and smoking. The classic triad of angina consists of substernal chest pain that is provoked by exertion and relieved by rest or nitrates."
