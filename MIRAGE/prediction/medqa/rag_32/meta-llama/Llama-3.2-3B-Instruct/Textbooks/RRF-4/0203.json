    "question": "A 39-year-old man presents to his primary care physician because he has been having severe headaches and fever for the last 2 days. He also says his right eyelid has been painlessly swelling and is starting to block his vision from that eye. He recently returned from a tour of the world where he visited Thailand, Ethiopia, and Brazil. Otherwise his past medical history is unremarkable. On presentation, his temperature is 102\u00b0F (38.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 126/81 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, and respirations are 13/min. Physical exam reveals a nontender swelling of the right eyelid, lymphadenopathy, and an indurated red patch with surrounding erythema and local swelling on his left leg. Which of the following drugs should be used to treat this patient's condition?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Benznidazole",
        "B": "Ivermectin",
        "C": "Mebendazol",
        "D": "Sodium stibogluconate"

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the given question: 1. The patient presents with severe headaches, fever, swelling of the right eyelid, lymphadenopathy, and an indurated red patch with surrounding erythema and local swelling on his left leg. These symptoms, combined with the patient's travel history to Thailand, Ethiopia, and Brazil, suggest a diagnosis of Lassa fever, which is endemic in parts of West and Central Africa, as well as South America. 2. Lassa fever is caused by the Lassa virus, which is transmitted to humans through contact with food or household items contaminated with the urine or feces of infected rodents, or through direct contact with infected people. 3. The symptoms of Lassa fever can range from mild to severe and include fever, headache, muscle pain, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling of the face, arms, or legs. 4. The patient's symptoms, such as severe headaches, fever, swelling of the right eyelid, and lymphadenopathy, are consistent with Lassa fever. 5. The appropriate treatment for Lassa fever typically involves supportive care, such as hydration and rest, and may include antiviral medications, such as ribavirin, which is not listed among the options. 6. However, among the options provided, Benznidazole is not typically used to treat Lassa fever. 7. Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medication used to treat various parasitic infections, such as onchocerciasis and strongyloidiasis, but it is not typically used to treat viral infections like Lassa fever. 8. Mebendazole is an antiparasitic medication used to treat various parasitic worm infections, but it is not typically used to treat Lassa fever. 9. Sodium stibogluconate is an antimonial compound used to treat leishmaniasis, not Lassa fever. 10. However, among the options provided, Benznidazole is not the best choice. The correct answer is not explicitly listed, but among the options, the closest correct answer is D. Sodium stibogluconate is not correct, but since Benznidazole is not listed, the next best option would be an antiviral medication, which is not available in the options. However, since sodium stibogluconate is the closest option to an antiviral medication, and considering the context of the question, I will choose the closest option: The final answer is: D",

            "content": "The classic rash of ARF is erythema marginatum (Chap. 24), which begins as pink macules that clear centrally, leaving a serpiginous, spreading edge. The rash is evanescent, appearing and disappearing before the examiner\u2019s eyes. It occurs usually on the trunk, sometimes on the limbs, but almost never on the face. Subcutaneous nodules occur as painless, small (0.5\u20132 cm), mobile lumps beneath the skin overlying bony prominences, particularly of the hands, feet, elbows, occiput, and occasionally the vertebrae. They are a delayed manifestation, appearing 2\u20133 weeks after the onset of disease, last for just a few days up to 3 weeks, and are commonly associated with carditis. Fever occurs in most cases of ARF, although rarely in cases of pure chorea. Although high-grade fever (\u226539\u00b0C) is the rule, lower grade temperature elevations are not uncommon. Elevated acute-phase reactants are also present in most cases."

Interestingly, the height of the patient and the previous lens surgery would suggest a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and a series of blood tests and review of the family history revealed this was so. A 35-year-old male patient presented to his family practitioner because of recent weight loss (14 lb over the previous 2 months). He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets."

He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

Desquamation of the skin, particularly of the fingers and toes, appears at this point. The platelet count, previously normal or slightly depressed, increases to a significant degree (often >1 million/mm3). This phase heralds the onset of coronary artery aneurysms, which may also appear in the convalescent phase and pose the highest risk of morbidity and mortality. Risk factors for development of coronary artery aneurysms include prolonged fever, prolonged elevation of inflammatory parameters such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), age younger than 1 year or older than 6 years, and male gender.

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Focused History: This was IR\u2019s first occurrence of severe joint pain. In the ED, he was given an anti-inflammatory medication. Fluid aspirated from the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb was negative for organisms but positive for needle-shaped monosodium urate (MSU) crystals (see image at right). The inflammatory symptoms have since resolved. IR reports he is in good health otherwise, with no significant past medical history. His body mass index (BMI) is 31. No tophi (deposits of MSU crystals under the skin) were detected in the physical examination."

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).
