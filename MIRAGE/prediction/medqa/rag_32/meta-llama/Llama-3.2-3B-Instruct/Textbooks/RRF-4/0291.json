She says that she has had multiple such lesions previously. Other medical history reveals that she has had 3 past spontaneous abortions at < 10 weeks of gestational age but has never been diagnosed with any diseases. She drinks socially but has never smoked or used drugs. She has never taken any medications except for over the counter analgesics and antipyretics. Physical exam shows that the cord-like lesion is tender, thick, and hardened on palpation. In addition, she has a lacy mottled violaceous rash on multiple extremities. Which of the following antibodies would most likely be found in this patient's blood?",

This clinical presentation is suggestive of a vasculitis, specifically polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) or a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The patient's history of multiple spontaneous abortions and the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies are also indicative of SLE. The anti-cardiolipin antibody is a specific marker for anti-phospholipid syndrome, which is often associated with SLE. Therefore, the most likely antibody found in this patient's blood is anti-cardiolipin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age. A 35-year-old woman visited her family practitioner because she had a \u201cbloating\u201d feeling and an increase in abdominal girth. The family practitioner examined the lower abdomen, which revealed a mass that extended from the superior pubic rami to the level of the umbilicus. The superior margin of the mass was easily palpated, but the inferior margin appeared to be less well defined. This patient has a pelvic mass. When examining a patient in the supine position, the observer should uncover the whole of the abdomen."

Reflex activity may therefore occur below the injury, but communication with the brain is lost. A 25-year-old woman complained of increasing lumbar back pain. Over the ensuing weeks she was noted to have an enlarging lump in the right groin, which was mildly tender to touch. On direct questioning, the patient also complained of a productive cough with sputum containing mucus and blood, and she had a mild temperature. The chest radiograph revealed a cavitating apical lung mass, which explains the pulmonary history."

These complaints are new since she used to always feel \u201chot,\u201d noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to \u201cprotect her bones\u201d and omeprazole for \u201cheartburn.\u201d On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm. Her weight is 136 lb (61.8 kg), an increase of 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the last year. Her thyroid gland is not palpable and her reflexes are delayed. Laboratory findings include a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 24.9 \u03bcIU/mL"

On physical examina-tion, the sclera of her eyes shows yellow discoloration. Labora-tory analyses of blood drawn within an hour of her admission reveal abnormal liver function as indicated by the increased indices: alkaline phosphatase 302 (41\u2013133),* alanine amino-transferase (ALT) 351 (7\u201356),* aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1045 (0\u201335),* bilirubin 3.33 mg/dL (0.1\u20131.2),* and pro-thrombin time of 19.8 seconds (11\u201315).* In addition, plasma bicarbonate is reduced, and she has ~45% reduced glomerular filtration rate from the normal value"

A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid.

The history should include a review of symptoms, general medical history, review of past surgery, and current medications. The woman\u2019s most troubling symptoms must be ascertained\u2014how often she leaks urine, how much urine she leaks, what provokes urine loss, what improves or worsens the problem, and what treatment (if any) she had in the past. It is essential to keep the patient\u2019s chief symptom at the forefront to avoid inappropriate management. Consider, for example, a woman whose chief concern is that once a month, while leading a business seminar, she has a sudden, overwhelming urge to void followed by complete bladder emptying. She finds this leakage devastating and is considering quitting her job because of her acute embarrassment. On occasion, she leaks a few drops of urine during exercise, but this minor leakage does not bother her. During the evaluation, urodynamics reveal minimal stress"

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."
