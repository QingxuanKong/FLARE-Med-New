    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the key points from the patient's presentation and the muscle biopsy results. The patient is a 40-year-old male who complains of weakness in climbing stairs or brushing his hair, but denies any headaches or visual changes. The muscle biopsy reveals CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium. This suggests an inflammatory process involving the muscle tissue. Let's evaluate the options: A. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and muscles. However, the muscle biopsy results do not directly support this diagnosis. B. Polymyalgia rheumatica is a condition characterized by pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders, and hips, but it does not typically involve muscle weakness or CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration. C. Polymyositis is an inflammatory muscle disease that can cause muscle weakness and muscle biopsy results showing inflammation. However, the CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium is more characteristic of dermatomyositis. D. Dermatomyositis is a type of inflammatory myopathy that is characterized by muscle weakness, skin rash, and CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium. This matches the patient's presentation and biopsy results. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is dermatomyositis. \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}}",

They are initiated by autophosphorylation of select tyrosine residues in their receptors. C. They are mediated by binding to adrenergic receptors, which are a class of nuclear receptors. D. They result in the activation of glycogen and triacylglycerol synthesis. Q3. NE bound to certain receptors causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. Why might NE be used clinically in the treatment of septic shock? Case 5: Sun Sensitivity Patient Presentation: AZ is a 6-year-old boy who is being evaluated for freckle-like areas of hyperpigmentation on his face, neck, forearms, and lower legs. Focused History: AZ\u2019s father reports that the boy has always been quite sensitive to the sun. His skin turns red (erythema) and his eyes hurt (photophobia) if he is exposed to the sun for any period of time."

Even in patients without detectable antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels, passive transfer experiments indicate the presence of a circulating factor with similar activity.

Often, the patient cannot easily determine the time of onset of weakness. Certain actions\u2014such as arising from a deep or low chair or from a squatting or kneeling position, climbing or descending stairs, walking, putting an object on a high shelf, or combing the hair\u2014become increasingly difficult. Pain of an aching variety in the buttocks, calves, or shoulders is experienced by approximately 15 percent of patients, and it may indicate a combination of myositis and rheumatoid arthritis, tendonitis, or other rhuematologic disorder."

Rosenthal, MD A 29-year-old Peruvian man presents with the incidental finding of a 10 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8-cm liver cyst on an abdominal com-puted tomography (CT) scan. The patient had noted 2 days of abdominal pain and fever, and his clinical evaluation and CT scan were consistent with appendicitis. His clinical find-ings resolved after laparoscopic appendectomy. The patient immigrated to the USA 10 years ago from a rural area of Peru where his family trades in sheepskins. His father and sister have undergone resection of abdominal masses, but details of their diagnoses are unavailable. What is your differential diagnosis? What are your diagnostic and therapeutic plans?"

The history also helps to bring a focus to the neurologic examination that follows. Each complaint should be pursued as far as possible to elucidate the location of the lesion, the likely underlying pathophysiology, and potential etiologies. For example, a patient complains of weakness of the right arm. What are the associated features? Does the patient have difficulty with brushing hair or reaching upward (proximal) or buttoning buttons or opening a twist-top bottle (distal)? Negative associations may also be crucial. A patient with a right hemiparesis without a language deficit likely has a lesion (internal capsule, brainstem, or spinal cord) different from that of a patient with a right hemiparesis and aphasia (left"
