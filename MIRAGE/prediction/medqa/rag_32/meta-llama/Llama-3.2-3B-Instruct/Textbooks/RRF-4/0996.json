    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the characteristics of different immunoglobulin classes and their primary functions. We know that IgM is the first class of immunoglobulin produced after activation of a B cell and is secreted as a pentamer, allowing it to bind to multiple antigens. IgA is primarily found in mucosal surfaces and secretions, and it plays a key role in protecting against bacterial adherence and colonization of mucous membranes. IgG is the most abundant immunoglobulin in the plasma and provides specific recognition to circulating antigens in the bloodstream. IgE is mainly associated with mast cells and plays a role in defense against parasite infections and allergic reactions. IgD is found on the surface of mature B cells as a surface immunoglobulin and is involved in the activation of B cells. IgM is not typically found as a dimer, but IgA can form dimers. Therefore, the primary function of the only immunoglobulin found as a dimer is related to its ability to protect against bacterial adherence and colonization of mucous membranes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

However, some mammals have the ability to produce an alternative form of antibody that is based on the ability of a single VH domain to interact with antigen in the absence of a VL domain (Fig. 4.12). It has been known for some time that the serum of camels contained abundant immunoglobulin-like material composed of heavy-chain dimers that lack associated light chains but retain the capacity to bind antigens. These antibodies are called heavy-chain-only IgGs (hcIgGs). This property is shared by other camelids, including llamas and alpacas. These species have retained the genes for the immunoglobulin light chains, and some IgG-like material in their sera remains associated with light chains, and so it is unclear what led to this particular adaptation during their evolution.

First, each chain consists of a series of similar, although not identical, sequences, each about 110 amino acids long. Each of these repeats corresponds to a discrete, compactly folded region of protein known as an immunoglobulin domain, or Ig domain. The light chain consists of two Ig domains, whereas the heavy chain of the IgG antibody contains four Ig domains (see Fig. 4.2).

            "content": "Figure 4\u201377 Schematic view of an antibody (immunoglobulin) molecule. This molecule is a complex of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. Each heavy chain contains four similar, covalently linked domains, while each light chain contains two such domains. Each domain is encoded by a separate exon, and all of the exons are thought to have evolved by the serial duplication of a single ancestral exon."

            "content": "4-1 IgG antibodies consist of four polypeptide chains. IgG antibodies are large molecules with a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa and are composed of two different kinds of polypeptide chains. One, of approximately 50 kDa, is called the heavy or H chain, and the other, of 25 kDa, is the light or L chain (Fig. 4.2). Each IgG molecule consists of two heavy chains and two light chains. The two heavy chains are linked to each other by disulfide bonds, and each heavy chain is linked to a light chain by a disulfide bond. In any given immunoglobulin molecule, the two heavy chains and the two light chains are identical, giving an antibody molecule two identical antigen-binding sites. This gives the antibody the ability to bind simultaneously to two identical antigens on a surface, thereby increasing the total strength of the interaction, which is called its avidity. The strength of the interaction between a single antigen-binding site and its antigen is called its affinity."
