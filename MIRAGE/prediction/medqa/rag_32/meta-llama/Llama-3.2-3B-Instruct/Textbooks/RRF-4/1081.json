The stiffness is worse at the end of the day. She recently retired after working for 28 years as a typist at a data entry firm. Physical examination shows swelling, joint-line tenderness, and decreased range of motion of the first metacarpophalangeal joint and the distal interphalangeal joints of the right hand. Discrete, hard, mildly tender nodules are palpated over the 2nd and 4th distal interphalangeal joints of the right hand.

The physical examination findings of swelling, joint-line tenderness, and decreased range of motion of the first metacarpophalangeal joint and the distal interphalangeal joints of the right hand are also consistent with OA. The presence of discrete, hard, mildly tender nodules over the 2nd and 4th distal interphalangeal joints is also a characteristic feature of OA. The x-ray findings of narrowing of the interphalangeal joint spaces with subchondral sclerosis and osteophytes further support this diagnosis. The patient's occupation as a typist, which involves repetitive hand movements, may have contributed to the development of OA. The patient's age and sex are also consistent with the typical demographic for OA. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's condition is degenerative disease of the joints.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

He is then switched to celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily, and on this regimen his joint symptoms and heartburn resolve. Two years later, he returns with increased joint symptoms. His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor. With the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, he is started on a regimen"

Clubbing is present when the sum of the individual digit ratios is >10. At thebedside, clubbingcanbe appreciated by having the patient place the dorsal surface of the distal phalanges of the fourth fingers together with the nails opposing each other. Normally, an open area is visible betweenthebasesoftheopposingfingernails;whenclubbingispresent, this open space is no longer visible. The base of the nail feels spongy when compressed, and the nail can be easily rocked on its bed. When clubbing is advanced, the finger may have a drumstick appearance, and the distal interphalangeal joint can be hyperextended. Periosteal involvement in the distal extremities may produce a burning or deep-seated aching pain. The pain, which can be quite incapacitating, is aggravated by dependency and relieved by elevation of the affected limbs. Pressure applied over"

Common sites include the costosternal junctions, spinous processes, iliac crests, greater trochanters, ischial tuberosities, tibial tubercles, and heels. Hip and shoulder (\u201croot\u201d joint) arthritis is considered part of the axial disease. Hip arthritis occurs in 25\u201335% of patients. Shoulder arthritis is much less common. Severe isolated hip arthritis or bony chest pain may be the presenting complaint, and symptomatic hip disease can dominate the clinical picture. Arthritis of peripheral joints other than the hips and shoulders, usually asymmetric, occurs in up to 30% of patients. Neck pain and stiffness from involvement of the cervical spine are usually relatively late manifestations but are occasionally dominant symptoms. Rare patients, particularly in the older age group, present with predominantly constitutional"

The shoulders are most affected, but half of these patients have hip or neck pain as well. Constitutional symptoms (loss of weight, fever, and anemia) and articular swelling are less consistent manifestations. A few patients have pitting edema of the hands or feet, as illustrated in the review by Salvarini and colleagues; others have knee or wrist arthritis or carpal tunnel syndrome. Arthroscopy and MRI suggest that the pain originates in a synovitis or, sometimes more accurately, a bursitis, and in an inflammation of periarticular structures. The fundamental cause is not known."

These joints are also often affected in the other patterns of PsA. Approximately 30% of patients have asymmetric oligoarthritis. This pattern commonly involves a knee or another large joint with a few small joints in the fingers or toes, often with dactylitis. Symmetric polyarthritis occurs in about 40% of PsA patients at presentation. It may be indistinguishable from RA in terms of the joints involved, but other features characteristic of PsA are usually also present. Almost any peripheral joint can be involved. Axial arthropathy without peripheral involvement is found in about 5% of PsA patients. It may be clinically indistinguishable from idiopathic AS, although more neck involvement and less thoracolumbar spinal involvement are characteristic,andnail changesarenot found inidiopathic AS.Asmall percentage of PsA patients have arthritis"
