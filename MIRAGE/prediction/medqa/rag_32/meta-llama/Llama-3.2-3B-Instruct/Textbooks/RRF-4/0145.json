    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Given the clinical presentation of the 5-year-old boy with facial swelling, pitting edema of the upper and lower extremities, periorbital edema, mild abdominal distension, and laboratory findings of proteinuria (4+), the most likely diagnosis is nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema. The proteinuria in this case is most likely due to a glomerular disease, and the presence of hematuria (blood in the urine) makes it less likely to be due to a tubular or interstitial disease. Considering the age of the patient and the clinical presentation, the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is minimal change disease (MCD), which is characterized by normal light microscopy findings. Therefore, the renal biopsy is most likely to show normal light microscopy findings. Here is the answer in the required format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The clinical presentation of the 5-year-old boy suggests nephrotic syndrome, which is most likely due to minimal change disease (MCD) given the age and clinical presentation. The normal light microscopy findings are characteristic of MCD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Flushing over the face, the V area of the neck, and the back is characteristic, as are pharyngeal injection, periorbital edema, and conjunctival suffusion. Petechiae often develop in areas of pressure, the conjunctivae, and the axillae. Back pain and tenderness to percussion at the costovertebral angle reflect massive retroperitoneal edema.

The urine should be examined for evidence of diabetes mellitus and renal disease (including microalbuminuria) since these conditions accelerate atherosclerosis. Similarly, examination of the blood should include measurements of lipids (cholesterol\u2014total, LDL, HDL\u2014and triglycerides), glucose (hemoglobin ), creatinine, hematocrit, and, if indicated based on the physical examination, thyroid function. A chest x-ray is important as it may show the consequences of IHD, i.e., cardiac enlargement, ventricular aneurysm, or signs of heart failure. These signs can support the diagnosis of IHD and are important in assessing the degree of cardiac damage. Evidence exists that an elevated level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) (specifically, between 0 and 3 mg/dL) is an independent risk factor for IHD and may be useful"

Past medical history was notable for small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, liver, and adrenals. The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced. Blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, increasing to 160/98 mmHg after 1 L of saline, with a JVP at 8 cm. There was generalized muscle weakness.

Patients with this condition present with nonspecific findings. Most patients are diagnosed after ure-teral obstruction. Patients may complain of dull or acute back or flank pain. Systemic complaints include anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, fever, and malaise. Decreased urinary out-put may ensue if the ureters become fibrotic. Because of renal artery impingement, patients are commonly hypertensive on exam. Other physical exam findings include lower extremity edema and diminished lower extremity pulses if the vessels of the lower extremities are compressed. New hydrocele or varico-cele can also be associated with fibrosis of the retroperitoneum. Laboratory analysis is also nonspecific. If there is renal obstruc-tion, patients may have elevated serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive pro-tein is elevated in most"

Calculate the amount of cholesterol in the low-density lipoproteins in an individual whose fasting blood gave the following lipid-panel test results: total cholesterol = 300 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol = 25 mg/dl, triglycerides = 150 mg/dl. A. 55 mg/dl B. 95 mg/dl C. 125 mg/dl D. 245 mg/dl Correct answer = D. The total cholesterol in the blood of a fasted individual is equal to the sum of the cholesterol in low-density lipoproteins plus the cholesterol in high-density lipoproteins plus the cholesterol in very-lowdensity lipoproteins (VLDL). This last term is calculated by dividing the triacylglycerol value by 5 because cholesterol accounts for about 1/5 of the volume of VLDL in fasted blood. For Questions 18.3 and 18.4, use the following scenario."

At admission, his blood glucose was 24 mg/dl (age-referenced normal is 60\u2013100). His urine was negative for ketone bodies and positive for a variety of dicarboxylic acids. Blood carnitine levels (free and acyl bound) were normal. A tentative diagnosis of medium-chain fatty acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is made. In patients with MCAD deficiency, the fasting hypoglycemia is a consequence of: A. decreased acetyl coenzyme A production. B. decreased ability to convert acetyl coenzyme A to glucose. C. increased conversion of acetyl coenzyme A to acetoacetate. D. increased production of ATP and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide."

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

The diagnosis is established by two of the following three criteria: (1) typical abdominal pain in the epigastrium that may radiate to the back, (2) threefold or greater elevation in serum lipase and/or amylase, and (3) confirmatory findings of acute pancreatitis on cross-sectional abdominal imaging. Patients also have associated nausea, emesis, fever, tachycardia, and abnormal findings on abdominal examination. Laboratory studies may reveal leukocytosis, hypocalcemia, and hyperglycemia. Although not required for diagnosis, markers of severity may include hemoconcentration (hematocrit >44%), admission azotemia (BUN >22 mg/dL), SIRS, and signs of organ failure (Table 371-3)."

The onset is nonspecific with headache, malaise, and fever. A pale, rose-red macular or maculopapular rash appears in 90% of cases. The rash begins peripherally and spreads to involve the entire body, including palms and soles. The early rash blanches on pressure and is accentuated by warmth. It progresses over hours or days to a petechial and purpuric eruption that appears first on the feet and ankles, then the wrists and hands, and progresses centripetally to the trunk and head. Myalgias, especially of the lower extremities, and intractable headaches are common. Severe cases progress with splenomegaly, myocarditis, renal impairment, pneumonitis, and shock."
