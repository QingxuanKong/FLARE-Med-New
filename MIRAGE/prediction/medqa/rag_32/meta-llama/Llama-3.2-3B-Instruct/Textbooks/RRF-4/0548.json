    "question": "A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",

The patient now presents with fever, increased cough, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph.

The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings suggest a possible reactivation of TB. The patient's CD4+ T cell count is still low, and the patient is immunocompromised due to HIV infection. The patient should be switched to a regimen that is more effective against TB, which is rifampin-streptomycin-ethambutol. The addition of streptomycin is necessary because the patient has not responded to the initial regimen and has a higher risk of drug-resistant TB. The antiretroviral therapy should be continued without any change to ensure the patient remains on effective HIV treatment. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of treatment failure or drug resistance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

Hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, signifying involvement of the mononuclear phagocyte system by the opportunistic pathogen, is common, as are gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and malabsorption. Pulmonary involvement is often indistinguishable from tuberculosis in patients with AIDS. Disseminated M. avium complex infection in patients with AIDS tends to occur late in the clinical course, when CD4+ T cell counts have fallen below 100 cells/\u00b5L. Hence, tissue examination usually does not reveal granulomas; instead, foamy macrophages \u201cstuffed\u201d with atypical mycobacteria typically are seen.

Patients with cavitary pulmonary TB and delayed sputum-culture conversion (i.e., those who remain culture-positive at 2 months) should be tested immediately for drug-resistant TB, and a change of regimen should be considered. To prevent isoniazid-related neuropathy, pyridoxine (10\u201325 mg/d) should be added to the regimen given to persons at high risk of vitamin B6 deficiency (e.g., alcoholics; malnourished persons; pregnant and lactating women; and patients with conditions such as chronic renal failure, diabetes, and HIV infection, which are also associated with neuropathy).

Rifapentine is lipophilic and has a prolonged half-life that permits weekly or twice-weekly dosing. Therefore, this drug is the subject of intensive clinical investigation aimed at determining optimal dosing and frequency of administration. Currently, rifapentine is an alternative to rifampin in the continuation phase of treatment for noncavitary drug-susceptible pulmonary TB in HIV-seronegative patients who have negative sputum smears at completion of the initial phase of treatment. When administered in these specific circumstances, rifapentine (10 mg/kg, up to 600 mg) is given once weekly with isoniazid. Because of higher rates of relapse, this regimen is not recommended for patients with TB disease and HIV co-infection. A large randomized controlled trial recently demonstrated that, for latent TB, a 12-dose (3-month) regimen of weekly DOT with a weight-based dose of"

In the setting of fulminant disease one cannot rely on the accuracy of a negative PPD skin test to rule out a diagnosis of TB. In addition, IFN-\u03b3 release assays may be difficult to interpret due to high backgrounds as a consequence of HIV-associated immune activation. TB is one of the conditions associated with HIV infection for which cure is possible with appropriate therapy. Therapy for TB is generally the same in the HIV-infected patient as in the HIV-negative patient (Chap. 202). Due to the possibility of multidrug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant TB, drug susceptibility testing should be performed to guide therapy. Due to pharmacokinetic interactions, adjusted doses of rifabutin should be substituted for rifampin in patients receiving the HIV protease inhibitors or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Treatment is most effective in programs that involve directly observed therapy. Initiation of cART"

For these reasons, it is strongly recommended that all patients with CD4+ T cell counts <200/\u03bcL (or a CD4 percentage <15) receive some form of PCP prophylaxis. The incidence of PCP is approaching zero in patients with known HIV infection receiving appropriate cART and prophylaxis. In the United States, primary PCP is now occurring at a median CD4+ T cell count of 36/ \u03bcL, while secondary PCP is occurring at a median CD4+ T cell count of 10/\u03bcL. Patients with PCP generally present with fever and a cough that is usually nonproductive or productive of only scant amounts of white sputum. They may complain of a characteristic retrosternal chest pain that is worse on inspiration and is described as sharp or burning.

As noted above, patients with cavitary disease in whom sputum culture conversion does not occur by 2 months require immediate testing for drug resistance. When a patient\u2019s sputum cultures remain positive at \u22653 months, treatment failure and drug resistance or poor adherence to the regimen are likely, and testing of drug resistance should guide the choice of the best treatment option (see below). A sputum specimen should be collected by the end of treatment to document cure. If mycobacterial cultures are not practical, then monitoring by AFB smear examination should be undertaken at 2, 5, and 6 months. Smears that are positive after 3 months of treatment when the patient is known to be adherent are indicative of treatment failure and possible drug resistance. Therefore, if not done at the start of treatment, drug susceptibility testing is mandatory at this stage. Bacteriologic monitoring of"
