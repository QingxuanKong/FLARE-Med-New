    "question": "A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient has a past medical history of asthma and cocaine use. His current medications include albuterol and ibuprofen. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 70/35 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On initial trauma evaluation, his airway is intact and he is breathing spontaneously. The patient's dorsalis pedis and radial pulses are palpable bilaterally. His Glasgow Coma Scale is 9. Head to toe examination reveals instability of the pelvis when downwards force is applied. The patient is started on IV fluids and norepinephrine, and a pelvic binder is placed. The patient's vitals are measured again and his temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 100/55 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. A blood transfusion is started, and the patient is given hydromorphone. The patient suddenly becomes short of breath with notable bilateral wheezing with poor air movement. His blood pressure is 60/35 mmHg and pulse is 160/min. The patient is treated appropriately, intubated, stabilized, and transferred to the surgical intensive care unit. Which of the following is most likely to be found in this patient's history?",

The patient has a history of asthma and cocaine use, and he is presenting with respiratory distress, wheezing, and decreased oxygen saturation after receiving a blood transfusion. These symptoms suggest an allergic reaction to the blood transfusion. The patient's history of asthma and cocaine use may also be relevant, but the primary concern is the acute reaction to the transfusion. The patient's symptoms and signs, such as hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased oxygen saturation, are consistent with anaphylactic shock. The correct answer is related to the patient's immune system and the reaction to the blood transfusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

First it must be determined whether the patient is breathing and has a clear airway and obtainable pulse and blood pressure, and whether there is hemorrhage from a scalp laceration or injured viscera. Severe head injuries that arrest respiration are soon followed by cessation of cardiac function. Injuries of this magnitude are often fatal; if resuscitative measures do not restore and sustain cardiopulmonary function within 4 to 5 min, the brain is usually irreparably damaged. Bleeding from the scalp can usually be controlled by a pressure bandage unless an artery is divided; then a suture becomes necessary. Resuscitative measures (artificial respiration and cardiac compression) should be continued until they are taken over by ambulance personnel. Oxygen should then be administered."

Past medical history was notable for small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, liver, and adrenals. The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced. Blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, increasing to 160/98 mmHg after 1 L of saline, with a JVP at 8 cm. There was generalized muscle weakness.

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

Pul-monary artery catheters are reserved for patients with severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction.In addition to confirming the diagnosis of dissection and defining its acuity and extent, the initial evaluation focuses on determining whether any of several life-threatening compli-cations are present.

Regardless of the cause of weakness, endotracheal intubation should be considered when the MIF falls to <\u201325 cmH2O or the VC is <1 L. Also, patients with severe palatal weakness may require endotracheal intubation in order to prevent acute upper airway obstruction or recurrent aspiration. Arterial blood gases and oxygen saturation from pulse oximetry are used to follow patients with potential respiratory compromise from PNS dysfunction. However, intubation and mechanical ventilation should be undertaken based on clinical assessment rather than waiting until oxygen saturation drops or CO2 retention develops from hypoventilation. Noninvasive mechanical ventilation may be considered initially in lieu of endotracheal intubation but is"
