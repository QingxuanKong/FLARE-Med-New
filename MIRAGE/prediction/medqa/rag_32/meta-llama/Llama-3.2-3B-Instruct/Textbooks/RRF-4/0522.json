His last bowel movement was yesterday and he has not passed flatus since then. He underwent appendectomy at the age of 39. He has psoriasis, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic back pain. He drinks two beers daily. He takes a topical corticosteroid, ramipril, metformin, and ibuprofen daily. He is 176 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 108 kg (240 lb); BMI is 35.4 kg/m2. His temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 112/67 mm Hg. Examination shows thick, scaly, plaques over both elbows and knees. Abdominal examination shows three well-healed laparoscopic scars. The abdomen is distended and there are frequent, high-pitched bowel sounds on auscultation. Digital rectal examination shows an empty rectum.

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely cause of the patient's condition, let's analyze the provided information: 1. The patient presents with a 2-day history of increasingly severe abdominal pain, nausea, and bilious vomiting. These symptoms suggest an obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract. 2. The patient has a history of appendectomy, which is a surgical procedure to remove the appendix. However, the patient's symptoms do not seem to be related to the appendix. 3. The patient has a history of chronic back pain and psoriasis, but these conditions are not directly related to the current symptoms. 4. The patient's laboratory studies show normal liver enzymes and a normal white blood cell count, which makes an infectious cause less likely. 5. The abdominal ultrasound shows nonpropulsive peristalsis of the small bowel, which suggests a mechanical obstruction. 6. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with a diagnosis of small bowel obstruction. Considering the options provided: A. Chronic inflammatory bowel disease is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis. B. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can cause gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers, but it is not the most likely cause of small bowel obstruction. C. History of abdominal surgery, specifically the laparoscopic appendectomy, is a significant risk factor for small bowel obstruction due to adhesions or hernias. D. Alcohol is not mentioned in the patient's history, and there is no evidence to suggest that alcohol consumption is contributing to the patient's condition. Based on the analysis, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is his history of abdominal surgery, specifically the laparoscopic appendectomy, which increases the risk of small bowel obstruction due to adhesions or hernias. answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

            "content": "Philip J. Rosenthal, MD A 5-year-old American girl presents with a 1-week history of intermittent chills, fever, and sweats. She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

Plasma Na+ concentration increased to 140 meq/L with a BUN of 23 and creatinine of 1.4, at which point demeclocycline was reduced to 300 mg PO bid.

The patient had noted progressive weakness over several days, to the point that he was unable to rise from bed. Past medical history was notable for small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, liver, and adrenals. The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced. Blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, increasing to 160/98 mmHg after 1 L of saline, with a JVP at 8 cm. There was generalized muscle weakness.

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"
