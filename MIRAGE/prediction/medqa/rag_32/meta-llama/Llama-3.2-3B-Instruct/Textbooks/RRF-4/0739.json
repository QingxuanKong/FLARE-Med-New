    "question": "A 30-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by ambulance after being involved in a motor vehicle collision. He was driving a motorcycle and collided with a bus. The EMT personnel found the patient alert with anterograde amnesia for the several minutes preceding the accident. Vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, the patient is drowsy but follows commands. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. The remainder of the initial examination is unremarkable. While the patient is being transferred to observation, his level of consciousness acutely declines. Repeat vital signs are significant for a blood pressure of 190/110 mm Hg. Ophthalmic examination now shows a fixed and dilated left pupil with no pupillary light reflex. A noncontrast CT of the head is performed and is shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely etiology of the patient's condition, we need to analyze the symptoms and examination findings. The patient was involved in a motor vehicle collision and had anterograde amnesia for several minutes preceding the accident, which suggests a possible head injury. Upon examination, the patient was drowsy but followed commands, with equal, round, and reactive pupils to light. However, his level of consciousness acutely declined, and a fixed and dilated left pupil with no pupillary light reflex was observed. The noncontrast CT of the head is pending, but these findings suggest a possible intracranial hemorrhage or mass lesion. Given the acute onset of symptoms and the fixed dilated pupil, the most likely etiology is a mass lesion in the brain, such as an epidural hematoma or subdural hematoma. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a traumatic brain injury, and the fixed dilated pupil on the same side as the hematoma is a classic sign of transtentorial herniation, which can occur in these conditions. The middle meningeal artery is a common site for injury in traumatic brain injuries, and tearing of this artery can lead to an epidural hematoma. Dural arteriovenous fistula, Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysm, and arteriovenous malformation are less likely to present with such acute and severe symptoms. Therefore, the most likely etiology of this patient's condition is tearing of the middle meningeal artery, which is a common cause of epidural hematoma in traumatic brain injuries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

These three responses are assessed by the Glasgow Coma Scale; a score between 3 and 15 is assigned (Table 457e-1). Over 85% of patients with aggregate scores of <5 die within 24 h. However, a number of patients with slightly higher scores, including a few without pupillary light responses, survive, suggesting that an initially aggressive approach is justified in most patients. Patients <20 years old, particularly children, may make remarkable recoveries after having grave early neurologic signs. In one large study of severe head injury, 55% of children had a good outcome at 1 year, compared with 21% of adults. Older age, increased ICP, early hypoxia or hypotension, compression of the brainstem on CT or MRI, and a delay in the evacuation of large intracranial hemorrhages are indicators of a poor prognosis."

The prognosis is better for patients with intact brainstem function, as indicated by normal pupillary light responses and intact oculocephalic (doll\u2019s eyes), oculovestibular (caloric), and corneal reflexes. Absence of these reflexes and the presence of persistently dilated pupils that do not react to light are grave prognostic signs. A low likelihood of a favorable outcome from hypoxic-ischemic coma is strongly suggested by an absent pupillary light reflex or extensor or absent motor response to pain on day 3 following the injury, excluding patients with metabolic disturbances and those treated with high-dose barbiturates or hypothermia, which confound interpretation of these signs.

The diagnosis can be established rapidly by revealing a lens-shaped clot with a smooth inner margin with CT and MRI (Fig. 34-8). Death, which is frequent if an expanding clot is not removed surgically, comes at the end of a comatose period and is a result of respiratory arrest. The visualization of a fracture line across the groove of the middle meningeal artery and knowledge of which side of the head was struck (the clot is on that side) are of aid in diagnosis and lateralization of the lesion.

Stated another way, coma generally cannot be attributed to elevated ICP alone. Only when ICP exceeds 40 to 50 mm Hg does cerebral blood flow diminish to a degree that results in loss of consciousness. Further elevations are followed imminently by global ischemia and brain death. From our own observations, the brain shift and herniation that causes the pupil to dilate on the side of a mass lesion generally occurs at an ICP of 28 to 34 mm Hg. (Again, this is not a direct effect of the elevated ICP.) There are instances in which the dissociation between ICP and clinical signs is striking, for example, a mass in the medial temporal lobe that is contiguous to the third nerve will compress the nerve at a time when ICP is little raised, and slowly growing lesions, which raise ICP slowly and allow for"

First it must be determined whether the patient is breathing and has a clear airway and obtainable pulse and blood pressure, and whether there is hemorrhage from a scalp laceration or injured viscera. Severe head injuries that arrest respiration are soon followed by cessation of cardiac function. Injuries of this magnitude are often fatal; if resuscitative measures do not restore and sustain cardiopulmonary function within 4 to 5 min, the brain is usually irreparably damaged. Bleeding from the scalp can usually be controlled by a pressure bandage unless an artery is divided; then a suture becomes necessary. Resuscitative measures (artificial respiration and cardiac compression) should be continued until they are taken over by ambulance personnel. Oxygen should then be administered."

Rarely, if these abnormalities are sufficiently intense, death may occur at the moment of impact, presumably from respiratory arrest. In its mildest form, there is no apparent loss of consciousness or collapse, only a brief period of stunned disorientation, staggering, and amnesia during which the individual appears outwardly normal.

Conversely, the absence of these brainstem reflexes even after circulation and oxygenation have been restored, particularly pupils that fail to react to light, implies a grave outlook as elaborated further on. If the damage is almost total, coma persists, decerebrate postures may be present spontaneously or in response to painful stimuli, and bilateral Babinski signs can be evoked.

A unilaterally enlarged (\u201cHuthcinson\u201d) pupil is an early indicator of stretching or compression of the third nerve and reflects the presence of an overlying ipsilateral hemispheral mass as described earlier in the section on herniations. A loss of light reaction usually precedes enlargement of the pupil. As a transitional phenomenon, the pupil may become oval or pear-shaped or appear to be off center (corectopia) because of a differential loss of innervation of a portion of the pupillary sphincter. The light-unreactive pupil continues to enlarge to a size of 6 to 9 mm diameter and is soon joined by a slight outward deviation of the eye. In unusual instances, the pupil contralateral to the mass may enlarge first; this has reportedly been the case in 10 percent of subdural hematomas but has been far less frequent in our experience. As midbrain displacement continues, both pupils dilate and become unreactive to light,"

The patient\u2019s behavior is normal except for a very characteristic incessant, repetitive questioning about his immediate circumstances\u2014usually of the identical question over and over at intervals of 20 to 60 s after a response to the query has already been given by the examiner (e.g., \u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d; \u201cHow did we get here?\u201d). Curiously, even the inflection used in questioning is repeated. Unlike psychomotor epilepsy, the"

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

            "content": "The physician first called on to examine a patient who has had a closed head injury will generally find one of three clinical conditions as indicated by the headings below, each of which is dealt with differently. It is usually possible to categorize the patient by assessing the mental and neurologic status when first seen and at intervals after the accident. The Glasgow Coma Scale has been used for almost 50 years as a rapid reference to accomplish this purpose (Table 34-1) but does not substitute for a fuller neurologic examination. The scale registers three aspects of neurologic function: eye opening, verbal response, and motor response to various stimuli. The scale uses a summed score from 3 to 15; a score of 7 or less is considered to reflect severe trauma and a poor clinical state, 8 to 12, moderate injury, and higher scores, mild injury. The scores provided by this scale correspond roughly with the outcome of the head injury as discussed further on, but its main utility is in"

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing.

The manner in which the patient tells the story of his illness may betray confusion or incoherence in thinking, impairment of memory or judgment, or difficulty in comprehending or expressing ideas. A more extensive examination of attention, memory, cognitive ability, and language is undertaken if the history or the manner in which it is given indicates the problem lies in those spheres. Otherwise, asking the date and place, repeating and recalling words, and simple arithmetic are adequate screening procedures. One then proceeds from an examination of the cranial nerves to the testing of motor, reflex, and sensory functions of the upper and lower limbs. This is followed by an assessment of gait and station (standing position) are observed before or after the rest of the examination."

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"
