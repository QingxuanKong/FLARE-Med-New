    "question": "Two hours after undergoing open cholecystectomy for complicated cholecystitis, a 48-year-old woman develops dizziness, lethargy, abdominal pain, and nausea. She has systemic lupus erythematosus and hypertension. Prior to hospitalization, her medications included nifedipine and prednisolone. Her pulse is 112/min and blood pressure is 90/64 mm Hg. Examination shows central obesity. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, and the laparoscopic incisions have no discharge. Her serum cortisol and serum ACTH are decreased. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient?",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To answer this question, let's analyze the provided documents step by step: 1. The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is on prednisolone, a corticosteroid, and nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker. 2. The patient underwent open cholecystectomy for complicated cholecystitis. 3. Post-operatively, the patient develops dizziness, lethargy, abdominal pain, and nausea. 4. The patient's pulse is 112/min and blood pressure is 90/64 mm Hg, indicating hypotension. 5. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, and the laparoscopic incisions have no discharge. 6. The serum cortisol and ACTH levels are decreased. Given these details, we can consider the potential side effects of long-term corticosteroid use, such as: - Mineralocorticoid deficiency: This can cause hyponatremia due to the loss of aldosterone, which regulates sodium levels in the body. 7. Considering the options provided: A. Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or medication side effects. B. Hyperkalemia is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or medication side effects. C. Hyperglycemia is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or medication side effects. D. Hyponatremia is a potential side effect of mineralocorticoid deficiency, which can occur with long-term corticosteroid use. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient is hyponatremia. Here's the output in the required format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is on prednisolone, a corticosteroid, and nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker. The patient underwent open cholecystectomy for complicated cholecystitis and develops symptoms of mineralocorticoid deficiency after surgery. The decreased serum cortisol and ACTH levels support this diagnosis. Hyponatremia is a potential side effect of mineralocorticoid deficiency, which can occur with long-term corticosteroid use.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The clear trend is toward earlier surgery, and this is due in part to requirements for shorter hospital stays. Urgent (emergency) cholecystectomy or cholecystostomy is probably appropriate in most patients in whom a complication of acute cholecystitis such as empyema, emphysematous cholecystitis, or perforation is suspected or confirmed. Patients with uncomplicated acute cholecystitis should undergo early elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, ideally within 48\u201372 h after diagnosis. The complication rate is not increased in patients undergoing early as opposed to delayed (>6 weeks after diagnosis) cholecystectomy.

The diagnosis is established by two of the following three criteria: (1) typical abdominal pain in the epigastrium that may radiate to the back, (2) threefold or greater elevation in serum lipase and/or amylase, and (3) confirmatory findings of acute pancreatitis on cross-sectional abdominal imaging. Patients also have associated nausea, emesis, fever, tachycardia, and abnormal findings on abdominal examination. Laboratory studies may reveal leukocytosis, hypocalcemia, and hyperglycemia. Although not required for diagnosis, markers of severity may include hemoconcentration (hematocrit >44%), admission azotemia (BUN >22 mg/dL), SIRS, and signs of organ failure (Table 371-3)."

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

At her annual physical examination, a 53-year-old middle school teacher complains that she has been having difficulty falling asleep, and after falling asleep, she awakens several times during the night. These episodes now occur almost nightly and are interfering with her ability to teach. She has tried various over-the-counter sleep remedies, but they were of little help and she experienced \u201changover\u201d effects on the day following their use.

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

She eats a low-sugar diet and regularly eats packaged frozen meals for dinner because she doesn\u2019t have time to cook regularly. Her most recent laboratory values include a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that is above goal at 160 mg/dL (goal < 100 mg/dL) and a hemo-globin A1c that is well controlled at 6%. Her blood pressure is high at 160/100 mm Hg. Her prescription medications include simvastatin, metformin, and benazepril.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

In 25%, however, a complication of acute cholecystitis will occur despite conservative treatment (see below). In this setting, prompt surgical intervention is required. Of the 75% of patients with acute cholecystitis who undergo remission of symptoms, \u223c25% will experience a recurrence of cholecystitis within 1 year, and 60% will have at least one recurrent bout within 6 years. In view of the natural history of the disease, acute cholecystitis is best treated by early surgery whenever possible."

She finds hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis and suspects Addison\u2019s disease. She performs a standard ACTH 1\u201324 stimulation test, which reveals an insufficient plasma cortisol response compatible with primary adrenal insuf-ficiency. The diagnosis of autoimmune Addison\u2019s disease is made, and the patient must start replacement of the hormones he cannot produce himself. How should this patient be treated? What precautions should he take?"
