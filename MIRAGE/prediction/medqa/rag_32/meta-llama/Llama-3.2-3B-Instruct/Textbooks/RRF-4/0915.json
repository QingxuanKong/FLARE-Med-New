To answer this question, we need to understand the effects of parvovirus B19 infection on the fetus. According to the provided documents, parvovirus B19 infection in pregnant women can lead to fetal hydrops fetalis, which is a condition characterized by an accumulation of fluid in the fetus, potentially leading to fetal death. However, the provided documents do not mention that fetal loss occurs in more than 40% of primary infections. Additionally, parvovirus B19 infection in neonates can cause transient aplastic crisis, not hydrops fetalis. The slapped-cheek rash is characteristic of erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) in children, not neonates. Therefore, the correct answer can be determined by evaluating the potential effects of parvovirus B19 infection on the fetus and eliminating the incorrect options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Several days later, a bright red rash with erythroderma afects the face and gives a slapped-cheek appearance. The rash becomes lacelike and spreads to the trunk and extremities. Adults often have milder rashes and develop symmetrical polyarthralgia that may persist several weeks. Mayama and associates (2014) described a pregnant woman in whom B 19 infection was associated with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. No evidence suggests that parvovirus infection is altered by pregnancy. With recovery, IgM antibody is generated 7 to 10 days postinfection, and production persists for 3 to 4 months. Several days after IgM is produced, IgG antibody is detectable and persists for life with natural immunity (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2017)."

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

Physical examina-tion reveals a pale woman with diminished vibration sen-sation, diminished spinal reflexes, and extensor plantar reflexes (Babinski sign). Examination of her oral cavity reveals atrophic glossitis, in which the tongue appears deep red in color and abnormally smooth and shiny due to atro-phy of the lingual papillae. Laboratory testing reveals a mac-rocytic anemia based on a hematocrit of 30% (normal for women, 37\u201348%), a hemoglobin concentration of 9.4 g/dL, an erythrocyte mean cell volume (MCV) of 123 fL (nor-mal, 84\u201399 fL), an erythrocyte mean cell hemoglobin con-centration (MCHC) of 34% (normal, 31\u201336%), and a low reticulocyte count. Further laboratory testing reveals a normal serum folate concentration and a serum vitamin B12 (cobalamin) concentration"

The distribution of the affected joints is often symmetrical, with arthralgia affecting the small joints of the hands and occasionally the ankles, knees, and wrists. Resolution usually occurs within a few weeks, but recurring symptoms can continue for months. The illness may mimic rheumatoid arthritis, and rheumatoid factor can often be detected in serum. B19V infection may trigger rheumatoid disease in some patients and has been associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis."

Neither the patient nor the family physician had any concerns about the pregnancy. However, the patient did complain of unilateral swelling of her left leg, which had gradually increased over the previous 2 days. Furthermore, the evening before her visit she developed some sharp chest pain, which was exacerbated by deep breaths. The family physician ordered a duplex ultrasound scan of the left leg venous system. Ultrasound scanning of the vascular tree can demonstrate flow and occlusion of arteries and veins."
