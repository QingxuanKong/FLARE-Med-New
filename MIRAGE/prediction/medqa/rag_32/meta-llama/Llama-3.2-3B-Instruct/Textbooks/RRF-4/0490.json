Two days ago, his mother found that he had left the gas on in the kitchen, and he was unable to smell the odor of the gas. As a child, he was consistently in the 40th percentile for height; now he is in the 15th percentile. He had bilateral orchidopexy for cryptorchidism as an infant.

The patient also has Tanner stage 1 genitals, which is consistent with primary hypogonadism. The patient's inability to identify common odors and the presence of cryptorchidism (bilateral orchidopexy as an infant) suggest a problem with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The patient's sense of smell is related to the olfactory system, which is closely linked to the hypothalamus, a region of the brain that plays a crucial role in regulating various bodily functions, including puberty and hormone production. Given the patient's symptoms, the most likely underlying cause is a problem with the migration of GnRH neurons, which could be due to a genetic disorder or a condition that affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. This would explain the patient's hypogonadism, delayed growth, and impaired sense of smell.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

In girls the estrogeneffect manifests as breast development, uterine increase,and, eventually, menarche. Both boys and girls manifest the androgen effect as adult body odor, pubic and axillary hair,and facial skin oiliness and acne. In boys it is also importantto note whether the testes are enlarged more than 2.5 cm inlength (4 mL volume), which implies gonadarche. If the testes are not enlarged but virilization is progressing, the source of the androgens may be the adrenal glands or exogenous sources."

Pubarche results from adrenal maturation or adrenarche and is marked with the appearance of pubic hair; other features include oiliness of hair and skin, acne, axillary hair, and body odor. Gonadarche is characterized by increasing secretion of gonadal sex steroids as a result of the maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. These sex steroids differ by gender, consisting of testosterone from the testes and estradiol and progesterone from the ovaries. In males physical signs are pubic hair, axillary hair, facial hair, increased muscularity, deeper voice, increased penile size, and increased testicular volume. In females the physical signs are breast development, development of the female body habitus, increased size of the uterus, and menarche with regular menstrual cycles.

The Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome ofcongenital absence of the uterus occurs in 1 in 4000 to 5000female births. Anatomic obstruction by imperforate hymen orvaginal septum also presents with normal secondary sexualdevelopment without menstruation. The complete syndromeof androgen insensitivity includes normal feminization, absence of pubic or axillary hair, and primary amenorrhea.In this syndrome, all m\u00fcllerian structures, including ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper third of the vagina, are lacking; the karyotype is 46,XY, and subjects have intra-abdominal testes."

            "content": "All environmental chemicals necessary for life enter the body by the nose and mouth. The senses of smell (olfaction) and taste (gustation) monitor such chemicals, determine the flavor and palatability of foods and beverages, and warn of dangerous environmental conditions, including fire, air pollution, leaking natural gas, and bacteria-laden foodstuffs. These senses contribute significantly to quality of life and, when dysfunctional, can have untoward physical and psychological consequences. A basic understanding of these senses in health and disease is critical for the physician, because thousands of patients present to doctors\u2019 offices each year with complaints of chemosensory dysfunction. Among the more important recent developments in neurology is the discovery that decreased smell function is among the first signs, if not the first sign, of such neurodegenerative diseases as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), signifying their \u201cpresymptomatic\u201d phase."

In boys, if the penis appears short, it should be measured and compared with known age-related data. Ambiguous genitalia often are associated with endocrinologic disorders, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (girls have masculinized external genitalia, but male genitalia may be unaffected), or chromosomal disorders such as 45,X/46,XY mosaicism or possibly secondary to a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome (see Chapters 174 and 177). Although hypospadias, which occurs in 1 in 300 newborn boys, is a common congenital malformation that often occurs as an isolated defect, if it is associated with other anomalies, especially cryptorchidism, there is a strong possibility of a syndrome."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor.

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."
