    "question": "A 62-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of difficulties walking for the past year. He has had multiple falls over the past 4 months. Over the past 6 months, he has had progressive urinary urgency and now wears an adult diaper as is not always able to control the urge to void. His appetite has also decreased in this time period. He used to drive, but his wife convinced him to stop after she noticed that he was becoming increasingly inattentive while driving. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Current medications include ramipril and metformin. His temperature is 37.1C (98.8F), pulse is 90/min and blood pressure is 132/88 mm Hg. Examination shows a broad-based gait with slow and short steps. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. On mental status examination, he is oriented to person and place but not to time. Attention and concentration are impaired. He recalls only one of three objects after 5 minutes. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking for the given question: The patient presents with a 1-year history of difficulties walking, multiple falls over the past 4 months, progressive urinary urgency, and decreased appetite. The patient's symptoms suggest a decline in cognitive function, particularly in attention and concentration. The patient's broad-based gait, slow and short steps, and impaired attention and concentration on mental status examination are indicative of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The patient's symptoms are consistent with the clinical features of frontotemporal dementia, which is a type of dementia that affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. The patient's decreased appetite and urinary urgency may also be related to the frontal lobe dysfunction. The treatment options provided are: A. Ventricular shunting: This is a surgical procedure typically used to treat hydrocephalus, which is not indicated in this case. B. Acetazolamide therapy: This medication is used to treat glaucoma and epilepsy, but it is not a standard treatment for frontotemporal dementia. C. Temporal lobectomy: This is a surgical procedure that involves removing part of the temporal lobe, which is sometimes used to treat epilepsy. However, it is not a standard treatment for frontotemporal dementia. D. Donepezil therapy: Donepezil is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which is a standard treatment for Alzheimer's disease, but it is also used off-label to treat frontotemporal dementia. Based on the patient's symptoms and clinical features, the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms is Donepezil therapy.

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction.

His heart fail-ure must be treated first, followed by careful control of the hypertension. He was initially treated with a diuretic (furo-semide, 40 mg twice daily). On this therapy, he was less short of breath on exertion and could also lie flat without dyspnea. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhib-itor was added (enalapril, 20 mg twice daily), and over the next few weeks, he continued to feel better. Because of continued shortness of breath on exercise, digoxin at 0.25 mg/d was added with a further modest improvement in exercise tolerance. The blood pressure stabilized at 150/90 mm Hg, and the patient will be educated regarding the relation between his hypertension and heart failure and the need for better blood pressure control. Cautious addition of a \u03b2 blocker (metoprolol) will be considered. Blood lipids, which are currently in the normal range, will be monitored."

A potentially treatable form of dementia that is thought to arise from impaired CSF out\ufb02ow from the brain. Symptoms include the classic triad of dementia, gait apraxia, and urinary incontinence. Headaches and other signs of \u2191 ICP (e.g., papilledema) typically do not appear, although continuous ICP monitoring may reveal spikes of elevated pressure. If a patient shows abrupt changes in symptoms over time rather than a steady decline, think vascular dementia. If a patient presents with rapid cognitive decline over the course of weeks to months, think CJD. The diagnosis is suggested by clinical features. The gait is classically described as \u201cmagnetic\u201d or with \u201cfeet glued to the \ufb02oor,\u201d as the forefoot is not completely dorsally extended. LP or continuous lumbar CSF drainage for several days reveals normal pressure but may cause clinically significant improvement of the patient\u2019s symptoms."

In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."

His physician initially prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic commonly used to treat hyper-tension. His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic. Because the patient had elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, hydrochlorothiazide was replaced with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril lowered his blood pressure to almost normotensive levels. However, after several weeks on enalapril, the patient returned complaining of a persistent cough. In addition, some signs of angioedema were detected. How does enalapril lower blood pressure? Why does it occasionally cause coughing and angioedema? What other drugs could be used to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and decrease blood pressure,"

The history should include a review of medications that may affect the ANS (Table 454-6). The main classes of drugs that may cause OH are diuretics, antihypertensives, antidepressants, ethanol, narcotics, insulin, dopamine agonists, barbiturates, and calcium channel-blocking agents. However, the precipitation of OH by medications may also be the first sign of an underlying autonomic disorder. The history may reveal an underlying cause for symptoms (e.g., diabetes, Parkinson\u2019s disease) or specific underlying mechanisms (e.g., cardiac pump failure, reduced intravascular volume).
