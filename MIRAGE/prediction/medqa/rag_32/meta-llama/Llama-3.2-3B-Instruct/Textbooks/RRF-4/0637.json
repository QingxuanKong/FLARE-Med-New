    "question": "A 12-year-old girl is brought to your psychiatry office by her parents, who are concerned that she has not made any friends since starting middle school last year. The girl tells you that she gets nervous around other children, as she cannot tell what they are feeling, when they are joking, or what she has in common with them. Her teachers describe her as \u201ceasily distracted\u201d and \u201ceasily upset by change.\u201d When asked about her hobbies and interests, she states that \u201cmarine biology\u201d is her only interest and gives you a 15-minute unsolicited explanation of how to identify different penguin species. Mental status exam is notable for intense eye contact, flat affect, and concrete thought process. Which of the following is true regarding this child\u2019s disorder?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 12-year-old girl who is experiencing social anxiety and difficulty making friends. She is easily distracted, easily upset by change, and has a flat affect. She is intensely focused on her hobby of marine biology and has a concrete thought process. The mental status exam is notable for intense eye contact, flat affect, and a concrete thought process. These symptoms are characteristic of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects social interaction, communication, and behavior. The question asks which of the following is true regarding this child's disorder. Let's evaluate the options: A. Boys are more commonly affected than girls: This is incorrect. Research suggests that girls with ASD are more likely to be diagnosed later and less likely to receive a diagnosis than boys. B. Impaired attention is a key feature of the disorder: This is incorrect. Impaired attention is not a characteristic of ASD. In fact, individuals with ASD often have enhanced attention to detail and focus on specific interests. C. Intellectual disability is a key feature of the disorder: This is incorrect. While some individuals with ASD may also have intellectual disability, it is not a key feature of the disorder. In fact, many individuals with ASD have average or above-average intelligence. D. Typical age of onset is 3-5 years of age: This is correct. The typical age of onset for ASD is around 3-5 years of age, although symptoms may be present earlier or later in life. The correct answer is D. Typical age of onset is 3-5 years of age.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

They cannot stay at their desks, take turns in reciting, be quiet, or control their impulsivity. The teacher finds it difficult to discipline them and the school often insists that the parents seek medical consultation for the child. A few are so hyperactive that they cannot attend regular classes. Their behavior verges on the \u201corganic drivenness\u201d that has been known to occur in children whose brains have been injured by encephalitis. In certain families, the disorder is probably inherited (Biederman et al). In about half the hyperactivity subsides gradually by puberty or soon thereafter, but in the remainder the symptoms persist in modified form into adulthood (Weiss et al)."

Rapport usually can be established quickly if the parents sense that the clinician respects them and is genuinelyinterested in listening to their concerns. The clinician develops rapport with the child by engaging the child in developmentally appropriate conversation or play, perhaps providingtoys while interviewing the parents, and being sensitive to thefears the child may have. Too often the child is ignored until itis time for the physical examination. Similar to their parents,children feel more comfortable if they are greeted by name and involved in pleasant interactions before they are askedsensitive questions or threatened with examinations. Youngchildren can be engaged in conversation on the parent\u2019s lap,which provides security and places the child at the eye levelof the examiner."

This calm attitude toward a turbulent illness and seemingly disabling physical signs is so common that it has been singled out as an important characteristic of hysteria, la belle indifference. Other patients, however, are obviously tense and anxious and report frank anxiety attacks. Emotional reactions are superficial and scenes that are disturbing to others are quickly forgotten. Claims of early life sexual or physical abuse are common and often prove to be true, or sometimes are not valid; when present, they probably play a role in the genesis of some cases (see further on)."

Although depressed patients may complain of memory failure, scrutiny of their complaints will show that they can usually remember the details of their illness and that little or no qualitative change in other intellectual functions has taken place. Their difficulty is either a lack of energy and interest or preoccupation with personal worries and anxiety, which prevents the focusing of attention on anything except their own problems. Even during mental tests, their performance may be impaired by \u201cemotional blocking,\u201d in much the same way as the worried student blocks during an examination.

An examination usually is required when there is a question of pelvic pain, genital anomaly, pregnancy-related condition, or possibility of pelvic infection. The keys to a successful examination in an adolescent lie in earning the patient\u2019s trust, explaining the components of her examination, performing only the essential components, and using a very careful and gentle technique. It is helpful to ascertain whether the patient had a previous pelvic examination, how she perceived the experience, and what she heard about a pelvic examination from her mother or friends."

They differ from other people in being plagued by feelings of inferiority or self-doubt, suspicion about the motives of others, low energy, inexplicable fatigue, shyness, irritability, moodiness, sense of guilt, and unreasonable worries and fears. They suffer as a result of these feelings or they behave in ways that are upsetting to those around them and to society at large. Yet none of these conditions precludes partaking in the everyday life, such as attending school, working, marrying, and raising a family. As these conditions were more carefully documented in the early part of the last century, they came to be called neuroses, and those that created societal difficulties were called psychopathies, and more recently, personality disorders and sociopathies."
