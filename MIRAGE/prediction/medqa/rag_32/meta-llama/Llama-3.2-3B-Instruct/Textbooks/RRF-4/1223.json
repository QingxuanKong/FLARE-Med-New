    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the given question: The patient presents with fever, right upper quadrant pain, myalgia, jaundice, and tender hepatomegaly after returning from a trip to Southeast Asia. The presence of anti-hepatitis A IgM antibodies suggests an acute hepatitis A infection. Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease that is typically spread through the fecal-oral route, often through contaminated food or water. In acute hepatitis A, the liver biopsy typically shows hepatocellular necrosis, which is characterized by hepatocytes with shrunken, eosinophilic cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei. This is due to the direct cytopathic effect of the hepatitis A virus on the hepatocytes. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Hepatocytes with shrunken, eosinophilic cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei: This is the characteristic histopathological finding in acute hepatitis A. B. Cystic spaces with scattered areas of cellular debris: This is more characteristic of hepatitis B or C, which can cause chronic inflammation and fibrosis leading to cirrhosis. C. Basophilic adipocyte remnants, filled with calcifications: This is more characteristic of chronic hepatitis B or C, where there is a high prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma. D. Engorged hepatocytes with red blood cell infiltration: This is more characteristic of acute viral hepatitis, but not specifically hepatitis A. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has acute hepatitis A, and the liver biopsy would most likely show hepatocytes with shrunken, eosinophilic cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Some patients, particularly those with associated disease of the biliary tract, have symptoms and signs localized to the right upper quadrant, including pain, guarding, punch tenderness, and even rebound tenderness. Nonspecific symptoms, such as chills, anorexia, weight loss, nausea, and vomiting, may also develop. Only 50% of patients with liver abscesses, however, have hepatomegaly, right-upper-quadrant tenderness, or jaundice; thus, one-half of patients have no symptoms or signs to direct attention to the liver. Fever of unknown origin may be the only manifestation of liver abscess, especially in the elderly. Diagnostic studies of the abdomen, especially the right upper quadrant, should be a part of any workup for fever of unknown origin.

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

            "content": "Yellow fever is a typical VHF accompanied by prominent hepatic necrosis. A period of viremia, typically lasting 3 or 4 days, is followed by a period of \u201cintoxication.\u201d During the latter phase in severe cases, characteristic jaundice, hemorrhages, black vomit, anuria, and terminal delirium occur, perhaps related in part to extensive hepatic involvement. Blood leukocyte counts may be normal or reduced and are often high in terminal stages. Albuminuria is usually noted and may be marked. As renal function fails in terminal or severe cases, the concentration of blood urea nitrogen rises proportionately. Abnormalities detected in liver function tests range from modest elevations of AST concentrations in mild cases to severe derangement."

            "content": "The symptoms that accompany the fevers are usually nonspecific. Headache, neck stiffness, arthralgia, myalgia, and nausea may accompany the first and subsequent febrile episodes. An enlarging spleen and liver cause abdominal pain. A nonproductive cough is common during LBRF and\u2014in combination with fever and myalgias\u2014may suggest influenza. Acute respiratory distress syndrome may occur during TBRF. On physical examination, the patient may be delirious or apathetic. There may be body lice in the patient\u2019s clothes or signs of insect bites. In regions with B. miyamotoi infection, a hard tick may be embedded in the skin. Epistaxis, petechiae, and ecchymoses are common during LBRF but not in TBRF. Splenomegaly or spleen tenderness is common in both forms of relapsing fever. The majority of patients with LBRF and ~10% of patients with TBRF have discernible hepatomegaly."

She admits to having taken a \u201chandful\u201d of Lorcet (hydrocodone/acetaminophen, an opioid/nonopioid analgesic combination), Soma (carisoprodol, a centrally acting muscle relaxant), and Cymbalta (duloxetine HCl, an antidepressant/ antifibromyalgia agent) 2 days earlier. On physical examina-tion, the sclera of her eyes shows yellow discoloration. Labora-tory analyses of blood drawn within an hour of her admission reveal abnormal liver function as indicated by the increased indices: alkaline phosphatase 302 (41\u2013133),* alanine amino-transferase (ALT) 351 (7\u201356),* aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1045 (0\u201335),* bilirubin 3.33 mg/dL (0.1\u20131.2),* and pro-thrombin time of 19.8 seconds (11\u201315).* In addition, plasma bicarbonate is reduced, and she has ~45% reduced glomerular filtration rate from the normal value"

A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative."

Abdominal bruits are noted in 6\u201325%, and ascites occurs in 30\u201360% of patients. Ascites should be examined by cytology. Splenomegaly is mainly due to portal hypertension. Weight loss and muscle wasting are common, particularly with rapidly growing or large tumors. Fever is found in 10\u201350% of patients, from unclear cause. The signs of chronic liver disease may often be present, including jaundice, dilated abdominal veins, palmar erythema, gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and peripheral edema. Budd-Chiari syndrome can occur due to HCC invasion of the hepatic veins, with tense ascites and a large tender liver (Chap. 365)."
