    "question": "A 35-year-old man presents with a 7 month history of insomnia. The patient admitted to having trouble sleeping from a young age but became more aware of how much this is affecting his health after attending a sleep conference earlier this year. He is worried that his health has suffered because of this, and he is also concerned that he will not be able to pay his bills if he were to get sick. He has no past medical or psychiatric condition and is not known to use any recreational drugs. The patient arrived for his appointment an hour early because he was afraid he might miss it. The patient is afebrile and his vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals an irritable middle age man who is tense and somewhat inattentive during the interview. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?\n ",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 7-month history of insomnia, which has been affecting his health and causing him concern about his financial stability. He is irritable, tense, and somewhat inattentive during the interview, indicating that his insomnia is impacting his daily life and causing distress. The patient's worry about his health and financial situation is a significant aspect of his presentation. The patient's history of insomnia dating back to a young age suggests that this is not a new-onset issue, but rather a chronic condition that has been building over time. The patient's physical examination is notable for his tense and somewhat inattentive demeanor, which is consistent with the emotional distress caused by his insomnia. The patient's presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), as he exhibits excessive worry about everyday things, which is a hallmark symptom of GAD. The patient's symptoms of insomnia and worry are also consistent with the diagnostic criteria for GAD, which includes persistent and excessive worry about everyday things, even when there is no apparent reason to worry, and difficulty controlling the worry, as well as restlessness, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance. The patient's presentation is less consistent with Adjustment Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and Normal Worry, as these conditions do not involve the same level of excessive worry and distress as GAD. \", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The patient is inattentive and unable to perceive the elements of his situation. He may talk incessantly and incoherently, and look distressed and perplexed; his expression may be in keeping with vague notions of being annoyed or threatened by someone. From his manner and the content of speech, it is evident that he misinterprets the meaning of ordinary objects and sounds, misidentifies the people around him, and is experiencing vivid visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations, often of a most unpleasant type. At first the patient can be brought into touch with reality and may identify the examiner and answer other questions correctly; but almost at once he relapses into a preoccupied, confused state, giving incorrect answers and being unable to think coherently.

He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

Physicians should inquire about when the patient typically goes to bed, when they fall asleep and wake up, whether they awaken during sleep, whether they feel rested in the morning, and whether they nap during the day. Depending on the primary complaint, it may be useful to ask about snoring, witnessed apneas, restless sensations in the legs, movements during sleep, depression, anxiety, and behaviors around the sleep episode.

There may be difficulty in falling asleep or remaining asleep, awakening may come too early, or there may be a combination of these complaints. Precision as to what constitutes pathologic insomnia is impossible at the present time because of our uncertainty as to the exact amounts of sleep required, and the role of sleep in the economy of the human body. All that can be said is that some form of sleeplessness is a frequent complaint (20 to 40 percent of the population) and is more prominent in the elderly and in women.

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

He has hypertension, and during the last 8 years, he has been adequately managed with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH\u2019s problem? What information would you gather to confirm your diagnosis? What treatment steps would you initiate?"

This is usually in the form of monetary compensation, which, surprisingly, is sometimes less than that which the patient could earn if he returned to work. Most such patients are actively engaged in litigation when first seen. Another interesting feature is the frequency with which the patient expresses extreme dissatisfaction with the medical care given him; he is often hostile toward the physicians and nurses. Many of these patients have already been subjected to an excessive number of hospitalizations and rather dramatic mishaps have allegedly occurred in carrying out diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The majority of these patients were previously suspected of malingering."

The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy.

What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity?

Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC).

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"
