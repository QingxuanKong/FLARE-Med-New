    "question": "A 4-month-old boy is brought to the pediatrician by his parents. He presents to the pediatric ward with fever, dyspnea, and cough, which he developed 3 days ago. His mother also reports he had poor weight gain despite a good appetite during the past 2 months as well as frequent stools with an unpleasant smell. He was born at 29 weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is meeting all of his milestones and is up to date with all vaccines. The child is breastfed exclusively. His blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg, the heart rate is 109/min, the respiratory rate is 29/min, and the temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.4\u00b0F). The patient\u2019s weight is between the 5th and 10th percentile. His length is between the 50th and 75th percentile. The patient is sluggish and reacts torpidly to examination. His skin is pale and dry with decreased turgor and elasticity. On auscultation, there are diminished vesicular sounds and disseminated moist rales at the bases of both lungs. Heart sounds are normal. The abdomen is distended without palpable masses. The patient\u2019s blood analysis shows the following findings:\nComplete blood count \n Erythrocytes  3.3 x 106/mm3\n Hb  12 g/dL\n Total leukocyte count  17,500/mm3\n Neutrophils\n 59%\n Lymphocytes\n 32%\n Eosinophils\n 3%\n Monocytes\n 6%\n Basophils\n 0\nPlatelet count\n232,000/mm3\nSputum culture grows Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A sweat test shows chloride concentration of 85 mEq/L (elevated). Which of the following is involved in the pathogenesis of this patient\u2019s symptoms?",

He has a low blood pressure, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The sputum culture grows Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the sweat test shows an elevated chloride concentration. These findings suggest a respiratory infection, particularly in an infant with a history of premature birth and poor weight gain.\", \"Step 2: Consider the patient's genetic history and congenital conditions\", \"The patient was born at 29 weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery, which increases the risk of respiratory complications. The elevated chloride concentration in the sweat test is a key finding that points towards Cystic Fibrosis (CF). CF is a genetic disorder that affects the CFTR protein, which is responsible for regulating salt and water transport in the lungs and pancreas.\", \"Step 3: Review the options and choose the correct answer\", \"Based on the analysis, option B, Abnormal CFTR protein, is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The elevated chloride concentration in the sweat test is a hallmark of CF, and the patient's respiratory symptoms and poor weight gain are consistent with this diagnosis.\" } \"answer_choice\": \"B\" ``` The final answer is B.

The level of spontaneous activity, passive muscle tone, quality of the cry, and apnea are useful screening signs to evaluate the state of the nervous system. The examination should proceed with an assessment of vital signs, particularly heart rate (normal rate, 120 to 160 beats/min); respiratory rate (normal rate, 30 to 60 breaths/min); temperature (usually done per rectum and later as an axillary measurement); and blood pressure (often reserved for sick infants).

The physiologic stability of the patient may be abnormal with acute blood loss and acute hemolysis, manifesting as tachycardia, blood pressure changes, and, most ominously, an altered state of consciousness. The presence of jaundice suggests hemolysis. Petechiae and purpura indicate a coagulopathy. Hepatosplenomegaly and adenopathy suggest infiltrative disorders. Growth failure or poor weight gain suggests an anemia of chronic disease. An essential element of the physical examination is the investigation of the stool for the presence of occult blood."

Physical examination demonstrates short stature and mild generalized obesity. Genital examination reveals descended but small testes and a phallic length of \u20132 SD. Laboratory evaluations demonstrate growth hormone (GH) deficiency and a delayed bone age of 18 months. The patient is started on replacement with recombinant human GH at a dose of 40 mcg/kg per day subcutaneously. After 1 year of treatment, his height velocity has increased from 5 cm/y to 11 cm/y.

Depending on the extent of reactivity, the effusion may be small, remain unnoticed, and resolve spontaneously or may be sufficiently large to cause symptoms such as fever, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea. Physical findings are those of pleural effusion: dullness to percussion and absence of breath sounds. A chest radiograph reveals the effusion and, in up to one-third of cases, also shows a parenchymal lesion. Thoracentesis is required to ascertain the nature of the effusion and to differentiate it from manifestations of other etiologies. The fluid is straw colored and at times hemorrhagic; it is an exudate with a protein concentration >50% of that in serum (usually ~4\u20136 g/dL), a normal to low glucose concentration, a pH of ~7.3"

In the acute phase, inflammatory parameters are elevated, including white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and the ESR, which can be profoundlyelevated (often >80 mm/hr). Platelet counts may be inappropriately low or normal. A lumbar puncture, if performed toexclude infection, may reveal pleocytosis. Tests of hepatobiliary function may be abnormal. Greatly elevated platelet countsdevelop during the subacute phase. The development of coronary artery aneurysms is monitored by performing two-dimensional echocardiograms, usually during the acute phase, at 2 to3 weeks, and again at 6 to 8 weeks. More frequent echocardiograms and, potentially, coronary angiography are indicated forpatients who develop coronary artery abnormalities."
