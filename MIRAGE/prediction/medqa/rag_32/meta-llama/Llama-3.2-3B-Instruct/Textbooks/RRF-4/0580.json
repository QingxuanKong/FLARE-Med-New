    "question": "A 20-year-old woman is brought in for a psychiatric consultation by her mother who is concerned because of her daughter\u2019s recent bizarre behavior. The patient\u2019s father died from lung cancer 1 week ago. Though this has been stressful for the whole family, the daughter has been hearing voices and having intrusive thoughts ever since. These voices have conversations about her and how she should have been the one to die and they encourage her to kill herself. She has not been able to concentrate at work or at school. She has no other history of medical or psychiatric illness. She denies recent use of any medication. Today, her heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, and temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F). On physical exam, she appears gaunt and anxious. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. CMP, CBC, and TSH are normal. A urine toxicology test is negative. What is the patient\u2019s most likely diagnosis?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and physical examination. The patient is a 20-year-old woman who has been experiencing bizarre behavior, including hearing voices and having intrusive thoughts since her father's recent death. She has been unable to concentrate at work or school and appears gaunt and anxious. The patient's heart rate is elevated at 90/min, and she has a regular heart rhythm. The physical examination is otherwise unremarkable, with normal lung function and no other abnormalities. The laboratory tests, including a urine toxicology test, are negative. Given these details, we need to consider the potential diagnoses provided in the options.\\n\\nOption A, Brief Psychotic Disorder, is a condition characterized by the onset of psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions, in response to a stressor, but these symptoms last for less than 1 month. While the patient is experiencing psychotic symptoms, they have been ongoing for more than a month, making this option less likely.\\n\\nOption B, Adjustment Disorder, is a condition characterized by the development of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to a significant stressor, but these symptoms do not meet the criteria for another disorder. While the patient's father's death is a significant stressor, the duration and severity of her symptoms suggest a more severe condition.\\n\\nOption C, Schizophrenia, is a chronic and severe mental disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and negative symptoms. The patient's symptoms, including hearing voices and having intrusive thoughts, and her inability to concentrate, are consistent with schizophrenia. Additionally, the duration of her symptoms, which have been ongoing for more than a month, supports this diagnosis.\\n\\nOption D, Bereavement, is a normal response to the loss of a loved one, characterized by feelings of sadness, grief, and adjustment difficulties. While the patient's father's death is a significant loss, her symptoms are more severe and prolonged than what is typically seen in bereavement.\\n\\nBased on the patient's symptoms and duration, the most likely diagnosis is Schizophrenia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

One of our patients, functioning normally in every other way, carried the unshakable idea that people were sneaking into her house at night when she was away and rearranging the furniture. She functioned extremely well through her eighties but had a schizophrenic sister. Also, several physicians under our care have woven extensive delusional ideas around tenuous scientific theories; these ideas have applied to personal life events as well as physical and psychologic symptoms and in some cases have resulted in bizarre regimens of self-medication. Rarely, a patient comes to the hospital for some other medical reason and it is found that he or she has been living quietly in the community, preoccupied with a bizarre delusional system yet appearing neither depressed nor schizophrenic. Certainly one often sees delusions in depressed patients who decompensate as their depression deepens."

Although depressed patients may complain of memory failure, scrutiny of their complaints will show that they can usually remember the details of their illness and that little or no qualitative change in other intellectual functions has taken place. Their difficulty is either a lack of energy and interest or preoccupation with personal worries and anxiety, which prevents the focusing of attention on anything except their own problems.

            "content": "Panic attacks in their full form are prone to begin after this age and are almost as dramatic as seizures. They often begin with distressing feelings of dread and foreboding. The patient is assailed by a sense of strangeness, as though his body had changed or the surroundings were unreal. He is frightened, sometimes by the prospect of imminent death (angor animi) or of losing his mind or self-control. There may be a feeling of smothering. \u201cI am dying\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d are characteristic expressions of alarm and panic. The heart races, breathing comes in rapid gasps, the pupils may be dilated, and the patient may sweat or tremble. The palpitation and breathing difficulties are so prominent that a cardiologist is often consulted. Some of our psychiatric colleagues identify breathlessness or a suffocating feeling as central to the diagnosis of panic (and attribute psychologic meaning to the symptom), but this is not sustained in our observations of affected patients.

Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

            "content": "A cardiac consultation and some simple tests (electrocardiogram, chest films) are often needed to reinforce to the patient the benign nature of the cardiac and respiratory symptoms and to alleviate fear of heart disease. These and other concepts of the treatment of anxiety were discussed by Goodwin and Guze. Anxiety symptoms arising in relation to a particular threatening event in a nonneurotic individual carry the best prognosis, but the symptoms may be prolonged, a feature of posttraumatic stress disorder."
