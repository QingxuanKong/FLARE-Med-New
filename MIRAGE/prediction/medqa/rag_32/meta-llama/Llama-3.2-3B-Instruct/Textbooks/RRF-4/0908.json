She was diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria at her last appointment 2 weeks ago, and was treated with amoxicillin. She has no concurrent diseases and no complaints. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg, heart rate 82/min, respiratory rate 11/min, and temperature 36.6\u2103 (97.7\u2109). The physical examination reveals no abnormalities. On gynecologic examination, the cervix is soft and non-tender with no discharge from the external os. The uterus is enlarged to the umbilicus and the fetal heart rate is normal. Which of the following statements is the most accurate with respect to the presented case?",

        "A": "This patient does not require further urinary tests unless she becomes symptomatic.",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is at 20 weeks gestation and was diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria 2 weeks ago and treated with amoxicillin. The patient is asymptomatic and has no concurrent diseases or complaints. The vital signs are normal, and the physical examination reveals no abnormalities. The cervix is soft and non-tender with no discharge from the external os, and the uterus is enlarged to the umbilicus. The fetal heart rate is normal. Given the patient's history of asymptomatic bacteriuria and treatment with amoxicillin, it is essential to consider the risk of recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that women with a history of UTI or pyelonephritis be screened for recurrent UTI at each prenatal visit. Performing a urinalysis on each subsequent antenatal visit can help identify any potential recurrence of bacteriuria. However, the ACOG also recommends that a urine culture be performed in women with a history of UTI, especially if they are symptomatic or have risk factors for recurrent UTI. In this case, given the patient's asymptomatic status and lack of concurrent diseases or complaints, option A is incorrect. Option C is also incorrect as there is no indication for another urine culture at this time. Option D is incorrect as the patient does not require a urine culture at this time. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that urinalysis should be performed on each subsequent antenatal visit to screen for possible recurrence of bacteriuria, making option B the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Frequently, the findings before rupture and hemorrhage are nonspecific, and vital signs are normal. The abdomen may be nontender or mildly tender, with or without rebound. The uterus may be slightly enlarged, with findings similar to a normal pregnancy (103,104). Cervical motion tenderness may or may not be present. An adnexal mass may be palpable in up to 50% of cases, but the mass varies markedly in size, consistency, and tenderness. A palpable mass may be the corpus luteum and not the ectopic pregnancy. With rupture and intra-abdominal hemorrhage, the patient develops tachycardia followed by hypotension. Bowel sounds are decreased or absent. The abdomen is distended, with marked tenderness and rebound tenderness. Cervical motion tenderness is present. Frequently, the findings of the pelvic examination are inadequate because of pain and guarding."

With a living viable-aged fetus, and with vaginal delivery not imminent, emergency cesarean delivery is chosen by most. In some women, fetal compromise will be evident as shown in Figure 41-19. When evaluating fetal status, sonographic conirmation of fetal heart activity may be necessary because sometimes an electrode applied directly to a dead fetus will provide misleading information by recording the maternal heart rate.

Maternal blood pressure and weight and their extent of change are examined. Symptoms such as headache, altered vision, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, bleeding, vaginal luid leakage, and dysuria are sought. Mter 20 weeks' gestation, uterine examination measures size from the symphysis to the fundus. In late pregnancy, vaginal examination often provides valuable information that includes conirmation of the presenting part and its station, clinical estimation of pelvic capacity and configuration, amnionic luid volume adequacy, and cervical consistency, efacement, and dilatation (Chap. 22, p. 435)."

Labor is defined as cervical dilation of 3 to 4 cm or more in the presence of uterine contractions. Management guidelines direct that a pelvic examination be performed approximately every 2 hours. Inefective labor is suspected when the cervix does not dilate within approximately 2 hours of admission. Amniotomy is then performed, and labor progress determined at the next 2-hour evaluation. In women whose labors do not progress, an intrauterine pressure catheter is placed to assess uterine function. Hypotonic contractions and no cervical dilation after an additional 2 to 3 hours result in stimulation of labor using the high-dose oxytocin regimen described in Chapter 26 (p. 509).

Nitrazine paper test is (paper turns blue, indicating alkaline pH of amniotic f uid). Fern test is (a ferning pattern is seen under a microscope after amniotic fuid dries on a glass slide). Second step: Ultrasound to assess amniotic f uid volume. If unsure: Ultrasound-guided transabdominal instillation of indigo carmine dye to check for leakage (unequivocal test). Minimize infection risk; do not perform digital vaginal exams on women who are not in labor or for whom labor is not planned immediately. Check fetal heart tracing, maternal temperature, WBC count, and uterine tenderness for evidence of chorioamnionitis. Depends on GA and fetal lung maturity."

An imperforate hymen is diagnosed by the presence of a bulging membrane that distends during Valsalva maneuver. Ultrasonography or MRI is useful to identify the m\u00a8ullerian anomaly when the abnormality cannot be found by physical examination. The patient should be examined for skeletal malformations and assessed with intravenous pyelography or renal ultrasound to detect concomitant renal abnormalities. These abnormalities occur less frequently than in m\u00a8ullerian agenesis (63). 2."

The extent of the physical examination during the gynecologic visit is often dictated by the patient\u2019s primary concerns and symptoms. For example, for healthy teens without symptoms who are requesting oral contraceptives before the initiation of intercourse, a gynecologic examination is not necessarily required. Some aspects of the examination\u2014such as assessment of vital signs and measurement of height, weight, blood pressure, and calculation of a body mass index\u2014 should be performed routinely during most office visits. Typically, examination of the breasts and abdomen and a complete examination of the pelvis are considered to be essential parts of the gynecologic examination. It is often helpful to ask the patient if the gynecologic examination was difficult for her in the past; this"
