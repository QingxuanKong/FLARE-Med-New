The patient lives with her son and his family and her son reports that other members of the family have had similar symptoms during the past week but that he has not had any symptoms. The result of a polymerase chain reaction test confirms that the woman is infected with a virus that has a helical capsid and a segmented genome. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the son being free of symptoms?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of a respiratory infection, including fever, headache, malaise, and dry cough. The patient lives with her son and his family, which increases the risk of transmission. The polymerase chain reaction test confirms that the patient is infected with a virus that has a helical capsid and a segmented genome. This suggests that the virus is a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, which includes influenza viruses. The son is likely free of symptoms because he has been vaccinated against influenza, which provides immunity against the specific strains of the virus. However, the question asks for the most likely explanation for the son being free of symptoms, not the reason for his vaccination. Therefore, the correct answer is related to the virus's ability to infect cells, not the son's vaccination status. Among the options, C. Protease-resistant antibodies in nasal secretions is the most likely explanation for the son being free of symptoms. Protease-resistant antibodies in nasal secretions can neutralize the virus, preventing it from infecting cells and causing symptoms. The other options are not directly related to the virus's ability to infect cells and cause symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

In this example, the proband, a 36-year-old woman (IV-1), has a strong history of breast and ovarian cancer on the paternal side of her family. The early age of onset and the co-occurrence of breast and ovarian cancer in this family suggest the possibility of an inherited mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. It is unclear however, without genetic testing, whether her father harbors such a mutation and transmitted it to her. After appropriate genetic counseling of the pro-band and her family, the most informative and cost-effective approach to DNA analysis in this family is to test the cancer-affected 42-year-old living cousin for the presence of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. If a mutation is found, then it is possible to test for this particular alteration in other family members, if they so desire. In the example shown, if the proband\u2019s father has a BRCA1 mutation, there is a 50:50 probability that the"

She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days.

Because they have an affected son, both the biological father and mother must be carriers for this disease. The affected son must have inherited a mutant allele from each parent. Because he shows only the 3kilobase (kb) band on the Southern blot, the mutant allele for this disease must be linked to the 3-kb band. The normal allele must be linked to the 4-kb band, and because the daughter inherited only the 4-kb band, she must be homozygous normal for the hexosaminidase A gene. 4.3.

Neither the patient nor the family physician had any concerns about the pregnancy. However, the patient did complain of unilateral swelling of her left leg, which had gradually increased over the previous 2 days. Furthermore, the evening before her visit she developed some sharp chest pain, which was exacerbated by deep breaths. The family physician ordered a duplex ultrasound scan of the left leg venous system. Ultrasound scanning of the vascular tree can demonstrate flow and occlusion of arteries and veins."

Among neonates, enteroviruses are the most common cause of aseptic meningitis and nonspecific febrile illnesses. Certain clinical syndromes are more likely to be caused by certain serotypes (Table 228-1). nonspecific febrile illness (sUmmer grippe) The most common clinical manifestation of enterovirus infection is a nonspecific febrile illness. After an incubation period of 3\u20136 days, patients present with an acute onset of fever, malaise, and headache. Occasional cases are associated with upper respiratory symptoms, and some cases include nausea and vomiting. Symptoms often last for 3\u20134 days, and most cases resolve in a week. While infections with other respiratory viruses occur more often from late fall to early spring, febrile illness due to enteroviruses frequently occurs in the summer and early fall."

Most cases had been preceded within days by an erythematous rash spreading from the limbs to the trunk and face, somewhat similar to the eruption of fifths disease caused by this virus in children. One of our patients had no premonitory features, but her child had just recovered from fifth disease (parvovirus) by the pediatrician. Some reported patients have had preceding influenza-like symptoms and adenopathy as well. A summary of cases that have appeared in the literature can be found in the paper by Maas and coworkers. Duchowny and colleagues described a patient in whom a typical brachial neuritis occurred as part of a febrile illness that proved to be caused by a CMV infection and the same has been observed (albeit rarely) in patients with HIV. A few outbreaks of brachial neuritis have been recorded and prompted the suggestion that the Coxsackievirus"

Although attention is often directed by the history to the diseased organ or part of the body, the examination of a new patient must extend from head to toe in an objective search for abnormalities. Unless the physical examination is systematic and is performed consistently from patient to patient, important segments may be omitted inadvertently. The results of the examination, like the details of the history, should be recorded at the time they are elicited\u2014not hours later, when they are subject to the distortions of memory. Skill in physical diagnosis is acquired with experience, but it is not merely technique that determines success in eliciting signs of disease. The detection of a few scattered petechiae, a faint diastolic murmur, or a small mass in the abdomen is not a question of keener eyes and ears or more sensitive fingers but of a mind alert to those"
