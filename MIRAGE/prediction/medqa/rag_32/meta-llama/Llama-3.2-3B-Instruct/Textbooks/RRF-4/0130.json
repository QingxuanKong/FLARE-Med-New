    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the given question: **Step 1: Analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results** The patient is a 4-week-old female newborn with increasing yellowing of her eyes and skin for 2 weeks, scleral icterus, jaundice, and pale stools. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin, indicating hepatomegaly. The serum studies show elevated bilirubin levels (total 15 mg/dL, direct 12.3 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase (2007 U/L), AST (53 U/L), ALT (45 U/L), and \u03b3-glutamyl transferase (154 U/L). **Step 2: Evaluate the differential diagnoses** Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the differential diagnoses can be narrowed down as follows: * **Galactosemia**: This condition is caused by a deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase, which leads to accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate in the liver and kidneys. However, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not specifically suggest galactosemia. * **Biliary atresia**: This condition is characterized by a blockage or absence of the bile ducts, leading to jaundice, pale stools, and hepatomegaly. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with this diagnosis. * **Crigler-Najjar syndrome**: This condition is a rare genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of bilirubin, leading to severe jaundice and hepatomegaly. However, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not specifically suggest Crigler-Najjar syndrome. * **Breast milk jaundice**: This condition is caused by the presence of substances in breast milk that increase bilirubin levels in infants. However, the patient was switched to formula feeds recently, which reduces the likelihood of breast milk jaundice. **Step 3: Consider the patient's history and physical examination** The patient was breastfed since birth but switched to formula feeds recently, which reduces the likelihood of breast milk jaundice. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are more consistent with biliary atresia. **Step 4: Choose the most likely diagnosis** Based on the analysis, the most likely diagnosis is **Biliary atresia**. **Answer** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with biliary atresia, a condition characterized by a blockage or absence of the bile ducts, leading to jaundice, pale stools, and hepatomegaly. The patient's history of being breastfed since birth but switching to formula feeds recently reduces the likelihood of breast milk jaundice.

Fetal protection from unconjugated bilirubin is lost after delivery if not cleared rapidly. Because clearance is totally dependent on neonatal hepatic function, varying degrees of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia result. Even in the mature newborn, serum bilirubin levels usually rise for 3 to 4 days to reach up to 10 mg/ dL. After this, concentrations usually fall rapidly.

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice?

In 173 pregnant women with pancreatitis, the mean amylase value approximated 2000 lUlL, and the mean lipase value approached 3000 lUlL (Table 55-5). Importanty, the degree of enzyme elevation and disease severiy do not reliaby correlate. Indeed, by 48 to 72 hours, amylase levels may return to normal despite other evidence for continuing pancreatitis. Serum lipase activity is also increased and usually remains elevated with continued inlammation. Leukocytosis is usually found, and 25 percent of patients have hypocalcemia. Elevated serum bilirubin and aspartate transaminase levels may signiY gallstone disease. Several prognostic scoring systems have been used to classiY pancreatitis severity, but not all of these are useful in pregnancy. For instance, two of the ive Ranson criteria determined TABLE 55-5.

            "content": "Physical evidence of jaundice is observed in infants when bilirubin levels reach 5 to 10 mg/dL (versus 2 to 3 mg/dL in adults). When jaundice is observed, the laboratory evaluation for hyperbilirubinemia should include a total bilirubin measurement to determine the magnitude of hyperbilirubinemia. Bilirubin levels greater than 5 mg/dL on the first day of life or greater than 13 mg/dL thereafter in term infants should be evaluated further with measurement of indirect and direct bilirubin levels, blood typing, Coombs test, complete blood count, blood smear, and reticulocyte count. These tests must be performed before treatment of hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy or exchange transfusion. In the absence of hemolysis or evidence for either the common or the rare causes of nonhemolytic indirect hyperbilirubinemia, the diagnosis is either physiologic or breast milk jaundice. Jaundice present after 2 weeks of age is pathologic and suggests a direct-reacting hyperbilirubinemia."

Signs of advanced disease include muscle wasting, ascites, edema, dilated abdominal veins, hepatic fetor, asterixis, mental confusion, stupor, and coma. In male patients with cirrhosis, particularly that related to alcohol use, signs of hyperestrogenemia such as gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and loss of male-pattern hair distribution may be found. Icterus is best appreciated when the sclera is inspected under natural light. In fair-skinned individuals, a yellow tinge to the skin may be obvious. In dark-skinned individuals, examination of the mucous membranes below the tongue can demonstrate jaundice. Jaundice is rarely detectable if the serum bilirubin level is <43 \u03bcmol/L (2.5 mg/dL) but may remain detectable below this level during recovery from jaundice (because of protein and tissue binding of conjugated bilirubin)."

Jaundice and hepatomegaly usually become evident during the first week of life. Accumulation of galactose and galactose-1-phosphate in the kidney impairs amino acid transport, resulting in aminoaciduria. Fulminant Escherichia coli septicemia occurs with increased frequency. Newborn screening tests are widely utilized in the United States. They depend on fluorometric assay of GALT enzyme activity on a dried blood spot. A positive screening test must be confirmed by assay of GALT levels in RBC. Antenatal diagnosis is possible by assay of GALT activity in cultured amniotic fluid cells or determination of galactitol level in amniotic fluid supernatant."

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."
