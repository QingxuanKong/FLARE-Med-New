    "question": "A 16-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath after prolonged exposure to cold air during a recent hike with his friends. He informs the physician that he is asthmatic, but does not use inhalers regularly because he does not like using medications. He is a non-smoker and occasionally drinks alcohol. On physical examination, the temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), the pulse is 120/min, the blood pressure is 114/76 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 32/min. Auscultation of the chest reveals bilateral wheezing. The physician asks the nurse to administer nebulized albuterol; however, the boy declines nebulized albuterol because of a history of palpitations that he experienced previously. The physician then prescribes nebulized ipratropium bromide, which results in significant clinical improvement. Which of the following second messenger systems is affected by the drug that improved the boy's symptoms?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: Step 1: Identify the drug that improved the boy's symptoms. The boy's symptoms improved after nebulized ipratropium bromide was administered. Step 2: Identify the mechanism of action of ipratropium bromide. Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic medication that acts as a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Step 3: Determine which second messenger system is affected by the drug. Muscarinic receptors are coupled to G-proteins that activate phospholipase C, which in turn increases the levels of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which activate protein kinase C (PKC). Therefore, the phosphoinositol system is affected by ipratropium bromide. ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic medication that acts as a muscarinic receptor antagonist.

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

During the wheezing phase, percussion of the chest usually reveals only hyperresonance, but auscultation usually reveals diffuse wheezes and crackles throughout the breathing cycle. With more severe disease, grunting and cyanosis may be present. Routine laboratory tests are not required to confirm the diagnosis. It is important to assess oxygenation in severe cases of bronchiolitis. Pulse oximetry is adequate for monitoring oxygen saturation. Frequent, regular assessments and cardiorespiratory monitoring of infants are necessary because respiratory failure may develop precipitously in very tired infants even though blood gas values taken before rapid decompensation are reassuring."

In children older than 6 years, pulmonary function tests (spirometry) can assess airflow obstruction and response to bronchodilators. Radiographic evaluation is not needed with each episode of wheezing, but those with significant respiratory distress, fever, history consistent with foreign body Bronchial edema Infection (e.g., bronchiolitis) Inhalation of irritant gases or particulates Increased pulmonary venous pressure Bronchial hypersecretion Infection Inhalation of irritant gases or particulates Cholinergic drugs Aspiration Foreign body Aspiration of gastric contents Hypersensitivity reactions, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (seen only in children with either asthma or cystic fibrosis) Dynamic airway collapse"

He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

Children <4 years of age generally require delivery of ICS (budesonide and fluticasone HFA) through a face mask that should fit snugly over nose and mouth and avoid nebulizing in the eyes. Wash face after each treatment to prevent local corticosteroid side effects. For budesonide, the dose may be administered 1\u20133 times daily. Budesonide suspension is compatible with Albuterol, Ipratropium, and Levalbuterol nebulizer solutions in the same nebulizer. Use only jet nebulizers, as ultrasonic nebulizers are ineffective for suspensions. For Fluticasone HFA, the dose should be divided 2 times daily; the low dose for children <4 years of age is higher than for children 5\u201311 years of age due to lower dose delivered with face mask and data on efficacy in young children. Potential Adverse Effects of Inhaled Corticosteroids: \u007f Cough, dysphonia, oral thrush (candidiasis)."

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

The patient is a long-time smoker (up to two packs per day) and has two to four glasses of wine with dinner, more on the weekends. He has chronic bronchitis, presumably from smoking, and has been treated on numerous occasions with oral prednisone for exacerba-tions of bronchitis. He is currently on 10 mg/d prednisone.

They last for 4 to 6 hours. Generally a short-acting \u03b22-agonist is prescribed for acute symptoms and as prophylaxis before allergen exposure and exercise. The inhaled route is preferred because adverse effects\u2014tremor, prolonged tachycardia, and irritability\u2014are less. Overuse of \u03b22-agonists implies inadequate control; a change in medications may be warranted. The definition of overuse depends on the severity of the child\u2019s asthma; use of more than one metered dose inhaler canister per month or more than eight puffs per day suggests poor control."

            "content": "The physical examination should begin during the interview of the patient. Inability of the patient to speak in full sentences before stopping to get a deep breath suggests a condition that leads to stimulation of the controller or impairment of the ventilatory pump with reduced vital capacity. Evidence of increased work of breathing (supraclavicular retractions; use of accessory muscles of ventilation; and the tripod position, characterized by sitting with the hands braced on the knees) is indicative of increased airway resistance or stiffness of the lungs and the chest wall. When measuring the vital signs, the physician should accurately assess the respiratory rate and measure the pulsus paradoxus (Chap. 288); if the systolic pressure decreases by >10 mmHg, the presence of COPD, acute asthma, or pericardial disease should be considered. During the general examination, signs of anemia (pale conjunctivae), cyanosis, and cirrhosis (spider angiomata, gynecomastia) should be sought."
