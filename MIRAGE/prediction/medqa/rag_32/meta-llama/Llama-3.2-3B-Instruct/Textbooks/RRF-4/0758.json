    "question": "A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department for evaluation of a low-grade fever, worsening fatigue, and mild intermittent abdominal pain that is not affected by eating. He reports that over the last 6 months he slept a lot more than usual and lost 14.9 kg (33 lbs) without trying to lose weight. He also complains of chest pain and shortness of breath that is worse when he is working and in the yard. There is no significant family history. His long-standing male partner passed away 2 years ago in a fatal car accident. His blood pressure is 145/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 90/min, the respiratory rate is 23/min, and the temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.5\u00b0F). On physical examination, he has pale mucous membranes, conjunctival hemorrhages, and petechiae on his lower extremities. There is a new-onset high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur best heard over the right upper sternal border. His head bobs with each heartbeat. There are small, painless, red macules on both palms. His spleen is palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. His laboratory results are shown below.\nHemoglobin 8.4 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 72 \u00b5m3\nPlatelet count 400,000/mm3\nLeukocytes 6,000/mm3\nSerum ferritin 8 ng/mL\nSerum iron 27 \u00b5g/dL\nTotal iron-binding capacity 450 \u00b5g/dL\nColonoscopy with biopsy is later performed showing a neoplastic growth in the descending colon.

The physical examination reveals pale mucous membranes, conjunctival hemorrhages, petechiae, and a palpable spleen. Laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytosis, and low serum iron levels. The patient also has a neoplastic growth in the descending colon found on colonoscopy with biopsy. This combination of findings suggests a diagnosis of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which is often associated with E. coli O157:H7 infection. The cardiac findings, including the diastolic murmur and splenomegaly, are likely secondary to the spleen's involvement in the disease process. The splenomegaly can cause an increase in cardiac output, leading to a diastolic murmur. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the cardiac findings is the underlying E. coli O157:H7 infection, which is commonly associated with HUS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

Clues to the mechanisms of anemia may be provided on physical examination by findings of infection, blood in the stool, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, or petechiae. Splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy suggest an underlying lymphoproliferative disease, whereas petechiae suggest platelet dysfunction. Past laboratory measurements are helpful to determine a time of onset."

The febrile stage lasts 3 or 4 days and is identified by the abrupt onset of fever, headache, severe myalgia, thirst, anorexia, and often nausea and vomiting. Photophobia, retroorbital pain, and pain on ocular movement are common, and the vision may become blurred with ciliary body inflammation. Flushing over the face, the V area of the neck, and the back is characteristic, as are pharyngeal injection, periorbital edema, and conjunctival suffusion. Petechiae often develop in areas of pressure, the conjunctivae, and the axillae. Back pain and tenderness to percussion at the costovertebral angle reflect massive retroperitoneal edema. Laboratory evidence of mild to moderate DIC is present. Other laboratory findings of HFRS include proteinuria and active urinary sediment. The hypotensive stage lasts from a few hours to 48 h and begins with falling blood pressure and sometimes shock. The relative bradycardia typical of the febrile"

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension.

Although attention is often directed by the history to the diseased organ or part of the body, the examination of a new patient must extend from head to toe in an objective search for abnormalities. Unless the physical examination is systematic and is performed consistently from patient to patient, important segments may be omitted inadvertently. The results of the examination, like the details of the history, should be recorded at the time they are elicited\u2014not hours later, when they are subject to the distortions of memory. Skill in physical diagnosis is acquired with experience, but it is not merely technique that determines success in eliciting signs of disease. The detection of a few scattered petechiae, a faint diastolic murmur, or a small mass in the abdomen is not a question of keener eyes and ears or more sensitive fingers but of a mind alert to those"
