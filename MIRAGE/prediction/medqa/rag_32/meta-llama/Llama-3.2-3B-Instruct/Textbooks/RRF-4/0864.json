The presence of hemoperitoneum on bedside sonography further supports this diagnosis. The patient's hemodynamic instability, as evidenced by a drop in blood pressure and a significant increase in heart rate, suggests that the patient is in shock. The next step should be to control the source of the shock, which in this case is likely due to the ongoing bleeding from the perforated viscus. An exploratory laparotomy is the most appropriate next step to control the bleeding and repair the perforation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Urine output is a reliable indicator of organ perfusion but requires time to quantitate. Adequate urine output is 0.5 mL/kg per hour in an adult, 1 mL/kg per hour in a child, and 2 mL/kg per hour in an infant <1 year of age. Because measurement of this resuscitation-related vari-able is time dependent, it is generally more useful in the OR and intensive care unit (ICU) setting, than in initial evaluation in the trauma bay.There are several caveats to be considered when evaluat-ing the injured patient for shock. Tachycardia (HR >110 bpm) is often the earliest sign of ongoing blood loss, but the critical issue is change in HR over time. Individuals in good physical condition with a resting pulse rate in the 50s may manifest a relative tachycardia in the 90s; although clinically"

Systolic BP is reduced (<90 mmHg or \u226530 mmHg below baseline) with a narrow pulse pressure (<30 mmHg), but occasionally BP may be maintained by very high systemic vascular resistance. Tachypnea, Cheyne-Stokes respirations, and jugular venous distention may be present. There is typically a weak apical pulse and soft S1, and an S3 gallop may be audible. Acute, severe MR and VSR usually are associated with characteristic systolic murmurs (Chap. 295). Rales are audible in most patients with LV failure. Oliguria is common."

Only patients with exsanguinating intraabdominal hemorrhage (e.g., ruptured aneurysm) must be rushed to the operating room immediately, but in such instances, only a few minutes are required to assess the critical nature of the problem. Under these circumstances, all obstacles must be swept aside, adequate venous access for fluid replacement obtained, and the operation begun. Many of these patients have died in the radiology department or the emergency room while awaiting unnecessary examinations such as electrocardiograms or computed tomography (CT) scans. There are no contraindications to operation when massive intraabdominal hemorrhage is present. Fortunately, this situation is relatively rare. This statement does not necessarily apply to patients with intraluminal gastrointestinal hemorrhage, who can often be managed by other means (Chap."
