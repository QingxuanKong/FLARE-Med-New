The patients\u2019 parents say that a bottle of oxycodone was found at his bedside and was missing 15 pills. On physical examination, the patient appears drowsy and lethargic and is minimally responsive to stimuli. His respiratory rate is 8/min and shallow, blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg, and pulse is 60/min. On physical examination, miosis is present, and the pupils appear pinpoint.

The patient is found in a state of overdose, with slurring speech, drowsiness, lethargy, shallow breathing, and pinpoint pupils. These symptoms are consistent with opioid overdose. 2. The patient's parents mention that a bottle of oxycodone was found at his bedside and was missing 15 pills. Oxycodone is an opioid medication, which confirms the suspicion of opioid overdose. 3. The patient's symptoms, such as miosis (constricted pupils), are also consistent with opioid overdose. 4. The goal of treatment for opioid overdose is to reverse the effects of the opioid on the central nervous system. The drug used to reverse opioid overdose is naloxone, which is a \u03bc opioid receptor antagonist. 5. Looking at the options, the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely administered is a \u03bc receptor antagonist, which is the mechanism of action of naloxone.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"A\"}```",

Rapid recognition and treatment with naloxone, a highly specific reversal agent that is relatively free of complications, is essential. The diagnosis is based on recognition of characteristic signs and symptoms, including shallow and slow respirations, pupillary miosis (mydriasis does not occur until significant brain anoxia supervenes), bradycardia, hypothermia, and stupor or coma. Blood or urine toxicology studies can confirm a suspected diagnosis, but immediate management must be based on clinical criteria. If naloxone is not administered, progression to respiratory and cardiovascular collapse leading to death occurs. At autopsy, cerebral edema and sometimes frothy pulmonary edema are generally found. Opiates generally do not produce seizures except for unusual cases of polydrug use with the opiate meperidine, with high doses of tramadol, or in the newborn."

The young man complained of feeling nau-seated, lay down on a couch, and began to lose conscious-ness. Two upperclassmen carried him to a bedroom, placed him on his stomach, and positioned a trash can nearby. Approximately 10 minutes later, the freshman was found unconscious and covered with vomit. There was a delay in treatment because the upperclassmen called the college police instead of calling 911. After the call was transferred to 911, emergency medical technicians responded quickly and discovered that the young man was not breathing and that he had choked on his vomit. He was rushed to the hospital, where he remained in a coma for 2 days before ultimately being pronounced dead. The"

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

At age 21, she had a second tonic-clonic seizure while in college; further discussion with her room-mate at that time revealed a history of two recent episodes of 1\u20132 minutes of altered consciousness with lip smacking (focal impaired awareness seizure, formerly complex partial seizure). A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid.

Specific attention must be paid to assessment of the airway (for ability to maintain a patent airway) and respiratory system (asthma, recent respiratory illness, loose teeth), cardiovascular status (especially adequacy of volume status), factors affecting drug metabolism (renal or liver disease), and risk of aspiration (adequate nothing-by-mouth status, gastroesophageal reflux). During the administration of procedural sedation, assessment of status must include monitoring of oxygen saturation, heart rate, and respiratory rate, as well as some assessment of effectiveness of ventilation. This assessment must be performed by someone who is not involved in the procedure; this person is also responsible for recording vital signs and drugs administered on a time-based graph. Monitoring must be continued until the child"

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

For example, a 45-year-old man presents with a 3-week history of a \u201cflulike\u201d upper respiratory infection (URI) including symptoms of dyspnea and a productive cough. On the basis of the presenting complaints, the clinician uses a \u201cURI assessment form\u201d to improve the quality and efficiency of care by standardizing the information gathered. After quickly acquiring the requisite structured examination components and noting in particular the absence of fever and a clear chest examination, the physician prescribes medication for acute bronchitis and sends the patient home with the reassurance that his illness was not serious. Following a sleepless night with significant dyspnea, the patient develops"

Breathing may be quiet or stertorous. This state persists for several minutes, after which the patient opens his eyes, begins to look about, and appears bewildered and is confused and may be quite agitated. The patient may speak and later not remember anything that has been said and undisturbed becomes drowsy and falls asleep, sometimes for several hours, then often awakens with a pulsatile headache. When fully recovered, such a patient has no memory of any part of the spell but knows that something has happened because of the strange surroundings (in ambulance or hospital), the obvious concern of those around him, and often, a sore, bitten tongue and aching muscles from the violent movements. The convulsive contractions, if violent enough, may crush a vertebral body or result in a serious injury; a fracture, periorbital hemorrhages,"
