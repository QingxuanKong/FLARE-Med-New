    "question": "A 16-year-old female presents to her primary care physician due to lack of menstruation. She has never had a period and is anxious that she is not \u201ckeeping up\u201d with her friends. She states that her breasts began developing when she was 13, and she had a growth spurt around the same time. Review of systems reveals that she has also been getting headaches every few months over the last year with some photosensitivity and nausea each time. Ibuprofen relieves her symptoms. The patient is a competitive ice skater and has never been sexually active. Her mother has a history of migraine headaches, and her older sister has a history of bipolar disorder. Both underwent menarche at age 15. At this visit, the patient\u2019s temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C), pulse is 70/min, blood pressure is 118/65 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Her body mass index is 23.8 kg/m^2. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Both breasts are Tanner IV with no expressable discharge. Pelvic and axillary hair growth is also Tanner IV. The patient is unable to tolerate a full pelvic exam, but the part of the vaginal canal that is examined is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are ordered and are below:\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nK+: 4.1 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nUrea nitrogen: 12 mg/dL\nGlucose: 73 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 0.9 mg/dL\nCa2+: 9.7 mg/dL\nMg2+: 1.7 mEq/L\nAST: 11 U/L\nALT: 11 U/L\nFollicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH): 16.2 mIU/mL (4.7-21.5 mIU/ml)\nEstrogen: 240 pg/mL (64-357 pg/mL)\n\nAbdominal ultrasound is performed and shows a normal uterus and ovaries.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results step by step.\\n\\nThe patient is a 16-year-old female presenting with primary amenorrhea, which means she has never had a menstrual period. She also experiences headaches, photosensitivity, and nausea, which are relieved by ibuprofen. These symptoms suggest a potential endocrine disorder, particularly given her age and the fact that her menstrual cycle is likely to be regular.\\n\\nHer breast development and pubertal growth are advanced (Tanner IV), indicating normal secondary sexual characteristics. However, her inability to tolerate a full pelvic exam and the absence of vaginal discharge suggest that there may be an obstruction or anatomical abnormality.\\n\\nThe laboratory results show elevated FSH levels (16.2 mIU/mL), which is consistent with primary amenorrhea due to an underlying hormonal imbalance. The estrogen level is also elevated (240 pg/mL), which is consistent with normal secondary sexual development.\\n\\nThe abdominal ultrasound shows a normal uterus and ovaries, which rules out anatomical abnormalities such as a uterine anomaly or ovarian dysgenesis.\\n\\nGiven these findings, the most likely diagnosis is hyperprolactinemia, which is a condition characterized by elevated prolactin levels. This can cause amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and other symptoms such as headaches and photosensitivity. The elevated FSH level supports this diagnosis, as hyperprolactinemia can disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and lead to elevated FSH levels.\\n\\nThe patient's family history of migraine headaches and bipolar disorder is also relevant, as there is a known association between hyperprolactinemia and these conditions.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is hyperprolactinemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation.

The extent of the physical examination during the gynecologic visit is often dictated by the patient\u2019s primary concerns and symptoms. For example, for healthy teens without symptoms who are requesting oral contraceptives before the initiation of intercourse, a gynecologic examination is not necessarily required. Some aspects of the examination\u2014such as assessment of vital signs and measurement of height, weight, blood pressure, and calculation of a body mass index\u2014 should be performed routinely during most office visits. Typically, examination of the breasts and abdomen and a complete examination of the pelvis are considered to be essential parts of the gynecologic examination. It is often helpful to ask the patient if the gynecologic examination was difficult for her in the past; this"

The physical examination may be particularly helpful in patients with Turner syndrome. A history of short stature but consistent growth rate, a family history of delayed puberty, and normal physical findings (including assessment of smell, optic discs, and visual fields) may suggest physiologic delay. Headaches, visual disturbances, short stature, symptoms of diabetes insipidus, and weakness of one or more limbs suggest central nervous system lesions (38). Galactorrhea may be seen with prolactinomas, a condition more commonly associated with secondary amenorrhea in the presence of normal secondary sexual characteristics. The diagnostic workup is summarized as follows: 1."

During the year before presentation, her scholastic performance in school deteriorated, she gained 25 lb, she became increasingly lethargic, and nocturia and polydypsia were noted. Initial evaluation documented low follicle-stimulating hormone, elevated prolactin, and a bone age of 10.5 years. Computed tomography scanning documented a large hypothalamic neoplasm that proved to be an ectopic germinoma. The patient was also documented to be hypothyroid and hypoadrenal and to have diabetes insipidus. Despite the elevated prolactin, she had no galactorrhea because of the minimal breast development.
