    "question": "A 24-year-old woman presents to the office for evaluation of intermittent vertigo for the past 2 days. She complains of vomiting and complete hearing loss in her left ear. The patient believes she had an ear infection in the same ear but never sought out treatment. She has a past medical history of uterine fibroids. She takes mifepristone daily to reduce the size of the fibroids. Her blood pressure is 114/72 mm Hg, the heart rate is 68/min, the respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F). The patient appears pale and in mild distress. Otoscopy reveals a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane. The tympanic membrane is observed to be immobile as confirmed by the pneumatoscope. Pure-tone audiometry testing reveals hearing loss across all frequencies in the left ear. Heart auscultation is without murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Nystagmus is positive to the right. MRI of the brain does not reveal a tumor or abscess. Her physician orders a complete blood count with differential and comprehensive metabolic panel, which show:\nHemoglobin 14.5 gm/dL\nHematocrit 43.2 %\nWhite blood cells 14,500 /mm3\nPlatelets 312,000/mm3\nNeutrophil 81.6%\nLymphocyte 15.2%\nMonocyte 1.4%\nEosinophil 1.2%\nBasophil 0.6%\nSerum Na+ 138 mEq/L\nK+ 4.3 mEq/L\nCl- 108 mmol/L\nBUN 12 mg/dL\nCreatinine 0.8 mg/dL\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. The patient presents with intermittent vertigo, vomiting, complete hearing loss in her left ear, and a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane. The patient also has a history of uterine fibroids and takes mifepristone daily. The patient's blood work shows a low hemoglobin and hematocrit, which may indicate anemia. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest an inner ear infection, specifically otitis media. The patient's pure-tone audiometry testing reveals hearing loss across all frequencies in the left ear, which further supports this diagnosis. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which is consistent with an infection. Given these findings, the most appropriate antibiotic choice would be one that is effective against bacterial infections of the ear and is suitable for use in a patient with a history of fibroids and potential hormonal influences on the immune system. Cefepime and cefotaxime are broad-spectrum cephalosporins that are effective against a wide range of bacterial infections, including those of the ear. Amoxicillin is a penicillin-type antibiotic that is also effective against bacterial infections of the ear, but it may not be as effective against more resistant organisms. Cephalexin is a first-generation cephalosporin that is less effective against Gram-negative bacteria and may not be the best choice for this patient. Considering the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, cefepime would be the most appropriate antibiotic choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Laboratory evaluation of patients with known or suspected heart disease should include a blood count and serum chemistry analysis. Patients with heart disease tolerate anemia poorly. Serum sodium and potassium levels are particularly important in patients taking diuretics and digitalis. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine values provide information on renal function and hydration status. Assessment of blood glucose levels may detect undiagnosed DM. Chest radiography and electrocardiography are mandatory as part of the preoperative evaluation, and the results may be particularly helpful when compared with those of previous studies."

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

Consider, for example, a woman whose chief concern is that once a month, while leading a business seminar, she has a sudden, overwhelming urge to void followed by complete bladder emptying.

He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"
