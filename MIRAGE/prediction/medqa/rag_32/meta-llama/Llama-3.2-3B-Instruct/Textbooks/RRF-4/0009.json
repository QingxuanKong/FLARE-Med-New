    "predict": "Let's break down the question step by step: 1. The patient is a 23-year-old woman with no history of serious illness and no medications. She is embarrassed about the appearance of her nails, and a photograph of the nails is shown, but it is not provided. 2. The options provided are: A. Silvery plaques on extensor surfaces B. Flesh-colored papules in the lumbosacral region C. Erosions of the dental enamel D. Holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border 3. The most common nail disorders include onycholysis, nail thickening, subungual hyperkeratosis, and dystrophic changes such as pitting and ridging. However, the description of silvery plaques on extensor surfaces is a characteristic feature of psoriasis. 4. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune skin condition that speeds up the life cycle of skin cells, causing cells to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. The extra skin cells form scales and red patches that itch or burn. 5. Considering the options, the most likely finding in this patient is A. Silvery plaques on extensor surfaces, which is a characteristic feature of psoriasis.

This approach ensures that the entire cutaneous surface will be evaluated, and objective findings can be integrated with relevant historical data. Four basic features of a skin lesion must be noted and considered during a physical examination: the distribution of the eruption, the types of primary and secondary lesions, the shape of individual lesions, and the arrangement of the lesions. An ideal skin examination includes evaluation of the skin, hair, and nails as well as the mucous membranes of the mouth, eyes, nose, nasopharynx, and anogenital region. In the initial examination, it is important that the patient be disrobed as completely as possible to minimize chances of missing important individual skin lesions and permit accurate assessment of the distribution of the eruption.

The primary lesion in psoriasis is a scaly papule that soon forms erythematous plaques covered with a white scale, whereas that of dermatitis herpetiformis is an urticarial papule that quickly becomes a small vesicle. In this manner, identification of the primary lesion directs the examiner toward the proper diagnosis. Secondary changes in skin can also be quite helpful. For example, scale represents excessive epidermis, while crust is the result of a discontinuous epithelial cell layer. Palpation of skin lesions can yield insight into the character of an eruption. Thus, red papules on the lower extremities that blanch with pressure can be a manifestation of many different diseases, but hemorrhagic red papules that do not blanch with pressure indicate palpable purpura"

            "content": "Pityriasis rosea (PR) is a papulosquamous eruption of unknown etiology occurring more commonly in the spring and fall. Its first manifestation is the development of a 2to 6-cm annular lesion (the herald patch). This is followed in a few days to a few weeks by the appearance of many smaller annular or papular lesions with a predilection to occur on the trunk (Fig. 71-6). The lesions are generally oval, with their long axis parallel to the skinfold lines. Individual lesions may range in color from red to brown and have a trailing scale. PR shares many clinical features with the eruption of secondary syphilis, but palm and sole lesions are extremely rare in PR and common in secondary syphilis. The eruption tends to be moderately pruritic and lasts 3\u20138 weeks. Treatment is directed at alleviating pruritus and consists of oral antihistamines; mid-potency topical glucocorticoids; and, in some cases, UVB phototherapy. IMPETIgO, ECTHYMA, AND FuRuNCuLOSIS"

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."
