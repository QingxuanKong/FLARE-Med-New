    "question": "A 25-year-old female presents to her primary care physician complaining of double vision. She first started seeing double after a long day at her work as a radiation technologist. Since then, her vision has appeared to worsen in the evenings. She has also felt worsening fatigue despite no change in her work hours or sleep habits. She has a history of type I diabetes mellitus and her most recent hemoglobin A1c was 7.4%. Her family history is notable for Sjogren\u2019s syndrome in her mother and hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and carotid dissection in her father. Her temperature is 98.9\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 75/min, and respirations are 16/min. On examination, her pupils are equally round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. Mild ptosis is noted bilaterally but worse on the left. A visual acuity test reveals no abnormalities. Which of the following medications is most appropriate in the management of this patient?",

The patient's history of type I diabetes mellitus and family history of Sjogren's syndrome also support this diagnosis. The fact that the patient's symptoms worsen in the evenings may also be consistent with MG, which can be exacerbated by fatigue. The patient's pupils are equally round and reactive to light, and extraocular movements are intact, which further supports the diagnosis of MG rather than a third cranial nerve palsy. Pyridostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that is commonly used to treat MG by increasing the amount of acetylcholine available at the neuromuscular junction, making it the most appropriate medication for this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

            "content": "The presenting syndrome may be one of increased intracranial pressure, but more often it takes the form of a combined pituitary-hypothalamic-chiasmal derangement. The symptoms are often subtle and long standing. In children, visual loss and diabetes insipidus are the most frequent findings, followed in a few cases by adiposity, delayed physical and mental development, headaches, and vomiting. The visual disorder takes the form of dim vision, chiasmal field defects, optic atrophy, or papilledema, as emphasized long ago by Kennedy and Smith. In adults, waning libido, amenorrhea, slight spastic weakness of one or both legs, headache without papilledema, failing vision, and mental dullness and confusion are the usual manifestations. One of the most remarkable cases in our experience was a middle-aged nurse who became distractible and ineffective at work and was thought for many months to be simply depressed. Often it is observed that drowsiness, ocular palsies, diabetes insipidus, and"

Intermittent drowsiness, inattentiveness, reduction of psychomotor activity, inability to perceive all the items in a sequence of events, and forgetfulness constitute the more subtle manifestations of this syndrome and may prompt the family to seek medical help. Such symptoms may last only a few minutes or hours, and one cannot count on their presence at the time of a particular examination. In fully developed cases, the CSF is under increased pressure; Pco2 may exceed 75 mm Hg, and the O2 saturation of arterial blood ranges from 85 percent to as low as 40 percent. The EEG shows slow activity in the delta or theta range, which is sometimes bilaterally synchronous."

The diagnosis of essential or physiologic anisocoria is secure as long as the relative pupil asymmetry remains constant as ambient lighting varies. Anisocoria that increases in dim light indicates a sympathetic paresis of the iris dilator muscle. The triad of miosis with ipsilateral ptosis and anhidrosis constitutes Horner\u2019s syndrome, although anhidrosis is an inconstant feature. Brainstem stroke, carotid dissection, and neoplasm impinging on the sympathetic chain occasionally are identified as the cause of Horner\u2019s syndrome, but most cases are idiopathic. Anisocoria that increases in bright light suggests a parasympathetic palsy. The first concern is an oculomotor nerve paresis. This possibility is excluded if the eye movements are full and the patient has no ptosis or diplopia. Acute pupillary dilation (mydriasis) can result from"
