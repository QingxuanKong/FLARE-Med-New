The patient was on 2 antihypertensive medications and a statin, but she was not receiving any antiplatelet drugs. She has a blood pressure of 136/94, heart rate of 84/min, and respiratory rate of 15/min. Initial examination shows global aphasia, right homonymous hemianopia, and hemisensory loss. An acute ischemic stroke caused by distal left internal carotid artery occlusion with salvageable penumbral tissue is diagnosed based on a non-contrast CT scan, brain MRI, and catheter cerebral angiogram. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is given as treatment within 3 hours of presentation.

The patient presents with acute onset of impaired speech and comprehension, right-sided weakness, and has been diagnosed with a distal left internal carotid artery occlusion with salvageable penumbral tissue. This indicates that the ischemic insult is likely to be reversible if blood flow is restored. The given options are related to cellular processes involved in cell injury and death. Let's examine each option in relation to the scenario:\\n\\nA. Mitochondrial permeability: This refers to the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and ATP depletion. While mitochondrial dysfunction can occur in ischemic injury, it is not the most direct consequence of reversible ischemic injury in this scenario.\\n\\nB. Caspase activation: Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that play key roles in the execution phase of cell apoptosis. While caspase activation is involved in cell death pathways, it is not the typical marker of reversible injury.\\n\\nC. Lysosomal rupture: Lysosomal rupture can occur in ischemic injury, leading to the release of toxic substances and cell death. However, it is not the primary characteristic of reversible ischemic injury in this scenario.\\n\\nD. Decreased ATP: Decreased ATP levels are a hallmark of ischemic injury, as cellular energy metabolism is impaired due to reduced oxygen and glucose delivery. This is the most direct consequence of reversible ischemic injury, as restoring blood flow can quickly improve ATP production and prevent further injury.\\n\\nGiven the patient's salvageable penumbral tissue and the prompt initiation of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, the most likely cellular process typical of the section of reversible injury is decreased ATP.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The symptoms and signs of a stroke depend on the distribution of impaired brain perfusion. Common presentations include rapid-onset hemiparesis or hemisensory loss, visual field deficits, dysarthria, ataxia, and a decreased level of consciousness. Stroke is a neurological emergency. It is therefore important to establish the diagnosis as early as possible so that urgent and potentially life-saving treatment can be administered.

She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

Here we discuss secondary stroke prevention in the patient who has had TIAs or minor stroke and who has passed the acute period. The segment of the vessels that most often lends itself to endarterectomy or stenting is the carotid sinus (the bulbous expansion of the internal carotid artery just above its origin from the common carotid) because this is the site where atherosclerotic narrowing occurs. Other sites suitable for surgical or endovascular management include the common carotid, innominate, and proximal subclavian arteries. As mentioned earlier in the chapter, carotid artery disease most often causes strokes and single or repetitive TIAs but may also result in a hemispheral hypoperfusion syndrome as a result of low blood flow distal to a severe stenosis."

            "content": "If hours have passed since the first symptoms of stroke but the syndrome is fluctuating or advancing, the basic problem is whether a thrombotic infarction (venous or arterial) will spread and involve more brain tissue; or if embolic, whether the ischemic tissue will become hemorrhagic or another embolus will occur; or if there is an arterial dissection, whether it will give rise to emboli. Therapies are controversial in most of these circumstances. In some centers, it is the practice to try to prevent propagation of a thrombus by administering heparin (or low-molecular-weight heparin) followed by warfarin, as discussed earlier. Some stroke deficits fluctuate with blood pressure, suggesting occlusion of the carotid or of another large vessel. Attention to adequate cerebral perfusion by omitting the patient\u2019s usual blood pressure medications, ensuring adequate hydration and avoiding hemoconcentration, and potentially utilizing a head-down position may all assist in stabilizing the"

            "content": "With the inception of thrombolytic agents for stroke and the advances in endovascular procedures for thrombectomy, acute stroke treatment has evolved to emphasize rapid restoration of perfusion through occluded cerebral vessels. The steps in the process are now dominated by rapidly determining the patient\u2019s eligibility for intravenous and intra-arterial revascularization treatment and the timing of these steps has been derived from a series of randomized clinical trials. The current practice is to use intravenous thrombolysis within 3 h if there is no intracranial hemorrhage on CT and with additional qualifications, up to 4.5 h of stroke onset (Hacke et al, 2008). If vascular imaging performed during or after intravenous thrombolysis treatment shows large vessel occlusion (distal internal carotid or proximal middle cerebral arteries), the patient is eligible for endovascular thrombectomy or thrombolysis. If vascular imaging at that point shows no proximal arterial occlusion, no"
