If delivery occurs before the pudendal block becomes efective and an episiotomy is indicated, then the fourchette, perineum, and adjacent vagina can be iniltrated with 5 to 10 mL of I-percent lidocaine solution directly at the planned episiotomy site. By the time of repair, the pudendal block usually has become efective. Pudendal block usually does not provide adequate analgesia when delivery requires extensive obstetrical manipulation. Moreover, such analgesia is usually inadequate for women in whom complete visualization of the cervix and upper vagina or manual exploration of the uterine cavity is indicated."

For women in labor with a breech presentation, continuous epidural analgesia is advocated by some.

This nerve block may be accomplished transvaginally or through the perineum.

As the anesthetic agent is injected, frequent aspiration is required to avoid injection into the pudendal vessels, which travel with the nerve. The female urinary and genital tracts are closely related, anatomically and embryologically. Both are derived largely from primitive mesoderm and endoderm, and there is evidence that the embryologic urinary system has an important inductive in\ufb02uence on the developing genital system.

These operative vaginal techniques are detailed in Chapter 29 (p. 561). Infrequently, protrusion of fetal scalp through the introitus is the consequence of marked elongation of the fetal head from molding combined with formation of a large caput succedaneum. In some cases, the head may not even be engaged-that is, the biparietal diameter may not have passed through the pelvic inlet. In these, labor is characteristically long and descent of the head is slow. Careful palpation above the symphysis may disclose the fetal head to be above the pelvic inlet.

As complete efacement is achieved in the primigravid cervix, dilation is minimal. The reverse is true in the multipara. Efacement may be compared to a funneling process in which the whole length of a narrow cylinder is converted into a very obtuse, flaring funnel with a small distal circular opening. Because of growing myometrial activity during uterine preparedness for labor, appreciable efacement of a softened cervix sometimes is accomplished before active labor begins. Efacement causes expulsion of the mucous plug as the cervical canal is shortened."

Thus, vacuum aspiration at minimum requires intravenously or orally administered sedatives or analgesics, and some add a paracervical or intracervical blockade with lidocaine (llen, 2009; Renner, 2012). For local blocks, 5 mL of 1-or 2-percent lidocaine is most efective if placed immediately lateral to the insertion of the uterosacral ligaments into the uterus at 4 and 8 o'clock. An intracervical block with 5-mL aliquots of I-percent lidocaine injected at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock was reported to be equally efective (Mankowski, 2009). Alternatively, general or regional anesthesia"

            "content": "With full cervical dilation, most women cannot resist the urge to \"bear down\" or \"push\" each time the uterus contracts (Chap. 22, p. 438). The combined force created by contractions of the uterus and abdominal musculature propels the fetus downward. At times, force created by abdominal musculature is compromised suiciently to slow or even prevent spontaneous vaginal delivery. Heavy sedation or regional analgesia may reduce the reflex urge to push and may impair the ability to contract abdominal muscles efectively. In other instances, the inherent urge to push is overridden by the intense pain created by bearing down. Two approaches to second-stage pushing in women with epidural analgesia have yielded contradictory results. The irst advocates pushing forcefully with contractions after complete dilation, regardless of the urge to push. With the second, analgesia inusion is stopped and pushing begins only ater the woman regains the sensory urge to bear down. Fraser and coworkers (2000)"

The treatment of congenital anomalies can be summarized as follows: 1. Treatment of an imperforate hymen involves making a cruciate incision to open the vaginal orifice. Most imperforate hymens are not diagnosed until a hematocolpos forms. It is unwise to place a needle into a hematocolpos without completely removing the obstruction because a pyocolpos may occur. 2. If a transverse septum is present, surgical removal is required. Forty-six percent of transverse septa occur in the upper third of the vagina, and 40% occur in the middle third of the vagina (69). Frank dilators should be used to distend the vagina until it is healed to prevent vaginal adhesions (70). Patients have a fully functional reproductive system after surgery; however, patients with repaired high transverse septa may have lower pregnancy rates (71). 3."

A cool pack applied to the perineum may help reduce edema and discomfort during the irst 24 hours if there is a perineal laceration or an episiotomy. Most women also appear to obtain a measure of relief from the periodic application of a local anesthetic spray. Severe perineal vaginal, or rectal pain always warrants carul inspection and papation. Severe discomfort usually indicates a problem, such as a hematoma within the irst day or so and infection ater the third or fourth day (Chap. 37, p. 674 and Chap. 41, p. 764). Beginning approximately 24 hours after delivery, moist heat as provided by warm sitz baths can be used to reduce local discomfort. Tub bathing after uncomplicated delivery is allowed. The episiotomy incision normally is firmly healed and nearly asymptomatic by the third week."

Abdominal access is obtained by a Pfannenstiel, Maylard or vertical inci-sion. Once the abdomen is entered, a vesicouterine reflection is created if a low transverse uterine incision is planned. The uter-ine incision is then made and extended laterally, avoiding the uterine vessels. After amniotomy, the baby is delivered, and the uterus is closed. Approximately 1000 mL of blood is typically lost during a cesarean delivery. Along with rapid closure of the uterine incision, uterotonics, such as intravenous oxytocin, are administered.

Evidence suggests that the paracervical block may be the most effective (208,209). Following exposure of the cervix with a vaginal speculum, a spinal needle can be used to instill about 3 mL of 0.5% to 1% lidocaine into the anterior lip of the cervix to allow attachment of a tenaculum and manipulation of the exocervix. While the exact location and depth of the injection varies with providers and studies, the uterosacral ligament location (about 4 mm deep at approximately at the 4-and 8-o\u2019clock positions as one looks at the cervix) was demonstrated successful (210). Care must be taken to avoid intravascular injection. An alternative technique is the use of an intracervical block where the anesthetic agent is injected evenly around the circumference of the cervix, attempting to reach the level of the"
