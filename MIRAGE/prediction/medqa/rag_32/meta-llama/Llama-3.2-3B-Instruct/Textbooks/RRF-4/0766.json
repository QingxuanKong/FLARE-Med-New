    "question": "A 16-year-old healthy female presents to her pediatrician concerned that she has not had a menstrual period. She has no past medical history and takes no medications. She plays volleyball and gets good grades in school. Her BMI is 22 kg/m2. Physical examination reveals normal female external genitalia and pubic hair along the mons pubis and superomedial thighs. Her breasts appear normal. Transabdominal ultrasound reveals an absent uterus. Serum testosterone levels is within the normal range for females. What is the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s condition?",

        "A": "Pituitary tumor",
        "B": "Absence of second X chromosome",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient is a 16-year-old female who has not had a menstrual period, which suggests primary amenorrhea. The physical examination reveals normal female external genitalia and pubic hair, but an absent uterus on transabdominal ultrasound. The serum testosterone levels are within the normal range for females. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest that the cause of her primary amenorrhea is not related to hypogonadism (low testosterone levels) or androgen insensitivity syndrome (absence of pubic and axillary hair). Therefore, options C (Androgen receptor mutation) and B (Absence of second X chromosome) can be ruled out. The absent uterus on transabdominal ultrasound suggests that the patient may have a M\u00fcllerian agenesis or a condition that affects the development of the M\u00fcllerian ducts. M\u00fcllerian agenesis is a congenital disorder characterized by the failure of the M\u00fcllerian ducts to develop, resulting in the absence of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper part of the vagina. The normal testosterone levels and the presence of pubic hair suggest that the patient's reproductive system is functioning normally, and the cause of her primary amenorrhea is likely related to the development of the M\u00fcllerian ducts. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is D (Failure of paramesonephric duct development). This is consistent with M\u00fcllerian agenesis, a condition that is characterized by the congenital absence of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper part of the vagina, and normal development of the ovaries and external genitalia.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",

            "content": "The complete form of androgen resistance or androgen insensitivity syndrome is the most dramatic example of resistance to hormone action by defects in the androgen receptor. Affected patients have a 46,XY karyotype, normally formed testes (usually located in the inguinal canal or labia majora), and female external genitalia with a short vagina and no internal m\u00fcllerian structures. At the time of puberty, testosterone concentrations increase to normal or above normal male range. Because a portion of the testosterone is normally converted to estradiol in peripheral tissues and the estrogen cannot be opposed by the androgen, breast development ensues at the normal age of puberty without growth of pubic, facial, or axillary hair or the occurrence of menstruation."

Computed tomography scanning documented a large hypothalamic neoplasm that proved to be an ectopic germinoma. The patient was also documented to be hypothyroid and hypoadrenal and to have diabetes insipidus. Despite the elevated prolactin, she had no galactorrhea because of the minimal breast development.

Physical examination should focus on height; arm span; weight; visual fields; and secondary sex characteristics, including hair growth, testicular volume, phallic size, and scrotal reddening and thinning.

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

            "content": "Available @ StudentConsult.com Breast enlargement in boys is usually a benign, self-limited condition. Gynecomastia is noted in 50% to 60% of boys during early adolescence. It is often idiopathic, but it may be noted in various conditions (Table 68-3). Typical findings include the appearance of a 1to 3-cm, round, freely mobile, often tender, and firm mass immediately beneath the areola during sexual maturity rating stage III. Large, hard, or fixed enlargements and masses associated with any nipple discharge warrant further investigation. Reassurance is usually the only treatment required. If the condition worsens and is associated with psychological morbidity, it may be treated with bromocriptine. Surgical treatment with reduction mammoplasty can be helpful with massive hypertrophy. Irregular menses is the most common complaint of early adolescent girls. As regular, ovulatory cycles become established, pain with menstruation (dysmenorrhea) is a frequent complaint."

The Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome ofcongenital absence of the uterus occurs in 1 in 4000 to 5000female births. Anatomic obstruction by imperforate hymen orvaginal septum also presents with normal secondary sexualdevelopment without menstruation. The complete syndromeof androgen insensitivity includes normal feminization, absence of pubic or axillary hair, and primary amenorrhea.In this syndrome, all m\u00fcllerian structures, including ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper third of the vagina, are lacking; the karyotype is 46,XY, and subjects have intra-abdominal testes."

Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age. A 35-year-old woman visited her family practitioner because she had a \u201cbloating\u201d feeling and an increase in abdominal girth. The family practitioner examined the lower abdomen, which revealed a mass that extended from the superior pubic rami to the level of the umbilicus. The superior margin of the mass was easily palpated, but the inferior margin appeared to be less well defined. This patient has a pelvic mass. When examining a patient in the supine position, the observer should uncover the whole of the abdomen."

            "content": "The McCune-Albright syndrome is characterized by the classic triad of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia of bone, irregular caf\u00b4e-au-lait spots on the skin, and GnRH-independent sexual precocity. The caf\u00b4e-au-lait spots are usually large, do not cross the midline, and have irregular \u201ccoast of Maine\u201d margins. They are often located on the same side as the bony lesions. Sexual precocity often begins in the first 2 years and usually presents with menstrual bleeding. Girls develop sexual precocity as a result of functioning ovarian cysts. Serum estradiol is elevated. Other endocrinopathies may include hyperthyroidism, hypercortisolism, hyperprolactinemia, acromegaly, and hyperparathyroidism. Osteomalacia, hepatic abnormalities, and cardiac arrhythmia may occur. Mutations of the Gs\u03b1 subunit of the G protein, which couples extracellular hormonal signals to the activation of adenylate cyclase, are responsible for the autonomous hyperfunction of the endocrine glands and, presumably, for the other"

In some persons it may be expressed only as hypogonadism, but most patients have a distinctive body habitus with an increase in length between the soles and the pubic bone, which creates the appearance of an elongated body. Also characteristic is eunuchoid body habitus. Reduced facial, body, and pubic hair and gynecomastia also are frequently seen. The testes are markedly reduced in size, sometimes to only 2 cm in greatest dimension. In keeping with the testicular atrophy, the serum testosterone levels are lower than normal, and urinary gonadotropin levels are elevated."
