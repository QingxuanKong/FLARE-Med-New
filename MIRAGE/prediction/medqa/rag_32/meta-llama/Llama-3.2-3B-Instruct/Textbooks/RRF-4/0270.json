    "question": "A 31-year-old female patient complains of numbness and tingling in her left hand, weakness, difficulty with walking, dizziness, and bladder dysfunction. She said that about a year ago, she had trouble with her vision, and that it eventually recovered in a few days. On physical exam, bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia, hyperreflexia in both patella, and bilateral clonus, are noted. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study was done (Figure 1). If a lumbar puncture is performed in this patient, which of the following would most likely be found in cerebrospinal fluid analysis?",

        "D": "Decreased IgG CSF concentration"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the symptoms and physical examination findings presented in the scenario. The patient complains of numbness and tingling in her left hand, weakness, difficulty with walking, dizziness, and bladder dysfunction. She also had a history of vision problems that resolved on its own. The physical exam reveals bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia, hyperreflexia in both patella, and bilateral clonus. These findings suggest a central nervous system (CNS) disorder, possibly a demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The MRI study is not described, but the symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with a diagnosis of MS. The patient's symptoms are also consistent with optic neuritis, which is a common feature of MS. The presence of optic neuritis and other CNS symptoms such as numbness, weakness, and bladder dysfunction, along with the physical exam findings of bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia and hyperreflexia, are consistent with a diagnosis of MS. The patient's history of vision problems that resolved on its own is also consistent with optic neuritis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is multiple sclerosis (MS). Now, let's consider the options for what would be found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis if a lumbar puncture is performed in this patient. Option A, presence of 14-3-3 protein, is a marker of axonal injury and is often found in acute CNS damage, such as in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Option B, decreased glucose with neutrophilic predominance, is more consistent with bacterial meningitis. Option C, oligoclonal IgG bands on electrophoresis, is a hallmark of MS, as it indicates intrathecal production of immunoglobulins. Option D, decreased IgG CSF concentration, is not typically seen in MS. Therefore, the most likely finding in CSF analysis in this patient is oligoclonal IgG bands on electrophoresis, which is consistent with multiple sclerosis (MS).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

Hypotonia may be evident on inspection and palpation of the buttock and calf. In only a few patients is a foot drop (L5 root) or weakness of plantar flexion (S1 root) the main feature of disc protrusion, but it is notable that some patients have little pain with disc rupture. The reflex changes noted below have little relationship to the severity of the pain or sensory loss. Furthermore, compression of the fourth, or sometimes fifth, lumbar root may occur without any change in the tendon reflexes. Bilaterality of symptoms and signs is rare, as is sphincteric paralysis, but they occur with large central protrusions that compress the cauda equina. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein is then slightly elevated, usually in the range of 55 to 85 mg/dL, sometimes higher."

Optic atrophy and irritability or other cognitive changes may be prominent in advanced cases and are occasionally the presenting symptoms.

Sagittal (left image) and axial (right image) T2 MRI of the cervical spine in subacute combined degeneration (SCD) showing abnormal hyperintensity in the posterior columns. The patient had markedly reduced vibration and position sense and a Romberg sign; the tendon reflexes were preserved and there were no corticospinal tract or peripheral nerve signs. Figure 40-4. Axial CT from a 60-year-old alcoholic patient showing prominence of midline cerebellar sulci (upper image). A broad-based gait and ataxia of the legs had been present for many years. Death was from myocardial infarction. The cerebellum, cut in the midsagittal plane (lower image), shows folial atrophy of the anterosuperior vermis, characteristic of alcoholic cerebellar degeneration."

            "content": "GBS is not only the most frequent acute generalized polyneuropathy seen in general hospitals but also the most rapidly evolving and potentially fatal form. Any polyneuropathy that brings the patient to the brink of death or to respiratory failure within a few days will usually be of this variety. Most cases, however, are of the more limited type with paresthesias, limb weakness, and areflexia. Several other conditions must be considered. The immediate problem is to differentiate GBS from acute spinal cord disease marked by sensorimotor paralysis with a defined spinal level and prominent sphincter disturbances and from several neuromuscular diseases that can simulate GBS. There may be diagnostic difficulty in the case of an acute lesion of the cord in which tendon reflexes are initially lost (spinal shock), or with necrotizing myelopathy, where a permanent loss of tendon reflexes follows extensive destruction of spinal gray matter. Early and transient urinary retention occurs in a"

            "content": "When there has been doubt as to the effects of lumbar puncture, one appropriate course is to admit the patient to the hospital, and insert a lumbar drain for up to 3 days, removing approximately 50 mL of CSF daily in order to observe the response in gait and mentation. It is worthwhile to quantify the speed and facility of gait two or three times before the lumbar puncture or drainage and to perform this testing at periodic intervals for several days after the procedure in order to be certain that improvement is genuine. Even more persuasive is a definite improvement followed days later by worsening of gait."

            "content": "About a dozen variants of globoid cell leukodystrophy have been reported, many of them allowing survival for years. In these, neurologic regression begins in the 2to 6-year-old period. Visual failure with optic atrophy and a normal electroretinogram is an early finding. Later there is ataxia, as well as spastic weakness of the legs, mental regression, and finally decerebration. In three patients observed by R.D. Adams, a progressive quadriparesis with mild pseudobulbar signs, slowly progressive impairment of memory and other mental functions, dystonic posturing of the arms, and preserved sphincteric control constituted the clinical picture. The patients were alive at ages 9, 12, and 16 years. We have observed another rare variant, beginning in adult years, with spastic quadriparesis (asymmetrical) and optic atrophy. Mentation was essentially normal and, on imaging, the cerebral lesion was restricted. Unlike typical Krabbe disease, these CNS abnormalities are unaccompanied by any"

In addition, she is on hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol for hypertension. The patient has a history of one depressive episode after a divorce that was treated successfully with fluoxetine. Medical workup including complete blood cell count, thyroid func-tion tests, and a chemistry panel reveals no abnormalities. She is started on fluoxetine for a presumed major depressive episode and referred for cognitive behavioral psychotherapy.
