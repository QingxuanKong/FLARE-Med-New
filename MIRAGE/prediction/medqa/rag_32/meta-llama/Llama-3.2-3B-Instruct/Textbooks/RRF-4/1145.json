The physical examination shows dense breasts and a 2.5-cm rubbery, mobile mass that is nontender in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast.\\n\\nFrom the given options, let's analyze each choice:\\n\\nA. Fibroadenoma: Fibroadenomas are common benign breast tumors that are usually discovered in young women, often between the ages of 15 and 35 years. They are typically firm, smooth, and rubbery, and are more common in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. The biopsy results show rounded contour with overgrowth of fibrous and glandular tissue, which is consistent with fibroadenoma.\\n\\nB. Normal pregnancy-related changes: Pregnancy-related changes in the breast are common and can cause a variety of symptoms, including a palpable mass. However, these changes are usually not as distinct as the one described in the scenario, and they do not typically cause a 2.5-cm rubbery, mobile mass.\\n\\nC. Fat necrosis: Fat necrosis is a rare condition that occurs when there is damage to the breast tissue, often due to trauma or surgery. It can cause a palpable mass, but it is typically not as smooth and rubbery as the one described in the scenario.\\n\\nD. Phyllodes tumor: Phyllodes tumors are rare breast tumors that can be benign, borderline, or malignant. They are typically larger than fibroadenomas and can cause more distortion of the breast tissue. The biopsy results do not provide enough information to suggest a phyllodes tumor.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the most likely diagnosis is fibroadenoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

If the breast is large, a pillow or towel may be placed beneath the scapula to elevate the side being examined; otherwise, the breast tends to fall to the side, making palpation of the lateral hemisphere more difficult. The major features to be identified on palpation of the breast are temperature, texture and thickness of skin, generalized or focal tenderness, nodularity, density, asymmetry, dominant masses, and nipple discharge. Most premenopausal patients have normally nodular breast parenchyma. The nodularity is diffuse but predominantly in the upper outer quadrants, where there is more breast tissue. These benign parenchymal nodules are small, similar in size, and indistinct. By comparison, breast cancer usually occurs in the form of a nontender, firm mass with irregular margins.

Some argue that stage for stage, the outcome is the same for breast cancer diagnosed in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Primary tumors in pregnant women are 3.5 cm on average, compared to <2 cm in nonpregnant women. A dominant mass and a nipple discharge are the most common presenting signs, and they should prompt ultrasonography and breast MRI exam (if available) followed by lumpectomy if the mass is solid and aspiration if the mass is cystic. Mammography is less reliable in pregnancy due to the increased breast density. Needle aspirates of breast masses in pregnant women are often nondiagnostic or falsely positive.

Most (~95%) are benign; these tend to be round to oval and to have circumscribed borders. In contrast, malignant tumors usually invade across tissue planes and have irregular borders. However, because some cancers grow deceptively as circumscribed masses, all palpable masses require evaluation. Gynecomastia is the only common breast symptom in males.

When a breast cancer is found, treatment consists of an axillary lymph node dissection with a mastectomy or preservation of the breast fol-lowed by whole-breast radiation therapy. Chemotherapy and endocrine therapy should be considered.Breast Cancer During PregnancyBreast cancer occurs in 1 of every 3000 pregnant women, and axillary lymph node metastases are present in up to 75% of these women.368 The average age of the pregnant woman with breast cancer is 34 years. Fewer than 25% of the breast nodules developing during pregnancy and lactation will be cancerous. Ultrasonography and needle biopsy specimens are used in the diagnosis of these nodules. Mammography is rarely indicated because of its decreased sensitivity during pregnancy and lac-tation; however, the fetus can be shielded if mammography is needed. Approximately 30% of the benign conditions encoun-tered will"

The upper outer quad-rant of the breast contains a greater volume of tissue than do the other quadrants. The breast has a protuberant conical form. The base of the cone is roughly circular, measuring 10 to 12 cm in diameter. Considerable variations in the size, contour, and den-sity of the breast are evident among individuals. The nulliparous breast has a hemispheric configuration with distinct flattening above the nipple. With the hormonal stimulation that accom-panies pregnancy and lactation, the breast becomes larger and increases in volume and density, whereas with senescence, it assumes a flattened, flaccid, and more pendulous configuration with decreased volume.Nipple-Areola Complex. The epidermis of the nipple-are-ola complex is pigmented and is variably corrugated. During puberty, the pigment becomes darker and the"

            "content": "Gynecomastia refers to enlargement of the male breast. It is caused by excess estrogen action and is usually the result of an increased estrogen-to-androgen ratio. True gynecomastia is associated with glandular breast tissue that is >4 cm in diameter and often tender. Glandular tissue enlargement should be distinguished from excess adipose tissue: glandular tissue is firmer and contains fibrous-like cords. Gynecomastia occurs as a normal physiologic phenomenon in the newborn (due to transplacental transfer of maternal and placental estrogens), during puberty (high estrogen-to-androgen ratio in early stages of puberty), and with aging (increased fat tissue and increased aromatase activity), but it can also result from pathologic conditions associated with androgen deficiency or estrogen excess. The prevalence of gynecomastia increases with age and body mass index (BMI), likely because of increased aromatase activity in adipose tissue. Medications that alter androgen metabolism or"
