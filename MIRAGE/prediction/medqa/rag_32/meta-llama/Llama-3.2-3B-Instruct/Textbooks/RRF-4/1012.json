The urea cycle is a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that convert ammonia (NH3) into urea, which is then excreted by the kidneys. The cycle involves several key steps, including the synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate, the conversion of carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline, and the formation of arginosuccinate. The final step of the cycle is the hydrolysis of arginosuccinate to arginine and fumarate, which is catalyzed by the enzyme argininosuccinate synthetase. However, this is not the rate-limiting step. The rate-limiting step is actually the synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate from ammonia, bicarbonate, and ATP. This step is catalyzed by the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS I), which is the first committed step of the urea cycle. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

Deficiencies of the enzymes of the urea cycle result in the failure to synthesize urea and lead to hyperammonemia in the first few weeks after birth. Glutamine will also be elevated because it acts as a nontoxic storage and transport form of ammonia. Therefore, elevated glutamine accompanies hyperammonemia. Asparagine and lysine do not serve this sequestering role. Urea would be decreased because of impaired activity of the urea cycle. [Note: Alanine would also be elevated in this patient.] 9.5. Why might supplementation with arginine be of benefit to this patient? The arginine will be cleaved by arginase to urea and ornithine.

Elevated levels of ammonia, which the liver normally clears through the urea cycle, in combination with inflammation and hyponatremia, cause the changes in brain function. Because it is only one contributing factor, ammonia levels in symptomatic patients vary widely. Within the CNS, ammonia metabolism occurs only in astrocytes through the action of glutamine synthetase, and in the setting of hyperammonemia, astrocytes in the cortex and basal ganglia develop swollen, pale nuclei (referred to as Alzheimer type II cells). http://ebooksmedicine.net"

Nitrogen enters the body in a variety of compounds present in food, the most important being amino acids contained in dietary protein. Nitrogen leaves the body as urea, ammonia, and other products derived from amino acid metabolism (such as creatinine, see p. 287). The role of body proteins in these transformations involves two important concepts: the amino acid pool and protein turnover. A. Amino acid pool"

            "content": "The NH3, which is toxic, can be transported to the liver as glutamine (Gln) and alanine (Ala). The Gln is generated by the amination of glutamate by ATP-requiring glutamine synthetase. In the liver, the enzyme glutaminase removes the NH3, which can be converted to urea by the urea cycle or excreted as ammonium (NH4+) (see figure at right). Gln, then, is a nontoxic vehicle of NH3 transport in the blood. Ala is generated in skeletal muscle from the catabolism of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). In the liver, Ala is transaminated by alanine transaminase (ALT) to pyruvate (used in gluconeogenesis) and glutamate. Thus, Ala carries nitrogen to the liver for conversion to urea (see figure below). Therefore, defects in the urea cycle would result in an elevation in NH3, Gln, and Ala. The elevated NH3 drives respiration, and the hyperventilation causes a rise in pH (respiratory alkalosis). [Note: Hyperammonemia is toxic to the nervous system. Although the exact mechanisms are not"

            "content": "During shock, there is disruption of the normal cycles of carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism. Through the citric acid cycle, alanine in conjunction with lactate, which is converted from pyruvate in the periphery in the presence of oxygen deprivation, enhances the hepatic production of glucose. With reduced availability of oxygen, the breakdown of glucose to pyruvate, and ultimately lactate, represents an inefficient cycling of substrate with minimal net energy production. An elevated plasma lactate/pyruvate ratio is preferable to lactate alone as a measure of anaerobic metabolism and reflects inadequate tissue perfusion. Decreased clearance of exogenous triglycerides coupled with increased hepatic lipogenesis causes a significant rise in serum triglyceride concentrations. There is increased protein catabolism as energy substrate, a negative nitrogen balance, and, if the process is prolonged, severe muscle wasting."

            "content": "The most plausible hypothesis relates hepatic coma to an abnormality of nitrogen metabolism, wherein ammonia, which is formed in the bowel by the action of urease-containing organisms on dietary protein, is carried to the liver in the portal circulation but fails to be converted into urea because of hepatocellular disease, portal\u2013 systemic shunting of blood, or both. As a result, excess NH3 reaches the systemic circulation, where it interferes with cerebral metabolism in a way that is not fully understood. The ammonia theory best explains the basic neuropathologic change. Because the brain is lacking in urea cycle enzymes, Norenberg has proposed that the hypertrophy of the astrocytic cytoplasm and proliferation of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, as well as the increase in the astroglial glutamic dehydrogenase activity, all reflect heightened metabolic activity of these systems within astrocytes associated with ammonia detoxification. Removal of brain ammonia depends on the"
