He wears soft contact lenses and has not removed them for 2 days. The ophthalmologic examination shows a deep corneal ulcer, severe conjunctival injection, and purulent discharge on the right eye. Given the symptoms and examination findings, the most likely cause of the infection is a bacterial infection, specifically Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common cause of contact lens-related infections. The use of soft contact lenses increases the risk of infection, and the presence of purulent discharge and corneal ulceration suggests a bacterial etiology. The Gram stain of the ocular discharge is most likely to show Gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacilli, which is characteristic of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The most common viral etiology is adenovirus infection. It causes a watery discharge, a mild foreign-body sensation, and photophobia. Bacterial infection tends to produce a more mucopurulent exudate. Mild cases of infectious conjunctivitis usually are treated empirically with broad-spectrum topical ocular antibiotics such as sulfacetamide 10%, polymyxin-bacitracin, or a trimethoprim-polymyxin combination. Smears and cultures usually are reserved for severe, resistant, or recurrent cases of conjunctivitis.

As in genital infection, the manifestations range from severe to occasionally mild or asymptomatic disease. The variability in clinical manifestations may be attributable to differences in the ability of the infecting strain to elicit an inflammatory response. Infection may result in a markedly swollen eyelid, severe hyperemia and chemosis, and a profuse purulent discharge. The massively inflamed conjunctiva may be draped over the cornea and limbus. Lytic enzymes from the infiltrating PMNs occasionally cause corneal ulceration and rarely cause perforation. Prompt recognition and treatment of this condition are of paramount importance. Gram\u2019s stain and culture of the purulent discharge establish the diagnosis. Genital cultures should also be performed."

Since contact lenses presumably cause microscopic trauma, the early corneal findings may be nonspecific. The first symptoms usually include tearing and the painful sensation of a foreign body.

            "content": "Most of these changes are transient and are usually due to traction injuries during the surgical procedure. A 33-year-old fit and well woman came to the emergency department complaining of double vision and pain behind her right eye. She had no other symptoms. On examination of the right eye the pupil was dilated. There was a mild ptosis. Testing of eye movement revealed that the eye turned down and out and the pupillary reflex was not present. These findings revealed that the patient had an ipsilateral third nerve palsy (palsy of the oculomotor nerve [III]). The oculomotor nerve [III] is the main motor nerve to the ocular and extra-ocular muscles. It arises from the midbrain and pierces the dura mater to run in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. The oculomotor nerve [III] leaves the cranial cavity and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. Within this fissure it divides into its superior and inferior divisions."

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."

The inflamed conjunctiva is painful, with numerous yellowish nodules and pinpoint ulcers. Rate of Occurrence, % Source: Adapted from RF Jacobs, JP Narain: Pediatrics 76:818, 1985; with permission. FIGuRE 195-1 An 8-year-old boy with inguinal lymphadenitis and associated tick-bite site characteristic of ulceroglandular tularemia. Purulent conjunctivitis with regional lymphadenopathy (preauricular, submandibular, or cervical) is evident. Because of debilitating pain, the patient may seek medical attention before regional lymphadenopathy develops. Painful preauricular lymphadenopathy is unique to tularemia and distinguishes it from tuberculosis, sporotrichosis, and syphilis. Corneal perforation may occur."

            "content": "The condition can be rapidly fatal if left untreated. If clinical suspicion is high, begin treatment while awaiting testing. Prevent by avoiding tick bites. Causes of red eye: A common complaint in the emergency room setting, inf ammation of the conjunctiva is most often bacterial or viral but can also be fungal, parasitic, allergic, or chemical. It is essential to differentiate potentially vision-threatening infectious etiologies from allergic or other causes of conjunctivitis, as well as to identify other vision-threatening conditions that may mimic conjunctivitis. See Table 2.8-9 for the common etiologies of infectious conjunctivitis. Commonly due to infection of the paranasal sinuses; can lead to endophthalmitis and blindness. Usually caused by streptococci, staphylococci (including MRSA), and H. in\ufb02 uenzae (in children). In diabetic and immunocompromised patients, mucormycosis and Rhizopus are in the differential."
