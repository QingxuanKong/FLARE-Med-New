    "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician due to sore throat and fever. He was in his usual state of health until 3 days ago when he began to complain of a sore throat as well as general malaise. The patient's past medical history reveals recurrent upper respiratory infections but no skin or soft tissue infections. The child had cardiac surgery as an infant but has otherwise been healthy. On presentation, his temperature is 100\u00b0F (37.8 \u00b0C), blood pressure is 115/72 mmHg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 22/min. Physical exam shows white plaques on the tongue and mouth. A scraping of this material reveals a characteristic morphology after being treated with KOH. Serum protein electrophoresis shows a normal distribution of bands from this patient. Which of the following findings would most likely be found in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Delayed separation of the umbilical cord",
        "B": "Hypoparathyroidism",
        "C": "Partial albinism",
        "D": "Thrombocytopenic purpura"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. The patient is a 5-year-old boy with a sore throat and fever, which started 3 days ago. He has a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections but no skin or soft tissue infections. 2. The physical examination reveals white plaques on the tongue and mouth, which, after being treated with KOH (potassium hydroxide), reveal a characteristic morphology. This suggests a fungal infection. 3. The patient had cardiac surgery as an infant but has otherwise been healthy. 4. The serum protein electrophoresis shows a normal distribution of bands, indicating no significant abnormalities in protein production. Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is oral thrush, a fungal infection caused by Candida species. Oral thrush is a common condition in children, especially those who have been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, had immunosuppression, or have a history of oral thrush. Now, let's evaluate the answer choices: A. Delayed separation of the umbilical cord - This is not directly related to oral thrush. B. Hypoparathyroidism - This condition is not associated with oral thrush. C. Partial albinism - This is also not related to oral thrush. D. Thrombocytopenic purpura - This condition is characterized by low platelet count and is not directly related to oral thrush. However, oral thrush can increase the risk of developing thrombocytopenia, especially in immunocompromised patients. Therefore, this is the most likely finding associated with oral thrush. So, the final answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient most likely has oral thrush, which can increase the risk of thrombocytopenia. The correct answer is D. Thrombocytopenic purpura.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Younger children may manifest streptococcal infection with a syndrome of fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy without exudative pharyngitis. Infection is acquired through contact with another individual carrying the organism. Respiratory droplets are the usual mechanism of spread, although other routes, including food-borne outbreaks, have been well described. The incubation period is 1\u20134 days. Symptoms include sore throat, fever and chills, malaise, and sometimes abdominal complaints and vomiting, particularly in children. Both symptoms and signs are quite variable, ranging from mild throat discomfort with minimal physical findings to high fever and severe sore throat associated with intense erythema and swelling of the"

The onset of streptococcal pharyngitis is often rapid and associated with prominent sore throat and moderate to high fever. Headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are frequent. In a typical, florid case, the pharynx is distinctly red. The tonsils are enlarged and covered with a yellow, blood-tinged exudate. There may be petechiae or doughnut-shapedlesions on the soft palate and posterior pharynx. The uvula may be red, stippled, and swollen. Anterior cervical lymph nodes are enlarged and tender to touch. Many children, however, present with only mild pharyngeal erythema without tonsillar exudate or cervical lymphadenitis. Conjunctivitis, cough, coryza, hoarseness, or ulcerations suggest a viral etiology. The diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis cannot be made on clinical features alone."

            "content": "Sore throat is the primary symptom in approximately one third of upper respiratory tract illnesses. Streptococcal pharyngitis is relatively uncommon before 2 to 3 years of age, but the incidence increases in young school-age children and then declines in late adolescence and adulthood. Streptococcal pharyngitis occurs throughout the year in temperate climates, with a peak during the winter and early spring. The illness often spreads to siblings and classmates. Viral infections generally spread via close contact with an infected person and peak during winter and spring. Available @ StudentConsult.com Pharyngeal inflammation causes cough, sore throat, dysphagia, and fever. If involvement of the tonsils is prominent, the term tonsillitis or tonsillopharyngitis is often used. Adapted from Hayden GF, Hendley JO, Gwaltney JM Jr: Management of the ambulatory patient with a sore throat, Curr Clin Top Infect Dis 9:62\u201375, 1988."

            "content": "APPROACH TO THE PATIENT: The chronology of events preceding fever, including exposure to other infected individuals or to vectors of disease, should be ascertained. Electronic devices for measuring oral, tympanic membrane, or rectal temperatures are reliable, but the same site should be used consistently to monitor a febrile disease. Moreover, physicians should be aware that newborns, elderly patients, patients with chronic liver or renal failure, and patients taking glucocorticoids or being treated with an anticytokine may have active infection in the absence of fever due to a blunted febrile response. The workup should include a complete blood count; a differential count should be performed manually or with an instrument sensitive to the identification of juvenile or band forms, toxic granulations, and D\u00f6hle bodies, which are suggestive of bacterial infection. Neutropenia may be present with some viral infections."

            "content": "The physician will be aided in the pursuit of an explanation for the lymphadenopathy by a careful medical history, physical examination, selected laboratory tests, and perhaps an excisional lymph node biopsy. The medical history should reveal the setting in which lymphadenopathy is occurring. Symptoms such as sore throat, cough, fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, or pain in the nodes should be sought. The patient\u2019s age, sex, occupation, exposure to pets, sexual behavior, and use of drugs such as diphenylhydantoin are other important historic points. For example, children and young adults usually have benign (i.e., nonmalignant) disorders that account for the observed lymphadenopathy such as viral or bacterial upper respiratory infections; infectious mononucleosis; toxoplasmosis; and, in some countries, tuberculosis. In contrast, after age 50, the incidence of malignant disorders increases and that of benign disorders decreases."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

Review of the past history and growth chart demonstrates normal birth weight and birth length, but a progressive decrease in height per-centiles relative to age-matched normal ranges starting at 6 months of age, and orthostasis with febrile illnesses. Physical examination demonstrates short stature and mild generalized obesity. Genital examination reveals descended but small testes and a phallic length of \u20132 SD. Laboratory evaluations demonstrate growth hormone (GH) deficiency and a delayed bone age of 18 months. The patient is started on replacement with recombinant human GH at a dose of 40 mcg/kg per day subcutaneously. After 1 year of treatment, his height velocity has increased from 5 cm/y to 11 cm/y.

The most common presenting symptom is sore throat\u2014one of the most common reasons for ambulatory care visits by both adults and children. Although sore throat is a symptom in many noninfectious illnesses as well, the overwhelming majority of patients with a new sore throat have acute pharyngitis of viral or bacterial etiology. Millions of visits to primary care providers each year are for sore throat; the majority of cases of acute pharyngitis are caused by typical respiratory viruses. The most important source of concern is infection with group A \u03b2-hemolytic Streptococcus (S. pyogenes) that is associated with acute glomerulonephritis and acute rheumatic fever. The risk of rheumatic fever can be reduced by timely penicillin therapy."

            "content": "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A complete physical examination should be performed, with special attention to several areas that are sometimes given short shrift in routine examinations. Assessment of the patient\u2019s general appearance and vital signs, skin and soft tissue examination, and the neurologic evaluation are of particular importance. The patient may appear either anxious and agitated or lethargic and apathetic. Fever is usually present, although elderly patients and compromised hosts (e.g., patients who are uremic or cirrhotic and those who are taking glucocorticoids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be afebrile despite serious underlying infection. Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate helps determine the degree of hemodynamic and metabolic compromise. The patient\u2019s airway must be evaluated to rule out the risk of obstruction from an invasive oropharyngeal infection."
