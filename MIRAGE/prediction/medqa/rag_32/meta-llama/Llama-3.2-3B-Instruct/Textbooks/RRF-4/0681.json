    "question": "A 29-year-old female presents to her primary care provider with an aching pain in her left leg that has progressively gotten worse over several days. She recently had an unfortunate sporting incident resulting in large bruises along both legs and lower thighs. An X-ray after the event was negative for fracture. Past medical history is positive for systemic lupus erythematosus. She also has a history of one spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks gestation. Today, her heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, blood pressure is 119/80 mm Hg, and temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical examination, her left leg appears pink and slightly swollen. Homan\u2019s sign is positive. A Doppler ultrasound reveals a thrombus in the left popliteal vein. Her lab results are as follows:\nPlatelets 250,000/mm3\nProthrombin Time 14 sec\nPartial Thromboplastin Time 90 sec\nMixing study (PTT) 89 sec\nWhat is the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s condition?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is an autoimmune disease that can affect various parts of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, brain, and other organs. SLE can also increase the risk of blood clots. The patient also had a recent sporting incident resulting in large bruises, which could have caused trauma to the veins, leading to thrombosis. The physical examination findings of Homan's sign (positive) and the Doppler ultrasound revealing a thrombus in the left popliteal vein are consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The lab results showing elevated PT, PTT, and mixing study time are also consistent with DVT. Given the patient's history of SLE, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is antibodies directed against phospholipids, which are a type of antiphospholipid antibody associated with SLE and an increased risk of blood clots.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" } ``` The reasoning is as follows: * The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is an autoimmune disease that can increase the risk of blood clots. * The patient had a recent sporting incident resulting in large bruises, which could have caused trauma to the veins, leading to thrombosis. * The physical examination findings of Homan's sign (positive) and the Doppler ultrasound revealing a thrombus in the left popliteal vein are consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). * The lab results showing elevated PT, PTT, and mixing study time are also consistent with DVT. * Given the patient's history of SLE, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is antibodies directed against phospholipids, which are a type of antiphospholipid antibody associated with SLE and an increased risk of blood clots. The other options are not as likely: * Antibodies directed against platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (A) are associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which is not indicated by the patient's symptoms and lab results. * Antibodies directed against endothelial cells (C) are associated with vasculitis, which is not indicated by the patient's symptoms and lab results. * Vitamin K deficiency (D) is not indicated by the patient's symptoms and lab results, and vitamin K is not typically associated with an increased risk of blood clots in this context.",

However, patients with a high clinical likelihood of VTE should skip d-dimer testing and undergo imaging as the next step in the diagnostic algorithm. Clinical Pearls Not all leg pain is due to DVT, and not all dyspnea is due to PE (Table 300-2). Sudden, severe calf discomfort suggests a ruptured Baker\u2019s cyst. Fever and chills usually herald cellulitis rather than DVT. Physical findings, if present, may consist only of mild palpation discomfort in the lower calf. However, massive DVT often presents with marked thigh swelling, tenderness, and erythema. If the leg is diffusely edematous, DVT is unlikely. More probable is an acute exacerbation of venous insufficiency due to postthrombotic syndrome. Upper extremity venous thrombosis may present with asymmetry in the supraclavicular fossa or in the circumference of the upper arms."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

The popliteal vein is superficial to the artery and the sciatic nerve is superficial to the vein (eFig. 6.142). Importantly, the sciatic nerve divides at the apex of the popliteal fossa. The tibial nerve continues into the lower popliteal fossa. The common fibular nerve passes laterally adjacent to the biceps femoris muscle to become superficial and wrap around the fibula neck. It was concluded that the surgeon had accidentally ligated the common fibular nerve rather than the small saphenous vein, thus producing this patient\u2019s symptoms. A 72-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency room after falling at home. She complained of a severe pain in her right hip and had noticeable bruising on the right side of the face. On admission it was noted that the patient\u2019s right leg was shorter than her left leg and externally rotated."

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg.

The most common location for an embolus to lodge in the leg is at the common femoral bifurcation. Typically, a patient will complain of foot and calf pain. Pulses are absent, and there may be diminution of sensation. Inability to move the affected muscle group is a sign of very severe ischemia and necessitates urgent revascularization. During evaluation of the affected extremity, it is important to compare findings with the contralateral limb. Clinical evaluation is extremely important in determining the etiology and location of the obstruction. One of the most important pieces of information to obtain is whether the patient has had prior vascular procedures or if there is a history of lower extremity claudication. Either of these features suggests"

Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination?
