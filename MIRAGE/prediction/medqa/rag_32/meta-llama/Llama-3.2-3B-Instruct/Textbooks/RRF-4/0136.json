He reports that his chest pain worsens with large meals and spicy foods and improves with calcium carbonate. He denies dyspnea on exertion and an ECG is normal. What is the most likely cause of this patient's pain?",

        "A": "Partially occluded coronary artery",
        "B": "Umbilical hernia",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's history and physical examination: 1. The patient is a 61-year-old Caucasian male with a family history of heart disease, with his father dying of a heart attack at age 62. 2. The patient's chest pain worsens with large meals and spicy foods, but improves with calcium carbonate. 3. The patient denies dyspnea on exertion and has a normal ECG. Given these points, the patient's symptoms are suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is often triggered by food intake, particularly large or spicy meals. The fact that the pain improves with calcium carbonate, an antacid, further supports this diagnosis. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Partially occluded coronary artery - This would likely cause chest pain that worsens with exertion and improves with rest, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. B. Umbilical hernia - While an umbilical hernia can cause abdominal pain, it is not typically associated with chest pain that improves with antacids. C. Gastroesophageal junction incompetence - This is a condition where the lower esophageal sphincter does not function properly, allowing stomach acid to flow back up into the esophagus, causing symptoms like those described. This is a common cause of GERD. D. Intestinal metaplasia at the gastroesophageal junction - This is a condition where the lining of the esophagus is replaced by tissue similar to the lining of the intestine, but it is not typically associated with the symptoms described. Based on the patient's symptoms and response to treatment, the most likely cause of his pain is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is consistent with option C, Gastroesophageal junction incompetence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

However, clinicians should be aware of the phenomenon of \u201cwarm-up angina\u201d in which some patients experience relief of angina as they continue at the same or even a greater level of exertion without symptoms (Chap. 293). Alterations in the intensity of pain with changes in position or movement of the upper extremities and neck are less likely with myocardial ischemia and suggest a musculoskeletal etiology. The pain of pericarditis, however, often is worse in the supine position and relieved by sitting upright and leaning forward. Gastroesophageal reflux may be exacerbated by alcohol, some foods, or by a reclined position. Relief can occur with sitting."

However, the characteristics of the pain are pivotal in formulating an initial clinical impression and assessing the likelihood of a serious cardiopulmonary process (Table 19-1), including acs in particular (Fig. 19-2). Pressure or tightness is consistent with a typical presentation of myocardial ischemic pain. Nevertheless, the clinician must remember that some patients with ischemic chest symptoms deny any \u201cpain\u201d but rather complain of dyspnea or a vague sense of anxiety. The severity of the discomfort has poor diagnostic accuracy. It is often helpful to ask about the similarity of the discomfort to previous definite ischemic symptoms. It is unusual for angina to be sharp, as in knifelike, stabbing, or pleuritic; however, patients sometimes use the word \u201csharp\u201d to convey the intensity of discomfort rather than the quality.

Assessment of a patient with chest pain includes a thorough history to determine activity at the onset; the location, radiation, quality, and duration of the pain; what makes the pain better and worse during the time that it is present; and any associated symptoms. A family history and assessment of how much anxiety the symptom is causing are important and often revealing. A careful general physical examination should focus on the chest wall, heart, lungs, and abdomen. A history of chest pain associated with exertion, syncope, or palpitations or acute onset associated with fever suggests a cardiac etiology. Cardiac causes of chest pain are generally ischemic, inflammatory, or arrhythmic in origin."

Sinus tachycardia, during exertion or with emotion, or premature ventricular contractions may produce particularly uncomfortable palpitations as well as head pounding. These complaints may persist for many years before the development of exertional dyspnea, usually the first symptom of diminished cardiac reserve. The dyspnea is followed by orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and excessive diaphoresis. Anginal chest pain even in the absence of CAD may occur in patients with severe AR, even in younger patients. Anginal pain may develop at rest as well as during exertion. Nocturnal angina may be a particularly troublesome symptom, and it may be accompanied by marked diaphoresis. The anginal episodes can be prolonged and often do not respond satisfactorily to"

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

            "content": "CHD presents differently in women, who are usually 10\u201315 years older than their male counterparts and are more likely to have comorbidities such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus (DM). In the Framingham study, angina was the most common initial symptom of CHD in women, whereas myocardial infarction (MI) was the most common initial presentation in men. Women more often have atypical symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, indigestion, and upper back pain. Although awareness that heart disease is the leading cause of death in women has nearly doubled over the last 15 years, women remain less aware that its symptoms are often atypical, and they are less likely to contact 9-1-1 when they experience such symptoms."

Interestingly, the height of the patient and the previous lens surgery would suggest a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and a series of blood tests and review of the family history revealed this was so. A 35-year-old male patient presented to his family practitioner because of recent weight loss (14 lb over the previous 2 months). He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets."

A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor.
