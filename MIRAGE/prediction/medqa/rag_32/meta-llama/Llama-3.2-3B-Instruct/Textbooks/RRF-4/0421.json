    "question": "A 65-year-old woman presented to the emergency room due to progressive dyspnea. She is a known hypertensive but is poorly compliant with medications. The patient claims to have orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and easy fatigability. On physical examination, the blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. There is prominent neck vein distention. An S3 gallop, bibasilar crackles, and grade 3 bipedal edema were also detected. A 2d echo was performed, which showed a decreased ejection fraction (32%).

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the results of the echocardiogram. The patient presents with progressive dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, easy fatigability, and physical examination findings of neck vein distention, S3 gallop, bibasilar crackles, and grade 3 bipedal edema. The echocardiogram shows a decreased ejection fraction of 32%, which indicates systolic heart failure. Given these findings, the patient is likely experiencing left-sided heart failure. The patient is also a known hypertensive and poorly compliant with medications, which may contribute to the progression of heart failure. Considering the patient's condition, we need to determine which of the listed drugs should not be given to this patient. Furosemide (A) is a loop diuretic commonly used to treat fluid overload and edema in heart failure patients. Nesiritide (B) is a B-type natriuretic peptide analogue used to treat acute decompensated heart failure. Metoprolol (C) is a beta-blocker that can be used to reduce heart rate and blood pressure in heart failure patients. Digoxin (D) is a cardiac glycoside used to increase the strength of heart contractions in atrial fibrillation or heart failure. Given the patient's systolic heart failure and decreased ejection fraction, Metoprolol (C) is the drug that should not be given to this patient as it can worsen heart failure by reducing the contractility of the heart. In the setting of systolic heart failure, beta-blockers like Metoprolol can decrease the contractility of the heart, leading to worsening heart failure. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and orthopnea are the most prominent complaints in patients with chronic severe MR. Palpitations are common and may signify the onset of AF. Right-sided heart failure, with painful hepatic congestion, ankle edema, distended neck veins, ascites, and secondary TR, occurs in patients with MR who have associated pulmonary vascular disease and pulmonary hypertension. Acute pulmonary edema is common in patients with acute severe MR. In patients with chronic severe MR, the arterial pressure is usually normal, although the carotid arterial pulse may show a sharp, low-volume upstroke owing to the reduced forward CO. A systolic thrill is often palpable at the cardiac apex, the LV is hyperdynamic with a brisk systolic impulse and a palpable rapid-filling wave (S3), and the apex beat is often displaced laterally."

All patients with a clinical history and physical exam suggestive of MS should have an electrocardio-gram (ECG) and chest X-ray. Abnormalities in the ECG may include atrial fibrillation, left atrial enlargement, or right axis deviation. Chest X-ray findings may include enlargement of the left atrium and pulmonary artery, creating a double contour behind the right atrial shadow and obliterating the normal con-cavity between the aorta and left ventricle. Findings consistent with pulmonary congestion may also be present.2The"

Plasma Na+ concentration was initially 129 meq/L, decreasing within 3 days to 118\u2013120 meq/L despite fluid restriction to 1 L/d. A chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a right 2.8 \u00d7 1.6 cm infrahilar mass and postobstructive pneumonia. The patient was an active smoker. Past medical history was notable for laryngeal carcinoma treated 15 years prior with radiation therapy, renal cell carcinoma, peripheral vascular disease, and hypothyroidism. On review of systems, he denied headache, nausea, and vomiting. He had chronic hip pain, managed with acetaminophen with codeine. Other medications included cilostazol, amoxicillin/clavulanate, digoxin, diltiazem, and thyroxine. He was euvolemic on examination, with no lymphadenopathy and a normal chest examination.

Standing decreases venous return; the heart becomes smaller; C moves closer to the first heart sound (S1), and the mitral regurgitant murmur has an earlier onset. With prompt squatting, venous return and afterload increase; the heart becomes larger; C moves toward S2; and the duration of the murmur shortens.

            "content": "The neck veins in patients with severe TR are distended with prominent c-v waves and rapid y descents (in the absence of TS). TR is more often diagnosed by examination of the neck veins than by auscultation of the heart sounds. Other findings may include marked hepatomegaly with systolic pulsations, ascites, pleural effusions, edema, and a positive hepatojugular reflex. A prominent RV pulsation along the left parasternal region and a blowing holosystolic murmur along the lower left sternal margin, which may be intensified during inspiration (Carvallo\u2019s sign) and reduced during expiration or the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver, are characteristic findings. The murmur of TR may sometimes be confused with that of MR unless attention is paid to its variation during the respiratory cycle and the extent of RV enlargement is appreciated. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is usually present in the chronic phase of the disease."

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

            "content": "The most common cause of right-sided heart failure is left-sided heart failure. Diuretics are for symptomatic relief only and confer no mortality benef t. Heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction is defined as a \u2193 EF (< 50%) and left ventricular end-diastolic volumes. It is caused by inadequate left ventricular contractility or \u2191 afterload. The heart compensates for low EF and preload through hypertrophy and ventricular dilation (Frank-Starling law), but the compensation ultimately fails, leading to \u2191 myocardial work and worsening systolic function. Exertional dyspnea is the earliest and most common presenting symptom and progresses to orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND), and finally rest dyspnea. Chronic cough, fatigue, lower extremity edema, nocturia, Cheyne-Stokes respirations, and/or abdominal fullness may be seen. Look for signs to distinguish leftfrom right-sided heart failure (see Table 2.1-6)."
