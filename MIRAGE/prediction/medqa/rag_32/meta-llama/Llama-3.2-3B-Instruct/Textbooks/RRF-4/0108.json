    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with severe knee, hip, and groin pain, and an inability to bear weight on his left leg. The patient's age and symptoms suggest a diagnosis of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), a common hip disorder in adolescents. SCFE is characterized by a displacement of the femoral head from the femoral neck, which can lead to avascular necrosis and long-term disability if not treated promptly. The patient's obesity and asthma are relevant medical history points, but they are not directly related to the diagnosis. The physical examination findings, such as the inability to bear weight on the affected leg and limited range of motion of the left hip, are consistent with SCFE. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest that surgical intervention is necessary to stabilize the femoral head and prevent further displacement. Casting and crutches (A) and supportive therapy and observation (C) are not appropriate management options for SCFE, as they do not address the underlying pathology. Surgical pinning of the femoral head (D) is a common treatment for SCFE, but it is not the best initial management option. The best initial management option for this patient is immobilization of the hip in a Pavlik harness (B), which can help reduce pain and prevent further displacement of the femoral head while the patient undergoes further evaluation and treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The patient or family will describe an acute onset of pain in the groin/hip, anterior thigh, or knee. Irritation of the obturator nerve can cause referred pain in the thigh and knee when the pathology is at the hip. Patients with transient synovitis are often afebrile, walk with a painful limp, and have normal to minimally elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate compared with bacterial diseases of the hip (Table 199-1). Table 197-3 lists the differential diagnosis of a limping child. Anteroposterior and frog-leg radiographs of the hip are usually normal. Ultrasonography may reveal a joint effusion.

Any knee pain mandates an examination of the hip, as hip pathology can cause referred pain to the anterior thigh and knee along the obturator nerve. The patient usually holds the affected extremity in external rotation. As the hip is flexed, it will progressively externally rotate. There is usually a limitation of internal rotation, but there may also be a loss of flexion and abduction.

Interestingly, the height of the patient and the previous lens surgery would suggest a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and a series of blood tests and review of the family history revealed this was so. A 35-year-old male patient presented to his family practitioner because of recent weight loss (14 lb over the previous 2 months). He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets."

            "content": "Knee pain may result from intraarticular (OA, RA) or periarticular (anserine bursitis, collateral ligament strain) processes or be referred from hip pathology. A careful history should delineate the chronology of the knee complaint and whether there are predisposing conditions, trauma, or medications that might underlie the complaint. For example, patellofemoral disease (e.g., OA) may cause anterior knee pain that worsens with climbing stairs. Observation of the patient\u2019s gait is also important. The knee should be carefully inspected in the upright (weight-bearing) and supine positions for swelling, erythema, malalignment, visible trauma, muscle wasting, and leg length discrepancy. The most common malalignment in the knee is genu varum (bowlegs) or genu valgum (knock-knees) resulting from asymmetric cartilage loss medially or laterally. Bony swelling of the knee joint commonly results from hypertrophic osseous changes seen with disorders such as OA and neuropathic arthropathy."

Previously, this was referred to as chondromalaciaof the patella, but this term is incorrect as the joint surfacesof the patella are normal. It is now known as patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). The patient will present withanterior knee pain that worsens with activity, going up anddown stairs, and soreness after sitting in one position for an extended time. There is usually no associated swelling.The patient may complain of a grinding sensation underthe kneecap. Palpating and compressing the patellofemoral joint with the knee extended elicits pain. Patients oftenhave weak hip musculature or poor flexibility in the lower extremities. Radiographs are rarely helpful but may be indicated to rule out other diagnoses such as osteochondritisdissecans."

On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."
