    "question": "A 19-year-old woman is brought into the emergency department after collapsing during a cheerleading practice session. Her vitals taken by the emergency medical services (EMS) include blood pressure 88/55 mm Hg, pulse 55/min. She was given a liter of isotonic fluid while en route to the hospital. At the emergency department, she is alert and oriented and is noted to be anorexic. The patient fervently denies being underweight claiming that she is \u2018a fatty\u2019 and goes on to refuse any further intravenous fluid and later, even the hospital meals. Which of the following is the best option for long-term management of this patient\u2019s condition?",

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 19-year-old woman who collapsed during a cheerleading practice session and is now presenting with hypotension (low blood pressure) and anorexia (lack of appetite). The key details to consider are her age, the context of the collapse, and her refusal of further intravenous fluid and hospital meals. This scenario is highly suggestive of an eating disorder, likely anorexia nervosa, given her age, the acute presentation, and her refusal of nutrition. The patient's self-perception of being 'fatty' is a common characteristic of individuals with anorexia nervosa, and her refusal of nutrition and fluid is a hallmark of the disorder. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a recommended treatment for anorexia nervosa, as it can help the patient address the underlying psychological issues and develop healthier eating habits. In-patient psychiatric therapy may not be necessary in this case, as the patient is alert and oriented. Antidepressants are not the primary treatment for anorexia nervosa, and appetite stimulants are not appropriate as they can worsen the condition. Therefore, the best option for long-term management of this patient's condition is cognitive-behavioral therapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

It is similarly advisable to give B vitamins to alcoholic patients who are seen for other reasons in the emergency department so as to raise body stores of thiamine and other vitamins. The patient with chronic alcoholism (or the nonalcoholic patient with persistent vomiting) exhausts thiamine in a matter of 7 or 8 weeks, during which time the administration of glucose may serve to precipitate Wernicke disease or cause an early form of the disease to progress rapidly.

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

The history should include a review of symptoms, general medical history, review of past surgery, and current medications. The woman\u2019s most troubling symptoms must be ascertained\u2014how often she leaks urine, how much urine she leaks, what provokes urine loss, what improves or worsens the problem, and what treatment (if any) she had in the past. It is essential to keep the patient\u2019s chief symptom at the forefront to avoid inappropriate management. Consider, for example, a woman whose chief concern is that once a month, while leading a business seminar, she has a sudden, overwhelming urge to void followed by complete bladder emptying. She finds this leakage devastating and is considering quitting her job because of her acute embarrassment. On occasion, she leaks a few drops of urine during exercise, but this minor leakage does not bother her. During the evaluation, urodynamics reveal minimal stress"

            "content": "The dichotomy of Inpatient and outpatient Internal Medicine The hospital environment has changed dramatically over the last few decades. Emergency departments and critical care units have evolved to identify and manage critically ill patients, allowing them to survive formerly fatal diseases. At the same time, there is increasing pressure to reduce the length of stay in the hospital and to manage complex disorders in the outpatient setting. This transition has been driven not only by efforts to reduce costs but also by the availability of new outpatient technologies, such as imaging and percutaneous infusion catheters for long-term antibiotics or nutrition, minimally invasive surgical procedures, and evidence that outcomes often are improved by minimizing inpatient hospitalization."

These anastomose with the superior, superficial, and deep epigastric venous systems to drain into the internal thoracic veins, which in turn drain into the brachiocephalic veins and the superior vena cava. After the initial inferior vena cava thrombosis, the veins of the anterior abdominal wall and other collateral pathways hypertrophy to accommodate the increase in blood flow. A 52-year-old woman visited her family physician with complaints of increasing lethargy and vomiting. The physician examined her and noted that compared to previous visits she had lost significant weight. She was also jaundiced, and on examination of the abdomen a well-defined 10-cm rounded mass was palpable below the liver edge in the right upper quadrant (Fig. 4.185)."

AVP has a half-life of only 10\u201320 min; therefore, the acute increase in intravascular volume after a liter of intravenous saline led to a rapid reduction in circulating AVP. The ensuing water diuresis is the primary explanation for the rapid increase in plasma Na+ concentration in the first 7 h of her hospitalization."

Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"
