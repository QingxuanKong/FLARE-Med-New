    "question": "A 63-year-old man is aiming to improve his health by eating a well balanced diet, walking daily, and quitting smoking following a 45-year smoking history. While on his daily walks he notices a strong cramping pain in his calves that consistently appears after a mile of walking. He sees his physician and a diagnosis of peripheral artery disease with intermittent claudication is made. To improve his symptoms, cilostazol is prescribed. What is the mechanism of action of this medication?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Irreversible cyclooxygenase inhibitor",
        "B": "Thromboxane synthase inhibitor",
        "C": "Adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitor",
        "D": "Phosphodiesterase inhibitor"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's first analyze the given information and the options provided. The patient has peripheral artery disease (PAD) with intermittent claudication, and cilostazol is prescribed to improve his symptoms. We need to determine the mechanism of action of cilostazol to understand why it is effective in treating PAD. Cilostazol is a medication commonly used to treat intermittent claudication, a symptom of PAD. Intermittent claudication is characterized by muscle pain in the legs that occurs during exercise and is relieved by rest. Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, specifically a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, which is a subtype of phosphodiesterase. It works by inhibiting the breakdown of adenosine diphosphate (ADP), leading to increased levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in the blood vessels. This increase in cAMP causes vasodilation, which improves blood flow to the muscles and reduces pain associated with PAD. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Irreversible cyclooxygenase inhibitor: This is not the mechanism of action of cilostazol. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors, such as ibuprofen, are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit the production of prostaglandins, which are involved in inflammation and pain. B. Thromboxane synthase inhibitor: This is not the mechanism of action of cilostazol. Thromboxane synthase inhibitors are a class of drugs that inhibit the production of thromboxane A2, a prothrombotic agent. C. Adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitor: While cilostazol does increase levels of adenosine diphosphate (ADP), its mechanism of action is not as an ADP receptor inhibitor. Instead, it inhibits the phosphodiesterase enzyme that breaks down ADP. D. Phosphodiesterase inhibitor: This is the correct answer. Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, specifically a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, which leads to increased levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and vasodilation, improving blood flow to the muscles and reducing pain associated with PAD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

Compliance with the health-promoting behaviors listed above is generally very poor, and a conscientious physician must not underestimate the major effort required to meet this challenge. Many patients who are discharged from the hospital with proven coronary disease do not receive adequate treatment for dyslipidemia. In light of the proof that treating dyslipidemia brings major benefits, physicians need to establish treatment pathways, monitor compliance, and follow up regularly."

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia.

            "content": "Patients with claudication should be encouraged to exercise regularly and at progressively more strenuous levels. Supervised exercise training programs for 30to 45-min sessions, three to five times per week for at least 12 weeks, prolong walking distance. Patients also should be advised to walk until nearly maximum claudication discomfort occurs and then rest until the symptoms resolve before resuming ambulation. The beneficial effect of supervised exercise training on walking performance in patients with claudication often is similar to or greater than that realized after a revascularization procedure. Pharmacologic treatment of PAD has not been as successful as the medical treatment of CAD (Chap. 293). In particular, vasodilators as a class have not proved to be beneficial. During exercise, peripheral vasodilation occurs distal to sites of significant arterial stenoses. As a result, perfusion pressure falls, often to levels lower than that generated in the interstitial tissue by the"

In addition, by increasing myocardial oxygen needs and reducing oxygen supply, it aggravates angina. Smoking cessation studies have demonstrated important benefits with a significant decline in the occurrence of these adverse outcomes. The physician\u2019s message must be clear and strong and supported by programs that achieve and monitor abstinence (Chap. 470). Hypertension (Chap. 298) is associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical events from coronary atherosclerosis as well as stroke. In addition, the left ventricular hypertrophy that results from sustained hypertension aggravates ischemia. There is evidence that long-term effective treatment of hypertension can decrease the occurrence of adverse coronary events."

His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented.

Thiazide diuretics in low doses are inexpensive, have relatively few side effects, and are effective in many patients with mild hypertension. Other first-line agents include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers. Beta blockers might be considered if the patient had coronary disease or had labile hypertension. A single agent should be prescribed and the patient reassessed in a month. If a second agent is needed, one of the two agents should be a thiazide diuretic. Once blood pressure is controlled, patients should be followed periodically to reinforce the need for compliance with both lifestyle changes and medications."
