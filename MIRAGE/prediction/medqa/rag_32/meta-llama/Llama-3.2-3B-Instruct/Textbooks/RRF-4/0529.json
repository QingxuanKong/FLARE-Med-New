She presents with sudden, painless loss of vision in her right eye that occurred 30 minutes ago while watching TV. The key findings include:\\n\\n- 20/50 vision in the left eye and no perception of light in the right eye\\n- Direct pupillary reflex is present in the left eye, but absent in the right eye\\n- Accommodation is intact bilaterally\\n- Intraocular pressure is 16 mm Hg in the left eye and 18 mm Hg in the right eye\\n- Fundoscopic examination of the right eye shows a pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula\\n- The optic disc appears normal\\n\\nGiven these findings, let's evaluate the options:\\n\\nA. Retinal detachment: This condition is characterized by a separation of the retina from the underlying tissue. However, the fundoscopic examination shows a pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula, which is not consistent with retinal detachment.\\n\\nB. Central retinal artery occlusion: This condition is characterized by a sudden, painless loss of vision in one eye, often accompanied by a pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula (Cherry-red spot). This matches the patient's symptoms and examination findings.\\n\\nC. Acute angle-closure glaucoma: This condition is characterized by a sudden increase in intraocular pressure, often accompanied by severe eye pain, blurred vision, and a red, painful eye. The patient's intraocular pressure is normal, and there is no mention of eye pain, making this option less likely.\\n\\nD. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy: This condition is characterized by a sudden, painless loss of vision in one eye, often accompanied by a pale, white optic disc. However, the patient's optic disc appears normal, and the key finding is the bright red area within the macula, making this option less likely.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the most likely diagnosis is central retinal artery occlusion (B).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Marked systemic hypertension causes sclerosis of retinal arterioles, splinter hemorrhages, focal infarcts of the nerve fiber layer (cottonwool spots), and leakage of lipid and fluid (hard exudate) into the macula (Fig. 39-7). In hypertensive crisis, sudden visual loss can result from vasospasm of retinal arterioles and retinal ischemia. In addition, acute hypertension may produce visual loss from ischemic swelling of the optic disc. Patients with acute hypertensive retinopathy should be treated by lowering the blood pressure. However, the blood pressure should not be reduced precipitously, because there is a danger of optic disc infarction from sudden hypoperfusion."

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

A hard, red eye is seen (from acute closure of a narrow anterior chamber angle); the pupil is dilated and nonreactive to light. IOP is \u2191. If it resolves spontaneously prior to presentation (e.g., with pupillary constriction in sunlight), ophthalmologic examination may reveal narrow angles in one or both eyes."

These screening procedures are indicated for all individuals with DM, but many individuals with diabetes do not receive comprehensive diabetes care. A comprehensive eye examination should be performed by a qualified optometrist or ophthalmologist. Because many individuals with type 2 DM have had asymptomatic diabetes for several years before diagnosis, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends the following ophthalmologic examination schedule: (1) individuals with type 1 DM should have an initial eye examination within 5 years of diagnosis, (2) individuals with type 2 DM should have an initial eye examination at the time of diabetes diagnosis, (3) women with DM who are pregnant or contemplating pregnancy should have an eye examination prior to conception and during the first trimester, and (4) if eye exam is normal,"

Patients complaining of bright flashes and spots in vision should be examined with the indirect ophthalmoscope to rule out tears, holes, or detachments of the vitreous or retina. Another common occurrence with advancing age is shrinkage of the vitreous humor and retraction from the retina, causing persistent streaks of light, usually in the periphery of the visual field. These phosphenes, also known as Moore lightning streaks, had been thought to be quite benign, but they may at times indicate incipient retinal or vitreous tears or detachment, and their first appearance requires prompt evaluation by an ophthalmologist. They are most prominent on movement of the globe, on closure of the eyelids, at the moment of accommodation, with saccadic eye movements, and with sudden exposure to dark. The vitreous may also be infiltrated by lymphoma also occurring in the brain; biopsy"

The retina is the only tissue in which arteries and arterioles can be examined directly. With increasing severity of hypertension and atherosclerotic disease, progressive funduscopic changes include increased arteriolar light reflex, arteriovenous crossing defects, hemorrhages and exudates, and, in patients with malignant hypertension, papilledema. Examination of the heart may reveal a loud second heart sound due to closure of the aortic valve and an S4 gallop attributed to atrial contraction against a noncompliant left ventricle. Left ventricular hypertrophy may be detected by an enlarged, sustained, and laterally displaced apical impulse. An abdominal bruit, particularly a bruit that lateralizes and extends throughout systole into diastole, raises the possibility of renovascular hypertension. Kidneys of patients with polycystic kidney disease may be palpable in the abdomen. The physical"
