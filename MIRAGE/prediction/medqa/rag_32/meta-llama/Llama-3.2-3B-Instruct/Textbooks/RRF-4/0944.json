    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is presenting with nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle cramps after admission to the hospital for treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia. Laboratory studies show hyperkalemia (K+ 5.9 mEq/L), hypokalemia is not present but the patient has hypocalcemia (Ca2+ 6.8 mg/dL), and elevated serum uric acid (11.2 mg/dL). The patient has a history of diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and has been smoking one-half pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years. The patient is also taking medications for leukemia treatment, which may have contributed to the development of hyperuricemia. The patient is also experiencing symptoms consistent with tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which is a potentially life-threatening complication of cancer treatment. TLS is characterized by hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hypocalcemia, and renal failure. The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle cramps are consistent with TLS. The most effective treatment to prevent TLS is to rapidly reduce uric acid levels. Rasburicase is an enzyme that breaks down uric acid and is specifically used to treat TLS. Urine alkalinization may help to reduce uric acid excretion, but it is not as effective as rasburicase. Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that can help to reduce uric acid production, but it is not as effective as rasburicase in treating TLS. Intravenous hydration may help to reduce uric acid levels, but it is not as effective as rasburicase in preventing TLS. Therefore, the most effective treatment to prevent this patient's current symptoms is rasburicase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Alternatively, attenuated recovery was due to persistent effects of the single dose of DDAVP. Of note, although the plasma half-life of DDAVP is only 1\u20132 h, pharmacodynamic studies indicate a much more prolonged effect on urine output and/or urine osmolality. One final consideration is the effect of the patient\u2019s initial renal dysfunction on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the administered DDAVP, which is renally excreted; DDAVP should be administered with caution for the reinduction of hyponatremia in patients with chronic kidney disease or acute renal dysfunction.

CSF has a lower concentration of K+ , glucose, and protein but a greater concentration of Na+ and Cl\u2212 than blood does. Furthermore, CSF contains practically no blood cells. The increased concentration of Na+ and Cl\u2212 enables CSF to be isotonic to blood. The pressure in the CSF column is about 120 to 180 mm H2O when a person is recumbent.

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases.

Measurement of the prothrombin time (PT) is important in patients with acute viral hepatitis, because a prolonged value may reflect a severe hepatic synthetic defect, signify extensive hepatocellular necrosis, and indicate a worse prognosis. Occasionally, a prolonged PT may occur with only mild increases in the serum bilirubin and aminotransferase levels. Prolonged nausea and vomiting, inadequate carbohydrate intake, and poor hepatic glycogen reserves may contribute to hypoglycemia noted occasionally in patients with severe viral hepatitis. Serum alkaline phosphatase may be normal or only mildly elevated, whereas a fall in serum albumin is uncommon in uncomplicated acute viral hepatitis. In some patients, mild and transient steatorrhea has been noted, as well as slight microscopic hematuria and minimal proteinuria."

The patient should eat nothing after midnight prior to the test day. On the morning of the test, adults are then given 75 g of glucose in 300 mL of water; children are given 1.75 g of glucose per kilogram of ideal body weight. The glucose load is consumed within 5 minutes. Blood samples for plasma glucose are obtained at 0 and 120 minutes after ingestion of glucose. An oral glucose tolerance test is normal if the fasting venous plasma glucose value is less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and the 2-hour value falls below 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L). A fasting value of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher or a 2-hour value of greater than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. Patients with 2-hour value of 140\u2013199 mg/dL (7.8\u201311.1 mmol/L) have impaired glucose tolerance."
