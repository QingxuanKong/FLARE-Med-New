The disorder is characterized by a mutation in the gene that affects copper metabolism, leading to symptoms such as brittle hair, growth retardation, and an increased risk of cerebral aneurysms. The options provided are ATP7A, COL5A1, FBN1, and ATP7B. We need to determine which one is associated with impaired copper absorption and transport. Document [0] states that the vascular type of hypermobility type joint instability is caused by a mutation in type III procollagen (COL3A1), but this is not directly related to copper metabolism. Document [1] mentions that Menkes kinky hair syndrome is an X-linked metabolic disturbance of copper metabolism caused by mutations in the copper-transporting ATP7A gene. Document [9] explains that Wilson disease is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which leads to impaired copper absorption and transport. Document [16] describes Fabry disease, a deficiency of \\u03b1-galactosidase, which is not related to copper metabolism. Document [26] mentions that Fragile X syndrome is caused by expansion of a repeated trinucleotide DNA segment, which is not related to copper metabolism. Document [27] states that Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, which is not related to copper metabolism. Document [28] explains that achondroplasia is caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene, which is not related to copper metabolism. Based on the information provided, the disorder is caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, which is responsible for impaired copper absorption and transport. Therefore, the correct answer is D.

Copper-deficiency anemia (refractory to therapeutic iron) has been reported in patients with malabsorptive diseases and nephrotic syndrome and in patients treated for Wilson\u2019s disease with chronic high doses of oral zinc, which can interfere with copper absorption. Menkes kinky hair syndrome is an X-linked metabolic disturbance of copper metabolism characterized by mental retardation, hypocupremia, and decreased circulating ceruloplasmin (Chap. 427). This syndrome is caused by mutations in the copper-transporting ATP7A gene. Children with this disease often die within 5 years because of dissecting aneurysms or cardiac rupture. Aceruloplasminemia is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by tissue iron overload, mental deterioration, microcytic anemia, and low serum iron and copper concentrations."

The primary defect is abnormal chondrocyte proliferation at the growth plate that causes development of short, but proportionately thick, long bones. Other regions of the long bones may be relatively unaffected. The disorder is manifest by the presence of short limbs (particularly the proximal portions), normal trunk, large head, saddle nose, and an exaggerated lumbar lordosis. Severe spinal deformity may lead to cord compression. The homozygous disorder is more serious than the sporadic form and may cause neonatal death. Pseudoachondroplasia clinically resembles"

Siblings of a diagnosed patient have a 1 in 4 risk of Wilson\u2019s disease, whereas children of an affected patient have about a 1 in 200 risk. Because a large number of inactivating mutations have been reported in the ATP7B gene, mutation screening for diagnosis is not routine, although this approach may be practical in the future. DNA haplotype analysis can be used to genotype siblings of an affected patient. A rare multisystem disorder of copper metabolism with features of both Menkes and Wilson\u2019s diseases has been reported. It is termed the MEDNIK syndrome (mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, neuropathy, ichthyosis, keratodermia) and is caused by mutations in the AP1S1 gene, which encodes an adaptor protein necessary for intracellular trafficking of copper pump proteins ATP7A (Menkes disease) and ATP7B (Wilson\u2019s disease)."

            "content": "If a disease phenotype can be caused by many mutations, a clinical laboratory result that is negative should be interpreted with care. For example, it is common to screen healthy pregnant women (and their partners) for mutations in the CFTR gene, which is mutated in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The goal of this screening is to identify women who are carriers of a CFTR mutation and therefore are at increased risk of having a baby with CF. Because CF is an autosomal recessive disorder, a fetus has a 1:4 chance of being affected if both parents are carriers of disease-causing CFTR mutations. The screening test approach that is commonly used to identify mutations in carriers detects 80\u201385% of all known disease-causing CFTR mutations in Caucasians and up to 97% of mutations among Ashkenazi Jews. A negative screening result therefore does not completely eliminate the possibility that a woman (or her partner) actually has a mutation. What can be inferred from a negative test result is"

He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

If a single copy of a gene bearing a mutation is sufficient to cause disease and that gene is not on one of the sex chromosomes, that condition is inherited in an AD fashion (Table 47-1). In AD disorders, an affected parent has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each child (Fig. 47-2; Table 47-2). Possessing one working gene and one nonworking gene is termed heterozygous. If both copies are the same, they are referred to as homozygous."
