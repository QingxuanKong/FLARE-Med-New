    "question": "A 36-year-old man presents to his physician for a regular checkup, and he expresses an intent to quit smoking. He is a financial director with a 15-pack-year history of smoking who tried quitting several times. He tried different nicotine replacement products, none of which helped him. The patient has gastrointestinal reflux disease and takes omeprazole. The medical history is significant for a head trauma after which he had two seizure episodes. He does not have a history of any other disorders. Currently, he is not on any antiepileptic medication. He heard from his friend about an antidepressant that efficiently helps with smoking cessation. He would like to try this medication, and asks his physician for an advice. Which of the following statements regarding the use of the mentioned medication is correct?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Omeprazole interferes with bupropion metabolism and should be taken one hour prior to omeprazole consumption.",
        "B": "Bupropion is only effective when used together with nicotine replacement products.",
        "C": "Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and it should not be taken by patients with a history of seizure disorder.",
        "D": "The physician may prescribe bupropion for this patient only after a full cardiac workup is performed."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the provided documents and identify the correct statement regarding the use of bupropion for smoking cessation in a patient with a history of seizure disorder and gastrointestinal reflux disease. Bupropion is a medication that is often used to help with smoking cessation, and it is known to be effective when used alone. However, it is also known to increase the seizure threshold, which may be a concern for patients with a history of seizure disorder. On the other hand, there is no evidence to suggest that omeprazole interferes with bupropion metabolism or that bupropion is only effective when used with nicotine replacement products. Therefore, the correct answer is related to the potential side effect of bupropion on seizure threshold in patients with a history of seizure disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

            "content": "The process of stopping smoking is commonly a cyclical one, with the smoker sometimes making multiple attempts to quit and failing before finally being successful. Approximately 70\u201380% of smokers would like to quit smoking. More than one-half of current smokers attempted to quit in the last year, but only 6% quit for 6 months, and only 3% remain abstinent for 2 years. Clinician-based smoking interventions should repeatedly encourage smokers to try to quit and to use different forms of cessation assistance with each new cessation attempt rather than focusing exclusively on immediate cessation at the time of the first visit. Advice from a physician to quit smoking, particularly at the time of an acute illness, is a powerful trigger for cessation attempts, with up to half of patients who are advised to quit making a cessation effort. Other triggers include the cost of cigarettes, media campaigns, and changes in rules to restrict smoking in the workplace."

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

There is a relationship between the amount of assistance a patient is willing to accept and the success of the cessation attempt.

Current recommendations are to offer pharmacologic treatment, usually with NRT or varenicline, to all who will accept it and to provide counseling and other support as a part of the cessation attempt. There are some data to suggest that longer term use of NRT may enable cessation in some smokers who are unable to quit with shorter duration use and that some individuals are able to achieve abstinence from tobacco through use of NRT chronically. Cessation advice alone by a physician or his or her staff is likely to increase success compared with no intervention; a more comprehensive approach with advice, pharmacologic assistance, and counseling can increase cessation success nearly threefold. Incorporation of cessation assistance into a practice requires a change of the care delivery infrastructure. Simple changes include (1) adding questions about smoking and interest in cessation on patient-intake questionnaires, (2) asking patients whether they"

The mass in the patient\u2019s pelvis compressed this nerve, producing his sensory and motor dysfunction. During surgery, the mass was found to be a benign nerve tumor and was excised. This patient had no long-standing neurological deficit. A 65-year-old man was examined by a surgical intern because he had a history of buttock pain and impotence. On examination he had a reduced peripheral pulse on the left foot compared to the right. On direct questioning, the patient revealed that he experienced severe left-sided buttock pain after walking 100 yards. After a short period of rest, he could walk another 100 yards before the same symptoms recurred. He also noticed that over the past year he was unable to obtain an erection. He smoked heavily and was on no other drugs or treatment."

The patient\u2019s temperature was normal. He explained that the episode had occurred following a birthday party at which he had participated in an ice cream\u2013eating contest. The patient reported prior episodes of a similar nature following ingestion of a significant amount of dairy products. This clinical picture is most probably due to a deficiency in the activity of: A. isomaltase. B. lactase. C. pancreatic \u03b1-amylase. D. salivary \u03b1-amylase. E. sucrase. Correct answer = B. The physical symptoms suggest a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for carbohydrate degradation. The symptoms observed following the ingestion of dairy products suggest that the patient is deficient in lactase as a result of the age-dependent reduction in expression of the enzyme."

The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy. One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC). He undergoes surgical resection and is found to have high-risk stage III CRC with five positive lymph nodes. After surgery, he feels entirely well with no symptoms.

He has hypertension, and during the last 8 years, he has been adequately managed with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH\u2019s problem?

Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."
