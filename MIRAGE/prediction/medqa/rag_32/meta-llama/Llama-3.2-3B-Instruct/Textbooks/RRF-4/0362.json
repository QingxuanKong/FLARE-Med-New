He has also had pain in the right ankle for 3 days and pain and swelling in the left knee for 1 day. Two weeks ago, he had several days of fever and bloody diarrhea, for which he was treated with antibiotics. Examination shows a small left knee effusion and bilateral conjunctival injection. Which of the following is the most likely additional finding in this patient?",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To solve this question, we'll analyze the symptoms and examination findings presented in the scenario. 1. **Symptoms and History:** - The patient presents with burning urination, pain in the right ankle, and pain and swelling in the left knee. - He had a recent episode of fever and bloody diarrhea, which was treated with antibiotics two weeks ago. - The patient is a previously healthy individual, suggesting an acute condition rather than a chronic one. 2. **Examination Findings:** - Small left knee effusion. - Bilateral conjunctival injection. 3. **Differential Diagnosis:** - Given the recent history of fever and bloody diarrhea, and the current symptoms, a post-infectious complication should be considered. - The presence of conjunctival injection suggests a systemic condition or an autoimmune response. 4. **Analyzing the Options:** - **A. Circular erythematous rash with central clearing:** This description is classic for erythema migrans, the hallmark of Lyme disease, which is caused by *Borrelia burgdorferi*. Lyme disease can cause arthritis, conjunctivitis, and can be associated with a rash. The patient's symptoms and the recent history of fever and bloody diarrhea (which can be associated with Lyme disease) make this a strong candidate. - **B. Pain on passive extension of the fingers:** This is more suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis, which is not supported by the patient's history of recent fever and bloody diarrhea. - **C. Palpable mass in the right lower quadrant:** This could be suggestive of an appendicitis or a mass, but the patient's recent episode of fever and bloody diarrhea makes this less likely. - **D. Tenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon:** This is more suggestive of tendonitis, which is not directly supported by the patient's symptoms. **Conclusion:** Given the combination of recent fever and bloody diarrhea, followed by symptoms of joint pain and swelling, and the presence of conjunctival injection, the most likely diagnosis is Lyme disease, caused by *Borrelia burgdorferi*. The characteristic rash of Lyme disease, erythema migrans, is also supported by the description of a circular erythematous rash with central clearing. ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's recent history of fever and bloody diarrhea, followed by symptoms of joint pain and swelling, and the presence of conjunctival injection, makes Lyme disease a strong candidate.

Diabetes can lead to vascular disease of large and medium arteries, narrowing the lumen and reducing blood supply to the extremities, thereby impairing healing. In addition, diabetes can also affect blood supply to nerves, which leads to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy results in reduced sensation, and therefore minor injuries can often go unnoticed. This patient has developed an ulcer on his heel, which is a pressure point and likely to be under repeated strain. The nurse examined the ulcer and found that the ulcer was looking infected with pus at the base of the ulcer and asked for a specialist orthopedic opinion, who requested an x-ray and an MRI.

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

Case 4: Hypoglycemia, Hyperketonemia, and Liver Dysfunction Patient Presentation: AK, a 59-year-old male with slurred speech, ataxia (loss of skeletal muscle coordination), and abdominal pain, was dropped off at the Emergency Department (ED). Focused History: AK is known to the ED staff from previous visits. He has a 6year history of chronic, excessive alcohol consumption. He is not known to take illicit drugs. At this ED visit, AK reports that he has been drinking heavily in the past day or so. He cannot recall having eaten anything in that time. There is evidence of recent vomiting, but no blood is apparent."

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

He underwent an abdominoperineal resection of the tumor and was left with a left lower abdominal colostomy (see below). Unfortunately, the man\u2019s wife left him for a number of reasons, including lack of sexual desire. He \u201cturned to drink\u201d and over the ensuing years developed cirrhosis. He was brought into the emergency room with severe bleeding from enlarged veins around his colostomy. An emergency transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt was created, which stopped all bleeding (eFigs. 4.189 and 4.190). He is now doing well in a rehabilitation program. A colostomy was necessary because of the low site of the tumor."

The second phase (approximately 5\u20137 days after disease onset and thereafter) involves the gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain with vomiting and/ or diarrhea), respiratory tract (chest pain, cough), vascular system (postural hypotension, edema), and central nervous system (confusion, coma, headache). Hemorrhagic manifestations such as subconjunctival injection, nosebleeds, hematemesis, hematuria, and melena are typical (Table 234-2).

On follow-up the patient had no complications. A 25-year-old man complained of significant swelling in front of his right ear before and around mealtimes. This swelling was associated with considerable pain, which was provoked by the ingestion of lemon sweets. On examination he had tenderness around the right parotid region and a hard nodule was demonstrated in the buccal mucosa adjacent to the right upper molar teeth. A diagnosis of parotid duct calculus was made."
