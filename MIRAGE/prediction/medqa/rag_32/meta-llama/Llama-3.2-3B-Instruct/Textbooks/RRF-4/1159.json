    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with fever, abdominal pain, and rapidly progressive distension of the abdomen 3 days after an appendectomy for an abscess. The complete blood count showed leukocytosis, and the anaerobic culture of the peritoneal fluid needle aspirate showed a gram-negative pathogen. Given the recent history of appendectomy and the presence of a gram-negative pathogen, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a secondary peritonitis, which is an infection of the peritoneum that occurs in the setting of a perforation or leakage from the gastrointestinal tract. The fact that the patient had an appendectomy for an abscess suggests that the appendix was perforated, which is a common cause of secondary peritonitis. The gram-negative pathogen is consistent with the microbiology of secondary peritonitis, which is often caused by enteric bacteria such as E. coli or Klebsiella. The presence of polymicrobial infection is also consistent with secondary peritonitis, which can involve multiple pathogens. The other options are not as likely given the clinical presentation and microbiology results. Bacteroides fragilis is an anaerobic bacterium that is commonly found in the gut and can cause intraabdominal infections, but it is not gram-negative. Campylobacter jejuni is a gram-negative bacterium that can cause gastrointestinal infections, but it is not as commonly associated with secondary peritonitis as E. coli or Klebsiella. Clostridium perfringens is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause gas gangrene and other infections, but it is not gram-negative. Shigella sonnei is a gram-negative bacterium that can cause gastrointestinal infections, but it is not as commonly associated with secondary peritonitis as E. coli or Klebsiella. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition, in addition to polymicrobial infection, is a gram-negative pathogen such as E. coli or Klebsiella.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

It was noted at operation that the appendix had perforated and there was pus within the abdominal cavity. The appendix was removed and the stump tied. The abdomen was washed out with warm saline solution. The patient initially made an uneventful recovery, but by day 7 she had become unwell, with pain over her right shoulder and spiking temperatures. This patient had developed an intraabdominal abscess. Any operation on the bowel may involve peritoneal contamination with fecal contents and fecal flora. This may not be appreciated at the time of the operation. Over the postoperative period an inflammatory reaction ensued and an abscess cavity developed, filling with pus. Typically, the observation chart revealed a \u201cswinging\u201d pyrexia (fever). The most common sites for abscess to develop are the pelvis and the hepatorenal recess."

Contrast-enhanced CT is useful in identifying an intraabdominal source for infection. It may be difficult to recover organisms from cultures of peritoneal fluid, presumably because the burden of organisms is low. However, the yield can be improved if 10 mL of peritoneal fluid is placed directly into a blood culture bottle. Because bacteremia frequently accompanies PBP, blood should be cultured simultaneously. To maximize the yield, culture samples should be collected prior to administration of antibiotics. No specific radiographic studies are helpful in the diagnosis of PBP. A plain film of the abdomen would be expected to show ascites. Chest and abdominal radiography should be performed in patients with abdominal pain to exclude free air, which signals a perforation (Fig. 159-2)."

Pain may be referred to the groin or leg, particularly with extension of infection. The diagnosis of perinephric abscess, like that of splenic abscess, is frequently delayed, and the mortality rate in some series is appreciable, although lower than in the past. Perinephric or renal abscess should be most seriously considered when a patient presents with symptoms and signs of pyelonephritis and remains febrile after 4 or 5 days of treatment. Moreover, when a urine culture yields a polymicrobial flora, when a patient is known to have renal stones, or when fever and pyuria coexist with a sterile urine culture, these diagnoses should be entertained."

Nonlocalizing symptoms (such as malaise, fatigue, or encephalopathy) without another clear etiology should also prompt consideration of PBP in a susceptible patient. It is vital to sample the peritoneal fluid of any cirrhotic patient with ascites and fever.

An elevated white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive proteinsuggest infection. In children older than 5 years, appendicitis isthe leading cause. Total serum protein, albumin, and urinalysisshould be ordered to rule out nephrotic syndrome. Liver function tests should be performed to rule out chronic liver diseasecausing ascites. The best way to diagnose suspected peritonitisis to sample the peritoneal fluid with a needle or catheter (paracentesis). Peritoneal fluid in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis has a high neutrophil count of greater than 250 cells/mm3. Other tests that should be run on the peritoneal fluid includeamylase (to rule out pancreatic ascites), culture, albumin, andlactate dehydrogenase concentration. For culture, a large sampleof fluid should be placed into aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles immediately on obtaining the sample."

Ultrasound examination of the liver reveals pyogenic abscesses as round or oval hypoechoic lesions with well-defined borders and a variable number of internal echoes. CT scan is highly sensitive in the localization of pyogenic liver abscesses, which appear hypodense with periph-eral enhancement and may contain air-fluid levels indicating a gas-producing infectious organism (Fig. 31-16). MRI of the abdomen can also detect pyogenic abscesses with a high level of sensitivity but plays a limited role because of its inability to be used for image-guided diagnosis and therapy.The current cornerstones of treatment include correction of the underlying cause and IV antibiotic therapy. Empiric antibiotic therapy should cover gram-negative and anaerobic organisms; percutaneous needle aspiration and culture of the aspirate may be useful in guiding subsequent antibiotic therapy. IV antibiotic therapy should be continued for at least 8 weeks and can be expected to be"

Percutaneous aspiration of necrosis with Gram stain and culture should be performed if there are ongoing signs of possible pancreatic infection such as sustained leukocytosis, fever, or organ failure. There is currently no role for prophylactic antibiotics in necrotizing pancreatitis. It is reasonable to start broad-spectrum antibiotics in a patient who appears septic while awaiting the results of Gram stain and cultures. If cultures are negative, the antibiotics should be discontinued to minimize the risk of developing opportunistic or fungal superinfection. Repeated fine-needle aspiration and Gram stain with culture of pancreatic necrosis may be done every 5\u20137 days in the presence of persistent fever. Repeated CT or MRI imaging should also be considered with any change in clinical course to monitor for complications (e.g., thromboses, hemorrhage, abdominal compartment syndrome)."

B. fragilis is not found in large numbers in the normal vaginal flora. For example, it is encountered less commonly in pelvic inflammatory disease and endometritis without an associated abscess. In pancreatitis with leakage of damaging pancreatic enzymes, inflammation is prominent. Therefore, clinical findings such as fever, leukocytosis, and even abdominal pain do not distinguish pancreatitis itself from complications such as pancreatic pseudocyst, pancreatic abscess (Chap. 371), or intraabdominal collections of pus. Especially in cases of necrotizing pancreatitis, in which the incidence of local pancreatic infection may be as high as 30%, needle aspiration under CT guidance is performed to sample fluid for culture.

In patients without this risk factor, the most common etiologic organisms are E coli, K pneumoniae, and S pneumoniae. Treatment consists of administration of an anti-biotic to which the organism is sensitive; often 14 to 21 days of therapy are required. Removal"

Either laparoscopic or open appendectomy is a satisfactory choice for patients with uncomplicated appendicitis. Management of those who present with a mass representing a phlegmon or abscess can be more difficult. Such patients are best served by treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, drainage if there is an abscess >3 cm in diameter, and parenteral fluids and bowel rest if they appear to respond to conservative management. The appendix can then be more safely removed 6\u201312 weeks later when inflammation has diminished."
