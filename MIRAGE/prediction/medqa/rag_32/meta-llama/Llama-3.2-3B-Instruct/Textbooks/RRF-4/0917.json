    "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother because of a sudden loss of consciousness. He has asthma and has been hospitalized multiple times. His mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is somnolent and diaphoretic. Serum studies show a glucose concentration of 22 mg/dL and a potassium concentration of 2.4 mEq/L. A dextrose infusion is administered, after which his glucose concentration normalizes and his symptoms improve. He is admitted to the hospital for further observation. Overnight, he has another episode of decreased consciousness. Serum studies taken during the episode show a glucose concentration of 19 mg/dL, an insulin concentration of 108 mIU/L (N=2.6\u201324.9), and a C-peptide concentration of 0.3 ng/mL (N = 0.8\u20133.1).

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's analyze the given information step by step.\\n\\nThe patient is a 5-year-old boy who had a sudden loss of consciousness, which improved with a dextrose infusion. This suggests that he was experiencing hypoglycemia.\\n\\nDuring the first episode, his serum glucose concentration was 22 mg/dL, and after receiving a dextrose infusion, it normalized. However, during the second episode, his glucose concentration was 19 mg/dL, insulin concentration was 108 mIU/L, and C-peptide concentration was 0.3 ng/mL.\\n\\nGiven these results, we can see that the insulin concentration is elevated, but the C-peptide concentration is within the normal range. This suggests that the insulin is not being produced by the patient's pancreas, but rather is being administered externally.\\n\\nThis pattern of elevated insulin levels without an appropriate increase in C-peptide concentration is highly suggestive of factitious disorder imposed on another, where the patient is intentionally administering insulin to himself in order to induce hypoglycemia.\\n\\nThe other options are less likely:\\n\\nA. Malingering: This is a false claim of illness for personal gain, but there is no evidence to suggest that the patient is faking his symptoms.\\n\\nB. Primary adrenal insufficiency: This condition would not result in the specific pattern of elevated insulin levels and normal C-peptide levels.\\n\\nC. Conversion disorder: This is a psychological condition that involves the conversion of psychological distress into physical symptoms, but there is no evidence to suggest that the patient is experiencing any psychological distress.\\n\\nD. Primary adrenal insufficiency: This condition would not result in the specific pattern of elevated insulin levels and normal C-peptide levels.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is D.

Blood should be drawn, whenever possible, before the administration of glucose to allow documentation of a low plasma glucose concentration. Convincing documentation of hypoglycemia requires the fulfillment of Whipple\u2019s triad. Thus, the ideal time to measure the plasma glucose level is during a symptomatic episode. A normal glucose level excludes hypoglycemia as the cause of the symptoms. A low glucose level confirms that hypoglycemia is the cause of the symptoms, provided the latter resolve after the glucose level is raised.

A patient is considered to have impaired fasting glucoseif fasting serum glucose concentration is 100 to 125 mg/dL or impaired glucose tolerance if 2-hour plasma glucose following an OGTT is 140 to 199 mg/dL.

            "content": "Hypoglycemia Philip E. Cryer, Stephen N. Davis Hypoglycemia is most commonly caused by drugs used to treat diabe-tes mellitus or by exposure to other drugs, including alcohol. However, a number of other disorders, including critical organ failure, sepsis and inanition, hormone deficiencies, non-\u03b2-cell tumors, insulinoma, 420 and prior gastric surgery, can cause hypoglycemia (Table 420-1). Hypoglycemia is most convincingly documented by Whipple\u2019s triad: (1) symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, (2) a low plasma glucose concentration measured with a precise method (not a glucose monitor), and (3) relief of symptoms after the plasma glucose level is raised. The lower limit of the fasting plasma glucose concentration is normally \u223c70 mg/dL (\u223c3.9 mmol/L), but lower venous glucose levels occur normally, late after a meal, during pregnancy, and during prolonged fasting (>24 h). Hypoglycemia can cause serious morbidity; if severe and prolonged, it can be fatal. It should be considered in any"

At admission, his blood glucose was 24 mg/dl (age-referenced normal is 60\u2013100). His urine was negative for ketone bodies and positive for a variety of dicarboxylic acids. Blood carnitine levels (free and acyl bound) were normal. A tentative diagnosis of medium-chain fatty acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is made. In patients with MCAD deficiency, the fasting hypoglycemia is a consequence of: A. decreased acetyl coenzyme A production. B. decreased ability to convert acetyl coenzyme A to glucose. C. increased conversion of acetyl coenzyme A to acetoacetate. D. increased production of ATP and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide."

            "content": "The diagnostic strategy is (1) to measure plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate concentrations and to screen for circulating oral hypoglycemic agents during an episode of hypoglycemia and (2) to assess symptoms during the episode and seek their resolution following correction of hypoglycemia by IV injection of glucagon (i.e., to document Whipple\u2019s triad). This is straightforward if the patient is hypoglycemic when seen. Since endogenous hyperinsulinemic disorders usually, but not invariably, cause fasting hypoglycemia, a diagnostic episode may develop after a relatively short outpatient fast. Serial sampling during an inpatient diagnostic fast of up to 72 h or after a mixed meal is more problematic. An alternative is to give patients a detailed list of the required measurements and ask them to present to an emergency room, with the list, during a symptomatic episode. Obviously, a normal plasma glucose concentration during a symptomatic episode indicates"

            "content": "A related form lasts days and may require treatment with intravenous glucose before it stabilizes. A few infants, some of diabetic mothers but most usually below about 2500 gm birth weight, continue to be hypoglycemic for days or weeks and are generally treated with intravenous glucose or glucagon if the situation is severe, and monitored in a neonatal intensive care unit. A proportion of these infants will have hypoglycemia that persists for only weeks or months and clears without explanation. This condition is due to congenital hyperinsulinism. The latter may be manifest as near normal insulin levels when the glucose drops below approximately 50 mg/dL. They can be treated with oral diazoxide, a drug formerly used intravenously for the control of severe acute hypertension but in oral form blocks insulin release, or with octreotide. The appropriate threshold for treatment of hypoglycemia has been a matter of debate."

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis?
