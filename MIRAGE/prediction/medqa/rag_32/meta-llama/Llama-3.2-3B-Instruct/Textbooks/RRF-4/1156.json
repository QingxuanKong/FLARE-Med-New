    "question": "A 7-month-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 2-month history of fatigue, weakness, and difficulty feeding. He was delivered at term to a 32-year-old woman. He is not able to sit upright on his own. He is at the 75th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. His temperature is 37.7\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), blood pressure is 110/68 mm Hg, pulse is 150/min, and respirations are 50/min. His tongue protrudes beyond the teeth. Neck veins are distended. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows an S3 gallop. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Neurologic examination shows profound weakness in proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities. He has 2+ reflexes bilaterally. A chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly. Serum glucose is 105 mg/dL. Which of the following is the enzyme most likely to be defective in this patient?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Muscle glycogen phosphorylase",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this question, we need to analyze the clinical presentation and the provided documents to identify the underlying condition and the enzyme deficiency. Step 1: Analyze the clinical presentation - The patient is a 7-month-old boy with a 2-month history of fatigue, weakness, and difficulty feeding. - He is unable to sit upright on his own and has a protruding tongue. - Distended neck veins and crackles at both lung bases suggest cardiac and respiratory involvement. - An S3 gallop on cardiac examination indicates heart failure. - Profound weakness in proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities, and reduced reflexes bilaterally suggest a neuromuscular disorder. - Cardiomegaly on chest x-ray supports cardiac involvement. Step 2: Review the provided documents - Document [0] describes a patient with a protuberant, firm abdomen and enlarged kidneys, which could be indicative of renal involvement. - Document [11] discusses a condition with muscle weakness, hypotonia, and cardiac involvement, which could be related to the patient's symptoms. - Document [22] describes a condition with progressive muscle weakness, wasting, and cardiac involvement, which matches the patient's symptoms. Step 3: Identify the underlying condition - The combination of muscle weakness, cardiac involvement, and renal involvement suggests a metabolic disorder affecting energy production. Step 4: Analyze the enzyme options - A. Muscle glycogen phosphorylase: Deficiency leads to McArdle disease, characterized by muscle cramps, fatigue, and weakness, but not typically cardiac involvement. - B. Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD): Deficiency leads to a condition with muscle weakness, lactic acidosis, and cardiac involvement, matching the patient's symptoms. - C. Lysosomal acid maltase: Deficiency leads to Pompe disease, characterized by muscle weakness, cardiomegaly, and respiratory failure, but typically presents later in life. - D. Glycogen debranching enzyme: Deficiency leads to Cori disease, characterized by hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and muscle weakness, but not typically cardiac involvement. Step 5: Choose the correct answer - Based on the analysis, the enzyme most likely to be defective in this patient is B. Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Here is the output in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a combination of muscle weakness, cardiac involvement, and renal involvement, suggesting a metabolic disorder affecting energy production. The analysis of the enzyme options reveals that very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency is the most likely cause, which matches the patient's symptoms. VLCAD deficiency is a condition that affects the breakdown of fatty acids in the mitochondria, leading to muscle weakness, lactic acidosis, and cardiac involvement.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Arm weakness is evident by age 6 years, and most boys are wheelchair dependent by age 12 years. Other manifestations include cardiomyopathy, scoliosis, respiratory decline, and, in some boys, cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. Many boys with Duchenne live into adulthood. Most die in their 20s or early 30s, usually as a result of progressive respiratory decline or cardiac dysfunction."

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

Other infants seem to develop normally for several months before the weakness becomes apparent. In these, the trunk, pelvic, and shoulder-girdle muscles are at first disproportionately affected, while the fingers and hands, toes and feet, and cranial muscles retain mobility. Hypotonia accompanies the weakness, and because passive displacement of articulated parts in testing muscle tone is easier to judge than power of contraction at this early age, it may be singled out as the dominant clinical characteristic. As a rule, the tendon reflexes are unobtainable. Volume of muscle is diminished but is difficult to evaluate in the infant because of the coverings of adipose tissue. Fasciculations are seldom visible except sometimes in the tongue. Perception of tactile and painful stimuli is undiminished, and emotional and social development measures up to age."

Extensor plantar responses (with normal tone in trunk and extremities), absence of deep tendon reflexes, and weakness (greater distally than proximally) are usually found. Loss of vibratory and proprioceptive sensation occurs. The median age of death is 35 years. Women have a significantly better prognosis than men. Cardiac involvement occurs in 90% of patients. Cardiomegaly, symmetric hypertrophy, murmurs, and conduction defects are reported. Moderate mental retardation or psychiatric syndromes are present in a small percentage of patients. A high incidence of diabetes mellitus (20%) is found and is associated with insulin resistance and pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction. Musculoskeletal deformities are common and include pes cavus, pes equinovarus, and scoliosis. MRI of the spinal cord shows atrophy (Fig. 450-2)."

Depending on the extent of reactivity, the effusion may be small, remain unnoticed, and resolve spontaneously or may be sufficiently large to cause symptoms such as fever, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea. Physical findings are those of pleural effusion: dullness to percussion and absence of breath sounds. A chest radiograph reveals the effusion and, in up to one-third of cases, also shows a parenchymal lesion. Thoracentesis is required to ascertain the nature of the effusion and to differentiate it from manifestations of other etiologies. The fluid is straw colored and at times hemorrhagic; it is an exudate with a protein concentration >50% of that in serum (usually ~4\u20136 g/dL), a normal to low glucose concentration, a pH of ~7.3"

He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."

Interestingly, the height of the patient and the previous lens surgery would suggest a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and a series of blood tests and review of the family history revealed this was so. A 35-year-old male patient presented to his family practitioner because of recent weight loss (14 lb over the previous 2 months). He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets."

The first heart sound is normal, whereas the second heart sound may not be split in the first day of life. Decreased splitting of the second heart sound is noted in PPHN, transposition of the great vessels, and pulmonary atresia. Heart murmurs in newborns are common in the delivery room and during the first day of life. Most of these murmurs are transient and are due to closure of the ductus arteriosus, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, or a small ventral septal defect. Pulses should be palpated in the upper and lower extremities (over the brachial and femoral arteries). Blood pressure in the upper and lower extremities should be measured in all patients with a murmur or heart failure. An upperto-lower extremity gradient of more than 10 to 20 mm Hg suggests coarctation of the aorta."
