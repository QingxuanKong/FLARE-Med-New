The mother has a history of schizophrenia and was treated with lithium until 5 weeks' gestation, when she found out that she was pregnant. The mother was treated for alcohol abuse disorder 2 years ago. She has been sober for 14 months now. Examination shows that the child has micrognathia, a broad nasal bridge, a short philtrum, and small, low-set ears. Examination of the mouth shows a cleft palate. A grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur can be heard over the left sternal border. Echocardiography shows a single overriding great vessel arising from the heart.

A fetal profile is not a required component of standard examination but may be helpful in identiying cases of micrognathia-an abnormally small jaw (Fig. 10-20). Micrognathia should be considered in the evaluation of hydramnios (Chap. 11, p. 227). Use of the ex-utero intrapartum treatment (EI) procedure for severe micrognathia is discussed in Chapter 16 (p. 327). here are three main types of clefts. he irst type, clt lip and palate, always involves the lip, may also involve the hard palate, can be unilateral or bilateral, and has a birth prevalence that approximates 1 in 1000 (Cragan, 2009; Dolk, 2010). If isolated, the inheritance is multifactorial-with a recurrence risk of 3 to 5 percent for one prior afected child. If a cleft is visible in the upper lip, a transverse image at the level of the alveolar ridge may demonstrate that the defect also involves the primary palate (Fig. 10-21)."

They stated that the affected infants are small in length in comparison to weight, and most of them fall below the third percentile for head circumference. They are distinguished also by the presence of short palpebral fissures (shortened distance between inner and outer canthi) and epicanthal folds; maxillary hypoplasia, micrognathia, indistinct philtrum, and thin upper lip; and longitudinally oriented palmar creases, flexion deformities of the fingers, and a limited range of motion of other joints. Minor anomalies (usually spontaneously closing cardiac septal defects), anomalous external genitalia, and cleft lip and palate are much more frequent than in the general population.

In general, the risk of major congenital defects is low; it increases to 4 to 5 percent in women taking antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy, in comparison to 2 to 3 percent in the overall population of pregnant women. These statistics have been essentially confirmed in the large study by Holmes and colleagues, conducted among several Boston hospitals. When all types of malformations were included, both major and minor, 20 percent of infants born to mothers who took antiepileptics during pregnancy showed abnormalities, compared to 9 percent of mothers who had not taken medications.

Decreased splitting of the second heart sound is noted in PPHN, transposition of the great vessels, and pulmonary atresia. Heart murmurs in newborns are common in the delivery room and during the first day of life. Most of these murmurs are transient and are due to closure of the ductus arteriosus, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, or a small ventral septal defect. Pulses should be palpated in the upper and lower extremities (over the brachial and femoral arteries). Blood pressure in the upper and lower extremities should be measured in all patients with a murmur or heart failure. An upperto-lower extremity gradient of more than 10 to 20 mm Hg suggests coarctation of the aorta."

Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis.

Infants with esophageal atresia have a history of polyhydramnios, exhibit drooling, and have mucus and saliva bubbling from the nose and mouth. Patients with a TEF are vulnerable to aspiration pneumonia. When TEF is suspected, the first feeding should be delayed until a diagnostic study is performed. The simplest test for TEF is to gently attempt to place a 10For larger tube via the mouth into the stomach. The passageof the tube is blocked at the level of the atresia. A chest x-rayreveals the tube coiled in the esophageal pouch. Air can beinjected through the tube to outline the atretic pouch. Barium should not be used because of extreme risk of aspiration,but a tiny amount of dilute water-soluble contrast agent canbe given carefully, then aspirated when the defect is clearlyshown."

Between 20 and 30 weeks' gestation, fundal heights averaged approximately 5 cm greater than expected for singletons of the same fetal age. FIGURE 45-7 Sonograms of first-trimester twins. A.
