    "question": "A 47-year-old woman seeks evaluation at your office because she has had postcoital vaginal bleeding for the past 8 months with occasional intermenstrual watery, blood-tinged vaginal discharge. Her family history is negative for malignancies and inherited disorders. She is the result of a pregnancy complicated by numerous miscarriages in the 1960s, for which her mother received diethylstilbestrol. During a pelvic examination, you notice a polypoid mass on the anterior wall of the vagina. The bimanual examination is negative for adnexal masses. You suspect the presence of carcinoma and, therefore, send tissue samples to pathology, which confirmed the presence of malignant cells. Which of the following is the most likely malignant tumor in this patient?",

Most often, this is postcoital bleeding, but it may occur as irregular or postmenopausal bleeding. Patients with advanced disease may present with a malodorous vaginal discharge, weight loss, or obstructive uropathy. In asymptomatic women, cervical cancer is most commonly identified through evaluation of abnormal cytologic screening tests. The false-negative rate for Pap tests in the presence of invasive cancer is up to 50%, so a negative Pap test should never be relied on in a symptomatic patient (10). Initially, all women suspected of having cervical cancer should have a general physical examination performed to include evaluation of the supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinofemoral lymph Figure 36.1 Gross appearance of cervical cancer on examination."

A solid, irregular, fixed pelvic mass is highly suggestive of an ovarian malignancy. If an upper abdominal mass or ascites is present, the diagnosis of ovarian cancer is almost certain. Because the patient usually reports abdominal symptoms, she may not have a pelvic examination, and a tumor may be missed. In patients who are at least 1 year past menopause, the ovaries should be atrophic and not palpable. It was proposed that any palpable pelvic mass in these patients should be considered potentially malignant, a situation that was referred to as the postmenopausal palpable ovary syndrome (91). This concept was challenged, because subsequent authors reported that only about 3% of palpable masses measuring less than 5 cm in postmenopausal women are malignant (57)."

Pelvic examination usually reveals regular or irregular uterine enlargement, sometimes associated with rubbery parametrial induration. The diagnosis may be determined by endometrial biopsy, but the usual preoperative diagnosis is uterine leiomyoma. At surgery, the diagnosis is suggested by the presence of an enlarged uterus filled with soft, gray-white to yellow necrotic and hemorrhagic tumors with bulging surfaces associated with wormlike elastic extensions into the pelvic veins."

            "content": "Paula J. Adams Hillard The causes of abnormal bleeding vary by age, with anovulatory bleeding most likely in adolescents and perimenopausal women. Pelvic masses in adolescents are most commonly functional or benign neoplastic ovarian masses, whereas the risks of malignant ovarian tumors increase with age. Although pelvic ultrasonography is an excellent technique for imaging pelvic masses and ultrasonographic characteristics may suggest reassuring characteristics of an ovarian mass, the possibility of malignancy must be kept in mind. Vulvovaginal symptoms of any sort in a young child should prompt the consideration of possible sexual abuse. Most uterine leiomyomas are asymptomatic, although bleeding, pressure symptoms, or pain may necessitate medical or surgical management."

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

            "content": "The pain of torsion is usually severe and constant or, if the torsion is partial and intermit, the pain can wax and wane. The onset of the torsion and subsequent abdominal pain frequently coincides with activity such as lifting, exercise, or intercourse. Autonomic re\ufb02ex responses (e.g., nausea, emesis, tachycardia, and apprehension) are usually present. Mild temperature elevation, tachycardia, and leukocytosis may accompany the necrosis of tissue. Pregnancy test is negative unless there is a co-existent pregnancy. The diagnosis must be suspected in any woman with acute pain and unilateral adnexal mass. On examination, the localized direct and rebound tenderness can be noted in the lower quadrant(s). Another important sign is the presence of a large pelvic mass on bimanual examination."

            "content": "Characterized by abnormal vaginal bleeding, an abnormal discharge, or postcoital bleeding. Presents in the upper third of the vagina in 75% of patients. Cytology, colposcopy, and biopsy. Local excision of involved areas when they are few and small. Extensive involvement of the vaginal mucosa may require partial or complete vaginectomy. Invasive disease requires radiation therapy or radical surgery. Most ovarian tumors are benign, but malignant tumors are the leading cause of death from reproductive tract cancer. Risk factors include the following: Age, low parity, \u2193 fertility, or delayed childbearing. A family history. Patients with one affected frst-degree relative have a 5% lifetime risk. With two or more affected frst-degree relatives, the risk is 7%. The BRCA1 mutation carries a 45% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer. The BRCA2 mutation is associated with a 25% lifetime risk."
