    "question": "A 53-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of fatigue and joint and muscle pain. He reports a 6-month history of slowly progressive tiredness associated with dull achy pain in his knees, hips, and shoulders. His past medical history is notable for hypertension, diabetes, and stable angina. He takes lisinopril, metformin, glyburide, and aspirin. He has a history of intravenous drug use and was homeless in his early 30\u2019s. He drinks alcohol socially and has a 30 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination reveals a generally well-appearing male without evidence of ascites, peripheral edema, or jaundice. Results from laboratory tests are below:\n\nHepatitis A IgM: Negative\nHepatitis A IgG: Negative\nHepatitis B surface antigen: Negative\nHepatitis B E antigen: Negative\nHepatitis B core antigen: Negative\nHepatitis B surface IgG: Positive\nHepatitis B E IgG: Negative\nHepatitis B core IgG: Negative\nHepatitis C IgG: Positive\nHCV RNA: 100,000,000 IU/ml\n\nThis patient should be started on which of the following medications?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate medication for this patient, we need to analyze the laboratory results and medical history. The patient has a history of intravenous drug use, which increases the risk of hepatitis C infection. The patient is also experiencing symptoms of fatigue, joint and muscle pain, and has a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test, but it is negative for hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg) and core antigen (HBcAg). The patient's hepatitis B surface IgG test is positive, indicating a past infection, while the hepatitis B core IgG test is negative, indicating that the patient is not currently infected with hepatitis B. The patient's hepatitis C IgG test is positive, and the HCV RNA test shows a high viral load of 100,000,000 IU/ml, indicating active hepatitis C infection. Given this information, the most appropriate medication for this patient would be a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for hepatitis C. Sofosbuvir and simeprevir are a combination of two DAA medications that have been shown to be effective in treating hepatitis C infection. Interferon-gamma is not typically used to treat hepatitis C infection, as it is more commonly used to treat other conditions such as HIV and certain types of cancer. Ribavirin is also not typically used to treat hepatitis C infection, as it is more commonly used to treat respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and certain other viral infections. Lamivudine is an antiviral medication, but it is typically used to treat hepatitis B infection, not hepatitis C infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Antibodies to HAV (anti-HAV) can be detected during acute illness when serum aminotransferase activity is elevated and fecal HAV shedding is still occurring. This early antibody response is predominantly of the IgM class and persists for several (~3) months, rarely for 6\u201312 months. During convalescence, however, anti-HAV of the IgG class becomes the predominant antibody (Fig. 360-2). Therefore, the diagnosis of hepatitis A is made during acute illness by demonstrating anti-HAV of the IgM class. After acute illness, anti-HAV of the IgG class remains detectable indefinitely, and patients with serum anti-HAV are immune to reinfection. Neutralizing antibody activity parallels the appearance of anti-HAV, and the IgG anti-HAV present in immune globulin accounts for the protection it affords against HAV infection."

Because HBeAg is invariably present during early acute hepatitis B, HBeAg testing is indicated primarily in chronic infection. In patients with hepatitis B surface antigenemia of unknown duration (e.g., blood donors found to be HBsAg-positive) testing for IgM anti-HBc may be useful to distinguish between acute or recent infection (IgM anti-HBc-positive) and chronic HBV infection (IgM antiHBc-negative, IgG anti-HBc-positive). A false-positive test for IgM anti-HBc may be encountered in patients with high-titer rheumatoid factor. Also, IgM anti-HBc may be reexpressed during acute reactivation of chronic hepatitis B."

Complications of cirrhosis occur in end-stage chronic hepatitis and include ascites, edema, bleeding gastroesophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, or hypersplenism. Occasionally, these complications bring the patient to initial clinical attention. Extrahepatic complications of chronic hepatitis B, similar to those seen during the prodromal phase of acute hepatitis B, are associated with deposition of circulating hepatitis B antigen\u2013antibody immune complexes. These include arthralgias and"

These complaints are new since she used to always feel \u201chot,\u201d noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to \u201cprotect her bones\u201d and omeprazole for \u201cheartburn.\u201d On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm.

            "content": "Viral diseases such as infectious mononucleosis; those due to cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, and coxsackieviruses; and toxoplasmosis may share certain clinical features with viral hepatitis and cause elevations in serum aminotransferase and, less commonly, in serum bilirubin levels. Tests such as the differential heterophile and serologic tests for these agents may be helpful in the differential diagnosis if HBsAg, anti-HBc, IgM anti-HAV, and anti-HCV determinations are negative. Aminotransferase elevations can accompany almost any systemic viral infection; other rare causes of liver injury confused with viral hepatitis are infections with Leptospira, Candida, Brucella, Mycobacteria, and Pneumocystis. A complete drug history is particularly important because many drugs and certain anesthetic agents can produce a picture of either acute hepatitis or cholestasis (Chap. 361). Equally important is a past history of unexplained \u201crepeated episodes\u201d of acute hepatitis. This history should"

            "content": "In patients with chronic hepatitis, initial testing should consist of HBsAg and anti-HCV. Anti-HCV supports and HCV RNA testing establishes the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C. If a serologic diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B is made, testing for HBeAg and anti-HBe is indicated to evaluate relative infectivity. Testing for HBV DNA in such patients provides a more quantitative and sensitive measure of the level of virus replication and, therefore, is very helpful during antiviral therapy (Chap. 362). In patients with chronic hepatitis B and normal aminotransferase activity in the absence of HBeAg, serial testing over time is often required to distinguish between inactive carriage and HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B with fluctuating virologic and necroinflammatory activity. In persons with hepatitis B, testing for anti-HDV is useful in those with severe and fulminant disease, with severe chronic disease, with chronic hepatitis B and acute hepatitis-like exacerbations, with frequent"

Rarely, however, isolated anti-HBc represents low-level hepatitis B viremia, with HBsAg below the detection threshold, and, occasionally, isolated anti-HBc represents a cross-reacting or false-positive immunologic specificity. Recent and remote HBV infections can be distinguished by determination of the immunoglobulin class of anti-HBc. Anti-HBc of the IgM class (IgM anti-HBc) predominates during the first 6 months after acute infection, whereas IgG anti-HBc is the predominant class of anti-HBc beyond 6 months. Therefore, patients with current or recent acute hepatitis B, including those in the anti-HBc window, have IgM anti-HBc in their serum. In patients who have recovered from hepatitis B in the remote past as well as those with chronic HBV infection, anti-HBc is predominantly of the IgG class. Infrequently, in \u22641\u20135% of patients with acute HBV infection, levels of HBsAg are too low to be detected; in such"
