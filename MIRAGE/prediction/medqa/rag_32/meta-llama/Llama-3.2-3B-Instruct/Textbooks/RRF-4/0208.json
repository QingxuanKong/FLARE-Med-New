    "question": "A clinical researcher is interested in creating a new drug for HIV patients. Darunavir has been particularly efficacious in recent patients; however, some have experienced an increased incidence of hyperglycemia. A new drug called DN501 is developed with the same mechanism of action as darunavir but fewer side effects. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of DN501?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the mechanism of action of DN501, we need to analyze the given information about darunavir and its side effects. Darunavir is a protease inhibitor, which means it works by inhibiting viral protease. However, it has been associated with an increased incidence of hyperglycemia. DN501 is a new drug with the same mechanism of action as darunavir but with fewer side effects. Therefore, the new drug is likely to target a different step in the HIV replication cycle that is less likely to cause hyperglycemia. One possible mechanism of action is inhibiting viral entry. Protease inhibitors like darunavir inhibit viral protease, while entry inhibitors target a different step in the viral life cycle. This could explain why DN501 has fewer side effects compared to darunavir.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

When used as part of initial regimens in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, these agents have been shown to be capable of suppressing levels of HIV replication to under 50 copies/mL in the majority of patients for a minimum of 5 years. As in the case of reverse transcriptase inhibitors, resistance to protease inhibitors can develop rapidly in the setting of monotherapy, and thus these agents should be used only as part of combination therapeutic regimens. A summary of known resistance mutations for protease inhibitors is shown in Fig. 226-46. The protease inhibitors preferred for use according to the DHHS Panel on the use of antiretroviral drugs are ritonavir (only as a pharmacokinetic enhancer), atazanavir, and darunavir."

The initial regimen is usually the most effective insofar as the virus has yet to develop significant resistance. HIV is capable of rapidly developing resistance to any single agent, and therapy must be given as a multidrug combination. Given that patients can be infected with viruses that harbor drug resistance mutations, it is recommended that a viral genotype be done prior to the initiation of therapy to optimize the selection of antiretroviral agents.

Patterns of susceptibility of HIV-2 to these agents may vary; however, there is innate resistance to the NNRTIs and enfuvirtide as well as a lower barrier of resistance to NRTIs and PIs. The NRTIs act by competitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase; incorporation into the growing viral DNA chain causes premature chain termination due to inhibition of binding with the incoming nucleotide (Figure 49\u20133).

Gatifloxacin (no longer marketed in several countries, including the United States, because of previously observed dysglycemia) has recently been tested in a 4-month regi men that produced no detectable major side effects; thus, this drug could be reconsidered as a good alternative. Other drugs (referred to by the WHO as \u201cgroup 5\u201d) whose efficacy is not clearly defined are used in the treatment of patients with TB resistant to most of the firstand second-line agents; these drugs include clofazimine, linezolid, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clarithromycin, and carbapenems such as imipenem/cilastatin and meropenem. Today amithiozone (thiacetazone) is used very rarely because it has been associated with severe and at times fatal skin reactions among HIV-infected patients.

            "content": "The second-generation NNRTIs (etravirine, rilpivirine) have higher potency, longer half-lives and reduced side-effect profiles compared with older NNRTIs (delavirdine, efavirenz, nevirapine). Baseline genotypic testing is recommended prior to initiating NNRTI treatment because primary resistance rates range from approximately 2% to 8%. NNRTI resistance occurs rapidly with monotherapy and can result from a single mutation. The K103N and Y181C mutations confer resistance to the first-generation NNRTIs, but not to etravirine or rilpivirine. Other mutations (eg, L100I, Y188C, G190A) may also confer cross-resistance among the NNRTI class. However, there is no cross-resistance between the NNRTIs and the NRTIs; in fact, some nucleoside-resistant viruses display hypersusceptibility to NNRTIs."
