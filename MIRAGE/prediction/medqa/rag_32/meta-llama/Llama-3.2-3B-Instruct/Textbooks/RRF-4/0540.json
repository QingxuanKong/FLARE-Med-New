    "question": "A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his mother after being found lying unconscious next to a bottle of pills. The patient\u2019s mother mentions that he has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder 3 years ago for which he was taking a medication that resulted in only a slight improvement in his symptoms. She says he still found it difficult to concentrate on his studies and did not participate in any social events in college. He didn\u2019t have many friends and was often found sitting alone in his room. He has also threatened to take his life on several occasions, but she did not think he was serious. While recording his vital signs, the patient goes into a coma. His ECG shows a QT interval of 450 milliseconds. Which of the following medications did this patient most likely overdose on?",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the symptoms presented and correlate them with the potential side effects of the medications listed as options. The patient was found unconscious next to a bottle of pills, which suggests an overdose. The patient has a history of major depressive disorder and has been taking medication for it. The patient also has a prolonged QT interval on the ECG, which can be a sign of certain medication toxicity, particularly tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and some other medications. Let's examine the options: A. Bupropion: This medication is not typically associated with QT interval prolongation or overdose symptoms that would lead to coma. B. Sertraline: This is an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), which is less likely to cause QT interval prolongation or overdose symptoms that would lead to coma. C. Venlafaxine: This is an SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), which can cause QT interval prolongation and overdose symptoms that may lead to coma. D. Clomipramine: This is a TCA, which is known to cause QT interval prolongation and overdose symptoms that can lead to coma, including seizures and respiratory depression. Given the patient's symptoms and the prolonged QT interval, the most likely medication overdose is Clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative.

He is rushed to a nearby level 1 trauma center where he is found to have multiple facial fractures, a severe, unstable cervical spine injury, and significant left eye trauma. Further examination of his left eye reveals rupture of his globe. The ophthalmolo-gist requests emergency surgery to repair and save his eye. Because the patient has suffered a recent trauma, you decide to perform a rapid sequence intubation in preparation for the surgical procedure. What muscle relaxant would you use to facilitate tracheal intubation? What is the proper dose for your chosen muscle relaxant? After intravenous infusion of your chosen muscle relaxant, you are unable to adequately visualize the patient\u2019s larynx and vocal cords and cannot successfully pass an endotracheal tube. You switch to mask ventilation but are barely able to mask ventilate the patient, and you become worried"

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."

An eight-year-old child is in a serious accident. She requires emergent transfusion, but her parents are not present. Conditions in which confidentiality must be overridden. Involuntary commitment or isolation for medical treatment may be undertaken for what reason? A 10-year-old child presents in status epilepticus, but her parents refuse treatment on religious grounds. A son asks that his mother not be told about her recently discovered cancer. False. Patients may change their minds at any time. Exceptions to the requirement of informed consent include emergency situations and patients without decision-making capacity."
