The laboratory studies show an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 65 mm/h, which is consistent with giant cell arteritis. The temporal artery biopsy shows transmural granulomatous inflammation and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina, which is also consistent with giant cell arteritis. The patient is being treated with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids, which is the standard treatment for giant cell arteritis. Given the patient's condition, the greatest risk of complications is related to the use of corticosteroids. One of the potential complications of corticosteroid use is \\u00c2\\u00b0Thoracic aortic aneurysm.

The prevalence of migraine among the elderly is substantial, considerably higher than that of giant cell arteritis. Migraineurs often report amelioration of their headaches with prednisone; thus, caution must be used when interpreting the therapeutic response. Glaucoma may present with a prostrating headache associated with nausea and vomiting. The headache often starts with severe eye pain. On physical examination, the eye is often red with a fixed, moderately dilated pupil. Glaucoma is discussed in Chap. 39."

Diagnosis depends on biopsy and histology; however, because the vascular inflammation is patchy, a negative biopsy result does not exclude the diagnosis.

            "content": "Philip J. Rosenthal, MD A 5-year-old American girl presents with a 1-week history of intermittent chills, fever, and sweats. She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

The pathology is that of focal granulomatous lesions involving the entire arterial wall; it may be associated with polymyalgia rheumatica. Obstruction of medium-size arteries (e.g., temporal and ophthalmic arteries) and major branches of the aorta and the development of aortitis and aortic regurgitation are important complications of the disease. High-dose glucocorticoid therapy may be effective when given early."

            "content": "In patients with involvement of the cranial arteries, headache is the predominant symptom and may be associated with a tender, thickened, or nodular artery, which may pulsate early in the disease but may become occluded later. Scalp pain and claudication of the jaw and tongue may occur. A well-recognized and dreaded complication of giant cell arteritis, particularly in untreated patients, is ischemic optic neuropathy, which may lead to serious visual symptoms, even sudden blindness in some patients. However, most patients have complaints relating to the head or eyes before visual loss. Attention to such symptoms with institution of appropriate therapy (see below) will usually avoid this complication. Other cranial ischemic complications include strokes and scalp or tongue infarction."

In contrast to temporal arteritis, the sedimentation rate is generally normal or only slightly elevated. An extensive early report given by Kolodny and colleagues still serves as a useful reference."

Review of the past history and growth chart demonstrates normal birth weight and birth length, but a progressive decrease in height per-centiles relative to age-matched normal ranges starting at 6 months of age, and orthostasis with febrile illnesses. Physical examination demonstrates short stature and mild generalized obesity. Genital examination reveals descended but small testes and a phallic length of \u20132 SD. Laboratory evaluations demonstrate growth hormone (GH) deficiency and a delayed bone age of 18 months. The patient is started on replacement with recombinant human GH at a dose of 40 mcg/kg per day subcutaneously. After 1 year of treatment, his height velocity has increased from 5 cm/y to 11 cm/y. How does GH stimulate growth in children? What other hormone deficiencies are sug-gested by the patient\u2019s history and physical examination? What"

            "content": "Treatment This disorder is self-limiting, lasting 6 months to 2 years, and responds dramatically to corticosteroid therapy, although this may have to be continued in low dosage for several months or a year or longer. We begin treatment with 20 mg of prednisone if there is no evidence of temporal arteritis (which requires higher doses). The absence of improvement in a day or two should bring the diagnosis into question. The degree of hip and shoulder pain is the best guide to the duration of steroid therapy and the rate at which the drug is withdrawn, usually in very small increments every 2 weeks. The sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein can be used as a guide, but neither alone is adequate to alter the medication schedule.
