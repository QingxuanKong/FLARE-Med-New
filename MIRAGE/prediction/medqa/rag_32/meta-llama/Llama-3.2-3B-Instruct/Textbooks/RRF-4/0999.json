    "question": "A 40-year-old man is referred to an optometrist. He complains of mild vision impairment over the last 6 months. His vision has continued to slowly deteriorate and his condition is now affecting his night driving. Past medical history is significant for well-controlled schizophrenia. He takes a low-potency typical antipsychotics and a multivitamin every day. He has been compliant with his medication and has regular follow-up visits. What is the best first step in the management of this patient\u2019s symptoms?",

        "A": "Decrease medication dosage",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best first step in the management of the patient's symptoms, we need to consider the potential causes of vision impairment in a patient with schizophrenia. The patient has a history of well-controlled schizophrenia and has been compliant with his medication, which suggests that the medication is unlikely to be the cause of his vision impairment. The patient's symptoms have slowly deteriorated over the last 6 months, and his condition is now affecting his night driving, which suggests that the cause of his vision impairment may be more serious. Given the patient's history of schizophrenia, the best first step in the management of his symptoms would be to perform a comprehensive eye examination to rule out any underlying ocular conditions that may be contributing to his vision impairment. This could include a slit-lamp examination to examine the anterior segment of the eye and an ophthalmoscopy to examine the posterior segment of the eye. An ocular examination under anesthesia may also be necessary to examine the retina and optic nerve in more detail. Decreasing the medication dosage or providing reassurance may not be sufficient to address the underlying cause of the patient's vision impairment, and may even worsen the condition if the cause is an underlying ocular condition. Therefore, the best first step in the management of this patient's symptoms is to perform a comprehensive ocular examination.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

At this ED visit, AK reports that he has been drinking heavily in the past day or so. He cannot recall having eaten anything in that time. There is evidence of recent vomiting, but no blood is apparent."

            "content": "In the United States, macular degeneration is the leading cause of permanent bilateral visual loss in the elderly. Risk factors include age > 40 years, African-American ethnicity, diabetes, and myopia. Hx/PE: Usually asymptomatic until late in the clinical course, when patients may begin to notice visual deficits. Should be suspected in patients > 35 years of age who need frequent lens changes and have mild headaches, visual disturbances, and impaired adaptation to darkness. The earliest visual defect is seen in the peripheral nasal fields. Cupping of the optic nerve head is seen on funduscopic exam. Dx: Tonometry, ophthalmoscopic visualization of the optic nerve, and visual field testing are most important. A diseased trabecular meshwork obstructs proper drainage of the eye, gradually increasing pressure and leading to progressive vision loss."

He is then switched to celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily, and on this regimen his joint symptoms and heartburn resolve. Two years later, he returns with increased joint symptoms. His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor. With the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, he is started on a regimen"

Research into the molecular basis of aging has answered a few questions and opened many more. It has long been known that caloric restriction alone can prolong the life span of animals, including mammals.

No cataracts are visible, but he is unable to read standard newsprint without a powerful magnifier. Why doesn\u2019t he take his antihypertensive medications?

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

In some of Griffin\u2019s cases of adrenomyeloneuropathy, a spastic weakness of the legs and sensory ataxia progressing over several years were the main clinical manifestations; a spinocerebellar degeneration was suspected. One of our patients with Kufs lipid storage disease began to deteriorate mentally in early adult life and only much later showed an increasing rigidity, with athetotic posturing of limbs and difficulty in walking; he succumbed to his disease after more than a decade of symptoms. Another recent patient with Kufs disease presented at age 51 with vague visual difficulty, which was followed by spasticity of the legs, behavioral disinhibition, and dementia spanning 6 years.
