    "question": "A 30-year-old G4P3 woman at 38 weeks gestation is admitted to the labor and delivery unit complaining of contractions every 5 minutes for the past hour. Her previous births have been via uncomplicated caesarean sections, but she wishes to attempt vaginal delivery this time. Her prenatal care is notable for gestational diabetes controlled with diet and exercise. The delivery is prolonged, but the patient's pain is controlled with epidural analgesia. She delivers a male infant with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Fundal massage is performed, but the placenta does not pass. The obstetrician manually removes the placenta, but a red mass protrudes through the vagina attached to the placenta. The patient loses 500 mL of blood over the next minute, during which her blood pressure decreases from 120/80 mmHg to 90/65 mmHg. What is the best next step in management?",

    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: ### Step 1: Assess the situation The patient is a 30-year-old woman at 38 weeks gestation, admitted with contractions every 5 minutes for the past hour, attempting vaginal delivery after previous caesarean sections. She delivers a male infant with good Apgar scores. However, during placental removal, a red mass protrudes through the vagina attached to the placenta, causing significant bleeding. ### Step 2: Identify the clinical findings - The patient has a history of gestational diabetes controlled with diet and exercise. - The delivery is prolonged, but pain is controlled with epidural analgesia. - The patient loses 500 mL of blood over the next minute, with a significant drop in blood pressure from 120/80 mmHg to 90/65 mmHg. - A red mass protrudes from the vagina, attached to the placenta. ### Step 3: Determine the likely diagnosis Based on the clinical findings, the most likely diagnosis is placenta accreta, a condition where the placenta grows too deeply into the uterine wall, making it difficult to separate from the uterus. ### Step 4: Choose the best next step in management Given the diagnosis of placenta accreta, the best next step is to stabilize the patient and control the bleeding. ### Answer ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Given the diagnosis of placenta accreta, the next step is to stabilize the patient and control the bleeding.

If the uterus remains irm and there is no unusual bleeding, watchful waiting until the placenta separates is the usual practice. Neither massage nor downward fundal pressure is employed, but the fundus is frequently palpated to ensure that it does not become atonic and illed with blood from placental separation. To prevent uterine inversion, umbilical cord traction must not be used to pul the placenta rom the uterus. Signs of separation include a sudden gush of blood into the vagina, a globular and firmer fundus, a lengthening of the umbilical cord as the placenta descends into the vagina, and elevation of the uterus into the abdomen. With the last, the placenta, having separated, passes down into the lower uterine segment and vagina. Here, its bulk pushes the uterine body upward."

Once the placenta has detached from the uterine wall, the mother may be asked to bear down, and the intraabdominal pressure often expels the placenta into the vagina. These eforts may fail or may not be possible because of analgesia. After ensuring that the uterus is contracted irmly, the umbilical cord is kept slightly taut but is not pulled. Pressure is exerted by a hand wrapped around the fundus to propel the detached placenta into the vagina (Fig. 27-10). Concurrently, the heel of the hand exerts downward pressure between the symphysis pubis and the uterine fundus. This also aids inversion prevention. Once the placenta passes through the introitus, pressure on the uterus is relieved. The placenta is then gently lifted away. Care is taken to prevent placental membranes from being torn of and left behind. If the membranes begin to"

Their overall cesarean delivery rate was 5 percent in the 1970s and 1980s with such management. The approach is now referred to as active management of labor. Two of its components-amniotomy and oxytocinhave been widely used, especially in English-speaking countries outside the United States. With this protocol, labor is diagnosed when painful contractions are accompanied by complete cervical efacement, bloody \"show,\" or ruptured membranes. Women with such indings are committed to delivery within 12 hours. Pelvic examination is performed each hour for the next 3 hours, and thereafter at 2-hour intervals. When dilation has not increased by at least 1 cm/hr, amniotomy is performed. Progress is again assessed at 2 hours, and high-dose oxytocin infusion, described in Chapter 26 (p. 509),"

A neonatologist attends each delivery and determines subsequent management. In our institution, traditional fetal indications for cesarean delivery are practiced in women at 25\u00b0/7 weeks or beyond. Cesarean delivery is not ofered for fetal indications before 24\u00b0/7 weeks. At 240r weeks, cesarean delivery is not ofered unless fetal weight is estimated at 750 g or greater.

For pregnant women with preeclampsia prior to 37 weeks of gestation, delivery reduces the mother\u2019s morbidity but exposes the fetus to the risk of premature birth. The management of preeclampsia is challenging because it requires the clinician to balance the health of the mother and fetus simultaneously. In general, prior to term, women with mild preeclampsia without severe features may be managed conservatively with limited physical activity, although bed rest is not recommended, close monitoring of blood pressure and renal function, and careful fetal surveillance. For women with preeclampsia with severe features, delivery is recommended unless the patient is eligible for expectant management in a tertiary hospital setting. Expectant management of preeclampsia with severe features remote from term affords some benefits for the fetus but significant risks for the mother."

She eats a low-sugar diet and regularly eats packaged frozen meals for dinner because she doesn\u2019t have time to cook regularly. Her most recent laboratory values include a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that is above goal at 160 mg/dL (goal < 100 mg/dL) and a hemo-globin A1c that is well controlled at 6%. Her blood pressure is high at 160/100 mm Hg. Her prescription medications include simvastatin, metformin, and benazepril. She also takes over-the-counter ibuprofen for occasional knee pain and a multivitamin supplement once daily. She has heard good things about natural products and asks you if taking a garlic supplement daily could help to bring her blood"

The procedure was successful in a large case series at 18 to 34 weeks with very few complications. High-Dose Oxytocin Oxytocin in very high doses is as effective as dinoprostone at 17 to 24 weeks of pregnancy, but is not equal to the mifepristone/misoprostol regimen described above (365). Patients initially receive an infusion of 50 U of oxytocin in 500 mL of 5% dextrose and normal saline over 3 hours; 1 hour of no oxytocin, followed by a 100-U, 500-mL solution over 3 hours; another hour of rest; and then a 150-U, 500-mL solution over 3 hours, alternating 3 hours of oxytocin"

            "content": "Historically, insulin has been considered standard therapy in women with gestational diabetes when target glucose levels cannot be consistently achieved through nutrition and exercise. It does not cross the placenta, and tight glycemic control can typically be achieved. Insulin therapy is typically added if fasting levels persistently exceed 95 mg/ dL in women with gestational diabetes. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017 a) also recommends that insulin be considered in women with I-hour postprandial levels that persistently exceed 140 mg/dL or those with 2-hour levelsr> 120 mg/dL. Importantly, all of these thresholds are extrapolated from recommendations for managing women with overt diabetes."

Three possibilities include pacenta adherens, in which uterine contractions are insu.cient to detach the placenta; lower uterine segment constriction and a detached but trapped placenta; or a morbidly adherent placenta. Consistent risks for retained placenta include stillbirth, prior cesarean delivery, prior retention, and preterm delivery (Belachew, 2014; Coviello, 2015; Endler, 2014; Nikolajsen, 2013). For the last, in one study with nearly 46,000 deliveries, analysis predicted that 90 percent of placentas would spontaneously deliver by 180 minutes for gestations at 20 weeks; 21 minutes at 30 weeks; and 14 minutes at 40 weeks (Dombrowski, 1995)."

Labor is defined as cervical dilation of 3 to 4 cm or more in the presence of uterine contractions. Management guidelines direct that a pelvic examination be performed approximately every 2 hours. Inefective labor is suspected when the cervix does not dilate within approximately 2 hours of admission. Amniotomy is then performed, and labor progress determined at the next 2-hour evaluation. In women whose labors do not progress, an intrauterine pressure catheter is placed to assess uterine function. Hypotonic contractions and no cervical dilation after an additional 2 to 3 hours result in stimulation of labor using the high-dose oxytocin regimen described in Chapter 26 (p. 509). The goal is uterine activity of 200 to 250 Montevideo units for 2 to 4 hours before dystocia can be diagnosed. If hypotonic contractions are strongly suspected, internal monitors may be placed with"
