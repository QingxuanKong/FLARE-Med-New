    "question": "A 61-year-old man is brought to the emergency room with chest pain. He developed severe, crushing, substernal chest pain 10 hours ago while he was hiking in the Adirondack mountains. He was with 2 friends at the time who gave him aspirin before carrying him 5 miles to a town to get phone service, where they then called emergency medical services. His past medical history is notable for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He takes enalapril, metformin, and atorvastatin. He has a 20-pack-year smoking history and is an avid hiker. His temperature is 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 102/60 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 28/min. He is diaphoretic and intermittently conscious. Bilateral rales are heard on pulmonary auscultation. An electrocardiogram demonstrates ST elevations in leads I and aVL. Despite appropriate management, the patient expires. An autopsy is performed demonstrating ischemia in the left atrium and posterior left ventricle. Which of the following vessels was most likely affected in this patient?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which vessel was most likely affected in this patient, we need to analyze the clinical presentation and the electrocardiogram (ECG) findings. The patient had severe, crushing, substernal chest pain while hiking, which is a classic presentation of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient's past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia also increases the risk of coronary artery disease. The ECG findings of ST elevations in leads I and aVL are indicative of an inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI). Given the location of the MI (left atrium and posterior left ventricle), we need to consider which coronary artery supplies these regions. The left circumflex artery (also known as the left circumflex branch of the left coronary artery) supplies the lateral and posterior walls of the left ventricle, including the posterior left ventricle. Therefore, the left circumflex artery is the most likely affected vessel in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Dyspnea may occur with multiple conditions considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain and thus is not discriminative, but the presence of dyspnea is important because it suggests a cardiopulmonary etiology.

Patients with preexisting coronary artery disease (CAD) or risk factors for CAD are at greatest risk for ventricular arrhythmias (Chap. 276) as a cause for palpitations. In addition, the association of palpitations with other symptoms suggesting hemodynamic compromise, including syncope or lightheadedness, supports this diagnosis. Palpitations caused by sustained tachyarrhythmias in patients with CAD can be accompanied by angina pectoris or dyspnea, and, in patients with ventricular dysfunction (systolic or diastolic), aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or mitral stenosis (with or without CAD), can be accompanied by dyspnea from increased left atrial and pulmonary venous pressure."

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

            "content": "The following three brief scenarios of a patient with hemoptysis demonstrate three distinct patterns: A 46-year-old man presents to his internist with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian"

            "content": "Chest discomfort is the third most common reason for visits to the ED in the United States, resulting in 6 to 7 million emergency visits each year. More than 60% of patients with this presentation are hospitalized for further testing, and the rest undergo additional investigation in the ED. Fewer than 25% of evaluated patients are eventually diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), with rates of 5\u201315% in most series of unselected populations. In the remainder, the most common diagnoses are gastrointestinal causes (Fig. 19-1), and fewer than 10% are other life-threatening cardiopulmonary conditions. In a large proportion of patients with transient acute chest discomfort, ACS or another acute cardiopulmonary cause is excluded but the cause is not determined. Therefore, the resources and time devoted to the evaluation of chest discomfort in the absence of a severe cause are substantial. Nevertheless, a disconcerting 2\u20136% of patients with chest discomfort of presumed non-ischemic"

Following a sleepless night with significant dyspnea, the patient develops nausea and vomiting and collapses. He presents to the emergency department in cardiac arrest and is unable to be resuscitated. His autopsy shows a posterior wall myocardial infarction and a fresh thrombus in an atherosclerotic right coronary artery. What went wrong? The clinician had decided, based on the patient\u2019s appearance, even before starting the history, that the patient\u2019s complaints were not serious. Therefore, he felt confident that he could perform an abbreviated and focused examination by using the URI assessment protocol rather than considering the broader range of possibilities and performing appropriate tests to confirm or refute his initial hypotheses. In particular, by concentrating on the URI, the clinician failed to elicit the full dyspnea history, which would have"

He gives a typical history relating to lack of blood flow to the muscles. A similar finding is present when muscular branches of the femoral artery are occluded or stenosed. Such patients develop similar (ischemic) pain in the calf muscles called intermittent claudication. How does the blood get to the gluteal muscles? Blood arrives at the aortic bifurcation and then passes into the common iliac arteries, which divide into the internal and external iliac vessels. The internal iliac artery then divides into anterior and posterior divisions, which in turn give rise to vessels that leave the pelvis by passing through the greater sciatic foramen and supply the gluteal muscles. The internal pudendal artery also arises from the anterior division of the internal iliac artery and supplies the penis."

Bifurcation lesions require consideration of PCI strategies that protect side-branch patency. There are both one-stent and two-stent techniques to treat bifurcation lesions; the selection of technique depends on anatomic considerations, including plaque burden, angle of side-branch take-off, plaque shift during angioplasty, and side-branch distribution. Rates of target lesion revascularization and stent thrombosis are similar between one-stent and two-stent procedures.
