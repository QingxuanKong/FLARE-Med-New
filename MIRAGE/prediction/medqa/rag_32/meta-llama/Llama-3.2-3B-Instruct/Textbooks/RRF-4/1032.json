    "question": "An 80-year-old man presents with severe pain of the right lower extremity. He says that symptoms had an acute onset while he was in the ICU for a COPD exacerbation due to a recent upper respiratory infection, which was treated with nebulized albuterol and ipratropium bromide, continuous oxygen, IV methylprednisolone, and levofloxacin. He says he has been hospitalized 3 other times this year for COPD exacerbations. The medical history is significant for a left main coronary artery myocardial infarction after a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 2 months ago, mild cognitive impairment, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications are metformin, aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, atorvastatin, galantamine, and enalapril. He reports a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. His temperature is 39.0\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F); blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg; pulse is 122/min; respiratory rate is 20/min, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. The physical examination is significant for the cutaneous finding shown in the picture. The involved area is severely tender to palpation and there are warmth and crepitus. A foul-smelling discharge is also noted. Pain seems out of proportion to the exam findings. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone a recent CABG. The presence of cellulitis in a patient with a prosthetic material (CABG) increases the risk of prosthetic joint infection (PJI). The next best step in management is to evaluate for PJI, which is confirmed by imaging studies. Biopsy of the wound (C) may be considered, but it is not the next best step. Immediate debridement (A) and empiric IV antibiotics (B) may be necessary, but they do not address the underlying concern for PJI. A contrast CT of the chest and abdomen (D) may be useful, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. The correct answer is C, as a biopsy of the wound can help confirm the diagnosis of PJI, which is a serious complication of prosthetic joint infections.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Many patients have such symptoms for months or years before seeking medical attention. Although the development of airflow obstruction is a gradual process, many patients date the onset of their disease to an acute illness or exacerbation. A careful history, however, usually reveals the presence of symptoms prior to the acute exacerbation. The development of exertional dyspnea, often described as increased effort to breathe, heaviness, air hunger, or gasping, can be insidious. It is best elicited by a careful history focused on typical physical activities and how the patient\u2019s ability to perform them has changed. Activities involving significant arm work, particularly at or above shoulder level, are particularly difficult for patients with COPD.

            "content": "David Robertson, MD, & Italo Biaggioni, MD* A 38-year-old man has been experiencing palpitations and headaches. He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

The classic physical exam finding is a systolic BP that is higher in the upper extremities; the difference in BP between the left and right arm can indicate the point of coarctation. Additional findings include weak femoral pulses, radiofemoral delay, a short systolic murmur in the left axilla, and a forceful apical impulse. In infancy, critical coarctation requires a patent PDA for survival. Such infants may present in the first few weeks of life in a shocklike state when the PDA closes. Differential cyanosis may be seen with lower oxygen saturation in the left arm and lower extremities (postductal areas) as compared to the right arm (preductal area). Echocardiography and color \ufb02ow Doppler are diagnostic. CXR in young children may demonstrate cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion."

            "content": "The patient has a low ejection fraction with systolic heart failure, probably secondary to hypertension. His heart fail-ure must be treated first, followed by careful control of the hypertension. He was initially treated with a diuretic (furo-semide, 40 mg twice daily). On this therapy, he was less short of breath on exertion and could also lie flat without dyspnea. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhib-itor was added (enalapril, 20 mg twice daily), and over the next few weeks, he continued to feel better. Because of continued shortness of breath on exercise, digoxin at 0.25 mg/d was added with a further modest improvement in exercise tolerance. The blood pressure stabilized at 150/90 mm Hg, and the patient will be educated regarding the relation between his hypertension and heart failure and the need for better blood pressure control. Cautious addition of a \u03b2 blocker (metoprolol) will be considered. Blood lipids, which are currently in the normal range, will be monitored."

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

Bifurcation lesions require consideration of PCI strategies that protect side-branch patency. There are both one-stent and two-stent techniques to treat bifurcation lesions; the selection of technique depends on anatomic considerations, including plaque burden, angle of side-branch take-off, plaque shift during angioplasty, and side-branch distribution. Rates of target lesion revascularization and stent thrombosis are similar between one-stent and two-stent procedures.

If pain persists after three doses given 5 min apart, intravenous nitroglycerin (5\u201310 \u03bcg/min using nonabsorbing tubing) is recommended. The rate of the infusion may be increased by 10 \u03bcg/min every 3\u20135 min until symptoms are relieved, systolic arterial pressure falls to This is the second major cornerstone of treatment.
