    "question": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother with increasing swelling of his right jaw for the past 2 months. She notes that he has been treated several times with different antibiotics, but that they have not helped. She reports no recent history of fever, chills, or night sweats. The boy has no significant medical history. He emigrated to the United States with his family from Nigeria 1 month ago. He is in the 85th percentile for height and weight, and he has been meeting all developmental milestones. His temperature is 37.8\u2103 (100.0\u2109). On physical examination, the patient has a prominent 8 \u00d7 8 cm mass over the right mandible. The mass has partially distorted the borders of the mandible and cheek. The overlying skin is erythematous. The mass is firm, immobile, and tender. The contralateral side of the face shows no abnormalities. An oral examination shows the disruption of the ipsilateral lower teeth and oral mucosa. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. A biopsy of the mass is performed and a histopathologic analysis is seen in the image. Which of the following microorganisms is most likely associated with this patient\u2019s condition?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: **Step 1: Review the patient's symptoms and history** The patient is a 7-year-old boy with increasing swelling of his right jaw for the past 2 months. He has been treated several times with different antibiotics, but they have not helped. He has no recent history of fever, chills, or night sweats. He emigrated to the United States with his family from Nigeria 1 month ago. **Step 2: Consider the differential diagnosis** Based on the patient's symptoms and history, the differential diagnosis for a painful, painless jaw mass in a child is: * Lymphoma * Leukemia * Sarcoma * Infection (e.g., abscess, cellulitis) * Dental issues (e.g., tooth abscess, impacted tooth) **Step 3: Consider the patient's travel history** The patient emigrated to the United States from Nigeria 1 month ago. This raises the possibility of infectious diseases that are common in Nigeria but not typically seen in the United States. **Step 4: Review the histopathologic analysis** Although the histopathologic analysis is not described in the question, based on the patient's symptoms and history, we can make an educated guess about the likely diagnosis. **Step 5: Review the potential choices** The potential choices are: A. Bartonella henselae B. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) C. Epstein barr virus (EBV) D. Yersinia pestis **Step 6: Make an educated guess** Based on the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is a cat-scratch disease, which is caused by Bartonella henselae. This disease is common in children who have scratched themselves on a cat's scratch, and it can cause a painful, painless jaw mass. **Step 7: Justify the answer** Cat-scratch disease is a common infectious disease in children who have scratched themselves on a cat's scratch. The disease is characterized by a painful, painless jaw mass, and it is often accompanied by swollen lymph nodes. Bartonella henselae is the causative agent of cat-scratch disease, and it is typically transmitted through a cat scratch. **Answer** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a diagnosis of cat-scratch disease, which is caused by Bartonella henselae.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

A detailed history and physical examination often helps determine the likely etiology of the lymph node and the need for excisional biopsy. Enlarged tender lymph nodes are usually the result of a bacterial infection (Staphy-lococcus or Streptococcus). Treatment of the primary cause (e.g., otitis media or pharyngitis) with antibiotics often is all that is necessary. However, when the involved nodes become fluctuant, incision and drainage are indicated. In many North American institutions, there has been an increasing prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection of the skin and soft tissues, leading to increased staphylococcal lymphadenitis in children. More chronic forms of lymphadeni-tis, including infections with atypical mycobacteria, as well as cat-scratch fever, are diagnosed based on serologic findings or excisional biopsy. The"

            "content": "APPROACH TO THE PATIENT: The chronology of events preceding fever, including exposure to other infected individuals or to vectors of disease, should be ascertained. Electronic devices for measuring oral, tympanic membrane, or rectal temperatures are reliable, but the same site should be used consistently to monitor a febrile disease. Moreover, physicians should be aware that newborns, elderly patients, patients with chronic liver or renal failure, and patients taking glucocorticoids or being treated with an anticytokine may have active infection in the absence of fever due to a blunted febrile response. The workup should include a complete blood count; a differential count should be performed manually or with an instrument sensitive to the identification of juvenile or band forms, toxic granulations, and D\u00f6hle bodies, which are suggestive of bacterial infection. Neutropenia may be present with some viral infections."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing.

The patient had noted 2 days of abdominal pain and fever, and his clinical evaluation and CT scan were consistent with appendicitis. His clinical find-ings resolved after laparoscopic appendectomy.

            "content": "Ludwig\u2019s angina is a rapidly progressive, potentially fulminant form of cellulitis that involves the bilateral sublingual and sub-mandibular spaces and that typically originates from an infected or recently extracted tooth, most commonly the lower second and third molars. Improved dental care has reduced the incidence of this disorder substantially. Infection in these areas leads to dysphagia, odynophagia, and \u201cwoody\u201d edema in the sublingual region, forcing the tongue up and back with the potential for airway obstruction. Fever, dysarthria, and drooling also may be noted, and patients may speak in a \u201chot potato\u201d voice. Intubation or tracheostomy may be necessary to secure the airway, as asphyxiation is the most common cause of death. Patients should be monitored closely and treated promptly with IV antibiotics directed against streptococci and oral anaerobes. Recommended agents include ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin, or high-dose penicillin plus metronidazole."
