The digital rectal exam reveals a slightly enlarged prostate, but no additional abnormalities. The serum PSA is 6 ng/mL. Given the patient's symptoms and PSA level, the primary concern is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is a common cause of LUTS in older men. The ultrasound image is not provided, but it would typically show an enlarged prostate gland. The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with BPH. The goal of treatment is to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. The patient's age and PSA level do not suggest prostate cancer. Therefore, the most appropriate medication to include in the treatment plan is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, which can help reduce the size of the prostate gland and alleviate symptoms. Finasteride is a commonly used medication for BPH and is a suitable option for this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Thus, the PSA level establishes the likelihood that a man will harbor cancer if he undergoes a prostate biopsy.

In normal conditions, PSA is secreted into prostatic gland alveoli and ultimately incorporated into seminal fluid. The alveolar secretion from the prostate gland is pumped into the prostatic urethra during ejaculation by contraction of the fibromuscular tissue of the prostate. Because PSA is predominately released into prostatic secretion, only a very small amount of PSA (usually below 4 ng/mL) is circulating in the blood of a healthy individual. However, in prostate cancer, serum concentration of PSA increases; large amounts of PSA are produced and misdirected into the circulation by the transformed prostatic epithelium. Therefore, the elevated levels of PSA are directly related to increased activity of the prostatic cancer cells. A PSA level between 4 and 10 ng/mL suggests about 25% percent cancer risk; levels above 10 ng/mL suggest a risk greater than 67%. An"

Overtreatment of these indolent cancers can cause significant morbidity, particularly erectile dysfunction and incontinence. A second limitation of PSA as a biomarker is that it is not cancer-specific. BPH, prostatitis, prostatic infarcts, instrumentation of the prostate, and ejaculation all may increase serum PSA levels.

Normal serum PSA increases with age due to BPH (2.5 ng/mL for ages 40-49 years vs. 7.5 ng/mL for ages 70-79 years) ii. PSA > 10 ng/mL is highly worrisome at any age. iii. Decreased% free-PSA is suggestive of cancer (cancer makes bound PSA). E. Prostatic biopsy is required to confirm the presence of carcinoma. 1.

In men 40 years of age or older with baseline PSA >0.6 ng/mL, perform digital rectal examination and check PSA level before initiating treatment, at 3\u20136 months, and then in accordance with guidelines for prostate cancer screening depending on the age and race of the patient. 6.

            "content": "In the United States, most prostate cancers are small, nonpalpable, asymptomatic lesions discovered on needle biopsy performed to investigate an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (discussed later). Some 70% to 80% of prostate cancers arise in the outer (peripheral) glands, and a subset of these may be palpable as irregular hard nodules on digital rectal examination. A minority of carcinomas is discovered unexpectedly during histologic examination of prostate tissue removed by trans-urethral resection for BPH. Because of the peripheral location, prostate cancer is less likely than BPH to cause urethral obstruction in its initial stages. Locally advanced cancers often infiltrate the seminal vesicles and periurethral zones of the prostate and may invade the adjacent soft tissues, the wall of the urinary bladder, or (less commonly) the rectum. Bone metastases, particularly to the axial skeleton, are frequent late in the disease and typically cause osteoblastic"

Evidence for distention of the kidney or urinary bladder can often be obtained by palpation and percussion of the abdomen. A careful rectal and genital examination may reveal enlargement or nodularity of the prostate, abnormal rectal sphincter tone, or a rectal or pelvic mass."

A presumptive diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia should be made only in men with LUTS who have demonstrable evidence of prostate enlargement and obstruction based on the size of the prostate. Diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants, and other medications that have anticholinergic properties can cause or exacerbate LUTS in older men. The intensity of LUTS symptoms tends to fluctuate over time."
