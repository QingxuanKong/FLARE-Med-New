    "question": "A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because she feels depressed, has difficulty sleeping, a poor appetite, and low concentration for the past 3 months. During this time, she has also had low energy and lost interest in playing the guitar. During high school, the patient went through similar episodes of low mood and poor sleep. At that time, she would repeatedly engage in binge eating and purging behavior, for which she was referred to therapy. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. The physician offers to prescribe a medication for her current symptoms. Treatment with which of the following drugs should most be avoided in this patient?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of binge eating and purging behavior in the past, which suggests a possible eating disorder. This history is relevant when considering antidepressant medication, as some antidepressants can exacerbate disordered eating behaviors. The patient does not have suicidal ideation, but the physician should still be cautious when prescribing antidepressants, especially if there is a history of eating disorders. The potential choices include duloxetine, trazodone, bupropion, and citalopram. Duloxetine is an SNRI, which can increase appetite and worsen binge eating behaviors. Trazodone is an SSRI, which can also increase appetite and is not ideal for someone with a history of binge eating. Bupropion is an norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, which can increase appetite and is not typically used for depression in individuals with a history of eating disorders. Citalopram is an SSRI, which is generally considered safe for individuals with eating disorders. However, the patient's history of binge eating and purging behavior requires careful consideration of the potential effects of antidepressants on her eating habits. Considering the potential risks, duloxetine and trazodone should be avoided in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Extreme cases require hospitalization. If the patient refuses to eat, tube feeding is the only alternative. As weight is gained over several weeks, the patient usually becomes more normal in her attitude toward eating and will continue to recover on this regimen at home. The menses do not return until considerable weight has been gained (approximately 10 percent above the weight at the time of the menarche). Our colleagues report better success with such a regimen when imipramine or fluoxetine is added.

It might seem that someone who repeatedly makes suicidal gestures is more interested in the responses of others than in ending her life. However, past attempts or gestures increase the risk of completed suicide. Patients who made a suicide attempt should be queried about the following risk factors: the intent to die (rather than escape, sleep, or make people understand her distress); increasing numbers or doses of drugs taken in a progression of attempts; and drug or alcohol misuse, especially if it, too, is increasing. Inquiry about suicidal ideation and behavior is an inherent part of every mental status examination and is mandatory for every patient with past or current depression or evidence of self-destructive"

Activities that were formerly found pleasurable are no longer so. Often, however, change in mood is less conspicuous than reduction in psychic and physical energy, and it is in this type of patient that diagnosis is most difficult. A complaint of fatigue is almost invariable; not uncommonly, it is worse in the morning after a night of restless sleep. The patient complains of a \u201closs of energy,\u201d \u201cweakness,\u201d \u201ctiredness,\u201d \u201chaving no energy,\u201d that his job has become more difficult. His outlook is pessimistic.

With excessive worry, the ability to think with accustomed efficiency is reduced; the patient complains that his mind is not functioning properly, and he is"

An episode may be characterized by sadness, indifference, apathy, or irritability and is usually associated with changes in sleep patterns, appetite, and weight; motor agitation or retardation; fatigue; impaired concentration and decision making; feelings of shame or guilt; and thoughts of death or dying. Patients with depression have a profound loss of pleasure in all enjoyable activities, exhibit early morning awakening, feel that the dysphoric mood state is qualitatively different from sadness, and often notice a diurnal variation in mood (worse in morning hours). Patients experiencing bereavement or grief may exhibit many of the same signs and symptoms of major depression, although the emphasis is usually on feelings of emptiness and loss, rather than"

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

The excessive somnolence cannot be attributable to medical or mental illness, medications, poor sleep hygiene, insuffcient sleep, or narcolepsy. Tx: First-line therapy includes stimulant drugs such as amphetamines. Antidepressants such as SSRIs may be useful in some patients. May affect up to 0.16% of the population. Onset typically occurs by young adulthood, generally before the age of 30. Some forms of narcolepsy may have a genetic component. Dx: Manifestations include excessive daytime somnolence and \u2193REM sleep latency on a daily basis for at least three months. Sleep attacks are the classic symptom; patients cannot avoid falling asleep. Factitious disorders and malingering are distinct from somatoform disorders in that they involve conscious and intentional processes. \u25a0The characteristic excessive sleepiness may be associated with the following:"

When such a state is fully developed, it qualifies as a psychosis. After a minimum of sleep, the patient awakes with enthusiasm and expectation. The manic individual appears to possess great drive and confidence yet lacks the ability to carry out plans. Often headstrong, impulsive, socially intrusive behavior is characteristic. Judgment may be so impaired that reckless investments are made; fortunes are spent in gambling or on extravagant shopping sprees. Setbacks do not perturb the patient, but rather act as goads to new activities. Euphoria and expansiveness sometimes bubble over into delusions of power and grandeur, which, in turn, may make the patient offensively aggressive. Up to a point, the patient\u2019s mirth and good spirits may be contagious, and others may join in; however, if the patient"
