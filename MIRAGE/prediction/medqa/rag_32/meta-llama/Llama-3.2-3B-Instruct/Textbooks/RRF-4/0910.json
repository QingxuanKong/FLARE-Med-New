It is not associated with fever and sensitivity to light or sound. She experiences occasional nausea but no vomiting. She did not have similar headaches in the past. Her blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg; pulse, 60/min, and body mass index is 33.5 kg/m2. The neurological examination reveals normal extraocular movements. Mild bilateral papilledema is present. A magnetic resonance imaging of the brain reveals a solitary lesion in the left temporal region with predominant hemorrhage. Refer to the image below of the MRI of the brain. Which of the following types of cancer has the highest tendency to cause this brain lesion?",

The lesion is described as a solitary lesion in the left temporal region with predominant hemorrhage, and the patient is a 52-year-old woman. The location of the lesion is in the temporal region, which is a common site for certain types of brain tumors. Lung cancer (A) is known to cause brain metastases, which can occur in any location, including the temporal region. However, it is not the most common primary brain tumor to metastasize to the temporal region. Melanoma (B) is another type of cancer that can metastasize to the brain, but it tends to metastasize to the posterior fossa or the brainstem, rather than the temporal region. Multiple myeloma (C) is a type of blood cancer that can cause brain lesions, but it typically causes lesions in the skull, spine, or vertebral bodies, rather than the temporal region. Thyroid cancer (D) is not commonly associated with brain metastases, especially not in the temporal region. Given the location of the lesion in the temporal region, the most likely primary cancer to cause this brain lesion is lung cancer (A). However, it is essential to note that the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not provide enough information to confirm the primary cancer, and further diagnostic workup is needed to determine the exact cause of the lesion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

General or nonspecific symptoms include headache, with or without nausea or vomiting, cognitive difficulties, personality change, and gait disorder. Generalized symptoms arise when the enlarging tumor and its surrounding edema cause an increase in intracranial pressure or direct compression of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation leading to hydrocephalus. The classic headache associated with a brain tumor is most evident in the morning and improves during the day, but this particular pattern is actually seen in a minority of patients. Headaches are often holocephalic but can be ipsilateral to the side of a tumor.

However, these are not specific attributes, as migraine and hypertensive vascular headaches may also begin in the early morning hours or upon awakening. But if vomiting occurs at the peak of the head pain, tumor is more likely, as noted later.

In the majority of instances, the CSF pressure is normal during the first weeks when the headache is present, and one can attribute it only to local swelling of tissues and to distortion of blood vessels in the dura overlying the tumor. Later, the headache may be related to increases in intracranial pressure, thus the early morning occurrence after recumbency and vomiting, as discussed in Chap. 9. Tumors above the tentorium cause headache on the side of the tumor and in its vicinity, in the orbitofrontal, temporal, or parietal region; tumors in the posterior fossa usually cause ipsilateral retroauricular or occipital headache. With elevated intracranial pressure, bifrontal or bioccipital headache is the rule regardless of the location of the tumor."

While headache is sometimes stated to occur in one-third of brain tumor cases, this is certainly the result of the high frequency of cranial imaging in headache patients. Headache probably only arises if the tumor displaces major cerebral vessels or blocks the flow of CSF, but we have seen exceptions. The pain has no specific features; it tends to be deep seated, usually nonthrobbing (occasionally throbbing), and is described as aching or bursting. However, a major change in the pattern of an accustomed headache syndrome should raise suspicion of a structural lesion in the cranium.

CT with contrast will detect practically all sizable (1 cm) metastases though MRI with gadolinium is much more sensitive especially for cerebellar and subcentimeter lesions, and will expose associated leptomeningeal disease.

Occasionally the onset is abrupt, resembling a stroke, with the sudden appearance of headache, nausea, vomiting, and neurologic deficits. This picture is usually due to hemorrhage into the metastasis. Melanoma, germ cell tumors, and renal cell cancers have a particularly high incidence of intracranial bleeding. The tumor mass and surrounding edema may cause obstruction of the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid, with resulting hydrocephalus. Patients with increased intracranial pressure may have papilledema with visual disturbances and neck stiffness. As the mass enlarges, brain tissue may be displaced through the fixed cranial openings, producing various herniation syndromes."

Wijdicks and colleagues confirmed that thunderclap headache is usually a benign condition; among 71 patients followed for more than 3 years they found no serious cerebrovascular lesions. For this reason, these idiopathic thunderclap headaches have been presumed by some workers to be a form of migraine (\u201ccrash migraine\u201d).

The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

            "content": "LP carries some risks if the CSF pressure is very high (evidenced mainly by headache and papilledema), for it increases the possibility of a fatal cerebellar or transtentorial herniation. The risk is considerable when there is an intracranial mass that distorts and displaces brain tissue, particularly asymmetric mass lesions near the tentorium or foramen magnum. The risk is much lower in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, in hydrocephalus with communication among all the ventricles, or with pseudotumor cerebri. Indeed, these are conditions in which repeated LPs may be employed as a therapeutic measure. In patients with purulent meningitis, there is also a small risk of herniation, but this is outweighed by the need for a definitive diagnosis and the institution of appropriate treatment at the earliest moment. With this last exception, LP should generally be preceded by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) whenever an elevation of intracranial pressure is"

            "content": "For the rapid diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral imaging occupies the foremost position (see Fig. 33-24). It is reliable in the detection of hemorrhages that are less than 1.0 cm in diameter. Very small pontine hemorrhages may be overlooked because of the artifact produced by adjacent bone. The spot sign on CT angiography has been mentioned above in relation to hematoma expansion. At the same time, coexisting hydrocephalus, tumor, cerebral swelling, and displacement of the intracranial contents are readily appreciated. MRI is particularly useful for demonstrating brainstem hemorrhages and residual hemorrhages, which remain visible long after they are no longer detectable on the CT (after 4 to 5 weeks). Hemosiderin and iron pigment have characteristic appearances, as described earlier and in Chap. 2."

The patient had no significant adverse effects from this dosage. At age 21, she had a second tonic-clonic seizure while in college; further discussion with her room-mate at that time revealed a history of two recent episodes of 1\u20132 minutes of altered consciousness with lip smacking (focal impaired awareness seizure, formerly complex partial seizure). A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid. Four days later, electroencephalography (EEG)"

            "content": "This tumor, mentioned earlier in the chapter, is situated over the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. As it grows, it may expand medially to involve structures in the wall of the cavernous sinus, anteriorly into the orbit, or laterally into the temporal bone. Fully 75 percent of such tumors occur in women, and the average age at onset is 50 years. Most prominent among the symptoms are a slowly developing unilateral exophthalmos, slight bulging of the bone in the temporal region, and radiologic evidence of thickening or erosion of the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. Variants of the clinical syndrome include anosmia; oculomotor palsies; painful ophthalmoplegia (sphenoidal fissure and Tolosa-Hunt syndromes; see Table 44-2); blindness and optic atrophy in one eye, sometimes with papilledema of the other eye (Foster Kennedy syndrome); mental changes; seizures (\u201cuncinate fits\u201d); and increased intracranial pressure. Rarely, a skull bruit can be heard over a highly vascular tumor. Sarcomas"

            "content": "It should be stated that, early in their evolution, tumors of the brain may exist with hardly any symptoms. A slight bewilderment, slowness in comprehension, or loss of capacity for sustained mental activity may be the only deviations from normal, and signs of focal cerebral disease are wholly lacking. On the other hand, there is in many patients with brain tumor an early indication of cerebral disease in the form of a progressive hemiparesis, a seizure, aphasia, or behavioral change such as disinhibition, occurring in a previously well person. In a third group, the existence of a brain tumor is apparent because of the presence of the signs of increased intracranial pressure such as relentless and morning headache, vomiting, diplopia, or intermittent visual blurring. In yet another group, the symptoms are so characteristic as to make it likely that not only is there an intracranial neoplasm, but that it is located in a particular region. These localized masses create certain syndromes"
