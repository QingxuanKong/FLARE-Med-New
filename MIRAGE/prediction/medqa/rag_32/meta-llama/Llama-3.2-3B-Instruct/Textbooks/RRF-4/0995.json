The patient's BMI is 33 kg/m^2, indicating that she is obese. Obesity is a risk factor for several complications during pregnancy, including placental abruption. Additionally, the patient's history of previous deliveries at 41 and 42 weeks' gestation, with one of them being the patient's current pregnancy, suggests that she may be at higher risk for postterm delivery complications. The patient's blood pressure is 110/80 mmHg, which is within the normal range. However, the patient's obesity and previous history of postterm delivery make her more susceptible to placental abruption. Therefore, the patient's child is at greatest risk for placental abruption.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

During pregnancy, a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg is considered to be abnormally elevated and is associated with an increase in perinatal morbidity and mortality. In all pregnant women, the measurement of blood pressure should be performed in the sitting position, because the lateral recumbent position may result in a blood pressure lower than that recorded in the sitting position. The diagnosis of hypertension requires the measurement of two elevated blood pressures at least 6 h apart. Hypertension during pregnancy is usually caused by preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, or renal disease."

For example, the percentage of fetuses born in 2009 whose birthweight exceeded 4000 g was 8.2 percent at 37 to 41 weeks and increased to 11.0 percent at 42 weeks or more (Martin, 2011).

            "content": "While we do not have the answers, we describe our strategies from Parkland Hospital as one approach to management. Our policies were developed in conjunction with the Division of Neonatal Medicine. Importantly, the decision not to perform cesarean delivery does not necessarily imply that care for the fetus is discounted. Neonatologists are consulted before delivery, and a trilateral discussion of survival and morbidity rates ensues with the woman and her family. A neonatologist attends each delivery and determines subsequent management. In our institution, traditional fetal indications for cesarean delivery are practiced in women at 25\u00b0/7 weeks or beyond. Cesarean delivery is not ofered for fetal indications before 24\u00b0/7 weeks. At 240r weeks, cesarean delivery is not ofered unless fetal weight is estimated at 750 g or greater. Aggressive obstetrical management is practiced in cases of growth restriction, wherein gestational age is used to guide management rather than fetal size."

Labor is defined as cervical dilation of 3 to 4 cm or more in the presence of uterine contractions. Management guidelines direct that a pelvic examination be performed approximately every 2 hours. Inefective labor is suspected when the cervix does not dilate within approximately 2 hours of admission. Amniotomy is then performed, and labor progress determined at the next 2-hour evaluation. In women whose labors do not progress, an intrauterine pressure catheter is placed to assess uterine function. Hypotonic contractions and no cervical dilation after an additional 2 to 3 hours result in stimulation of labor using the high-dose oxytocin regimen described in Chapter 26 (p. 509). The goal is uterine activity of 200 to 250 Montevideo units for 2 to 4 hours before dystocia can be diagnosed. If hypotonic contractions are strongly suspected, internal monitors may be placed with"
