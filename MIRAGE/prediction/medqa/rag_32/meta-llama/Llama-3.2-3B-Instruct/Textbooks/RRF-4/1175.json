    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking for the question: Step 1: Review the patient's symptoms and history The patient is a 27-year-old woman with recurrent wrist and neck pain for the last 2 months. She reports stiffness in the morning that improves as the day progresses. She denies any recent trauma or other inciting events. Family history is significant for a grandmother with fibromyalgia. Step 2: Consider the differential diagnosis Based on the patient's symptoms, the differential diagnosis for her condition could include rheumatoid arthritis (RA), fibromyalgia, and other inflammatory arthritis. Step 3: Evaluate the options for diagnosing the patient's condition A. Synovial fluid analysis: This would be most helpful for diagnosing conditions such as septic arthritis or crystal-induced arthritis, but it is not the best choice for diagnosing RA or fibromyalgia. B. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody: This is a specific antibody associated with RA. While it is a useful marker for RA, it is not the only marker and can be positive in other conditions. C. Rheumatoid factor: This is a nonspecific marker that can be positive in various inflammatory conditions, including RA and other autoimmune diseases. However, it is not specific for RA. D. X-ray of cervical spine: This would be most helpful for diagnosing conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis or cervical spine disorders, but it is not the best choice for diagnosing RA or fibromyalgia. Step 4: Consider the patient's symptoms and history in more detail The patient's symptoms of wrist and neck pain that improve with activity are more suggestive of fibromyalgia. The absence of systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or elevated inflammatory markers makes RA less likely. Conclusion: Based on the patient's symptoms and history, option D. X-ray of cervical spine would be the most helpful for diagnosing her condition. Here is the output in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms of wrist and neck pain that improve with activity are more suggestive of fibromyalgia. The absence of systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or elevated inflammatory markers makes RA less likely. An X-ray of the cervical spine would be the most helpful for diagnosing her condition, as it can rule out other conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis or cervical spine disorders.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid. Four days later, electroencephalography (EEG)"

Fibromyalgia is a common, yet poorly understood, type of myofascial pain syndrome. Patients complain of severe muscle pain and tenderness and have specific painful trigger points, sleep disturbances, and easy fatigability. Serum creatine kinase (CK), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), electromyography (EMG), and muscle biopsy are normal (Chap. 396). Polymyalgia rheumatica occurs mainly in patients >50 years and is characterized by stiffness and pain in the shoulders, lower back, hips, and thighs (Chap. 385). The ESR is elevated, while serum CK, EMG, and muscle biopsy are normal. Temporal arteritis, an inflammatory FIgURE 462e-3 Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy with prominent scapular winging."

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

This subject is mentioned briefly in other sections of this book in relation to back and extremity pain (see Chap. 10) and to temporal arteritis, to which it is closely connected (see Chap. 9). The muscular soreness may be diffuse or asymmetrical, particularly in the proximal arms and shoulders. Every movement is reported as stiff and painful. The periarticular tissues and their muscular attachments are affected primarily and may be tender, but this is difficult to interpret, because tenderness in these regions may be found in healthy individuals. The sedimentation rate is elevated in the majority of patients, and a 48-h trial of prednisone, by completely alleviating muscle pain, confirms the diagnosis. In the context of muscle pain, systemic symptoms such as weight loss, headache, and fatigue, as well as mild anemia, are particularly suggestive of"
