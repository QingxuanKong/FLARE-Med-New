The patient's older brother died at age 13 from heart failure and his 6-year-old nephew currently has severe muscle weakness. Genetic testing in the patient's family shows that his mother is not a carrier of the mutation that is responsible for the disease in his relatives. A pedigree chart of the patient's family is shown.

This suggests an inherited disorder that affects the heart and muscle.\\n\\nThe pedigree chart shows that the patient's mother is not a carrier of the mutation responsible for the disease in his relatives. This information is crucial in determining the possible explanations for the patient not being affected.\\n\\nVariable expressivity (A) refers to the phenomenon where individuals with the same genotype exhibit different levels of phenotype expression. However, this does not explain why the patient is not affected if he has the same genotype as his affected relatives.\\n\\nMaternal uniparental disomy (B) occurs when a person receives two copies of a chromosome from the mother and none from the father. This can result in an individual being affected even if neither parent is a carrier of the disease-causing mutation. However, the pedigree chart does not support this possibility, as the patient's mother is not a carrier.\\n\\nGonadal mosaicism (C) refers to the presence of cells with a mutation in the reproductive cells (sperm or egg) but not in the somatic cells. This can result in an individual being affected while their parents are not carriers. The pedigree chart does not provide information about the patient's reproductive history, but we can infer that the mutation is likely to be X-linked, given the symptoms of heart failure and muscle weakness in the male relatives.\\n\\nIncomplete penetrance (D) refers to the phenomenon where individuals with a certain genotype do not express the associated phenotype. This could explain why the patient is not affected if he has the same genotype as his affected relatives, but it does not explain why the patient is not affected if he has a different genotype.\\n\\nGiven the information provided, the most likely explanation for the patient not being affected is gonadal mosaicism. The patient's mother is not a carrier of the mutation, but it is possible that the mutation occurred in the patient's reproductive cells (sperm or egg) and resulted in an affected son (the patient's brother) and an affected grandson (the 6-year-old nephew). The patient, being a daughter, would not be affected unless he inherited the mutated sperm.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Gonadal mosaicism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

In this example, the proband, a 36-year-old woman (IV-1), has a strong history of breast and ovarian cancer on the paternal side of her family. The early age of onset and the co-occurrence of breast and ovarian cancer in this family suggest the possibility of an inherited mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. It is unclear however, without genetic testing, whether her father harbors such a mutation and transmitted it to her. After appropriate genetic counseling of the pro-band and her family, the most informative and cost-effective approach to DNA analysis in this family is to test the cancer-affected 42-year-old living cousin for the presence of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. If a mutation is found, then it is possible to test for this particular alteration in other family members, if they so desire.

In contrast, mtDNA point mutations or duplications can be transmitted down the maternal line. Accordingly, the father of an affected individual has no risk of harboring the disease-causing mutation, and a male cannot transmit the mtDNA mutation to his offspring. In contrast, the mother of an affected individual usually harbors the same mutation but might be completely asymptomatic.

            "content": "The clustering of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy within families has been appreciated since recognition of the disease approximately 55 years ago. Echocardiographic screening of families revealed an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Initial genetic studies using linkage analysis in large families identified disease-causing mutations in sarcomeric genes. A sarcomere mutation is present in ~60% of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and is more common in those with familial disease and characteristic asymmetric septal hypertrophy. More than nine different sarcomere genes with over 1400 mutations have been implicated, although ~80% of patients have a mutation in either MYH7 or MYBPC3 (Table 287-3), most of which are unique to individual families (\u201cprivate\u201d mutations)."

True or false: Withdrawing a nonbeneficial treatment is ethically similar to withholding a nonindicated one. When can a physician refuse to continue treating a patient on the grounds of futility? An eight-year-old child is in a serious accident. She requires emergent transfusion, but her parents are not present. Conditions in which confidentiality must be overridden. Involuntary commitment or isolation for medical treatment may be undertaken for what reason? A 10-year-old child presents in status epilepticus, but her parents refuse treatment on religious grounds. A son asks that his mother not be told about her recently discovered cancer. False. Patients may change their minds at any time. Exceptions to the requirement of informed consent include emergency situations and patients without decision-making capacity."

            "content": "The investigation of a suspected case of mitochondrial disease begins with an exploration of the family history for unusual childhood diseases including neonatal death, unexplained seizure disorders, and progressive neurologic deficits of the types already described. Unexplained deafness or diabetes in family members might also raise the level of suspicion of a mitochondrial disorder. The diagnosis should be suspected when a disorder with these characteristics occurs in a pattern that indicates maternal inheritance. However, one encounters families with mendelian patterns of inheritance due to nuclear gene defects as described in the introductory section of this chapter. Commercial tests are available for the more frequent mitochondrial point mutation sites (3243, 8993, and 8344) in leukocytes. Detection of deletions requires analysis of muscle tissue. They are useful for diagnosis but reveal abnormalities in only a modest number, estimated to be approximately 15 percent of cases that"

They are initiated by autophosphorylation of select tyrosine residues in their receptors. C. They are mediated by binding to adrenergic receptors, which are a class of nuclear receptors. D. They result in the activation of glycogen and triacylglycerol synthesis. Q3. NE bound to certain receptors causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. Why might NE be used clinically in the treatment of septic shock? Case 5: Sun Sensitivity Patient Presentation: AZ is a 6-year-old boy who is being evaluated for freckle-like areas of hyperpigmentation on his face, neck, forearms, and lower legs. Focused History: AZ\u2019s father reports that the boy has always been quite sensitive to the sun. His skin turns red (erythema) and his eyes hurt (photophobia) if he is exposed to the sun for any period of time."
