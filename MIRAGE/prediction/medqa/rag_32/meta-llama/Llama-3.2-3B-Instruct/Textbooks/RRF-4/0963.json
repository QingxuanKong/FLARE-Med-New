His pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Further evaluation shows a systemic vascular resistance of 35 mm Hg \u00d7 min/L with an end-systolic volume of 80 mL. Which of the following describes the ejection fraction in this patient?",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To calculate the ejection fraction (EF) of the patient, we need to know the stroke volume (SV) and the end-diastolic volume (EDV). The formula for ejection fraction is: EF = (SV / EDV) x 100 We are given the end-systolic volume (ESV), which is the volume of blood left in the ventricle at the end of systole, but we are not directly given the stroke volume (SV). However, we can calculate SV using the following formula: SV = SVR x EDV / (Pulse x 73) Where SVR is systemic vascular resistance, EDV is end-diastolic volume, and pulse is the heart rate. First, let's calculate SVR in dynes/cm5 (1 mmHg = 13.6 dynes/cm5): SVR = 35 mmHg x (13.6 dynes/cm5/mmHg) = 476 dynes/cm5 Now, we need to convert the pulse from beats per minute (bpm) to beats per second (bpm): 100 bpm / 60 s/min = 1.67 beats/s Now we can calculate SV: SV = 476 dynes/cm5 x 80 mL / (1.67 beats/s x 73 cm3/L) = 11.55 mL Now that we have SV, we can calculate EF: EF = (SV / EDV) x 100 = (11.55 mL / 80 mL) x 100 = 14.44% Rounding to the nearest whole number, the ejection fraction is approximately 14%. The closest answer choice is B.",

His heart fail-ure must be treated first, followed by careful control of the hypertension. He was initially treated with a diuretic (furo-semide, 40 mg twice daily). On this therapy, he was less short of breath on exertion and could also lie flat without dyspnea. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhib-itor was added (enalapril, 20 mg twice daily), and over the next few weeks, he continued to feel better. Because of continued shortness of breath on exercise, digoxin at 0.25 mg/d was added with a further modest improvement in exercise tolerance. The blood pressure stabilized at 150/90 mm Hg, and the patient will be educated regarding the relation between his hypertension and heart failure and the need for better blood pressure control. Cautious addition of a \u03b2 blocker (metoprolol) will be considered. Blood lipids, which are currently in the normal range, will be monitored."

Resistant hypertension may be related to \u201cpseudoresistance\u201d (high office blood pressures and lower home blood pressures), nonadherence to therapy, identifiable causes of hypertension (including obesity and excessive alcohol intake), and the use of any of a number of nonprescription and prescription drugs (Table 298-3).

In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, a small, nonprogressive increase in the serum creatinine concentration may occur. This generally reflects a hemodynamic response, not structural renal injury, indicating that intraglomerular pressure has been reduced. Blood pressure control should not be allowed to deteriorate in order to prevent the modest creatinine rise. Among older patients with isolated systolic hypertension, further lowering of diastolic blood pressure does not result in harm. However, relatively little information is available concerning the risk-versusbenefit ratio of antihypertensive therapy in individuals >80 years of age, and in this population, gradual blood pressure reduction to a less aggressive target level of control may be appropriate."

Current clinical criteria for defining hypertension generally are based on the average of two or more seated blood pressure readings during each of two or more outpatient visits. A recent classification recommends blood pressure criteria for defining normal blood pressure, prehypertension, hypertension (stages I and II), and isolated systolic hypertension, which is frequent among the elderly (Table 298-1). In children and adolescents, hypertension generally is defined as systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure consistently >95th percentile for age, sex, and height. Blood pressures between the 90th Blood Pressure Classification Systolic, mmHg Diastolic, mmHg Source: Adapted from AV Chobanian et al: JAMA 289:2560, 2003. and 95th percentiles are considered prehypertensive and are an indication for lifestyle interventions."

The hydrostatic pressure in postcapillary venules is approximately 20 mm Hg, and it decreases to approximately 0 mm Hg in the thoracic venae cavae and right atrium. Hydrostatic pressure in the thoracic venae cavae and right atrium is also termed central venous pressure. Veins are very distensible and have very low resistance to blood flow. Such low resistance allows movement of blood from Consider that the arterial blood pressure is being measured in a patient whose blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. The pressure (represented by the oblique line) in a cuff around the patient\u2019s arm is allowed to fall from greater than 120 mm Hg (point B) to below 80 mm Hg (point C) in about 6 seconds."

            "content": "Depression of myocardial function, manifested as increased end-diastolic and systolic ventricular volumes with a decreased ejection fraction, develops within 24 h in most patients with severe sepsis. Cardiac output is maintained despite the low ejection fraction because ventricular dilation permits a normal stroke volume. In survivors, myocardial function returns to normal over several days. Although myocardial dysfunction may contribute to hypotension, refractory hypotension is usually due to low systemic vascular resistance, and 1755 death most often results from refractory shock or the failure of multiple organs rather than from cardiac dysfunction per se."

Therefore, they should be carried out only if the results can be expected to modify the patient\u2019s management. The prevention of heart disease, especially of CAD, is one of the most important tasks of primary care health givers as well as cardiologists. Prevention begins with risk assessment, followed by attention to lifestyle, such as achieving optimal weight, physical activity, and smoking cessation, and then aggressive treatment of all abnormal risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (Chap. 417). After a complete diagnosis has been established in patients with known heart disease, a number of management options are usually available. Several examples may be used to demonstrate some of the 1441 principles of cardiovascular therapeutics: 1."

CXR, MRI, and cardiac catheterization may be helpful, but echocardiography is key to diagnosis and reveals rapid early filling with a normal or near-normal EF. Cardiac biopsy may reveal fibrosis or evidence of infiltration. ECG frequently shows LBBB. Therapeutic options are limited and generally are palliative only. Medical treatment includes cautious use of diuretics for \ufb02uid overload, vasodilators to \u2193 filling pressure, and anticoagulation if not contraindicated. Major risk factors for CAD include age, male gender, hyperlipidemia, DM, hypertension, obesity, a family history, and smoking. The classic triad of angina consists of substernal chest pain that is provoked by exertion and relieved by rest or nitrates."
