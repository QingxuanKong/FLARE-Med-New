Her medical history is remarkable for iron deficiency, for which she is on ferrous sulfate. The patient has also experienced intermittent episodes of mild diarrhea, previously diagnosed as lactose intolerance. Her height is at the 30th percentile and weight is at the 25th percentile for age and sex. An immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase titer is 5 times the upper limit of normal.

The patient presents with intensely pruritic lesions over her buttocks, which have worsened over time. She also has a history of iron deficiency, lactose intolerance, and elevated IgA tissue transglutaminase titer, which is 5 times the upper limit of normal. These symptoms and test results are highly suggestive of celiac disease, a condition where the ingestion of gluten leads to an immune response and damage to the small intestine. The patient's symptoms of pruritic lesions and diarrhea are consistent with celiac disease, which can cause skin rashes and gastrointestinal symptoms. The elevated IgA tissue transglutaminase titer further supports this diagnosis, as it is a specific marker for celiac disease. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is celiac disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Which of the eicosanoid agonists have been demonstrated to reduce both morbidity and mortality in patients with such a diagnosis? What are the modes of action? A 40-year-old woman presented to her doctor with a 6-month history of increasing shortness of breath. This was associated with poor appetite and ankle swell-ing. On physical examination, she had elevated jugular venous distention, a soft tricuspid regurgitation murmur, clear lungs, and mild peripheral edema. An echocardio-gram revealed tricuspid regurgitation, severely elevated"

A variety of other cutaneous manifestations have been described, including erythematous macular lesions, nonthrombocytopenic purpura, subcutaneous nodules, and hyperkeratosis. miscellaneous sites Thyroid, renal, testicular, epididymal, gallbladder, skeletal muscle, and bone marrow involvement have all been described. In fact, almost any organ can be involved in classic Whipple\u2019s disease, with varying frequency, variable combinations, and myriad signs and symptoms. As a result, Whipple\u2019s disease should be considered in the setting of a chronic multisystemic process. Despite its rarity, the combination of rheumatologic and intestinal disease with weight loss, with or without neurologic and cardiac involvement, warrants heightened suspicion."

Alternatively, the symptoms of celiac disease may first become evident at almost any age throughout adulthood. In many patients, frequent spontaneous remissions and exacerbations occur. The symptoms range from significant malabsorption of multiple nutrients, with diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss, and the consequences of nutrient depletion (i.e., anemia and metabolic bone disease), to the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms despite evidence of the depletion of a single nutrient (e.g., iron or folate deficiency, osteomalacia, edema from protein loss). Asymptomatic relatives of patients with celiac disease have been identified as having this disease either by small-intestinal biopsy or by serologic studies (e.g.,"

Characteristically, 1-to 6-cm tender, red, warm nodules and plaques develop rapidly on the extensor surface of the legs and arms. Within a few days, lesions flatten and undergo the color evolution of a bruise-from dark red and purple to yellow green. Constitutional symptoms may also be present. Initial evaluation and treatment focuses on the underlying etiology. Symptoms spontaneously resolve in 1 to 6 weeks without scarring but may leave residual hyperpigmentation (Acosta, 2013). his lesion is frequently seen in pregnancy (Fig. 62-4).
