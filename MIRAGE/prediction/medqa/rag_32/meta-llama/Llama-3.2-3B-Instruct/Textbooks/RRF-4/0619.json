    "question": "Eight weeks after starting a new weight-loss medication, a 43-year-old woman with obesity comes to the physician because of greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, and flatulence. She also complains of progressively worsening night-time vision. She has had no fever, chills, or vomiting. Physical examination shows dry, scaly skin on her extremities and face. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of action of the drug she is taking?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Stimulation of monoamine neurotransmitter release",
        "B": "Inhibition of serotonin reuptake",
        "C": "Stimulation of norepinephrine release",
        "D": "Inhibition of lipase"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break down the patient's symptoms and potential side effects of weight-loss medications. The patient presents with greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, and flatulence, which are gastrointestinal side effects often associated with medications that affect gut motility or fat absorption. The patient also complains of progressively worsening night-time vision, dry, scaly skin on her extremities and face, and has lost a significant amount of weight. Considering these symptoms, the most likely mechanism of action of the weight-loss medication is related to fat absorption or gastrointestinal motility. Let's evaluate the options: A. Stimulation of monoamine neurotransmitter release: This mechanism is more commonly associated with antidepressants, such as SSRIs or MAOIs, which are not typically linked to gastrointestinal side effects like diarrhea and flatulence. B. Inhibition of serotonin reuptake: This mechanism is also related to antidepressants, such as SSRIs, which are not commonly associated with the gastrointestinal side effects described. C. Stimulation of norepinephrine release: This mechanism is related to certain anorexiant medications, such as phentermine, which can cause gastrointestinal side effects like diarrhea and dry mouth. However, the patient's symptoms, especially the skin changes, are not typical of phentermine. D. Inhibition of lipase: This mechanism is associated with orlistat, a lipase inhibitor used for weight loss. Orlistat can cause gastrointestinal side effects like greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, and flatulence due to malabsorption of fats. The patient's skin changes, particularly the dry, scaly skin, are also consistent with orlistat use. Based on the patient's symptoms, the most likely mechanism of action of the weight-loss medication is inhibition of lipase, which is characteristic of orlistat. Here is the output in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, and flatulence, which are gastrointestinal side effects often associated with medications that affect gut motility or fat absorption.

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

Although the vast majority of cases of obesity can be attributed to behavioral factors that affect diet and physical activity patterns, the history may suggest secondary causes that merit further evaluation. Disorders to consider include polycystic ovarian syndrome, hypothyroidism, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, and hypothalamic disease. Drug-induced weight gain also should be considered. Common causes include medications for diabetes (insulin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones); steroid hormones; psychotropic agents; mood stabilizers (lithium); antidepressants (tricyclics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, paroxetine, mirtazapine); and antiepileptic drugs (valproate, gabapentin, carbamazepine). Other medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium channel blockers, may cause peripheral edema but do not increase body fat."

A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen.

While none of the latter manifestations is specific for any one condition, any of them can suggest a particular diagnosis. A history of arthralgias and myalgias predating jaundice suggests hepatitis, either viral or drug-related. Jaundice associated with the sudden onset of severe right-upper-quadrant pain and shaking chills suggests choledocholithiasis and ascending cholangitis."
