    "question": "A mother brings her 18-year-old daughter to your office because she has not menstruated yet. They recently immigrated from another country, and do not have any previous medical records. The adolescent girl looks relatively short, but otherwise looks healthy. She has no complaints except for mild intermittent lower abdominal pain for the past year. On physical examination, vitals are within normal limits. There is the presence of axillary hair, breast development, and pubic hair at Tanner stage 5. You explain to the mother and the patient that you need to perform a complete vaginal examination, however, both of them declined the procedure and would prefer that lab test be performed. Her labs are significant for the following:\nFSH 7 mIU/mL\nNormal values:  \n   Follicular phase 3.1 \u2013 7.9 mIU/mL\n   Ovulation peak 2.3 \u2013 18.5 mIU/mL\n   Luteal phase 1.4 \u2013 5.5 mIU/mL\n   Postmenopausal 30.6 \u2013 106.3 mIU/mL\nEstradiol 28 pg/mL\nNormal values:  \n   Mid-follicular phase 27 \u2013 123 pg/mL\n   Periovulatory 96 \u2013 436 pg/mL\n   Mid-luteal phase 49 \u2013 294 pg/mL\n   Postmenopausal 0 \u2013 40 pg/mL\nTestosterone 52 ng/dL, 40 \u2013 60 ng/dL\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results step by step. 1. The patient is an 18-year-old girl who has not menstruated yet, which is a key indicator of primary amenorrhea. She also has axillary hair, breast development, and pubic hair at Tanner stage 5, indicating precocious puberty. 2. The laboratory results show elevated FSH levels (7 mIU/mL) in the follicular phase, which is higher than the normal range (3.1 - 7.9 mIU/mL). This suggests that the ovaries are not responding to FSH, which is a characteristic of ovarian failure. 3. The estradiol level is normal (28 pg/mL), which does not provide any additional information in this case. 4. The testosterone level is elevated (52 ng/dL), which is above the normal range (40 - 60 ng/dL). Elevated testosterone levels can be seen in androgen-secreting tumors, but in the context of elevated FSH, it is more likely related to ovarian failure. 5. The patient's physical examination findings of axillary hair, breast development, and pubic hair at Tanner stage 5 are consistent with precocious puberty, but the elevated FSH levels suggest that the ovaries are not responding to FSH, which is a characteristic of ovarian failure. 6. Based on the combination of elevated FSH levels, normal estradiol levels, and elevated testosterone levels, the most likely diagnosis is ovarian failure, which can be caused by various factors such as Turner syndrome, premature ovarian failure, or ovarian dysgenesis. 7. Among the options provided, Turner syndrome (C) is the most likely diagnosis. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects females, characterized by ovarian dysgenesis, which leads to ovarian failure and elevated FSH levels. The patient's short stature and precocious puberty are also consistent with Turner syndrome. 8. Muellerian agenesis (A) is a condition where the M\u00fcllerian ducts fail to develop, leading to absent or underdeveloped female reproductive organs. However, it is not consistent with the patient's elevated FSH levels and precocious puberty. 9. Hyperprolactinemia (B) is a condition characterized by elevated prolactin levels, which is not supported by the patient's laboratory results. 10. Androgen insensitivity (D) is a condition where the body is resistant to androgens, which is not consistent with the patient's elevated testosterone levels. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Turner syndrome (C).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

Samples should not be drawn soon after the patient awakes or after procedures. Prolactin is secreted in a pulsatile fashion with a pulse frequency ranging from about 14 pulses per 24 hours in the late follicular phase to about 9 pulses per 24 hours in the late luteal phase. There also is a diurnal variation, with the lowest levels occurring in midmorning. Levels rise 1 hour after the onset of sleep and continue to rise until peak values are reached between 5 and 7 a.m. (256,257). The pulse amplitude of prolactin appears to increase from early to late follicular and luteal phases (258\u2013260). Because of the variability of secretion and inherent limitations of radioimmunoassay, an elevated level should always be rechecked.

The lower limit of progesterone levels in the luteal phase varies among laboratories, but a level above 3 ng/mL (10 nmol/L) typically confirms ovulation. However, interpretation of isolated luteal-phase measurements of serum progesterone is complicated by the frequent pulses that characterize the secretion of this hormone. Although ovulatory levels are often considerably higher than 3 ng/mL, low midluteal serum levels of progesterone are not necessarily diagnostic of anovulation (124)."

After 100 \u03bcg GnRH, an LH peak of greater than 15 mIU/mL is suggestive of gonadotropin-dependent precocious puberty (68). Perhaps the most difficult decision for the gynecologist is determining how much evaluation is warranted for the young girl brought in by her mother for precocious breast budding only (precocious thelarche) or the appearance of pubic or axillary hair alone (precocious pubarche or adrenarche) (Fig. 29.17). In such cases, it is acceptable to many clinicians to follow the patient at frequent intervals and to proceed with evaluation if there is evidence of pubertal progression. The feasibility of this approach may depend on the concerns of the parents."

Ovulatory Dysfunction In women with a history of regular menstrual cycles, evidence of ovulation should be sought (Chap. 412). Even in the presence of ovulatory cycles, evaluation of ovarian reserve is recommended for women age >35 years if they are interested in fertility. Measurement of FSH on day 3 of the cycle (an FSH level <10 IU/ mL on cycle day 3 predicts adequate ovarian oocyte reserve) is the most cost-effective test. Other tests include measurement of FSH in response to clomiphene citrate (blocks estrogen negative feedback on FSH), antral follicle count on ultrasound, and anti-m\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH; <0.5 ng/mL predicts reduced ovarian reserve although there is variability between labs)."

Unfortunately, the characteristic pulsatile secretion of progesterone during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle combines with wide temporal variations (even within a 60-to 90-minute time span) to make interpretation of midlueal progesterone levels difficult (258). Similar rates of shortened luteal phase are found in fertile and infertile women, and there is significant variability of luteal phase length from cycle to cycle in an individual woman (261). Finally, there is significant interobserver variability in pathologic interpretation of endometrial biopsies from infertile women, and out-of-phase biopsy results"

If a patient still has some menstrual cycles, it is advisable to obtain the prolactin level in the follicular phase. Assessment of serum FSH levels is required to determine whether the patient has hypergonadotropic, hypogonadotropic, or eugonadotropic amenorrhea. A circulating FSH level of greater than 25 to 40 mIU/mL indicated on at least two blood samples is indicative of hypergonadotropic amenorrhea. Hypergonadotropism implies that the cause of amenorrhea is ovarian insufficiency. The history should establish whether the cause of ovarian insufficiency is chemotherapy or radiation therapy."

The two most common sources of androgen-secreting tumors are the adrenal glands and the ovaries. To assess the symptoms, serum and urine tests for androgens and their metabolites should be obtained along with modern abdominal imaging techniques such as CT, MRI, and ultrasound scans (194). In prepubertal girls, virilizing tumors may cause signs of heterosexual precocious puberty in addition to hirsutism, acne, and virilization. In patients suspected of harboring an adrenal or ovarian tumor because of rapidly progressing or severe hyperandrogenism, the bioavailable testosterone level (free testosterone level above 6.85 pg/mL; 23.6 pmol/L), followed by an11-desoxycortisol (above 7 ng/mL; 20.2 nmol/L), DHEAS (>3.6 \u03bcg/mL) and a 24-hour urinary cortisol (>45 \u03bcg per day) are the most sensitive and specific"

The ectopic pregnancy site and hCG level do not correlate (112). Many patients in whom the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is being considered are uncertain about their menstrual dates. A single hCG level may be useful when measured by sensitive enzyme immunoassays that, if negative, exclude a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Measurement of a single level may be helpful in predicting pregnancy outcome after timed conceptions using advanced reproductive technology. If the hCG level is more than 300 mIU/mL on day 16 to 18 after artificial insemination, there is an 88% chance of a live birth (113). If the hCG level is less than 300 mIU/mL, the chance of a live birth is only 22%.

Event 8: Rising levels of progesterone, estrogen, and inhibin A by the mature corpus luteum negatively feed back on pituitary gonadotropes. Even though estradiol levels exceed the 200-pg/mL threshold for positive feedback, the high progesterone levels now produced by the corpus luteum block any positive feedback of estradiol. Consequently both FSH and LH levels decline to basal levels (see Fig. 44.23B , Mid-Luteal Phase)."

Therefore, the definition of primary amenorrhea changed: Primary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses by 13 years of age when there is no visible development of secondary sexual characteristics or by 15 years of age in the presence of normal secondary sexual characteristics. The ages defining primary amenorrhea were decreased by 1 year to continue to represent two standard deviations above the mean age of developing secondary sexual characteristics and menses (1). Failure to begin breast development by age 13 warrants investigation. A woman who previously menstruated can develop secondary amenorrhea, which is defined as absence of menstruation for three normal menstrual cycles (2). A woman with regular cycles and a delay of menses of even a week may warrant assessment with a pregnancy test. It is reasonable to evaluate a woman who has fewer than nine cycles per year.

Commercially available kits for documenting the LH surge are generally accurate, quick, convenient, and relatively inexpensive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) that use 35 to 50 mIU/mL as their threshold for detection (132,133). Once the LH surge is detected, ovulation may occur within the next 48 hours (32,132,133). The positive-predictive and negative-predictive values for these kits have been described to be 92% and 95%, respectively (132,134). Because the duration of the surge may be less than 12 hours, twice daily testing may increase detection rates (133). However, the 2 days of highest probability of conception are the day of and the day prior to the LH surge, so this may actually lead to abstaining from intercourse during a potentially fertile time (127).

For example, Cole and associates (201i1) found that a detection limit of 12.5 mIU/mL would be required to diagnose 95 percent of pregnancies at the time of missed menses, but they reported that only one brand had this degree of sensitivity. Two other brands gave false-positive or invalid results. In fact, with an hCG concentration of 100 mIU/mL, clearly positive results were displayed by only 44 percent of brands. Accordingly, only about 15 percent of pregnancies could be diagnosed at the time of the missed menses. Some manufacturers of even newer home urine assays claim >99-percent accuracy of tests done on the day of-and some up to 4 days before-the expected day of menses. Again, careful analysis"
