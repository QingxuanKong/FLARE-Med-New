The patient\u2019s mother says that the patient was recently in northern Maine and spent most of her time during the trip outdoors.

These symptoms, combined with the patient's recent outdoor activities in northern Maine, suggest a tick-borne illness. The rash is characteristic of erythema migrans, which is a common symptom of Lyme disease. The patient's symptoms of facial paralysis and decreased taste sensation are also consistent with Lyme disease. Therefore, the most likely organism responsible for this patient's illness is Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"} Note: The other options are not correct because: * B. Tsetse fly is the vector for trypanosomiasis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. * C. Culicidae refers to the family of mosquitoes, which is not the vector for Lyme disease. * D. Anopheles refers to the genus of mosquitoes that transmit malaria, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.",

This peripheral nerve injury is characterized by an asymmetric crying face whose normal side, including the forehead, moves in a regular manner. The affected side is flaccid, the eye does not close, the nasolabial fold is absent, and the side of the mouth droops at rest. If there is a central injury to the facial nerve, only the lower two thirds of the face (not the forehead) are involved. Complete agenesis of the facial nucleus results in a central facial paralysis; when this is bilateral, as in M\u00f6bius syndrome, the face appears expressionless."

She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

In most cases, facial weakness is the initial manifestation, appearing as an inability to smile, whistle, or fully close the eyes. Weakness of the shoulder girdles, rather than the facial muscles, usually brings the patient to medical attention. Loss of scapular stabilizer muscles makes arm elevation difficult. Scapular winging (Fig. 462e-3) becomes apparent with attempts at abduction and forward movement of the arms. Biceps and triceps muscles may be severely affected, with relative sparing of the deltoid muscles. Weakness is invariably worse for wrist extension than for wrist flexion, and weakness of the anterior compartment muscles of the legs may lead to footdrop."

In other cases, ptosis of the eyelids and thinness and slackness of the facial muscles may be the earliest signs, preceding other muscular involvement by many years. Atrophy of the masseters leads to narrowing of the lower half of the face, and the mandible is slender and malpositioned so that the teeth do not occlude properly. This, along with the ptosis, frontal baldness, and wrinkled forehead, imparts a distinctive appearance that, once seen, can be recognized at a glance (\u201chatchet\u201d face).

First, in recording observations, it is important to describe what is found rather than to apply a poorly defined medical term (e.g., \u201cpatient groans to sternal rub\u201d rather than \u201cobtunded\u201d). Second, subtle CNS abnormalities are best detected by carefully comparing a patient\u2019s performance on tasks that require simultaneous activation of both cerebral hemispheres (e.g., eliciting a pronator drift of an outstretched arm with the eyes closed; extinction on one side of bilaterally applied light touch, also with eyes closed; or decreased arm swing or a slight asymmetry when walking). Third, if the patient\u2019s complaint is brought on by some activity, reproduce the activity in the office. If the complaint is of dizziness when the head is turned in one direction, have the patient do this and also look for associated signs on examination (e.g., nystagmus or dysmetria).

            "content": "We have had experience with patients who had this syndrome following parvovirus B19 infection, as has been cited in the literature. Most cases had been preceded within days by an erythematous rash spreading from the limbs to the trunk and face, somewhat similar to the eruption of fifths disease caused by this virus in children. One of our patients had no premonitory features, but her child had just recovered from fifth disease (parvovirus) by the pediatrician. Some reported patients have had preceding influenza-like symptoms and adenopathy as well. A summary of cases that have appeared in the literature can be found in the paper by Maas and coworkers. Duchowny and colleagues described a patient in whom a typical brachial neuritis occurred as part of a febrile illness that proved to be caused by a CMV infection and the same has been observed (albeit rarely) in patients with HIV. A few outbreaks of brachial neuritis have been recorded and prompted the suggestion that the Coxsackievirus"

What are two potential treatment options for her possible chlamydial infection? How does her potential pregnancy affect the treatment decision? A 22-year-old woman presents to her college medical clinic complaining of a 2-week history of vaginal discharge. She denies any fever or abdominal pain but does report vaginal bleeding after sexual intercourse. When questioned about her sexual activity, she reports having vaginal intercourse, at times unprotected, with two men in the last 6 months. A pelvic examination is performed and is positive for muco-purulent discharge from the endocervical canal. No cervical"

            "content": "The onset of Bell\u2019s palsy is acute; about one-half of cases attain maximum paralysis in 48 h and practically all within 3 or 4 days. Pain behind the ear may precede the paralysis by a day or two and in a few patients is intense and persistent. Although a report by the patient of fullness or numbness in the face is common, in a small number there is hypesthesia in 1 or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. The explanation of this finding is not clear. Impairment of taste is present in most patients but it rarely persists beyond the second week of paralysis. This indicates that the lesion has extended proximal to the point at which the chorda tympani joins the facial nerve. Hyperacusis or distortion of sound is then experienced in the ipsilateral ear and, as mentioned, indicates paralysis of the stapedius muscle."

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"
