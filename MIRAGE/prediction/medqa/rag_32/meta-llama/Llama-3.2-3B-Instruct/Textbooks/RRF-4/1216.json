    "question": "A 46-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after being involved in a motor vehicle collision where he was the unrestrained driver. On arrival, he is unconscious. His respirations are 24/min, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg, and pulse is 141/min and irregularly irregular. Examination shows multiple ecchymoses over the chest. There is a 3-cm (1.2-in) laceration over the abdomen and a 4-cm (1.6-in) laceration over the scalp. Jugular venous pressure is increased. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft. Two large bore intravenous catheters are inserted and 0.9% saline infusion is begun. Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) is negative. An electrocardiogram shows absent p-waves. After 5 minutes, his pulse is 160/min and palpable systolic blood pressure is 50 mm Hg. Vasopressors are administered. One hour later, the patient dies.

The patient's history of trauma and the absence of other clear explanations for the hypotension make cardiac tamponade a likely diagnosis. The patient's death shortly after receiving vasopressors suggests that the tamponade was severe and unresponsive to initial treatment. The absence of a clear source of bleeding on the FAST exam and the lack of other obvious injuries make cardiac tamponade a more likely explanation for the patient's condition than other options such as hemothorax, aortic dissection, or pulmonary contusion. The electrocardiogram showing absent P-waves also supports the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade, as it can be a sign of cardiac compression by the accumulated fluid in the pericardial sac.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

First it must be determined whether the patient is breathing and has a clear airway and obtainable pulse and blood pressure, and whether there is hemorrhage from a scalp laceration or injured viscera. Severe head injuries that arrest respiration are soon followed by cessation of cardiac function. Injuries of this magnitude are often fatal; if resuscitative measures do not restore and sustain cardiopulmonary function within 4 to 5 min, the brain is usually irreparably damaged. Bleeding from the scalp can usually be controlled by a pressure bandage unless an artery is divided; then a suture becomes necessary. Resuscitative measures (artificial respiration and cardiac compression) should be continued until they are taken over by ambulance personnel. Oxygen should then be administered."

He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?"

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

            "content": "tamponade. Blunt cardiac rupture, a rare event in trauma vic-tims who survive long enough to reach the hospital, can produce refractory shock and tamponade in the multiply-injured patient. The manifestations of cardiac tamponade, such as total circula-tory collapse and cardiac arrest, may be catastrophic, or they may be more subtle. A high index of suspicion is warranted to make a rapid diagnosis. Patients who present with circulatory arrest from cardiac tamponade require emergency pericardial decompression, usually through a left thoracotomy. The indi-cations for this maneuver are discussed in Chapter 7. Cardiac tamponade also may be associated with dyspnea, orthopnea, cough, peripheral edema, chest pain, tachycardia, muffled heart tones, jugular venous distention, and elevated central venous pressure. Beck\u2019s triad consists of hypotension, muffled heart tones, and neck vein distention. Unfortunately, absence of these clinical findings may not be sufficient to exclude cardiac injury"

To remember the Glasgow Coma Scale, think 4-eyes, Jackson-5, V6 engine. Four points can be assigned for eye response, five points for verbal response, and six points for motor response. Patients with chest trauma and shock may have cardiac tamponade. The relevant signs are JVD, hypotension, and muf\ufb02ed heart sounds. This can be diagnosed with bedside ultrasound. If tamponade is diagnosed, an immediate pericardiocentesis is necessary. Disability/Exposure: Disability (CNS dysfunction) is assessed and quantified with the GCS. Exposure requires that the patient be completely disrobed and assessed for injury and temperature status on both the front and back of the body. Hypothermia is a common problem in trauma and can worsen bleeding; once the exam is done, the patient should be covered with warm blankets."

If shock was present on admission to the emergency ward, the mortality was 65 percent. Although the hypotension that follows most injuries is a vasodepressor response and usually comes under control within approximately 1 h without pressor drugs, a large, unimpeded intravenous line should be inserted. Persistent hypotension because of head injury alone is an uncommon occurrence and should always raise the suspicion of thoracic or abdominal internal bleeding, extensive fractures, or trauma to the cervical cord, or diabetes insipidus. Initially, the infused fluid should be normal saline, avoiding the administration of excessive \u201cfree water\u201d because of its adverse effect on brain edema. Oxygen should continue to be administered until it can be shown that the arterial oxygen saturation is"

To objectively evaluate the progression of local envenomation, the level of swelling in the bitten extremity should be marked and limb circumference should be measured every 15 min until the swelling has stabilized. During this period of observation, the extremity should be positioned at approximately heart level. Measures applied in the field (such as bandages or wraps) should be removed once IV access has been obtained, with cognizance that the release of such ligatures may result in hypotension or dysrhythmias when stagnant acidotic blood containing venom is released into the systemic circulation. Two large-bore IV lines should be established in unaffected extremities. Because of the potential for coagulopathy, venipuncture attempts should be minimized, and noncompressible"

            "content": "Additional clues to the etiology and importance of a heart murmur can be gleaned from the history and other physical examination findings. Symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, neurologic, or pulmonary disease help focus the differential diagnosis, as do findings relevant to the jugular venous pressure and waveforms, the arterial pulses, other heart sounds, the lungs, the abdomen, the skin, and the extremities. In many instances, laboratory studies, an ECG, and/or a chest x-ray may have been obtained earlier and may contain valuable information. A patient with suspected infective endocarditis, for example, may have a murmur in the setting of fever, chills, anorexia, fatigue, dyspnea, splenomegaly, petechiae, and positive blood cultures. A new systolic murmur in a patient with a marked fall in blood pressure after a recent MI suggests myocardial rupture. By contrast, an isolated grade 1 or 2 mid-systolic murmur at the left sternal border in a healthy, active, and asymptomatic young"
