The patient says he moved to Nevada 6 months ago because of a new job where he works outdoors; however, he worked indoors in an office before. His vital signs include: blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, pulse 64/min, respiratory rate 18/min. The patient\u2019s rash is shown in the exhibit. Which of the following is the best initial step in the treatment of this patient?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and answer: The patient presents with a red rash over his face, which has been present for 3 months. The patient has a history of moving to a new location, which could be relevant to the diagnosis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with low blood pressure and slow pulse. Considering the options, the best initial step in the treatment of this patient would be: \"{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible diagnosis of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), which is a type of skin rash associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Given the patient's history of moving to a new location, it is possible that the patient was exposed to a new environmental factor that triggered the rash. Oral tetracycline (A) is an antibiotic that can be used to treat bacterial infections, but it is not the best initial choice for CLE. Oral clonidine (B) is an antihypertensive medication that may be used to treat high blood pressure, but it is not typically used to treat skin rashes. Topical metronidazole (C) is an antibiotic that is used to treat fungal and bacterial infections, but it is not typically used to treat skin rashes. Topical benzoyl peroxide (D) is a skin cream that is used to treat acne, but it is not typically used to treat CLE. The best initial step in the treatment of this patient would be to consult a dermatologist to determine the underlying cause of the rash and develop a treatment plan.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

            "content": "The duration of untreated illness averages 12 days (range, 9\u201318 days). Rash is present in only 13% of patients at presentation for medical care (usually ~4 days after onset of fever), appearing an average of 2 days later in half of the remaining patients and never appearing in the others. The initial macular rash is often detected by careful inspection of the axilla or the inner surface of the arm. Subsequently, the rash becomes maculopapular, involving the trunk more often than the extremities; it is seldom petechial and rarely involves the face, palms, or soles. A rash is detected in only 20% of patients with darkly pigmented skin."

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).
