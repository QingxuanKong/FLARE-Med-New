    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents with severe fear reactions to seeing dogs after moving into a new suburban neighborhood. She states that she has always had an irrational and excessive fear of dogs but has been able to avoid it for most of her life while living in the city. When she sees her neighbors walking their dogs outside, she is terrified and begins to feel short of breath. Recently, she has stopped picking up her children from the bus stop and no longer plays outside with her children in order to avoid seeing any dogs. Which of the following would be the best definitive treatment for this patient?",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a specific phobia, which is a type of anxiety disorder characterized by an intense, irrational fear of a specific object or situation. The patient's fear of dogs is excessive and interferes with her daily life, causing her to avoid certain situations and activities. To determine the best definitive treatment for this patient, we need to consider the characteristics of specific phobia and the available treatment options. The patient's fear is not just a normal fear, but an excessive and irrational one that interferes with her daily life. This suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be an effective treatment option. CBT is a type of psychotherapy that helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with their phobia. It is a common treatment for specific phobia and has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are also commonly used to treat specific phobia, but they may take several weeks to take effect. Short-acting benzodiazepines are not typically used to treat specific phobia, as they can have negative side effects and may not address the underlying cause of the phobia. Systematic desensitization is a type of exposure therapy that involves gradually exposing the individual to the feared object or situation in a controlled and safe environment. While it can be an effective treatment for specific phobia, it may not be as effective as CBT in the short term. Therefore, the best definitive treatment for this patient would be cognitive behavioral therapy (D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Removal of mismatched bases from the 3\u2032-end of Okazaki fragments by a methyl-directed process C. Removal of pyrimidine dimers from DNA by nucleotide excision repair D. Removal of uracil from DNA by base excision repair"

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

Active avoidance means the individual intentionally behaves in ways that are designed to prevent or minimize contact with phobic objects or situations (e.g., takes tunnels instead of bridges on daily commute to work for fear of heights; avoids entering a dark room for fear of spi- ders; avoids accepting a job in a locale where a phobic stimulus is more common). Avoid- ance behaviors are often obvious (e.g., an individual who fears blood refusing to go to the doctor) but are sometimes less obvious (e.g., an individual who fears snakes refusing to look at pictures that resemble the form or shape of snakes). Many individuals with specific ways designed to avoid the phobic object or situation as much as possible (e.g., an indi- vidual diagnosed with specific phobia, animal, who moves to reside in an area devoid of"

Other phobias are those of open (agoraphobia), closed, or high places, dogs, cats, insects, dirt, sprays and other contaminants, air travel, HIV, cancer, insanity, and death. Feelings of helplessness, pessimism, and despondency, the hallmarks of a depressive illness, result after years of phobic suffering. Often there are obsessive-compulsive tendencies as well, and some patients are hypochondriacal. Phobias are essentially obsessive fears and are somehow allied with this latter category of neurosis. The present authors have observed a number of patients whose phobic (or obsessive- compulsive) states became greatly exaggerated as an endogenous depression developed. Recovery from the depression returned them to their earlier and milder phobic state."

            "content": "Frequent mild physical punishment (corporal punishment) may become less effective over time and tempt the parent to escalate the physical punishment, increasing the risk of child abuse. Corporal punishment teaches a child that in certain situations it is proper to strike another person. Commonly in households that use spanking, older children who have been raised with this technique are seen responding to younger sibling behavioral problems by hitting their siblings. Threats by parents to leave or to give up the child are perhaps the most psychologically damaging ways to control a child\u2019s behavior. Children of any age may remain fearful and anxious about loss of the parent long after the threat is made; however many children are able to see through empty threats. Threatening a mild loss of privileges (no video games for 1 week or grounding a teenager) may be appropriate, but the consequence must be enforced if there is a violation."

She is comatose, tachypneic (25 breaths per minute), and tachycardic (150 bpm), but she appears flushed, and fingertip pulse oximetry is normal (97%) breathing room air. Questioning of her parents reveals that they are homeless and have been living in their car (a small van). The nights have been cold, and they have used a small char-coal burner to keep warm inside the vehicle. What is the most likely diagnosis? What treatment should be instituted immediately? If her mother is pregnant, what additional measures should be taken?"
