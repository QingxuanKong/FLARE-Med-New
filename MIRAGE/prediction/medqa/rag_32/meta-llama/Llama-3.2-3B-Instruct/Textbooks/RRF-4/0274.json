            "content": "In examining the skin it is usually advisable to assess the patient before taking an extensive history. This approach ensures that the entire cutaneous surface will be evaluated, and objective findings can be integrated with relevant historical data. Four basic features of a skin lesion must be noted and considered during a physical examination: the distribution of the eruption, the types of primary and secondary lesions, the shape of individual lesions, and the arrangement of the lesions. An ideal skin examination includes evaluation of the skin, hair, and nails as well as the mucous membranes of the mouth, eyes, nose, nasopharynx, and anogenital region. In the initial examination, it is important that the patient be disrobed as completely as possible to minimize chances of missing important individual skin lesions and permit accurate assessment of the distribution of the eruption. The patient should first be viewed from a distance of about 1.5\u20132 m (4\u20136 ft) so that the general"

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

The fact that the largest organ in the body is visible is both an advantage and a disadvantage to those who examine it. It is advantageous because no special instrumentation is necessary and because the skin can be biopsied with little morbidity. However, the casual observer can be misled by a variety of stimuli and overlook important, subtle signs of skin or systemic disease. For instance, the sometimes minor differences in color and shape that distinguish a melanoma (Fig. 70-1) from a benign nevomelanocytic nevus (Fig. 70-2) can be difficult to recognize. A variety of descriptive terms have been developed that characterize cutaneous lesions (Tables 70-1, 70-2, and Tables 70-3; Fig. 70-3), thereby aiding in their interpretation and in the formulation of a differential diagnosis (Table 70-4). For example, the finding of scaling"

Diagnosis: AZ has xeroderma pigmentosum, a rare defect in nucleotide excision repair of DNA. Treatment: Protection from sunlight through use of sunscreens such as protective clothing that reflect UV radiation and chemicals that absorb it is essential. Frequent skin and eye examinations are recommended. Prognosis: Most patients with xeroderma pigmentosum die at an early age from skin cancers. However, survival beyond middle age is possible.
