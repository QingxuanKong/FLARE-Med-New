    "question": "A 61-year-old man complaining of unexplained bleeding by from the mouth is escorted to the emergency department by corrections officers. Upon examination patient states he feels nauseated as he begins to retch violently and vomit bright red blood. His past medical history is remarkable for cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse and untreated hepatitis C. His current blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, heart rate is 128/min, and oxygen saturation in room air is 88%. On further questioning, he states that he is scared to die and wants everything done to save his life. IV fluids are initiated and packed RBCs are ordered. You begin to review his labs and notice and he has elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate, ammonia, and lactate. What would be the appropriate response to the patient?",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the appropriate response to the patient, let's break down the situation step by step. The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse and untreated hepatitis C, presenting with unexplained bleeding from the mouth, nausea, vomiting of bright red blood, and a low blood pressure of 90/50 mmHg. The patient is also showing signs of metabolic acidosis (elevated lactate) and possibly liver dysfunction (elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate). Given these findings, the patient's condition suggests a high risk of hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of cirrhosis characterized by altered mental status, confusion, and altered level of consciousness. The patient's desire to die and fear of death also suggests a high risk of suicide. The patient's vital signs and laboratory results indicate a need for immediate attention and stabilization. The appropriate response would be to accept the patient's wishes and ensure he receives appropriate care, including psychiatric evaluation and management of his pain and discomfort, while also addressing the underlying liver disease and preventing further complications. This approach prioritizes the patient's comfort and dignity while also ensuring that his medical needs are met. Options A, B, and D are not the most appropriate responses in this situation, as they do not address the patient's immediate medical needs and may not prioritize his comfort and dignity.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor.

During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH\u2019s problem?

It is also important to offer adequate nutrition and oral multiple B vitamins, including 50\u2013100 mg of thiamine daily for a week or more. Because most alcoholics who enter withdrawal are either normally hydrated or mildly overhydrated, IV fluids should be avoided unless there is a relevant medical problem or significant recent bleeding, vomiting, or diarrhea."

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."
