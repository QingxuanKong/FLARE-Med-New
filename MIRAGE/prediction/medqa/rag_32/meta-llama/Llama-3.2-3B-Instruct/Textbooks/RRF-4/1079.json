    "question": "A 65-year-old man presents with left-sided numbness, diplopia, and blurring of vision. The diplopia is more prominent on his left-side lateral gaze. He denies having fever, headache, ocular pain, lacrimation, changes in color vision, or limb weakness. He has a past medical history of type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and ischemic heart disease. In addition, he had an ischemic stroke 9 years ago, from which he recovered completely with physiotherapy and rehabilitation. He has a history of a 56-pack-year cigarette smoking habit. His medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, glimepiride, metformin, metoprolol, and ramipril. The mental status examination is unremarkable. His muscle strength is normal in all 4 limbs. His sensations are decreased on his left side, including his face. The examination of extraocular movements is shown in the image.

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the location of the lesion, we need to analyze the symptoms and examination findings. The patient presents with left-sided numbness, diplopia (double vision) that is more prominent on left-sided lateral gaze, and blurring of vision. The patient has a history of type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and ischemic heart disease, but no recent symptoms or changes in his medication regimen that could explain the new symptoms. The patient has a history of an ischemic stroke 9 years ago, but it is not clear if this is related to the current symptoms. The patient's examination findings of decreased sensations on his left side, including his face, and the specific finding of diplopia that is more prominent on left-sided lateral gaze suggest a lesion affecting the left oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) or the left abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI). The oculomotor nerve controls most of the extraocular muscles, including the medial rectus, superior rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles, which are responsible for adduction, elevation, depression, and intorsion of the eye, respectively. The abducens nerve controls the lateral rectus muscle, which is responsible for abduction of the eye. The patient's symptoms of diplopia that is more prominent on left-sided lateral gaze suggest a lesion affecting the left abducens nerve. The abducens nerve is located in the cavernous sinus, which is a group of veins located near the base of the brain. The cavernous sinus is a critical structure that contains several cranial nerves, including the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III), the trochlear nerve (cranial nerve IV), the abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI), and the superior and inferior divisions of the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). Given the location of the abducens nerve in the cavernous sinus, a lesion in this location could explain the patient's symptoms of left-sided numbness, diplopia that is more prominent on left-sided lateral gaze, and blurring of vision. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Cavernous sinus.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"A\"",

The similarity to tabes dorsalis is even closer if lancinating pains in the legs, unreactive pupils, abdominal pains, and neuropathic arthropathy are present. Among these, diabetic ophthalmoplegia is a common occurrence, usually in a patient with well-established diabetes. It commonly presents as isolated, painful third nerve palsy with sparing of pupillary function. In the first autopsied patient reported by Dreyfus and colleagues, there was an ischemic lesion in the center of the retroorbital portion of the third nerve. Subsequently, a similar case was described by Asbury and colleagues (1970). Slightly less often, the sixth nerve on one side is involved. The disorder was described in Chap. 13."

In contrast, with posterior ischemic optic neuropathy, there are no changes of the optic disc until disc pallor develops in the chronic stages.

With nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), the onset is typically abrupt and painless, but on occasion the visual loss is progressive for several days.

Plasma Na+ concentration was initially 129 meq/L, decreasing within 3 days to 118\u2013120 meq/L despite fluid restriction to 1 L/d. A chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a right 2.8 \u00d7 1.6 cm infrahilar mass and postobstructive pneumonia. The patient was an active smoker. Past medical history was notable for laryngeal carcinoma treated 15 years prior with radiation therapy, renal cell carcinoma, peripheral vascular disease, and hypothyroidism. On review of systems, he denied headache, nausea, and vomiting. He had chronic hip pain, managed with acetaminophen with codeine. Other medications included cilostazol, amoxicillin/clavulanate, digoxin, diltiazem, and thyroxine. He was euvolemic on examination, with no lymphadenopathy and a normal chest examination.

The condition was observed mainly in infants, children, and adolescents (more than half the patients were younger than 10 years of age, and only 4 were older than age 40 years). All of their patients were Japanese, in whom the disease seems disproportionately prevalent; both males and females were affected, and 8 were siblings. The symptom that led to medical examination was usually a sudden weakness of an arm, leg, or both on one side. The symptoms tended to clear rapidly but recurred in some instances. Headache, convulsions, impaired mental clarity, visual disturbance, and nystagmus were less frequent. In older patients, subarachnoid hemorrhage was the most common initial manifestation. Other symptoms and signs were speech disturbance, sensory impairment, involuntary movements, and unsteady gait. Characteristics noted in other series have included prolonged TIAs (this"

He is rushed to a nearby level 1 trauma center where he is found to have multiple facial fractures, a severe, unstable cervical spine injury, and significant left eye trauma. Further examination of his left eye reveals rupture of his globe. The ophthalmolo-gist requests emergency surgery to repair and save his eye. Because the patient has suffered a recent trauma, you decide to perform a rapid sequence intubation in preparation for the surgical procedure. What muscle relaxant would you use to facilitate tracheal intubation? What is the proper dose for your chosen muscle relaxant? After intravenous infusion of your chosen muscle relaxant, you are unable to adequately visualize the patient\u2019s larynx and vocal cords and cannot successfully pass an endotracheal tube. You switch to mask ventilation but are barely able to mask ventilate the patient, and you become worried"

Repeated vomiting is a prominent feature, with occipital headache, vertigo, and inability to sit, stand, or walk. Often these are the only abnormalities, making it imperative to have the patient attempt to ambulate; otherwise the examination may erroneously seem to be normal. In the early phase of the illness other clinical signs of cerebellar disease are usually minimal or lacking; only a minority of cases shows nystagmus or cerebellar ataxia of the limbs, although these signs must always be sought. A mild ipsilateral facial weakness, diminished corneal reflex, paresis of conjugate lateral gaze to the side of the hemorrhage, or an ipsilateral sixth-nerve weakness occur with larger hemorrhages that compress the pons or extend into the cerebellar peduncle. Dysarthria and dysphagia may be prominent in some cases but usually are absent. Other infrequent ocular signs include"

In the former, the infant is born blind, with a white vascularized retinal mass behind a clear lens; later the lens and cornea become opaque. The eyes are small, and the iris is atrophied. In the latter, the optic fundi shows tortuosity of vessels, telangiectases, and retinal detachment. The nature of the progressive generalized muscular weakness has not been ascertained. Susac syndrome should be considered in the broad differential diagnosis of this group of disorders. This is a microvasculopathy that causes characteristic changes in the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, retinal vasculopathy, and progressive deafness as discussed in"

            "content": "Transient monocular blindness Transient ischemic attacks of visual loss involving all or part of the field of vision of one eye are referred to as amaurosis fugax or transient monocular blindness (TMB). They are common manifestations of atherosclerotic carotid stenosis but have other causes. An altitudinal horizontal border, or \u201cshade,\u201d is often, but not invariably, an aspect of the visual loss. The shade may rise or fall at the onset or cessation of the spell and occasionally remains throughout the episode. Fortuitous inspection of the retina during an attack may show segments of arteries that are filled with white material that migrate distally over many minutes. There can be stagnation of arterial and venous blood flow, which returns within seconds or minutes as vision is restored (Fisher). One interpretation of these observations is that an embolus to the central retinal artery and has broken up and moved distally. Fisher went on to discredit the theory of the time that transient"

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."
