    "question": "A 60-year-old man with severe persistent asthma since the age of 14 presents with an acute exacerbation of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing over the last several days. His asthmatic symptoms are usually well controlled with regular high-dose inhaled triamcinolone, but over the last week or so he has developed a nocturnal cough and mild wheezing despite good compliance with controller medications. A review of several spirometry reports suggest of bronchial asthma with a partial irreversible airway obstruction. Which of the following is most likely to be associated with the recent loss of asthma control in this patient?",

The patient's symptoms are usually well-controlled with regular high-dose inhaled triamcinolone, but recently, he has developed a nocturnal cough and mild wheezing despite good compliance with controller medications.\\n\\nWe need to consider the possible reasons for the recent loss of asthma control in this patient.\\n\\nAirway epithelial shedding (A) is not typically associated with loss of asthma control. It is a normal process that occurs in the airways, but it is not directly related to the loss of asthma control.\\n\\nAirway smooth muscle atrophy (B) is not a common feature of asthma. In fact, airway smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperresponsiveness are more commonly seen in asthma.\\n\\nAirway remodeling (C) is a process that occurs in chronic asthma, characterized by changes in the airway wall, including thickening of the basement membrane, increased smooth muscle mass, and goblet cell hyperplasia. This process can lead to a decrease in lung function and an increase in airway responsiveness, making it a potential cause of loss of asthma control.\\n\\nAirway hyperresponsiveness (D) is a hallmark of asthma, but it is not the most likely cause of the recent loss of asthma control in this patient. The patient's symptoms are usually well-controlled, and airway hyperresponsiveness is not directly related to the nocturnal cough and mild wheezing.\\n\\nBased on the information provided, the most likely cause of the recent loss of asthma control in this patient is airway remodeling (C). This is because the patient has a history of severe persistent asthma, and airway remodeling is a common feature of chronic asthma. The recent development of nocturnal cough and mild wheezing suggests that the airway remodeling may be contributing to the loss of asthma control.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.

A rise in asthma mortality seen in several countries during the 1960s was associated with increased use of short-acting inhaled \u03b22-adrenergic agonists (as rescue therapy), but there is now compelling evidence that the more widespread use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in patients with persistent asthma is responsible for the decrease in mortality in recent years. Major risk factors for asthma deaths are poorly controlled disease with frequent use of bronchodilator inhalers, lack of or poor compliance with ICS therapy, and previous admissions to hospital with near-fatal asthma. It has proved difficult to agree on a definition of asthma, but there is good agreement on the description of the clinical syndrome and disease pathology. Until the etiologic mechanisms of the disease are better understood, it will be difficult to provide an accurate definition."

ICSs are usually given twice daily, but some may be effective once daily in mildly symptomatic patients. ICSs rapidly improve the symptoms of asthma, and lung function improves over several days. They are effective in preventing asthma symptoms, such as EIA and nocturnal exacerbations, but also prevent severe exacerbations. ICSs reduce AHR, but maximal improvement may take several months of therapy. Early treatment with ICS appears to prevent irreversible changes in airway function that occur with chronic asthma. Withdrawal of ICS results in slow deterioration of asthma control, indicating that they suppress inflammation and symptoms, but do not cure the underlying condition.

While most commonly a sign of asthma, peribronchial edema in the setting of congestive heart failure can also result in diffuse wheezes, as can any other process that causes narrowing of small airways. For this reason, clinicians must take care not to attribute all wheezing to asthma. Rhonchi are a manifestation of obstruction of medium-sized airways, most often with secretions. In the acute setting, this manifestation may be a sign of viral or bacterial bronchitis. Chronic rhonchi suggest bronchiectasis or COPD. Stridor, a high-pitched, focal inspiratory wheeze, usually heard over the neck, is a manifestation of upper airway obstruction and should prompt expedited evaluation of the patient, as it can precede complete upper airway obstruction and respiratory failure."

If symptoms are not controlled, a LABA should be added, which is most conveniently given by switching to a combination inhaler. The dose of controller should be adjusted accordingly, as judged by the need for a rescue inhaler.

Triggers that worsen asthma control, such as allergens or occupational agents, should be avoided, whereas triggers, such as exercise and fog, which result in transient symptoms, provide an indication that more controller therapy is needed. It is important to assess asthma control, determined by Controlled (all of Partly Characteristic the following) Controlled Uncontrolled features of partly controlled Limitation of None Any activities Abbreviations: FEV1, forced expiratory volume in 1 s; PEF, peak expiratory flow."

It is common among cigarette smokers and urban dwellers in smog-ridden cities; some studies indicate that 20% to 25% of men in the 40to 65-year-old age group have the disease. In early stages of the disease, the cough raises mucoid sputum, but airflow is not obstructed. Some patients with chronic bronchitis have evidence of hyperresponsive airways, with intermittent bronchospasm and wheezing (asthmatic bronchitis), while other bronchitic patients, especially heavy smokers, develop chronic outflow obstruction, usually with associated emphysema (COPD). The distinctive feature of chronic bronchitis is hypersecretion of mucus, beginning in the large airways."

They also need instruction on an action plan for managing severe symptoms. This can be as simple as advising that if the patient has a severe, frightening attack, she can take up to four puffs of albuterol every 15 minutes, but if the first treatment does not bring significant relief, she should take the next four puffs while on her way to an emergency department or urgent care clinic. She should also be given a prescription for prednisone, with instructions to take 40\u201360 mg orally for severe attacks, but not to wait for it to take effect if she remains severely short of breath even after albuterol inhalations. Asthma is a chronic disease, and good care requires close follow-up and creation of a provider-patient partnership for optimal management. If she has had several previous exacerbations, she should be considered a candidate for monoclonal"

Acute shortness of breath is usually associated with sudden physiologic changes, such as laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or pneumothorax. Patients with COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) experience a gradual progression of dyspnea on exertion, punctuated by acute exacerbations of shortness of breath. In contrast, most asthmatics have normal breathing the majority of the time with recurrent episodes of dyspnea that are usually associated with specific triggers, such as an upper respiratory tract infection or exposure to allergens."

Early intervention with inhaled corticosteroids reduces morbidity but does not alter the natural history of asthma. Regular use reduces airway hyperreactivity, the need for rescue bronchodilator therapy, risk of hospitalization, and risk of death from asthma. Inhaled corticosteroids are available as an inhalation aerosol, dry powder inhaler, and nebulizer solution."

Barnes Asthma is a syndrome characterized by airflow obstruction that varies markedly, both spontaneously and with treatment. Asthmatics harbor a special type of inflammation in the airways that makes them more responsive than nonasthmatics to a wide range of triggers, leading to 309 SeCtion 2 excessive narrowing with consequent reduced airflow and symptomatic wheezing and dyspnea. Narrowing of the airways is usually reversible, but in some patients with chronic asthma there may be an element of irreversible airflow obstruction. The increasing global prevalence of asthma, the large burden it now imposes on patients, and the high health care costs have led to extensive research into its mechanisms and treatment."
