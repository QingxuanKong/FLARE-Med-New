The contractions last 40 seconds, occur every 2 minutes, and are increasing in intensity. She has a history of recurrent painful ulcers on her vulva, but she currently does not have them. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a non-reassuring fetal heart rate. Her current medications include acyclovir, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Her temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), heart rate is 88/min, and blood pressure is 126/76 mm Hg. Contractions are felt on the abdomen. The cervix is dilated to 5 cm, 70% effaced, and the station of the head is -2. A fetal ultrasound shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

The cervix is dilated to 5 cm and 70% effaced. The patient has a history of recurrent painful ulcers on her vulva, which may indicate a possible history of cervical insufficiency. The patient's current medication regimen includes acyclovir, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Given the patient's history and current condition, the most appropriate next step in management would be to initiate nifedipine therapy to manage the uterine contractions and prevent preterm labor. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that is commonly used to treat preterm labor and can help relax the uterine muscles. The other options are not appropriate as misoprostol is typically used to induce labor, dilation and evacuation is a procedure for terminating a pregnancy, and allowing vaginal delivery may not be appropriate given the patient's history of cervical insufficiency and the fact that she is at 26 weeks' gestation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

With a living viable-aged fetus, and with vaginal delivery not imminent, emergency cesarean delivery is chosen by most. In some women, fetal compromise will be evident as shown in Figure 41-19. When evaluating fetal status, sonographic conirmation of fetal heart activity may be necessary because sometimes an electrode applied directly to a dead fetus will provide misleading information by recording the maternal heart rate. If the fetus has died or if it is not considered suiciently mature to live outside the uterus, then FIGURE 41-19 Placental abruption with fetal compromise.

Their overall cesarean delivery rate was 5 percent in the 1970s and 1980s with such management. The approach is now referred to as active management of labor. Two of its components-amniotomy and oxytocinhave been widely used, especially in English-speaking countries outside the United States. With this protocol, labor is diagnosed when painful contractions are accompanied by complete cervical efacement, bloody \"show,\" or ruptured membranes. Women with such indings are committed to delivery within 12 hours. Pelvic examination is performed each hour for the next 3 hours, and thereafter at 2-hour intervals. When dilation has not increased by at least 1 cm/hr, amniotomy is performed. Progress is again assessed at 2 hours, and high-dose oxytocin infusion, described in Chapter 26 (p. 509),"

Occasionally, a woman may not employ her expulsive forces to good advantage and coaching is desirable. Her legs should be half-flexed so that she can push with them against the mattress. When the next uterine contraction begins, she is instructed to exert downward pressure as though she were straining at stool. A woman is not encouraged to push beyond the completion of each contraction. Instead, she and her fetus are allowed to rest and recover. During this period of actively bearing down, the fetal heart rate auscultated during the contraction is likely to be slow but should recover to normal range before the next expulsive efort. Fetal and obstetrical outcomes appear to be unafected whether pushing is coached or uncoached during second-stage labor (Bloom, 2006; Tuuli, 2012). Bloom and colleagues (2006) studied efects of actively coaching expulsive eforts in women without epidural analgesia. hey"

Because change in heart rate is the primary response of the fetus to hypoxia or hypo-tension, anything above an FHT of 160 is a concern, whereas bradycardia (FHT of <120) is considered fetal distress. Indica-tions for emergent cesarean section include: (a) severe mater-nal shock or impending death (if the fetus is delivered within 5 minutes, survival is estimated at 70%), (b) uterine injury or significant fetal distress (anticipated survival rates of >70% if FHTs are present and fetal gestational age is >28 weeks).149If possible, a member of the obstetrics team should be present during initial evaluation. Vaginal bleeding can signal early cervical dilation and labor, abruptio placentae, or placenta previa. Amniotic sac rupture can result in prolapse of the umbil-ical cord with fetal compromise.

During the second trimester, these contractions can be detected by bimanual examination. In 1872, J. Braxton Hicks first brought attention to these contractions, which now bear his name. hese appear unpredictably and sporadically and are usually nonrhythmic. Their intensity varies between 5 and 25 mm Hg (Alvarez, 1950). Until near term, these Braxton Hicks contractions are infrequent, but their number rises during the last week or two. At this time, the uterus may contract as often as every 10 to 20 minutes and with some degree of rhythmicity. Correspondingly, uterine electrical activity is low and uncoordinated early in gestation, but becomes progressively more intense and synchronized by term (Garield, 2005; Rabotti, 2015). This synchrony develops twice as fast in multiparas compared with nulliparas (Govindan, 2015). Late in pregnancy, these contractions may cause some"

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

Frequently, the findings before rupture and hemorrhage are nonspecific, and vital signs are normal. The abdomen may be nontender or mildly tender, with or without rebound. The uterus may be slightly enlarged, with findings similar to a normal pregnancy (103,104). Cervical motion tenderness may or may not be present. An adnexal mass may be palpable in up to 50% of cases, but the mass varies markedly in size, consistency, and tenderness. A palpable mass may be the corpus luteum and not the ectopic pregnancy. With rupture and intra-abdominal hemorrhage, the patient develops tachycardia followed by hypotension. Bowel sounds are decreased or absent. The abdomen is distended, with marked tenderness and rebound tenderness. Cervical motion tenderness is present. Frequently, the findings of the pelvic examination are inadequate because of pain and guarding."
