    "question": "A 28-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of amenorrhea. Her last period occurred 4 months ago but she has not had sex in the last year and home pregnancy tests have come back negative. She first started having periods at age 13 and her periods have been unremarkable up until they stopped 4 months ago. Her past medical history is significant for radius and ulnar forearm fractures that she sustained in a car crash 3 months ago. She didn't see the car coming and has had increasing difficulty noticing objects in her peripheral vision. She also notes having recurrent headaches 5 months ago. Otherwise she has been healthy with no previous pregnancies. Physical exam reveals galactorrhea and temporal field visual defects. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for this patient's amenorrhea?",

The elevated prolactin levels also support this diagnosis. According to Document [1], hyperprolactinemia is a common cause of amenorrhea, and it can be caused by a prolactinoma, a type of pituitary tumor. The patient's symptoms of galactorrhea and visual field defects are consistent with a prolactinoma, which can compress the optic nerves and chiasm, leading to visual field defects. The patient's history of fractures and recurrent headaches may also be related to the tumor. Therefore, the most likely mechanism responsible for this patient's amenorrhea is the inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release, which is caused by the tumor in the pituitary gland. This inhibition leads to decreased secretion of LH and FSH, resulting in amenorrhea. The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and history.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

A 30-year-old woman came to her doctor with a history of amenorrhea (absence of menses) and galactorrhea (the production of breast milk). She was not pregnant and appeared otherwise fit and well. Serum prolactin was measured. Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland and necessary for the production of breast milk postpartum. This hormone was markedly elevated. Further clinical tests demonstrated visual field defects. The patient went to see an optometrist who performed a visual field assessment and demonstrated a reduction in the lateral aspects of the normal visual fields. This was bilateral and symmetrical\u2014a bilateral temporal hemianopia. The visual pathways have now determined the site of the lesion."

The history usually discloses that menarche had occurred at the appropriate age; primary amenorrhea is rare. A common history is that the patient took birth control pills, only to find, when she stopped, that the menstrual cycle did not reestablish itself. On examination, there may be no abnormalities other than galactorrhea. Serum prolactin concentrations are increased (usually in excess of 100 ng/mL). In general, the longer the duration of amenorrhea and the higher the serum prolactin level, the larger the tumor (prolactinoma). The elevated prolactin levels distinguish this disorder from idiopathic galactorrhea, in which the serum prolactin concentration is normal."

The physical examination may be particularly helpful in patients with Turner syndrome. A history of short stature but consistent growth rate, a family history of delayed puberty, and normal physical findings (including assessment of smell, optic discs, and visual fields) may suggest physiologic delay. Headaches, visual disturbances, short stature, symptoms of diabetes insipidus, and weakness of one or more limbs suggest central nervous system lesions (38). Galactorrhea may be seen with prolactinomas, a condition more commonly associated with secondary amenorrhea in the presence of normal secondary sexual characteristics.

The ages defining primary amenorrhea were decreased by 1 year to continue to represent two standard deviations above the mean age of developing secondary sexual characteristics and menses (1). Failure to begin breast development by age 13 warrants investigation. A woman who previously menstruated can develop secondary amenorrhea, which is defined as absence of menstruation for three normal menstrual cycles (2).

            "content": "Patients may develop slight alterations in the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013ovarian axis that are not severe enough to cause amenorrhea but instead cause irregular menses (oligomenorrhea) associated with absent or infrequent ovulation. These patients may bleed excessively during menstruation because estrogen is unopposed. The etiologies of oligomenorrhea overlap with the etiologies of amenorrhea, with the exception that certain anatomic (e.g., absent uterine development) and karyotypic abnormalities (e.g., Turner syndrome), are largely associated with primary amenorrhea."

As regular, ovulatory cycles become established, pain with menstruation (dysmenorrhea) is a frequent complaint. Available @ StudentConsult.com Primary amenorrhea is the complete absence of menstruation by 16 years of age in the presence of breast development or by 14 years of age in the absence of breast development. However 98% of adolescents have onset of menarche by age 15; therefore, investigations should begin at that age in young women without menses. Secondary amenorrhea refers to the cessation of menses for more than 3 consecutive months, any time after menarche."

Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min).
