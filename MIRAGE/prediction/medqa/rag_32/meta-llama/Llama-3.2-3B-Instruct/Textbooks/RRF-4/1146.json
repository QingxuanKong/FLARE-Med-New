His wife arrives within minutes to the hospital exclaiming that under no circumstance should he receive any blood transfusions during surgery.

The annotation in his medical chart also supports this. The patient's life is at risk, and delaying a blood transfusion could be fatal. The primary goal in this situation is to save the patient's life. The hospital's policy and the patient's autonomy should be considered, but the patient's life takes precedence. The patient's religious beliefs should be respected, but they should not override the need for a life-saving intervention. The patient's wife should not be asked to administer the transfusion, as this is the responsibility of the medical team. The hospital's ethics committee or a similar body should be consulted to discuss the situation and determine the best course of action. The patient's life should be prioritized, and a blood transfusion should be administered. The patient's wife's objections should be taken into consideration, but they should not override the need for a life-saving intervention.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

At the time of surgery, the initial dissection mobilized the kidney on its vascular pedicle; however, a large portion of tumor became detached in the inferior vena cava. The tumor embolus passed through the right atrium and right ventricle and occluded the pulmonary artery. This could not be cleared at the time of surgery, and the patient succumbed. A 65-year-old businessman came to the emergency department with severe lower abdominal pain that was predominantly central and left sided. He had pain radiating into the left loin, and he also noticed he was passing gas and fecal debris as he urinated. A CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis was performed (eFig. 4.191)."

            "content": "The hematocrit level or hemoglobin concentration that mandates blood transfusion is controversial. Cardiac output does not substantively drop until the hemoglobin concentration falls to approximately 7 g/dL or hematocrit of 20 volume percent. At this level, several organizations recommend consideration for red cell transfusions (Carson, 2017). Also, Military Combat Trauma Units in Iraq used a target hematocrit of 21 volume percent (Barbieri, 2007). In general, with ongoing obstetrical hemorrhage, we recommend rapid blood infusion when the hematocrit is <25 volume percent. This decision is dependent on whether the fetus has been delivered; surgery is imminent or ongoing operative blood loss is expected; or acute hypoxia, vascular collapse, or other factors are present."

Thus, both inadequate or unrestrained volume resus-citation are harmful.Likewise, observations in the management of septic shock have led to consensus statements and evolving guideline based management.10 Core principles in the management of patients in septic shock include: (a) septic shock is an emergency, and treatment/resuscitation should begin as early as possible; (b) specific anatomic diagnosis of"
