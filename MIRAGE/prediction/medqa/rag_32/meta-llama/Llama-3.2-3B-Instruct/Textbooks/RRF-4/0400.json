    "question": "A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive fatigue and painful swelling of her right knee for 3 weeks. She works as a professional ballet dancer and says, \u201cI'm always trying to be in shape for my upcoming performances.\u201d She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 45 kg (99 lb); BMI is 17 kg/m2. Physical examination shows tenderness and limited range of motion in her right knee. Oral examination shows bleeding and swelling of the gums. There are diffuse petechiae around hair follicles on her abdomen and both thighs. Laboratory studies show a prothrombin time of 12 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 35 seconds, and a bleeding time of 11 minutes. Arthrocentesis of the right knee shows bloody synovial fluid. The patient\u2019s condition is most likely associated with a defect in a reaction that occurs in which of the following cellular structures?",

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To approach this question, let's break it down step by step. The patient presents with progressive fatigue, painful swelling of the right knee, tenderness, limited range of motion, bleeding and swelling of the gums, diffuse petechiae, and prolonged coagulation times (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and bleeding time). The arthrocentesis of the right knee shows bloody synovial fluid. Considering the combination of coagulation disorders (prolonged coagulation times) and bleeding manifestations (petechiae, bleeding gums), we can suspect a bleeding disorder. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Lysosomes: Lysosomes are involved in cellular digestion and recycling, but they are not directly related to the coagulation cascade. B. Rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER): The RER is involved in protein synthesis, but it is not directly related to the coagulation pathway. C. Nucleus: The nucleus is involved in DNA replication and transcription, but it is not directly related to the coagulation cascade. D. Extracellular space: The extracellular space is the environment outside the cells, where coagulation factors are present and interact. A defect in a reaction that occurs in the extracellular space could lead to a bleeding disorder. Given the clinical presentation of prolonged coagulation times and bleeding manifestations, the most likely defect is in the extracellular space, where coagulation factors are present. Therefore, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's condition is most likely associated with a defect in a reaction that occurs in the extracellular space, where coagulation factors are present. The prolonged coagulation times and bleeding manifestations suggest a bleeding disorder, which is consistent with a defect in the extracellular space.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization.

These anastomose with the superior, superficial, and deep epigastric venous systems to drain into the internal thoracic veins, which in turn drain into the brachiocephalic veins and the superior vena cava. After the initial inferior vena cava thrombosis, the veins of the anterior abdominal wall and other collateral pathways hypertrophy to accommodate the increase in blood flow. A 52-year-old woman visited her family physician with complaints of increasing lethargy and vomiting. The physician examined her and noted that compared to previous visits she had lost significant weight. She was also jaundiced, and on examination of the abdomen a well-defined 10-cm rounded mass was palpable below the liver edge in the right upper quadrant (Fig. 4.185)."

The locale and level of pain elicited by palpation or movement should be quantified. One standard would be to count the number of tender joints on palpation of 28 easily examined joints (proximal interphalangeals, metacarpophalangeals, wrists, elbows, shoulders, and knees). Similarly, the number of swollen joints (0\u201328) can be counted and recorded. Careful examination should distinguish between true articular swelling (caused by bony hypertrophy, synovial effusion or proliferation) and nonarticular (or periarticular) involvement, which usually extends beyond the normal joint margins. Synovial effusion can be distinguished from synovial hypertrophy or bony hypertrophy by palpation or specific maneuvers.

She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

            "content": "OA is the most common cause of chronic knee pain in persons over age 45, but the differential diagnosis is long. Inflammatory arthritis is likely if there is prolonged morning stiffness and many other joints are affected. Bursitis occurs commonly around knees and hips. A physical examination should focus on whether tenderness is over the joint line (at the junction of the two bones around which the joint is articulating) or is outside of it. Anserine bursitis, medial and distal to the knee, is an extremely common cause of chronic knee pain that may respond to a glucocorticoid injection. Prominent nocturnal pain in the absence of end-stage OA merits a distinct workup. For hip pain, OA can be detected by loss of internal rotation on passive movement, and pain isolated to an area lateral to the hip joint usually reflects the presence of trochanteric bursitis. No blood tests are routinely indicated for workup of patients with OA unless symptoms and signs suggest inflammatory arthritis."

Neither the patient nor the family physician had any concerns about the pregnancy. However, the patient did complain of unilateral swelling of her left leg, which had gradually increased over the previous 2 days. Furthermore, the evening before her visit she developed some sharp chest pain, which was exacerbated by deep breaths. The family physician ordered a duplex ultrasound scan of the left leg venous system. Ultrasound scanning of the vascular tree can demonstrate flow and occlusion of arteries and veins."

The patient\u2019s hand was placed over her right buttock, a position that acts to externally rotate and extend the shoulder, exposing the supraspinatus tendon for ultrasound scan examination. The ultrasound revealed a completely torn tendon with fluid in the subacromial subdeltoid bursa (eFig. 7.128). The patient underwent a surgical repair and made a good recovery. A 35-year-old baseball pitcher came to the clinic with a history of a recurrent dislocation of the shoulder (eFig. 7.129). An MRI scan was performed to assess the shoulder joint prior to any treatment. The MRI demonstrates the anatomical structures in multiple planes, allowing the physician to obtain an overview of the shoulder and to assess any intraarticular or extraarticular structures that may have been damaged and require surgical repair."

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

The family practitioner examined the lower abdomen, which revealed a mass that extended from the superior pubic rami to the level of the umbilicus. The superior margin of the mass was easily palpated, but the inferior margin appeared to be less well defined. This patient has a pelvic mass. When examining a patient in the supine position, the observer should uncover the whole of the abdomen."
