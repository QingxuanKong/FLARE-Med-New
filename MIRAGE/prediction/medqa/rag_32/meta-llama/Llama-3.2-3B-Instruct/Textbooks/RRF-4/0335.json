Consciousness is regained after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Past medical history is negative for any neurological and cardiovascular problems. Physical examination reveals a prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse and a double apical impulse. There are no audible murmurs. An S4 is present. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the key points from the patient's presentation and physical examination findings:\\n\\n- Sudden loss of consciousness during physical activity (pitching in a baseball game)\\n- No history of neurological or cardiovascular problems\\n- Physical examination reveals a prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse\\n- Double apical impulse\\n- S4 present\\n- No audible murmurs\\n\\nThese findings suggest a cardiac cause for the syncope. The prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse is particularly notable, as it is often associated with right ventricular dysfunction or tricuspid regurgitation. The double apical impulse may be seen in conditions such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but in this case, it is not the only finding. The presence of an S4 heart sound is also indicative of diastolic dysfunction, which can be seen in various cardiac conditions. However, the absence of audible murmurs makes valvular disease less likely.\\n\\nConsidering the options provided:\\n- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (A) is a possibility, but the lack of other characteristic findings such as a holosystolic murmur makes it less likely.\\n- Aortic stenosis (B) typically presents with a systolic ejection murmur, which is not present in this case.\\n- Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (C) is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction, often precipitated by emotional or physical stress, but the physical examination findings do not support this diagnosis.\\n- Restrictive cardiomyopathy (D) is a possibility, but the prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse and double apical impulse are more suggestive of right ventricular dysfunction, making this option less likely.\\n\\nGiven the above analysis, the most likely diagnosis is C. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome. This condition is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction, often precipitated by emotional or physical stress, and can present with a prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse and double apical impulse. The patient's sudden loss of consciousness during physical activity may have triggered the condition.\\n\\nAnswer: C. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The initial evaluation should include a detailed history, thorough questioning of eyewitnesses, and a complete physical and neurologic examination. Blood pressure and heart rate should be measured in the supine position and after 3 min of standing to determine whether orthostatic hypotension is present. An ECG should be performed if there is suspicion of syncope due to an arrhythmia or underlying cardiac disease. Relevant electrocardiographic abnormalities include bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias, AV block, ischemia, old myocardial infarction, long QT syndrome, and bundle branch block. This initial assessment will lead to the identification of a cause of syncope in approximately 50% of patients and also allows stratification of patients at risk for cardiac mortality."

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

He was recently incarcerated near Bakersfield, California and returned to Oakland about 3 months ago. He is currently experiencing one month of severe headache and double vision. He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

            "content": "Faintness or syncope because of carotid sinus sensitivity reportedly has been initiated by turning of the head to one side while wearing a tight collar or even by shaving over the region of the sinus. However, the absence of a history of such an association does not exclude the diagnosis. The attack nearly always occurs when the patient is upright, usually standing. The onset is sudden, often with falling. Small convulsive movements occur quite frequently in both the vagal and vasodepressor types of carotid sinus syncope. The period of unconsciousness in carotid sinus syncope seldom lasts longer than 30 s, and the sensorium is immediately clear when consciousness is regained. The majority of the reported cases have been in men."

            "content": "Clinical Manifestations Most unruptured intracranial aneurysms are completely asymptomatic. Symptoms are usually due to rupture and resultant SAH, although some unruptured aneurysms present with mass effect on cranial nerves or brain parenchyma. At the moment of aneurysmal rupture with major SAH, the ICP suddenly rises. This may account for the sudden transient loss of consciousness that occurs in nearly half of patients. Sudden loss of consciousness may be preceded by a brief moment of excruciating headache, but most patients first complain of headache upon regaining consciousness. In 10% of cases, aneurysmal bleeding is severe enough to cause loss of consciousness for several days. In ~45% of cases, severe headache associated with exertion is the presenting complaint. The patient often calls the headache \u201cthe worst headache of my life\u201d; however, the most important characteristic is sudden onset. Occasionally, these ruptures may present as headache of only moderate intensity or as a"

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."
