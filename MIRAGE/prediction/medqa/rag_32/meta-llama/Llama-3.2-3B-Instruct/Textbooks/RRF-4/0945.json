The result shows a structure marked with the green arrow. We need to determine the function of this structure. Given the context of pregnancy and the options provided, we can eliminate some choices. Option A (Removal of nitrogenous waste) is a function of the kidneys, which is not directly related to the structure marked with the green arrow. Option B (Embryonic hematopoiesis) is the production of blood cells in the embryo, which is also not directly related to the structure marked with the green arrow. Option D (Gas exchange) is a function of the lungs, which is not relevant to the context of pregnancy and the structure marked with the green arrow. This leaves us with Option C (Production of amniotic fluid), which is a function of the structure marked with the green arrow. The structure marked with the green arrow is the amnion, which is a membrane that surrounds the embryo and produces amniotic fluid. The amnion plays a crucial role in cushioning the embryo and providing a protective environment for fetal development. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Therefore, the definition of primary amenorrhea changed: Primary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses by 13 years of age when there is no visible development of secondary sexual characteristics or by 15 years of age in the presence of normal secondary sexual characteristics. The ages defining primary amenorrhea were decreased by 1 year to continue to represent two standard deviations above the mean age of developing secondary sexual characteristics and menses (1). Failure to begin breast development by age 13 warrants investigation. A woman who previously menstruated can develop secondary amenorrhea, which is defined as absence of menstruation for three normal menstrual cycles (2). A woman with regular cycles and a delay of menses of even a week may warrant assessment with a pregnancy test. It is reasonable to evaluate a woman who has fewer than nine cycles per year.

Primary amenorrhea is defined as absence of menses at age 13 years when there is no visible development of secondary sexual characteristics or age 15 years in the presence of normal secondary sexual characteristics. Absent or irregular menses may be an indication that a woman has a medical condition that can affect her overall health. The health implications can vary depending on the etiology of the amenorrhea. Therefore, a cause for amenorrhea should be established whenever possible. When gonadal failure occurs in conjunction with primary amenorrhea, it is associated with a high incidence of abnormal karyotype. The anatomic causes of amenorrhea are relatively few, and the majority may be diagnosed by history and physical examination."

Menstrual cycles vary appreciably in length among women and even in the same woman (Chap. 5, p. 81). hus, amenorrhea is not a reliable pregnancy indicator until 10 days or more after expected menses have passed. Occasionally, uterine bleeding that mimics menstruation is noted after conception. During the irst month of pregnancy, these episodes are likely the consequence of blastocyst implantation. Still, irst-trimester bleeding should generally prompt evaluation for an abnormal pregnancy."

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

Bleeding and cramping with medical termination typically is signiicantly worse than with menses. Thus, adequate analgesia, usually including a narcotic, is provided. If bleeding soaks two or more pads per hour for at least 2 hours, the woman is instructed to contact her provider to determine whether she needs to be seen . At the follow-up appointment, routine postabortal sonographic examination is typically unnecessary (Clark, 2010). Instead, assessment of the clinical course along with bimanual pelvic examination is recommended. If sonography is indicated TABLE 18-7.
