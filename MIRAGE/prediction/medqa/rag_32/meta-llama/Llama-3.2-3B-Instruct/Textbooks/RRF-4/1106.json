    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents to a psychiatrist for an initial consultation. She reports that for the past 3 years, she has experienced several periods of depressed mood. The episodes do not coincide with any specific life events and seem to resolve after 4-6 weeks. During these episodes, she experiences a depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and a poor appetite, but she at times is able to enjoy spending time with her children and husband but other times she is distressed and cannot enjoy time with them. Upon further questioning, she also reports experiencing occasional episodes of elevated mood over the past ten years. During these episodes, she is very productive at her work as a lawyer and requires less sleep than usual. Her past medical history is notable for obesity, type I diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. She is on insulin and takes methotrexate. She smokes marijuana occasionally. Her temperature is 99.2\u00b0F (37.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 124/80 mmHg, pulse is 78/min, and respirations are 17/min. On exam, she is quiet with a flattened affect, but is cooperative and answers questions thoroughly. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely diagnosis for the patient, let's analyze the key features presented in the scenario:\\n\\nThe patient reports experiencing several periods of depressed mood over the past 3 years, which resolve after 4-6 weeks. She also experiences episodes of elevated mood, which are productive and require less sleep than usual. These episodes seem to alternate with periods of depressed mood.\\n\\nThis pattern of mood swings, where the patient experiences both depressive and hypomanic episodes, is characteristic of a bipolar disorder. However, the duration of the episodes and the presence of depressive episodes without the full-blown manic episode make cyclothymic disorder a more likely diagnosis.\\n\\nThe patient's past medical history of obesity, type I diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis may contribute to her mood instability, but they do not directly impact the primary diagnosis of a mood disorder.\\n\\nThe patient's flattened affect and quiet demeanor during the examination are consistent with depressive symptoms, but they do not rule out the presence of hypomanic episodes.\\n\\nGiven the patient's symptoms of alternating depressive and hypomanic episodes, the most likely diagnosis is cyclothymic disorder.\\n\\nThe other options are less likely because:\\n\\n- Bipolar I disorder requires at least one manic episode, which is not explicitly mentioned in the scenario.\\n\\n- Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) typically involves a depressed mood for most of the day, more days than not, for at least two years, which is not the case here.\\n\\n- Schizoaffective disorder involves a combination of psychotic symptoms and a mood disorder, which is not explicitly mentioned in the scenario.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is cyclothymic disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

One of our patients, functioning normally in every other way, carried the unshakable idea that people were sneaking into her house at night when she was away and rearranging the furniture. She functioned extremely well through her eighties but had a schizophrenic sister. Also, several physicians under our care have woven extensive delusional ideas around tenuous scientific theories; these ideas have applied to personal life events as well as physical and psychologic symptoms and in some cases have resulted in bizarre regimens of self-medication. Rarely, a patient comes to the hospital for some other medical reason and it is found that he or she has been living quietly in the community, preoccupied with a bizarre delusional system yet appearing neither depressed nor schizophrenic. Certainly one often sees delusions in depressed patients who decompensate as their depression deepens."

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

For days or weeks, the patients, mostly adolescent boys, sleep 18 h or more a day, awakening only long enough to eat and attend to toilet needs. They appeared dull, often confused, and restless, and were sometimes troubled by hallucinations. In the series of 11 cases collected by Critchley, the age range of onset was from late teenage years to mid-1920s, with few exceptions. There may be a brief prodromal period of inertia and drowsiness. The duration of nocturnal sleep may be greatly prolonged, or, as in our patients referred to below, they may sleep for days on end. Food intake during and around the period of hypersomnia may exceed three times the normal (bulimia) and occurs almost compulsively during brief periods of semiwakefulness; to a variable extent, there are other behavioral changes such as social withdrawal, negativism, slowness of thinking, incoherence,"

Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"
