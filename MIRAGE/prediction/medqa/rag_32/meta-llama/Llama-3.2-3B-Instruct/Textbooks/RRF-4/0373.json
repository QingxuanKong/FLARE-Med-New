    "question": "A 45-year-old man presents to the physician because of a 1-day history of progressive pain and blurry vision in his right eye. He is struggling to open this eye because of the pain. His left eye is asymptomatic. He wears contact lenses. He has bronchial asthma treated with inhaled salbutamol. He works as a kindergarten teacher. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 85/min, and blood pressure 135/75 mm Hg. The examination shows a visual acuity in the left eye of 20/25 and the ability to count fingers at 3 feet in the right eye. A photograph of the right eye is shown.

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the symptoms and examination findings presented in the case. The patient is a 45-year-old man with progressive pain and blurry vision in his right eye, which is unable to be opened due to pain. The patient has a history of bronchial asthma treated with inhaled salbutamol and wears contact lenses. The examination reveals a visual acuity of 20/25 in the left eye and counting fingers at 3 feet in the right eye. The patient's vital signs are stable. Considering the symptoms and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a condition that affects the cornea or the anterior segment of the eye. The patient's inability to open his right eye due to pain and the presence of blurry vision are key findings that point towards a condition affecting the cornea. Option A, Angle-closure glaucoma, is less likely because it typically presents with severe eye pain, redness, and blurred vision, but the patient's eyes are not red, and there is no mention of acute angle closure. Option B, Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, is also less likely because it typically presents with conjunctival injection, excessive tearing, and photophobia, which are not mentioned in the case. Option C, Herpes simplex keratitis, is a possible diagnosis, but the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest a viral infection. Option D, Pseudomonas keratitis, is the most likely diagnosis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of bacterial keratitis, especially in contact lens wearers. The patient's contact lens use and the presence of blurry vision and eye pain are consistent with this diagnosis. The photograph of the right eye is not provided, but based on the symptoms and examination findings, Pseudomonas keratitis is the most likely diagnosis.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",

For convenience, a scale version of the Snellen chart called the Rosenbaum card is held at 36 cm (14 in.) from the patient (Fig. 39-1). All subjects should be able to read the 6/6 m (20/20 ft) line with each eye using their refractive correction, if any. Patients who need reading glasses because of presbyopia must wear them for accurate testing with the Rosenbaum card. If 6/6 (20/20) acuity is not present in each eye, the deficiency in vision must be explained. If it is worse than 6/240 (20/800), acuity should be recorded in terms of counting fingers, hand motions, light perception, or no light perception. Legal blindness is defined by the Internal Revenue Service as a best corrected acuity of 6/60 (20/200) or less in the better eye or a binocular visual field subtending 20\u00b0 or less.

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

They are initiated by autophosphorylation of select tyrosine residues in their receptors. C. They are mediated by binding to adrenergic receptors, which are a class of nuclear receptors. D. They result in the activation of glycogen and triacylglycerol synthesis. Q3. NE bound to certain receptors causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. Why might NE be used clinically in the treatment of septic shock? Case 5: Sun Sensitivity Patient Presentation: AZ is a 6-year-old boy who is being evaluated for freckle-like areas of hyperpigmentation on his face, neck, forearms, and lower legs. Focused History: AZ\u2019s father reports that the boy has always been quite sensitive to the sun. His skin turns red (erythema) and his eyes hurt (photophobia) if he is exposed to the sun for any period of time."

            "content": "The first symptom is usually an impairment of twilight vision (nyctalopia). Under dim light, the visual fields tend to constrict; but slowly, as the disease progresses, there is permanent visual impairment in all degrees of illumination. The perimacular zones tend to be the first and most severely involved, giving rise to partial or complete ring scotomata. Peripheral loss sets in later. Usually both eyes are affected simultaneously, but cases are on record where 1 eye was affected first and more severely. Ophthalmoscopic examination shows the characteristic triad of pigmentary deposits that assume the configuration of bone corpuscles, attenuated vessels, and pallor of the optic discs. The pigment is caused by clumping of epithelial cells that migrate from the pigment layer to the superficial parts of the retina as the rod cells degenerate. The pigmentary change spares only the fovea, so that eventually the world is perceived by the patient as though he were looking through narrow"

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension.

A 33-year-old fit and well woman came to the emergency department complaining of double vision and pain behind her right eye. She had no other symptoms. On examination of the right eye the pupil was dilated. There was a mild ptosis. Testing of eye movement revealed that the eye turned down and out and the pupillary reflex was not present. These findings revealed that the patient had an ipsilateral third nerve palsy (palsy of the oculomotor nerve [III]). The oculomotor nerve [III] is the main motor nerve to the ocular and extra-ocular muscles. It arises from the midbrain and pierces the dura mater to run in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. The oculomotor nerve [III] leaves the cranial cavity and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. Within this fissure it divides into its superior and inferior divisions."

Evaluation of the head includes examination for injuries to the scalp, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, facial bones, and intracra-nial structures. Palpation of the head is done to identify scalp lacerations, which should be evaluated for depth, and pres-ence of associated depressed or open skull fractures. The eye examination includes not only pupillary size and reactivity, but also examination for visual acuity and for hemorrhage within the globe. Ocular entrapment, caused by orbital fractures with impingement of the ocular muscles, is evident when the patient cannot move his or her eyes through an entire range of motion. It is important to perform the eye examination early because significant orbital swelling may prevent later evaluation. A lat-eral canthotomy may be needed to relieve periorbital pressure. The tympanic membrane is examined to identify hemotym-panum, otorrhea, or rupture, which"

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"
