    "question": "A previously healthy 24-year-old man comes to the physician 1 day after the onset of burning pain, swelling, and multiple blisters over the left index finger. He works as a dental assistant and is concerned about not being able to work. The patient wonders if the symptoms might be related to a hunting trip he returned from 1 week ago because he remembers seeing a lot of poison oak. He is sexually active with one female partner, and they do not use condoms. His father has a history of thromboangiitis obliterans. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 5 years. He drinks two to four beers on social occasions. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows swelling and erythema of the pulp space of the left index finger; there are multiple 3-mm vesicles. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 12,000 cells/mm3. In addition to supportive therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of burning pain, swelling, and multiple blisters over the left index finger, which suggests a skin infection. Given the patient's occupation as a dental assistant and the presence of vesicles, the most likely diagnosis is herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, possibly HSV-1. The patient's symptoms could be related to the hunting trip, as HSV-1 is commonly spread through skin-to-skin contact. The patient's father has a history of thromboangiitis obliterans, but this is not directly related to the current symptoms. The patient's smoking history and alcohol consumption are also not directly relevant to the diagnosis. The most appropriate next step in management, in addition to supportive therapy, is to wash the affected area thoroughly to prevent the spread of the infection and reduce the risk of complications. Oral acyclovir may be considered for treatment, but it is not the most immediate next step. Oral cephalexin is an antibiotic, but it is not the best choice for HSV infection. Smoking cessation is important for overall health, but it is not directly relevant to the current diagnosis. \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

He was otherwise healthy and had no other symptoms. During examination, the physician palpated the left testis, which was normal, although he noted soft nodular swelling around the superior aspect of the testes and the epididymis. In his clinical notes, he described these findings as a \u201cbag of worms\u201d (Fig. 5.86). The bag of worms was a varicocele. The venous drainage of the testis is via the pampiniform plexus of veins that runs within the spermatic cord. A varicocele is a collection of dilated veins that arise from the pampiniform plexus. In many ways, they are similar to varicose veins that develop in the legs. Typically, the patient complains of a dragging feeling in the scrotum and around the testis, which is usually worse toward the end of the day. The family physician recommended surgical treatment, with a recommendation for surgery through an inguinal incision."

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

First, one observes the actions of the patient as he engages in simulated tasks as dressing, washing, shaving, and using eating utensils. Second, the patient is asked to carry out familiar symbolic acts\u2014wave goodbye, salute the flag, shake a fist as though angry, or blow a kiss. If he fails, he is asked to imitate such acts made by the examiner. Finally, he is asked to show how he would hammer a nail, brush his teeth, take a comb out of his pocket and comb his hair, or to execute a more complex act, such as lighting and smoking a cigarette or opening a bottle of soda, pouring some into a glass, and drinking it. These latter actions, involving more complex sequences, are said to be tests of ideational apraxia; the simpler and familiar acts are considered tests of ideomotor apraxia. To perform these tasks in the absence of the tool or utensil is always more demanding because the patient must mentally formulate a plan of action rather"

The mass in the patient\u2019s pelvis compressed this nerve, producing his sensory and motor dysfunction. During surgery, the mass was found to be a benign nerve tumor and was excised. This patient had no long-standing neurological deficit. A 65-year-old man was examined by a surgical intern because he had a history of buttock pain and impotence. On examination he had a reduced peripheral pulse on the left foot compared to the right. On direct questioning, the patient revealed that he experienced severe left-sided buttock pain after walking 100 yards. After a short period of rest, he could walk another 100 yards before the same symptoms recurred. He also noticed that over the past year he was unable to obtain an erection. He smoked heavily and was on no other drugs or treatment."

Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH\u2019s problem?

The cause of thromboangiitis obliterans is unknown; however, use of or exposure to tobacco is essential to both the diagnosis and progression of the disease.Pathologically, thrombosis occurs in smallto medium-sized arteries and veins with associated dense polymorphonu-clear leukocyte aggregation, microabscesses, and multinucleated giant cells. The chronic phase of the disease shows a decrease in the hypercellularity and frequent recanalization of the vessel lumen."

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"
