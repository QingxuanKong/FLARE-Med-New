    "question": "A 21-year-old college student comes to the physician because of daytime fatigue for 2 months. He has problems getting to sleep at night and frequently falls asleep during class. Recently he has started skipping classes altogether. He goes to bed between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. but cannot fall asleep for 2\u20133 hours. When he wakes up at 8:30 a.m., he feels extremely drowsy, and he tries to overcome his fatigue by drinking 2\u20133 cups of coffee a day. He naps at various times during the afternoon, often for more than an hour. He stopped watching videos on his smartphone at night because of suggestions from his peers. He states that he has tried over-the-counter melatonin pills and exercising at 8 p.m. without success. He has no history of serious illness. He does not smoke. He drinks three to five beers on weekends. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for this patient?",

        "A": "Trial of diphenhydramine",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the patient's symptoms and history. The patient is a 21-year-old college student experiencing daytime fatigue, difficulty falling asleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness. He has tried over-the-counter melatonin pills and exercising at 8 p.m. without success. He also stopped watching videos on his smartphone at night due to suggestions from peers. The patient's symptoms are consistent with delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), a condition characterized by a delayed sleep onset and sleep-wake cycle. The patient's sleep schedule is shifted later than the conventional sleep-wake cycle, leading to excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue. Given the patient's age, academic responsibilities, and the fact that he is trying to establish a consistent sleep schedule, it is essential to address the underlying sleep schedule issue rather than relying on temporary solutions like melatonin or caffeine. The patient's decision to stop watching videos on his smartphone at night is a positive step towards establishing a sleep-conducive environment. However, this is not a comprehensive solution and may not address the underlying sleep schedule issue. The patient's history of trying melatonin without success and the fact that he has not been able to establish a consistent sleep schedule through exercise and sleep schedule adjustments suggest that DSPS may be the underlying cause of his symptoms. Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation would be to help the patient establish a consistent sleep schedule and create a sleep-conducive environment, rather than relying on temporary solutions like diphenhydramine, stopping evening exercise, or taking alcoholic beverages before bedtime. Scheduled afternoon naps may also be counterproductive, as they can further disrupt the patient's sleep-wake cycle. Thus, the best answer is B. Stop evening exercise.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Sleep onset is delayed until 3 to 6 a.m.; the subject then sleeps normally until 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. An imposed sleep period from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. leads to a prolonged sleep latency and daytime sleepiness. By contrast, the advanced-sleep-phase syndrome is characterized by an early evening sleep onset (8 to 9 p.m.) and early morning awakening (3 to 5 a.m.). Simply delaying the onset of sleep usually fails to prevent early morning awakening. This pattern is not uncommon among healthy elderly persons (and also among college students), in whom it should probably not be defined as an insomnia syndrome. Still other persons show a completely irregular sleep\u2013wake pattern; sleep consists of persistent but variable short or long naps throughout the night and day, with a nearly normal 24-h accumulation of sleep."

Some patients may think that a short amount of sleep is normal or advantageous, and they may not appreciate their biological need for more sleep, especially if coffee and other stimulants mask the sleepiness. A 2-week sleep log documenting the timing of sleep and daily level of alertness is diagnostically useful and provides helpful feedback for the patient.

The test is performed after an overnight polysomnogram to establish that the patient has had an adequate amount of good-quality nighttime sleep. The MSLT consists of five 20-min nap opportunities every 2 h across the day. The patient is instructed to try to fall asleep, and the major endpoints are the average latency to sleep and the occurrence of REM sleep during the naps. An average sleep latency across the naps of less than 8 min is considered objective evidence of excessive daytime sleepiness. REM sleep normally occurs only during the nighttime sleep episode, and the occurrence of REM sleep in two or more of the MSLT naps provides support for the diagnosis of narcolepsy."

A 33-year-old man was playing cricket for his local Sunday team. As the new bowler pitched the ball short, it bounced higher than he anticipated and hit him on the side of his head. He immediately fell to the ground unconscious, but after about 30 seconds he was helped to his feet and felt otherwise well. It was noted he had some bruising around his temple. He decided not to continue playing and went to watch the match from the side. Over the next hour he became extremely sleepy and was eventually unrousable. He was rushed to hospital. When he was admitted to hospital, the patient\u2019s breathing was shallow and irregular and it was necessary to intubate him. A skull radiograph demonstrated a fracture in the region of the pterion. No other abnormality was demonstrated other than minor soft tissue bruising over the left temporal fossa. A CT scan was performed."

On closer analysis, one observes and hears that many such patients have difficulty initiating activity but also in sustaining it; that is, their endurance is diminished. This condition, of course, is the familiar aftermath of sleeplessness or prolonged mental or physical effort, and, under such circumstances, it is accepted as a normal reaction. When, however, similar symptoms appear without relation to such antecedents, they should be suspected of being the manifestations of"

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia.

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."
