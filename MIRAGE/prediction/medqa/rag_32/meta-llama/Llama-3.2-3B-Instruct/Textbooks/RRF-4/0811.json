    "question": "A 39-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of personality changes over the past year. He has become increasingly irritable, loud, aggressive, and impulsive. His wife also reports jerky movements of his limbs and trunk for the past few months. His father had dementia in his mid-40s, but the details of his condition are unclear. The patient appears restless. Examination shows irregular movements of the extremities and twitching of the face and tongue. Mental status examination shows impaired memory. This patient's condition is most likely associated with which of the following changes on MRI?",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Based on the provided documents, I'll analyze the case and provide a step-by-step explanation. **Step 1: Identify the key symptoms and history** The patient is a 39-year-old man with personality changes, including increasing irritability, loudness, aggression, and impulsivity over the past year. He also exhibits jerky movements of his limbs and trunk, facial twitching, and impaired memory. His family history includes a father with dementia in his mid-40s, although the details are unclear. **Step 2: Consider the potential causes** Based on the symptoms, the patient's condition is likely related to a neurodegenerative disorder. The presence of personality changes, motor symptoms (jerky movements, facial twitching), and impaired memory suggests a condition that affects the brain's motor and cognitive functions. **Step 3: Review the potential MRI changes** The question asks about the most likely MRI change associated with the patient's condition. Let's review the options: A. Reduced hippocampal volume: While hippocampal atrophy is a common feature of Alzheimer's disease, it is not the most specific or sensitive marker for the patient's condition. B. Multiple cortical and subcortical infarctions: This option is more suggestive of vascular dementia, which is less likely given the patient's age and symptoms. C. Degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes: The patient's personality changes, impulsivity, and impaired memory are more consistent with damage to the frontal and temporal lobes, which are involved in executive function, emotion regulation, and memory. D. Atrophy of the striatum: The striatum is a structure involved in motor control and movement. While the patient exhibits motor symptoms, the primary issue appears to be cognitive and personality-related, rather than purely motor. **Step 4: Make an educated guess** Based on the analysis, the most likely MRI change associated with the patient's condition is degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes (option C). This is consistent with a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a condition characterized by personality changes, impulsivity, and impaired memory, often with motor symptoms. **Answer** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a neurodegenerative disorder, and the most likely MRI change is degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes, consistent with frontotemporal dementia (FTD).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

This may appear before the more obvious memory or language defects announce themselves. The patient becomes convinced that relatives are stealing his possessions or that an elderly and even infirm spouse is guilty of infidelity. He may hide his belongings, even relatively worthless ones, and go about spying on family members. Hostilities arise, and wills may be altered irrationally. Many of these patients are constantly worried, tense, and agitated. Of course, paranoid delusions may be part of a depressive psychosis and of other dementias, but most of the elderly patients in whom paranoia is the presenting problem, seem not to be depressed, and their cognitive functions are for a time relatively well preserved. Social indiscretions, rejection of old friends, embarking on imprudent financial ventures, or an amorous pursuit that is"

Ancillary examinations: CT, MRI, functional imaging, sometimes lumbar puncture, EEG, and appropriate laboratory procedures, as described in Chap. 2. The history should be supplemented by information obtained from a person other than the patient, because, through lack of insight, the patient will have limited and variable grasp of his illness or its gravity; indeed, he may be unaware even of his chief complaint. Special inquiry should be made about the patient\u2019s general behavior, capacity for work, personality changes, language, mood, special preoccupations and concerns, delusional ideas, hallucinatory experiences, personal habits and care in hygiene, and such faculties as memory and judgment."

As the stage of posttraumatic dementia recedes, the patient may find it impossible to work or to adjust to his family situation.

Unlike the postconcussion syndrome described above, in which there is a certain uniformity, these traits vary with the patient\u2019s age, past experience, and environmental stresses. Extremes of age have been particularly important in our experience. The most prominent behavioral abnormality in children, described by Bowman and colleagues, is a change in personality. They become impulsive, impatient, unable to sit still, or may become heedless of the consequences of their actions and lacking in appreciation of social norms\u2014much like those who in the past had recovered from encephalitis lethargica.

When such patients are calmed by reassurance and encouraged to try harder, their mental function improves, indicating that intellectual deterioration has not occurred. Conversely, it is helpful to remember that demented patients in the mid-stages of the process infrequently have sufficient insight to complain of mental deterioration; if they admit to poor memory, they do so without conviction or full appreciation of the degree of their disability. The physician must not rely on the patient\u2019s statements alone in gauging the efficiency of mental function and should seek corroboration from family members. Yet another problem is that of the impulsive, cantankerous, and quarrelsome patient who is a constant source of distress to employer and family. Such changes in personality and behavior (as, e.g., in Huntington disease) may precede or mask early intellectual deterioration."

Diffuse cerebral and hippocampal atrophy with ex vacuo ventricular and cortical sulcal dilation is noted. Bottom: Coronal T1-weighted MRI of a 70-year-old woman with behavioral variant frontotemporal lobar dementia. Atrophy of the right greater than left temporal lobes is out of proportion to atrophy of the frontal and parietal lobes. Figure 38-4. Axial CT from a 54-year-old mildly demented woman with a 10-year history of Huntington chorea. The bulge in the inferolateral border of the lateral ventricle, normally created by the head of the caudate nucleus, is absent. There is also diffuse enlargement of the lateral ventricles."

He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

One notes in them a tendency to describe their pain vaguely and a preference to discuss the degree of their disability and their mistreatment at the hands of the medical profession. The description of the pain may vary considerably from one examination to other. Often also, the region(s) in which pain is experienced and its radiation are nonphysiologic, and the condition fails to respond to rest and inactivity. These features and a negative examination of the back should lead one to suspect a psychologic factor. A few patients, usually frank malingerers, adopt bizarre gaits and attitudes, such as walking with the trunk flexed at almost a right angle (camptocormia), and are unable to straighten up. Or the patient may be unable to bend forward even a few degrees, despite the absence of muscle spasm, and may wince at the"
