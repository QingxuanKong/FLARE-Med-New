    "question": "Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1\u00df, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment?",

This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Given that RCC can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1\\u00E0 hydroxylase activity, even in the absence of hypoxia, it is likely that RCC cells under normoxic conditions will have inhibited VHL protein activity, leading to increased levels of HIF-1\\u00E0.

With hypoxia, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1\u03b1 rapidly accumulates due to the inhibition of the HIF prolylhydroxylases, which normally promote HIF1\u03b1 proteasomal degradation. HIF1\u03b1 then dimerizes with HIF1\u03b2 and the dimer moves to the nucleus, where it upregulates a number of genes whose protein products are involved in energy metabolism, angiogenesis, and apoptosis, enhancing oxygen delivery and metabolic adaptation to hypoxia. This takes the form of a complex interplay among factors that regulate perfusion, cellular redox state, and mitochondrial function. For example, upregulation of NO production by sepsis results in vasodilatation and reduction in mitochondrial respiration and oxygen consumption. In addition, HIF1 activation in endothelial cells may be important for adaptive preservation of the microvasculature during and after hypoxia. Better understanding of the role that the HIFs"

Thus, pVHL, in complex with other proteins, regulates the expression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1 and HIF-2) such that loss of functional pVHL leads to a stabilization of the HIF protein complexes, resulting in VEGF overexpression and tumor angiogenesis.

            "content": "Both sporadic and germ line mutations result in constitutively active KIT or PDGFRA receptor tyrosine kinases and produce intracellular signals that promote tumor cell proliferation and survival (Chapter 6). In GISTs without KIT or PDGFRA mutations, genes encoding components of the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex are most commonly affected. These mutations result in loss of SDH function and confer increased risk for both GIST and paraganglioma. One mutant allele is often inherited, with the second copy of the gene being either mutated or otherwise lost in the tumor. The loss of SDH causes a number of metabolic changes, including increased production of reactive oxygen species, activation of hypoxia induced factor (HIF), and increased dependency on glycolysis for ATP production, but how these alterations lead to transformation is uncertain. http://ebooksmedicine.net"

            "content": "Hypoxia-inducible factor, which is important in high-altitude adaptation, controls transcriptional responses to hypoxia throughout the body and is involved in the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the brain, erythropoiesis, and other pulmonary and cardiac functions at high altitudes. In particular, the gene EPAS1, which codes for transcriptional regulator hypoxia-inducible factor 2\u03b1, appears to play an important role in the adaptation of Tibetans living at high altitude, resulting in lower hemoglobin concentrations than are found in the Han Chinese. For acute altitude illness, a single gene variant is unlikely to be found, but the differences in the susceptibility of individuals and populations, familial clustering of cases, and a positive association of some genetic variants all clearly support a role for genetics. Approximately 58 candidate genes have been tested, and at least one variant from 17 of these genes is associated with altitude illness."

Few drugs have been developed to attempt to directly target the process of metastasis, in part because the specifics of the critical steps in the process that would be potentially good targets for drugs are still being identified. However, a number of potential targets are known. HER2 can enhance the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells, and as discussed above, the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, which targets HER2, improves survival in the adjuvant setting for HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Other potential targets that increase metastatic potential of cells in preclinical studies include HIF-1 and -2, transcription factors induced by hypoxia within tumors; growth factors (e.g., cMET and VEGFR); oncogenes (e.g., SRC); adhesion molecules (e.g., focal adhesion kinase [FAK]); ECM proteins (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases-1 and -2); and inflammatory molecules (e.g., COX-2)."

            "content": "When tumor cells arise in or metastasize to an avascular area, they grow to a size limited by hypoxemia and nutrient deprivation. Hypoxemia, a key regulator of tumor angiogenesis, causes the transcriptional induction of the gene encoding VEGF. VEGF and its receptors are required for embryonic vasculogenesis (development of new blood vessels when none preexist) and normal (wound healing, corpus luteum formation) and pathologic angiogenesis (tumor angiogenesis, inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis). VEGF-A is a heparin-binding glycoprotein with at least four isoforms (splice variants) that regulates blood vessel formation by binding to the RTKs VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, which are expressed on all ECs in addition to a subset of hematopoietic cells (Fig. 102e-9). VEGFR2 regulates EC proliferation, migration, and survival, whereas VEGFR1 may act as an antagonist of R2 in ECs but is probably also important for angioblast differentiation during embryogenesis. Tumor vessels may be"

            "content": "Initially, the pattern of FGF production in fly embryos is defined by the D-V and A-P patterning systems discussed earlier. In later stages of development, however, FGF expression is induced by transcription regulators called hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) that are activated by hypoxia (low oxygen levels). In this way, hypoxia stimulates the formation of finer and finer and more extensively branched trachea, until the oxygen supply is sufficient to stop the process. Hypoxia and HIFs have similar roles in vertebrates, especially in the development of blood vessels, as we shall see in the next chapter."
