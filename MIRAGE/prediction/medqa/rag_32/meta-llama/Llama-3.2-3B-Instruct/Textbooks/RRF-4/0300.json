    "question": "A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of an irregular gait 3 days after receiving age-appropriate vaccinations. Examination of the lower extremities shows no redness or swelling. When the child stands on his right leg, his left leg drops and his pelvis tilts towards the left. Sensation to light touch is normal in both legs. This patient's symptoms are most likely due to the injection of the vaccine into which of the following locations?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Inferolateral quadrant of the right buttock",
        "B": "Inferomedial quadrant of the right buttock",
        "C": "Inferomedial quadrant of the left buttock",
        "D": "Superomedial quadrant of the right buttock"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the symptoms described and correlate them with the potential side effects of vaccinations administered in different locations. The patient presents with an irregular gait, specifically, the left leg drops and the pelvis tilts towards the left when standing on the right leg. This suggests a neurological issue, likely related to the nerve roots in the lower spine. The sensation to light touch is normal in both legs, which indicates that the sensory pathways are intact. The symptoms occurred 3 days after receiving vaccinations, suggesting a reaction to the vaccine. The most common nerve roots affected by the nerve blocks in the lower spine are those in the lumbar and sacral regions, which correspond to the gluteal and sciatic nerve roots. The gluteal nerve roots are located in the gluteal region, which is the area where the vaccine is typically administered in the buttock region. The correct answer can be deduced by considering the relationship between the vaccine administration site and the nerve roots affected. The gluteal region is the most likely location for the vaccine to cause nerve damage leading to the described symptoms. Therefore, the most likely location for the injection that caused the patient's symptoms is the inferomedial quadrant of the right buttock, which corresponds to the sciatic nerve root, or more specifically the L4-S1 nerve roots. This is because the sciatic nerve is formed from the L4-S3 nerve roots and the symptoms described are consistent with nerve root irritation or compression, which is a known complication of gluteal injections in children. The other options are less likely to cause the described symptoms. Option A, the inferolateral quadrant of the right buttock, is less likely to cause nerve root irritation. Option C, the inferomedial quadrant of the left buttock, would not cause symptoms in the right leg. Option D, the superomedial quadrant of the right buttock, is also less likely to cause nerve root irritation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

At about 2 to 3 years of age, boys develop an awkward gait and an inability to run properly. Some have an antecedent history of mild slowness in attaining motor milestones or poor head control during infancy. Examination shows firm calf hypertrophy and mild to moderate proximal leg weakness with a hyperlordotic, waddling gait. The child typically arises from a lying position on the floor by using his arms to climb up his legs and body (Gower sign). Arm weakness is evident by age 6 years, and most boys are wheelchair dependent by age 12 years. Other manifestations include cardiomyopathy, scoliosis, respiratory decline, and, in some boys, cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. Many boys with Duchenne live into adulthood. Most die in their 20s or early 30s, usually as a result of progressive respiratory decline or cardiac dysfunction."

The venous drainage of the testis is via the pampiniform plexus of veins that runs within the spermatic cord. A varicocele is a collection of dilated veins that arise from the pampiniform plexus.

Findings of deep venous insufficiency include increased leg circumference, venous varicosities, edema, and skin changes. The edema, which is usually pitting, may be confined to the ankles, extend above the ankles to the knees, or involve the thighs in severe cases. Over time, the edema may become less pitting and more indurated. Dermatologic findings associated with venous stasis include hyperpigmentation, erythema, eczema, lipodermatosclerosis, atrophie blanche, and a phlebectasia corona. Lipodermatosclerosis is the combination of induration, hemosiderin deposition, and inflammation, and typically occurs in"

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

The classic clinical manifestationsconsist of fever, polyarticular arthralgias, lymphadenopathy, andcutaneous symptoms. Cutaneous lesions vary and may includeurticaria, angioedema, erythema multiforme, morbilliformrash, and a palpable purpura or serpiginous rash at the interfaceof the dorsal and palmar or plantar aspects of the hands and feet. Carditis, glomerulonephritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, encephalomyelitis, and peripheral neuritis are rare complications."

            "content": "The principal observable features of sensory-ataxic gait are the brusqueness of movement of the legs and in its extreme, stamping of the feet as the foot is forcibly brought down onto the floor (apparently to detect the location of the foot as a substitute for proprioception). The feet are placed far apart to correct the instability, and patients carefully watch both the ground and their legs. As they step out, their legs are flung abruptly forward and outward, in irregular steps of variable length and height. The body is held in a slightly flexed position, and some of the weight is supported on the cane that the severely ataxic patient usually carries. To use Ramsay Hunt\u2019s characterization, the patient with this gait disorder is recognized by his \u201cstamp and stick.\u201d As mentioned, the most specific feature is that the ataxia is markedly exaggerated when the patient is deprived of visual cues, as in walking in the dark. Such patients, when asked to stand with feet together and eyes"

The signs of either the adrenal insufficiency or the cerebral lesion may be the first to appear. In the case described by Siemerling and Creutzfeldt, the first recorded example of this disorder, bronzing of the skin of the hands appeared at 4 years of age; quadriparesis, with dysarthria and dysphagia (i.e., pseudobulbar palsy), became evident at 7 years; a single seizure occurred at 8 years; and by 9 years, shortly before death, the patient was decerebrate and unresponsive. In personally observed cases, the first abnormalities appeared at 9 to 10 years and took the form of episodic vomiting, decline in scholastic performance and change in personality with inappropriate giggling and crying. After a time, severe vomiting and an episode of circulatory collapse"
