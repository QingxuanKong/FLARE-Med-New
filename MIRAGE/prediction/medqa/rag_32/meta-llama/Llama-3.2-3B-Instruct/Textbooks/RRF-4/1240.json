    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Given the information provided, here's a step-by-step analysis of the question: 1. The patient is a 3-year-old male with severe lip lacerations, a portion of his tongue appearing to be bitten off, and missing portions of the fingers on his right hand. This suggests a condition that affects the skin, muscles, and possibly the bones. 2. The family history is notable for two similar cases in male cousins on the mother's side. This indicates an X-linked pattern of inheritance. 3. The urinalysis revealed a high level of uric acid. This is a key clue, as it suggests that the disorder may be related to uric acid metabolism. 4. The combination of X-linked inheritance, the specific symptoms, and the elevated uric acid levels in the urinalysis points towards a condition known as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the HPRT1 gene, which is involved in purine metabolism. The disorder leads to an overproduction of uric acid, resulting in kidney stones, gout, and other symptoms. Therefore, the mode of inheritance for this disorder is X-linked recessive. Here's the output in the requested format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and family history suggest an X-linked recessive disorder. The elevated uric acid levels in the urinalysis further support this conclusion. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a known X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the HPRT1 gene, which is involved in purine metabolism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

A son inherits the Y chromosome from his father and one maternal X chromosome. Thus, the characteristic features of X-linked inheritance are (1) the absence of father-to-son transmission, and (2) the fact that all daughters of an affected male are obligate carriers of the mutant allele (Fig. 82-13C). The risk of developing disease due to a mutant X-chromosomal gene differs in the two sexes. Because males have only one X chromosome, they are hemizygous for the mutant allele; thus, they are more likely to develop the mutant phenotype, regardless of whether the mutation is dominant or recessive. A female may be either heterozygous or homozygous for the mutant allele, which may be dominant or recessive. The terms X-linked dominant or X-linked recessive are therefore only applicable to expression of the mutant"

Although it carries the names of Lesch and Nyhan (see their 1964 description), the occurrence of uricemia in association with spasticity and choreoathetosis in early childhood had been described earlier by Cateland Schmidt. Essentially, it is a hereditary choreoathetosis with self-mutilation and hyperuricemia. The affected children appear normal at birth and usually develop on schedule up to 3 to 6 months of age. Maturational delay then sets in, initially with hypotonia that later gives way to hypertonia. Also, the patient\u2019s behavior becomes abnormal, with aggressiveness and compulsive actions. The uncontrollable self-mutilation, mainly of the lips, occurs early (during the second and third year), and spasticity, choreoathetosis, and tremor come later. Most of the children learn to walk. Speech is delayed, and once attained, it is dysarthric and remains so throughout life. Mental retardation is moderately severe."

In contrast, mtDNA point mutations or duplications can be transmitted down the maternal line. Accordingly, the father of an affected individual has no risk of harboring the disease-causing mutation, and a male cannot transmit the mtDNA mutation to his offspring. In contrast, the mother of an affected individual usually harbors the same mutation but might be completely asymptomatic. This wide phenotypic variability is primarily related to the phenomena of heteroplasmy and the mutation load carried by different members of the same family. Consequently, a symptomatic or"

In this example, the proband, a 36-year-old woman (IV-1), has a strong history of breast and ovarian cancer on the paternal side of her family. The early age of onset and the co-occurrence of breast and ovarian cancer in this family suggest the possibility of an inherited mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. It is unclear however, without genetic testing, whether her father harbors such a mutation and transmitted it to her. After appropriate genetic counseling of the pro-band and her family, the most informative and cost-effective approach to DNA analysis in this family is to test the cancer-affected 42-year-old living cousin for the presence of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. If a mutation is found, then it is possible to test for this particular alteration in other family members, if they so desire.

There are both one-stent and two-stent techniques to treat bifurcation lesions; the selection of technique depends on anatomic considerations, including plaque burden, angle of side-branch take-off, plaque shift during angioplasty, and side-branch distribution. Rates of target lesion revascularization and stent thrombosis are similar between one-stent and two-stent procedures. CASE 3: INFERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION\u2014THROMBUS AND MANUAL THROMBECTOMY PART 10 Disorders of the Cardiovascular System (Figs. 297e-2 to 297e-4; Videos 297e-17 to 297e-22) A 59-year-old male presented to the emergency room with 2 h of severe midsternal chest pressure. His systolic blood pressure was 100 mmHg, and he was tachycardic in sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 90\u2013100 beats/min."

Imaging reveals a fracture of a bowed femur, secondary to minor trauma, and thin bones (see x-ray at right). Blue sclerae are also noted. At age 1 month, the infant had multiple fractures in various states of healing (right clavicle, right humerus, and right radius). A careful family history has ruled out nonaccidental trauma (child abuse) as a cause of the bone fractures. Which pairing of a defective (or deficient) molecule and the resulting pathology best fits this clinical description? A. Elastin and emphysema B. Fibrillin and Marfan disease C. Type I collagen and osteogenesis imperfecta D. Type V collagen and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome E. Vitamin C and scurvy"

On the face, the deep layers are usually closed with a 3-0 or 4-0 Vicryl/Polysorb after a minimal amount of undermining, and interrupted 5-0 or 6-0 Prolene or Nylon is used for the skin. These sutures are removed at 5 days on the face. Antibiotics are reserved for through-and-through mucosal lacerations, con-taminated wounds, bite injuries, and when delayed closure is performed (>72 hours). The chosen antibiotic should cover S aureus. Patients are instructed to avoid sunlight because this can cause pigmentary abnormalities in the suture line as it heals and matures over the first year.Eyelid lacerations are closed in layers with careful reap-proximation of the orbicularis oculi as a separate layer. Another important layer to reapproximate separately is the gray line (con-junctival margin) so as to avoid height mismatch or lid notching. Lip injuries"

A large and growing number of genetically distinct but related autosomal recessive disorders are referred to as nephronophthises. These should not be confused with the adult-onset autosomal dominant medullary cystic kidney diseases discussed above, despite the often confusing nomenclature seen in older medical literature. Nephronophthisis is quite rare but is nevertheless the most common inherited childhood form of kidney failure requiring kidney replacement therapy."

Interestingly, the height of the patient and the previous lens surgery would suggest a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and a series of blood tests and review of the family history revealed this was so. A 35-year-old male patient presented to his family practitioner because of recent weight loss (14 lb over the previous 2 months). He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets."

White, shiny, multiple transient epidermal inclusion cysts (Epstein pearls) on the hard palate are normal. Hard, marble-sized masses in the buccal mucosa are usually transient idiopathic fat necrosis. The tympanic membranes are dull, gray, opaque, and immobile in the first 1 to 4 weeks. These findings should not be confused with otitis media."
