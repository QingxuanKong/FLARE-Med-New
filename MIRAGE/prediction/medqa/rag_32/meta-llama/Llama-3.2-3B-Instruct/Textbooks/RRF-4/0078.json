    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The newborn is extremely cyanotic immediately after birth, indicating a congenital heart defect that involves either a lack of oxygenation of the blood or an abnormal connection between the systemic and pulmonary circulations. The presence of a single loud S2 heart sound and a machine-like murmur at the left upper sternal border suggests a defect that causes increased flow across the pulmonary valve, leading to pulmonary hypertension. The radiography showing an enlarged \\\"egg-shaped\\\" heart is characteristic of a condition where there is a narrow superior mediastinum due to the abnormal connection between the pulmonary and systemic circulations. The atrial septostomy performed to alleviate the condition pending definitive surgical correction suggests that the defect is a type of transposition of the great arteries or another similar condition where there is a need to increase blood flow between the atria to alleviate cyanosis. The options provided can be evaluated as follows: A. Coarctation of the aorta is characterized by narrowing of the aorta, which would not typically cause an enlarged \\\"egg-shaped\\\" heart or a machine-like murmur. B. Persistent truncus arteriosus is a condition where the single blood vessel arising from the heart gives rise to both the aorta and pulmonary artery, which does not match the described presentation. C. Transposition of the great arteries is a condition where the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle, resulting in parallel circulations and a narrow superior mediastinum, which is consistent with the described radiography. D. Tricuspid atresia is a condition where the tricuspid valve is absent or abnormally developed, which does not typically present with a machine-like murmur or an enlarged \\\"egg-shaped\\\" heart. Therefore, the most likely cause of the newborn's condition is C. Transposition of the great vessels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The underdevelopment of the right ventricle and pulmonary stenosis reduce blood flow to the lungs, leading to reduced volume of oxygenated blood returning to the heart. The defect in the interventricular septum causes mixing of oxygenated and nonoxygenated blood.

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome accounts for 1% of all congenital heart defects (Fig. 144-6) but is the most common cause of death from cardiac defects in the first month of life. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome occurs when there is failure of development of the mitral or aortic valve or the aortic arch. A small left ventricle that is unable to support normal systemic circulation is a central finding, regardless of etiology. Associated degrees of hypoplasia of the ascending aorta and aortic arch are present. Left-to-right shunting occurs at the atrial level."

However, the absence of LA enlargement and of Kerley B lines and the demonstration of fixed splitting of S2 with a grade II or III mid-systolic murmur at the mid to upper left sternal border all favor atrial septal defect over MS. Atrial septal defects with large left-to-right shunts may result in functional TS because of the enhanced diastolic flow."

However, 40% of patients with partial AV canal defects have moderate-to-severe valve incompetence, and progressive heart failure occurs early in this patient population.175 Complete AV canal defects produce more severe pathophysiologic changes because the large intra-cardiac communication and significant AV valve regurgitation contribute to ventricular volume loading and pulmonary hyper-tension. Children with complete AV canal defects develop signs of congestive heart failure within the first few months of life.Physical examination may reveal a right ventricular heave and a systolic murmur. Children may also present with endo-carditis or paradoxical emboli as a result of the intracardiac communication. Chest radiography will be consistent with con-gestive heart failure, and the EKG demonstrates right ventricu-lar hypertrophy with a prolonged PR interval and is classically associated with left axis deviation.Two-dimensional"

The murmur may be soft and difficult to hear unless auscultation is performed with the patient leaning forward at end expiration. This maneuver brings the aortic root closer to the anterior chest wall. Radiation of the murmur may provide a clue to the cause of the AR. With primary valve disease, such as that due to congenital bicuspid disease, prolapse, or endocarditis, the diastolic murmur tends to radiate along the left sternal border, where it is often louder than appreciated in the second right interspace. When AR is caused by aortic root disease, the diastolic murmur may radiate along the right sternal border. Diseases of the aortic root cause dilation or distortion of the aortic annulus and failure of leaflet"
