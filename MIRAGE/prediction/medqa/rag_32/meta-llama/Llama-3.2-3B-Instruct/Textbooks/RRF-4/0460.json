    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the physician because of a progressive development of tender breast tissue over the past 18 months. He used to ride his bicycle for exercise 4 times a week but stopped after he had an accident and injured his left testicle 3 months ago. He has gained 5 kg (11 lb) during this period. For the last 10 years, he drinks one to two beers daily and sometimes more on weekends. He occasionally takes pantoprazole for heartburn. He is 171 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 87 kg (192 lb); BMI is 30 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows bilaterally symmetrical, mildly tender gynecomastia. A nontender 1.5-cm mass is palpated in the left testis; transillumination test is negative. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient is a 32-year-old man who has developed tender breast tissue over the past 18 months, which is a progressive development. He also has gained weight and has bilaterally symmetrical, mildly tender gynecomastia. A nontender 1.5-cm mass is palpated in the left testis, and the transillumination test is negative. The patient's history of trauma to the left testis 3 months ago is also relevant. We need to consider the possible causes of these findings, including Leydig cell tumor, obesity, Klinefelter syndrome, and trauma to the testis. However, the presence of gynecomastia and a testicular mass suggests that the cause is likely related to hormonal imbalance, such as androgen deficiency or excess. The patient's history of trauma to the left testis is also a potential cause of testicular injury, which can lead to hormonal imbalance and gynecomastia. Obesity is not a direct cause of gynecomastia or testicular mass. Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition that can cause gynecomastia, but it is not directly related to the patient's history of trauma to the left testis. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of these findings is trauma to the testis, which has led to hormonal imbalance and gynecomastia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

Unfortunately, internists frequently do not examine breasts in men, and in women, they are apt to defer this evaluation to gynecologists. Because of the plausible association between early detection and improved outcome, it is the duty of every physician to identify breast abnormalities at the earliest possible stage and to institute a diagnostic workup. Women should be trained in breast self-examination (BSE). Although breast cancer in men is unusual, unilateral lesions should be evaluated in the same manner as in women, with the recognition that gynecomastia in men can sometimes begin unilaterally and is often asymmetric."

The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension.

The mass in the patient\u2019s pelvis compressed this nerve, producing his sensory and motor dysfunction. During surgery, the mass was found to be a benign nerve tumor and was excised. This patient had no long-standing neurological deficit. A 65-year-old man was examined by a surgical intern because he had a history of buttock pain and impotence. On examination he had a reduced peripheral pulse on the left foot compared to the right. On direct questioning, the patient revealed that he experienced severe left-sided buttock pain after walking 100 yards. After a short period of rest, he could walk another 100 yards before the same symptoms recurred. He also noticed that over the past year he was unable to obtain an erection. He smoked heavily and was on no other drugs or treatment."

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

Inspection revealed a bulge in the lower abdomen to the level of the umbilicus. Palpation revealed a hard and slightly irregular mass with well-defined superior and lateral borders and a less well-defined inferior border, giving the impression that the mass continued into the pelvis. The lesion was dull to percussion. Auscultation did not reveal any abnormal sounds. The doctor pondered which structures this mass may be arising from. When examining the pelvis, it is important to remember the sex differences. Common to both men and women are the rectum, bowel, bladder, and musculature. Certain pathological states are also common to both sexes, including the development of pelvic abscesses and fluid collections."

He underwent an abdominoperineal resection of the tumor and was left with a left lower abdominal colostomy (see below). Unfortunately, the man\u2019s wife left him for a number of reasons, including lack of sexual desire. He \u201cturned to drink\u201d and over the ensuing years developed cirrhosis. He was brought into the emergency room with severe bleeding from enlarged veins around his colostomy. An emergency transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt was created, which stopped all bleeding (eFigs. 4.189 and 4.190). He is now doing well in a rehabilitation program. A colostomy was necessary because of the low site of the tumor."
