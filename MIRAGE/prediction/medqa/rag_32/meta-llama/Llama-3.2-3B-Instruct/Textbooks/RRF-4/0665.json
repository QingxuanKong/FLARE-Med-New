    "question": "A 31-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-week history of a painless lump near the left wrist and tingling pain over his left hand. Physical examination shows a transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, non-tender mass over the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist. There is decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger of the left hand. The tingling pain is aggravated by tapping over the swelling. Which of the following adjacent structures is at risk of entrapment if this mass persists?",

        "A": "Ulnar artery",
        "B": "Flexor pollicis longus tendon",
        "C": "Flexor carpi radialis tendon",
        "D": "Ulnar nerve"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The symptoms described are characteristic of a carpal tunnel syndrome, which is a condition that occurs when the median nerve is compressed within the carpal tunnel. The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway on the palmar side of the wrist that contains the median nerve, along with tendons that control finger movement. The symptoms described, such as tingling pain in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger, are consistent with median nerve compression. The fact that the mass is transilluminating, rubbery, and fixed suggests a fluid-filled cyst or swelling, which is consistent with a carpal tunnel syndrome. The fact that the tingling pain is aggravated by tapping over the swelling further supports this diagnosis. The structures at risk of entrapment in carpal tunnel syndrome include the median nerve, the flexor pollicis longus tendon, and the flexor carpi radialis tendon. However, the median nerve is the most likely structure to be at risk of entrapment in this case. The ulnar nerve is not typically involved in carpal tunnel syndrome, and the flexor pollicis longus tendon and flexor carpi radialis tendon are not as commonly affected. Therefore, the correct answer is the median nerve, but since it is not listed among the options, we have to consider the closest structure that is at risk of entrapment in carpal tunnel syndrome, which is the ulnar nerve in the case of a large median cyst, but in this scenario the mass is likely to be a cyst that does not involve the ulnar nerve. The ulnar nerve is not the best answer in this case. The flexor pollicis longus tendon and flexor carpi radialis tendon are not the best answer in this case. The ulnar artery is not typically involved in carpal tunnel syndrome, so it is not the best answer. The flexor pollicis longus tendon is not typically involved in carpal tunnel syndrome, so it is not the best answer. Therefore, the best answer is not listed, but based on the options given, the best answer would be the ulnar nerve, but in this scenario, the ulnar nerve is not the best answer, so we will choose the closest structure that is at risk of entrapment in carpal tunnel syndrome, which is the flexor carpi radialis tendon, but the question asks for the structure that is at risk of entrapment if the mass persists, and based on the symptoms described, the flexor carpi radialis tendon is the closest structure that is at risk of entrapment in carpal tunnel syndrome, so the best answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

He is then switched to celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily, and on this regimen his joint symptoms and heartburn resolve. Two years later, he returns with increased joint symptoms. His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor. With the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, he is started on a regimen"

The etiology is believed to be from a fragment of carti-lage from the central physis. Histology shows well-differentiated hyaline cartilage with lamellar bone and calcification.94Figure 44-28.

As in other locations, these are potentially limb-threat-ening issues. Principle symptoms are pain in the affected com-partments, tense swelling, tenderness to palpation over the compartment, and pain with passive stretch of the muscles of the compartment.36 Pulse changes are a late finding; normal pulses do not rule out compartment syndrome.There are three compartments in the forearm and four groups of compartments in the hand. The volar forearm is one compartment. On the dorsum of the forearm, there is the dorsal compartment as"

            "content": "Ganglion cysts are synovial fluid-filled cysts about the wrist. The most common location is the dorsum of the wrist near the radiocarpal joint, followed by the volar radial aspect of the wrist. The defect is in the joint capsule, which allows synovial fluid into the soft tissues with wrist use, where it can become walled off with fibrous tissue. Often, in skeletally immature patients, the process is benign and disappears over time. Large ganglion cysts or cysts that are painful and interfere with function may require more aggressive therapy. Aspiration and steroid injection into the cyst may be helpful, but many will recur. Surgical excision will remove the tract that attaches to the wrist joint, so it is usually curative."

The symptoms are insidious in onset and slowly progressive, but occasionally they seem to evolve or to worsen rapidly over a matter of days. The initial symptoms are usually referred to the distal portions of the limbs and progress proximally if the illness remains untreated. The feet are always affected earlier and more severely than the hands. Usually some aspect of motor disability is part of the chief complaint, but in about one-third of the patients the main complaints are pain and paresthesias. It is this painful syndrome that has been the most prominent feature in the patients we have encountered. The discomfort takes several forms: a dull, constant ache in the feet or legs; sharp and lancinating pains, momentary in duration, like those of tabes dorsalis; sensations of cramping or tightness in the muscles of the feet and calves; or band-like feelings around the legs."

It is important to completely excise the stalk because this will greatly reduce tumor recurrence even in the setting of residual tumor. If tumor is suspected to have extended into the joint, the joint must be opened and all tumor removed. Despite this being a benign lesion, local recurrence is varies widely from 4% to 44%. Some variants can mimic more aggressive processes, and malignancy must be considered if aggressive features are identified, such as direct bony invasion.82Lipoma.

There is slight wasting and weakness of the hypothenar, interosseous, adductor pollicis, and deep flexor muscles of the fourth and fifth fingers (i.e., the muscles innervated by the lower trunk of the brachial plexus and ulnar nerve). Weakness of the flexor muscles of the forearm may be present in advanced cases. Tendon reflexes are usually preserved. In addition, most patients complain of an intermittent aching of the arm, particularly of the ulnar side, and about half of them complain also of numbness and tingling along the ulnar border of the forearm and hand. A loss of superficial sensation in these areas is variable. It may be possible to reproduce the sensory symptoms by firm pressure just above the clavicle or by traction on the arm. Vascular features are often absent or minimal in patients with the neurologic form of the syndrome."
