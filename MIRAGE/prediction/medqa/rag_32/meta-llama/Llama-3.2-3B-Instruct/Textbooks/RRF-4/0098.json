    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with significant neck pain after a motor vehicle accident, which is a high-risk mechanism for cervical spine injury. The patient denies weakness, numbness, or tingling in his extremities, but this does not rule out a cervical spine injury. The patient's vital signs are stable, but it is essential to assess for potential cervical spine instability. The American College of Radiology (ACR) and the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommend that imaging be obtained in patients with a high-risk mechanism of injury, such as a motor vehicle accident, and in patients who are unstable or have a negative clinical examination. The NEXUS low-risk criteria, which include the patient's age, mechanism of injury, and the presence or absence of neurological deficits, suggest that this patient may not require immediate imaging. However, the patient's significant neck pain warrants further evaluation. The most appropriate next step is to perform cervical immobilization to prevent further injury, as this is a simple and effective way to stabilize the cervical spine. Imaging can be obtained later if the patient's condition worsens or if the clinical examination is concerning for a cervical spine injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

He noted that there was reduced sensation in both legs, and there was virtually no power in extensor or flexor groups. The patient was tachycardic, which was believed to be due to pain, and the blood pressure obtained in the ambulance measured 120/80 mm Hg. It was noted that the patient\u2019s current blood pressure was 80/40 mm Hg; however, the patient did not complain of typical clinical symptoms of hypotension. On first inspection, it is difficult to \u201cadd up\u201d these clinical symptoms and signs. In essence we have a progressive paraplegia associated with severe back pain and an anomaly in blood pressure measurements, which are not compatible with the clinical state of the patient. It was deduced that the blood pressure measurements were obtained in different arms, and both were reassessed."

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

The usual pattern is an ascending paralysis that may be first noticed as rubbery legs. Weakness typically evolves over hours to a few days and is frequently accompanied by tingling dysesthesias in the extremities. The legs are usually more affected than the arms, and facial diparesis is present in 50% of affected individuals. The lower cranial nerves are also frequently involved, causing bulbar weakness with difficulty handling secretions and maintaining an airway; the diagnosis in these patients may initially be mistaken for brainstem ischemia. Pain in the neck, shoulder, back, or diffusely over the spine is also common in the early stages of GBS, occurring in ~50% of patients. Most patients require hospitalization, and in different series, up to 30% require ventilatory assistance at some time during the illness. The need for mechanical ventilation is associated"
