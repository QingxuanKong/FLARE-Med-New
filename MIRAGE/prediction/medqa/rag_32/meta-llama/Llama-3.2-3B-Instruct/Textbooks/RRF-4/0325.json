    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and the provided options:\\n\\nThe patient is a 31-year-old woman with a 5-month history of intermittent flank pain and a history of five urinary tract infections over the past 2 years. She has bilateral, nontender upper abdominal masses and elevated serum studies showing urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations within the normal range. Renal ultrasonography reveals bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple parenchymal anechoic masses.\\n\\nThe patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of a renal cystic disease, given the presence of flank pain, urinary tract infections, and renal ultrasonography showing multiple parenchymal anechoic masses. Let's evaluate the options:\\n\\nA. Medullary sponge kidney: This is a congenital disorder characterized by the presence of ectatic tubules in the medulla, leading to cysts in the medullary and papillary regions. It is often associated with urinary tract infections and flank pain, but it typically presents with multiple small cysts, not large masses.\\n\\nB. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD): This is a genetic disorder characterized by the progressive formation of multiple cysts in the kidneys, which can lead to renal enlargement, hypertension, and eventually end-stage renal disease. The patient's age of onset, presence of multiple large masses, and family history of ADPKD make this a strong consideration.\\n\\nC. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD): This is another genetic disorder that affects the kidneys, causing cysts and renal enlargement. However, it typically presents in childhood and is less common than ADPKD.\\n\\nD. Obstructive cystic dysplasia: This is a rare condition characterized by the presence of cysts in the kidneys due to obstruction. However, it is not typically associated with the large masses seen in this patient.\\n\\nBased on the patient's presentation, age, and family history, the most likely diagnosis is B. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

Persistent urinary tract infection, persistent proteinuria, or hematuria in patients with cancer should raise suspicion of ureteral obstruction. Total anuria and/or anuria alternating with polyuria may occur. A slow, continuous rise in the serum creatinine level necessitates immediate evaluation. Renal ultrasound is the safest and cheapest way to identify hydronephrosis. The function of an obstructed kidney can be evaluated by a nuclear scan.

Hundreds to thousands of cysts are usually present in the kidneys of most patients in the fifth decade (Fig. 339-2). Enlarged kidneys can each reach a fourfold increase in length and weigh up to 20 times the normal weight. The clinical presentations of ADPKD are highly variable. Although many patients are asymptomatic until the fourth to fifth decade of life and are diagnosed by incidental discoveries of hypertension or abdominal masses, back or flank pain is a frequent symptom in ~60% of patients with ADPKD.

She is obese (body mass index [BMI] 33), does not exercise, and spends a good portion of her work day in a seated position. She eats a low-sugar diet and regularly eats packaged frozen meals for dinner because she doesn\u2019t have time to cook regularly. Her most recent laboratory values include a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that is above goal at 160 mg/dL (goal < 100 mg/dL) and a hemo-globin A1c that is well controlled at 6%. Her blood pressure is high at 160/100 mm Hg. Her prescription medications include simvastatin, metformin, and benazepril. She also takes over-the-counter ibuprofen for occasional knee pain and a multivitamin supplement once daily. She has heard good things about natural products and asks you if taking a garlic supplement daily could help to bring her blood"

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

Intrinsic: Associated with a history of drug exposure (aminoglycosides, NSAIDs), infection, or exposure to contrast media or toxins (e.g., myoglobin, myeloma protein). Hematuria or tea-colored urine, foamy urine (from proteinuria), hypertension, and/or edema may also be present. Atheroemboli: Subcutaneous nodules, livedo reticularis, digital ischemia. Postrenal: Prostatic disease, \u2193 urine output leading to suprapubic pain, distended bladder and \ufb02 ank pain. Check serum electrolytes. Examine the urine for RBCs, WBCs, casts (see Table 2.16-4), and urine eosinophils."

            "content": "Although the diagnosis of IHD can be made with a high degree of confidence from the history and physical examination, a number of simple laboratory tests can be helpful. The urine should be examined for evidence of diabetes mellitus and renal disease (including microalbuminuria) since these conditions accelerate atherosclerosis. Similarly, examination of the blood should include measurements of lipids (cholesterol\u2014total, LDL, HDL\u2014and triglycerides), glucose (hemoglobin ), creatinine, hematocrit, and, if indicated based on the physical examination, thyroid function. A chest x-ray is important as it may show the consequences of IHD, i.e., cardiac enlargement, ventricular aneurysm, or signs of heart failure. These signs can support the diagnosis of IHD and are important in assessing the degree of cardiac damage. Evidence exists that an elevated level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) (specifically, between 0 and 3 mg/dL) is an independent risk factor for IHD and may be useful"

Past medical history included schizophrenia, for which he required institutional care; treatment had included neuroleptics and intermittent lithium, the latter restarted 6 months before admission. The patient was treated with antibiotics and intubated for several days, with the development of polyuria (3\u20135 L/d), hypernatremia, and acute renal insufficiency; the peak plasma Na+ concentration was 156 meq/L, and peak creatinine was 2.6 mg/dL. Urine osmolality was measured once and reported as 157 mOsm/kg, with a coincident plasma osmolality of 318 mOsm/kg. Lithium was stopped on admission to the ICU. On physical examination, the patient was alert, extubated, and thirsty. Weight was 97.5 kg. Urine output for the previous 24 h had been 3.4 L, with an IV intake of 2 L/d of D5W."

The patient had noted progressive weakness over several days, to the point that he was unable to rise from bed. Past medical history was notable for small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, liver, and adrenals. The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced. Blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, increasing to 160/98 mmHg after 1 L of saline, with a JVP at 8 cm. There was generalized muscle weakness.

Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age. A 35-year-old woman visited her family practitioner because she had a \u201cbloating\u201d feeling and an increase in abdominal girth. The family practitioner examined the lower abdomen, which revealed a mass that extended from the superior pubic rami to the level of the umbilicus. The superior margin of the mass was easily palpated, but the inferior margin appeared to be less well defined. This patient has a pelvic mass. When examining a patient in the supine position, the observer should uncover the whole of the abdomen."
