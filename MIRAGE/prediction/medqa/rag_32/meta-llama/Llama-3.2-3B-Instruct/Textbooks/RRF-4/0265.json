An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Systemic spread often occurs and can involve any tissue; common sites include meninges (meningitis), cervical lymph nodes, kidneys (sterile pyuria), and lumbar vertebrae (Pott disease). I. BASIC PRINCIPLES A. Group of diseases characterized by airway obstruction; lung does not empty, and air is trapped. 1. Volume ofair that can be forcefully expired is decreased (-.I, FVC), especially during the first second ofexpiration (-.l,-.l, FEV); results in -.I, FEV :FVC ratio 2. Total lung capacity (TLC) is usually increased due to air trapping. II. CHRONIC BRONCHITIS A. Chronic productive cough lasting at least 3 months over a minimum of 2 years; highly associated with smoking B. Characterized by hypertrophy of bronchial mucous glands (Fig. 9.7)"

            "content": "Acute pulmonary infection is often diagnosed in association with point-source outbreaks. Typical symptoms include the abrupt onset of fever, chills, pleuritic chest pain, arthralgias, and myalgias. Cough is initially nonproductive but frequently becomes purulent as disease progresses. Chest radiographs usually reveal alveolar infiltrates with consolidation. Pleural effusions and hilar adenopathy are uncommon. Most patients diagnosed with pulmonary blastomycosis have chronic indolent pneumonia with signs and symptoms of fever, weight loss, productive cough, and hemoptysis. The most common radiologic findings are alveolar infiltrates with or without cavitation, mass lesions that mimic bronchogenic carcinoma, and fibronodular infiltrates. Hematogenous dissemination to the skin, bones, and genitourinary tract occurs most often in association with chronic pulmonary disease. Although blastomycosis is not considered an opportunistic infection, immunosuppression has been recognized as a risk"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously.

She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet.

            "content": "Pleuritis, the most common pulmonary manifestation of RA, may produce pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea, as well as a pleural friction rub and effusion. Pleural effusions tend to be exudative with increased numbers of monocytes and neutrophils. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) may also occur in patients with RA and is heralded by symptoms of dry cough and progressive shortness of breath. ILD can be associated with cigarette smoking and is generally found in patients with higher disease activity, although it may be diagnosed in up to 3.5% of patients prior to the onset of joint symptoms. Diagnosis is readily made by high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) scan. Pulmonary function testing shows a restrictive pattern (e.g., reduced total lung capacity) with a reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). The presence of ILD confers a poor prognosis. The prognosis is not quite as poor as that of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (e.g., usual interstitial pneumonitis) because ILD"

            "content": "In virtually all instances, evaluation of chronic cough merits a chest radiograph. The list of diseases that can cause persistent cough without other symptoms and without detectable abnormalities on physical examination is long. It includes serious illnesses such as sarcoidosis or Hodgkin\u2019s disease in young adults, lung cancer in older patients, and (worldwide) pulmonary tuberculosis. An abnormal chest film prompts an evaluation aimed at explaining the cough. In a patient with chronic productive cough, examination of expectorated sputum is warranted. Purulent-appearing sputum should be sent for routine bacterial culture and, in certain circumstances, mycobacterial culture as well. Cytologic examination of mucoid sputum may be useful to assess for malignancy and to distinguish neutrophilic from eosinophilic bronchitis. Expectoration of blood\u2014whether streaks of blood, blood mixed with airway secretions, or pure blood\u2014deserves a special approach to assessment and management (see"
