This suggests that she has a genetic condition that requires regular monitoring and surgical intervention. The patient's father had a similar condition, which implies a possible genetic inheritance pattern. The patient's age of onset (10 years) and the fact that she has been undergoing regular colonoscopies since a young age hint towards an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. This pattern is consistent with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of polyps in the colon and rectum, leading to an increased risk of colorectal cancer. The fact that the patient's father had a similar condition also supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the genetic inheritance pattern of the patient's disease is likely Autosomal Dominant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The relative risk for developing colorectal cancer increases to 1.75 in such individuals and may be even higher if the relative was afflicted before age 60.

Upper endoscopy is therefore recommended for surveillance every 1 to 3 years beginning at age 25 to 30 years.Once the diagnosis of FAP has been made and polyps are developing, treatment is surgical. Four factors affect the choice of operation: age of the patient; presence and severity of symp-toms; extent of rectal polyposis; and presence and location of cancer or desmoid tumors. Three operative procedures can be considered: total proctocolectomy with an end (Brooke) ileos-tomy; total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis; and restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch\u2013anal anas-tomosis (IPAA) with or without a temporary ileostomy. Most patients elect to have an ileal pouch\u2013anal anastomosis in the absence of a distal"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

There is no gender predilection, and they are present in nearly 50% of adults living in the Western world beginning at age 50. Because these polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, current recommendations are that all adults in the United States undergo screening colonoscopy starting at 50 years of age. Because individuals with a family history are at risk for developing colon cancer earlier in life, they are typically screened at least 10 years before the youngest age at which a relative was diagnosed. While adenomas are less common in Asia, their frequency has risen (in parallel with an increasing incidence of colorectal adenocarcinoma) as Western diets and lifestyles become more common. http://ebooksmedicine.net"

Screening and colectomy guidelines for this syndrome are less clear than for polyposis coli, but annual to biennial colonoscopic surveillance is generally recommended starting at age 25\u201330."

For example, mutations in PMS2 or MSH6 result in a more attenuated form of Lynch syndrome when compared to mutations in other genes. MSH6 inactivation also appears to be associated with a higher risk for endometrial cancer. Further significance of these specific mutations remains to be determined.Screening colonoscopy is recommended annually for at-risk patients beginning at either age 20 to 25 years or 10 years younger than the youngest age at diagnosis in the family, which-ever comes first. Because of the high risk of endometrial carci-noma, transvaginal ultrasound or endometrial aspiration biopsy is also recommended annually after age 25 to 35 years.

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

            "content": "Because stool becomes more formed as it passes into the transverse and descending colon, tumors arising there tend to impede the passage of stool, resulting in the development of abdominal cramping, occasional obstruction, and even perforation. Radiographs of the abdomen often reveal characteristic annular, constricting lesions (\u201capple-core\u201d or \u201cnapkin-ring\u201d) (Fig. 110-2). Cancers arising in the rectosigmoid are often associated with hematochezia, tenesmus, and narrowing of the caliber of stool; anemia is an infrequent finding. While these symptoms may lead patients and their physicians to suspect the presence of hemorrhoids, the development of rectal bleeding and/or altered bowel habits demands a prompt digital rectal examination and proctosigmoidoscopy."
