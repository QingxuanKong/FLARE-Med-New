    "question": "A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She has noticed trembling of her hands for the past 5 months. These movements are only present when she reaches to pick up an object or answer the phone. She has a history of major depressive disorder but has been off medications for the past 3 years. Her father had Parkinson's disease and died 6 months ago. She drinks a glass of wine daily. She appears anxious. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 118/74 mm Hg. A low-frequency tremor is present that worsens as she reaches out for an object. She consistently overshoots her target. There is no tremor present when her arms are held outstretched. There is increased tone in the lower extremities and Babinski's sign is positive bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

        "D": "Subthalamic nucleus stroke\n\""
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms, let's analyze the key points from the case presentation: 1. The patient has a low-frequency tremor that worsens as she reaches out for an object, which is a classic symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). 2. The tremor is present only when she is using her hands for fine motor tasks, such as picking up objects or answering the phone. 3. The tremor is not present when her arms are held outstretched, which suggests that it is a resting tremor. 4. The patient has increased tone in the lower extremities and a positive Babinski's sign bilaterally, which are also characteristic of Parkinson's disease. 5. The patient has a history of major depressive disorder, but she has been off medications for the past 3 years, which makes it less likely that her symptoms are a side effect of medication. 6. The patient's father had Parkinson's disease, which increases the likelihood of a genetic component to her condition. 7. The patient's symptoms are progressive, as she has been experiencing tremors for 5 months. Considering these points, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is degenerated substantia nigra, which is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease. The substantia nigra is a critical component of the basal ganglia, and its degeneration leads to the characteristic motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, including resting tremors, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. The other options are less likely: A. Cerebellar demyelination is more likely to cause ataxia and coordination problems, rather than the tremors and rigidity described in this case. C. Degenerated caudate nucleus is more commonly associated with Huntington's disease, which has a different set of symptoms and progression. D. Subthalamic nucleus stroke would likely cause more severe motor symptoms, such as hemiparesis and hemiplegia, which are not described in this case. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Degenerated substantia nigra.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Tremor can be on intention or occasionally resting and, in advanced disease, can take on a wing-beating characteristic. Other features include parkinsonism with bradykinesia, dystonia (particularly facial grimacing), dysarthria, and dysphagia. More than half of those with neurologic features have a history of psychiatric disturbances, including depression, mood swings, and overt psychosis. Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings are seen in 80% of those with hepatic presentations and virtually all with neurologic features. KF rings represent the deposition of copper in Descemet\u2019s membrane around the cornea.

This tremor, unlike the slower one, persists throughout voluntary movement, is not evident with the limb in a resting position, and is more easily suppressed by relaxation.

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

The patient had no significant adverse effects from this dosage. At age 21, she had a second tonic-clonic seizure while in college; further discussion with her room-mate at that time revealed a history of two recent episodes of 1\u20132 minutes of altered consciousness with lip smacking (focal impaired awareness seizure, formerly complex partial seizure). A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid. Four days later, electroencephalography (EEG)"

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

            "content": "Simple clinical clues are useful in the differential diagnosis. Early prominent gait disturbance with only mild memory loss suggests vascular dementia or, rarely, NPH (see below). Resting tremor with stooped posture, bradykinesia, and masked facies suggest PD (Chap. 449). When dementia occurs after a well-established diagnosis of PD, PD dementia (PDD) is usually the correct diagnosis, but many patients with this diagnosis will show a mixture of AD and Lewy body disease at autopsy. The early appearance of parkinsonian features in association with fluctuating alertness, visual hallucinations, or delusional misidentification suggests DLB. Chronic alcoholism should prompt the search for vitamin deficiency. Loss of joint position and vibration sensibility accompanied by Babinski signs suggests vitamin B12 deficiency (Chap. 456). Early onset of a focal seizure suggests a metastatic or primary brain neoplasm (Chap. 118). Previous or ongoing depression raises suspicion for depression-related"

The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures?

            "content": "Old age is thought always to carry a liability to tremulousness, and indeed, one sees this association with some frequency. The head, chin, or hands tremble and the voice quavers, yet there is not the usual slowness and poverty of movement, facial impassivity, or flexed posture that would stamp the condition as parkinsonian. Some instances of tremor are clearly familial, having appeared or worsened only late in life. However, the relation of tremulousness to aging is sometimes open to doubt. Charcot, in a review of over 2,000 elderly inhabitants of the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital, could find only about 30 with tremor. Some cases probably represent the exaggeration or emergence of essential tremor, but many cases cannot be explained on this basis. Spastic or spasmodic dysphonia, a disorder of middle and late life characterized by spasm of all the throat muscles on attempted speech, is discussed in Chap. 4."
