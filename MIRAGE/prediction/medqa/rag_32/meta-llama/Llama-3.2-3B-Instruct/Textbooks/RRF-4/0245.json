    "question": "A 70-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for 1 day. Computed tomography shows a small bowel perforation. The patient is prepared for emergent exploratory laparotomy. She is sedated with midazolam, induced with propofol, intubated, and maintained on nitrous oxide and isoflurane for the duration of the surgery. A single perforation in the terminal ileum is diagnosed intraoperatively and successfully repaired. The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit. The ventilator is set at an FiO2 of 50%, tidal volume of 1000 mL, respiratory rate of 12/min, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 2.5 cm H2O. Her temperature is 37.3\u00b0C (99.1\u00b0F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 111/50 mm Hg. She is responsive to painful stimuli. Lung examination shows bilateral rales. Abdominal examination shows a distended abdomen and intact abdominal surgical incisions. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis shows:\npH 7.44\npO2 54 mm Hg\npCO2 31 mm Hg\nHCO3- 22 mm Hg\nWhich of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?\"",

Her arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.44, pO2 of 54 mmHg, pCO2 of 31 mmHg, and HCO3- of 22 mmHg.\\n\\nThe patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis (pH 7.44) with a low pCO2 (31 mmHg) and a low bicarbonate level (22 mmHg). This suggests that the patient is hyperventilating, which can lead to respiratory alkalosis, causing the blood pH to rise. The low pO2 (54 mmHg) also indicates hypoxemia.\\n\\nGiven these findings, the best next step in management would be to address the hypoxemia and acidosis. Increasing the FiO2 may not be sufficient as the patient is already receiving a high FiO2 of 50%. Increasing the tidal volume (option B) could worsen lung injury and is not indicated in this scenario. Increasing the respiratory rate (option D) may also not be the best option as it may not address the underlying issue of hypoxemia and could lead to respiratory fatigue.\\n\\nThe best option is to increase the PEEP (option C). Increasing PEEP can help to improve oxygenation by increasing the pressure in the alveoli and allowing more blood to flow through the lungs, thereby improving gas exchange. This can help to improve the patient's oxygenation and reduce the work of breathing. Additionally, increasing PEEP can help to reduce the patient's respiratory rate and tidal volume, which can help to reduce the risk of lung injury.\\n\\nTherefore, the best next step in the management of this patient is to increase the PEEP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Risk factors that could increase the postoperative risk are upper respiratory infection, abnormal chest x-ray, and age. Preoperative pulmonary function testing is of unproven value in patients not undergoing thoracic surgery (237). This is based on multiple reasons: first, a lower limit of forced expiration volume (FEV1) did not correlate with pulmonary complications; second, pulmonary complications can occur in the context of a normal FEV1; and third, if an FEV1 were able to predict a pulmonary complication putting the patient at increased risk, it would not change the need for aggressive postoperative prophylactic measures (237).

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia.

If surgical indications are present (gas in the peritoneal cavity, absent bowel sounds, rebound tenderness, abdominal rigidity), however, the mortality rate ranges from 35% to 100%; a fatal outcome is due in part to perforation of the intestine.

The patient should be made NPO status (nothing by mouth) with intravenous (IV) \ufb02uids and electrolytes. If nausea and vomiting persist, a nasogastric tube should be used to evacuate the stomach of its \ufb02uid and gaseous contents. Continued nasogastric suction removes swallowed air, which is the most common source of gas in the small bowel. 2. Fluid and electrolyte replacement must be adequate to keep the patient well hydrated and in metabolic balance. Significant amounts of third-space \ufb02uid loss occur in the bowel wall, the bowel lumen, and the peritoneal cavity during the acute episode. Gastrointestinal \ufb02uid losses from the stomach may lead to metabolic alkalosis and depletion of other electrolytes as well. Careful monitoring of serum chemistry levels and appropriate replacement are necessary. 3."

Feedings are refused. As the intussusception progresses, and obstruction becomes prolonged, bilious vomiting becomes prominent, and the dilated, fatigued intestine generates less pressure and less pain. As the intussuscepted bowel is pulled further and further into the downstream intestine by motility, the mesentery is pulled with it and becomes stretched and compressed. The venous outflow from the intussusceptum is obstructed, leading to edema, weeping of fluid, and congestion with bleeding. Third space fluid losses and \u201ccurrant jelly\u201d stools result. Another unexpected feature of intussusception is lethargy. Between episodes of pain, the infant is glassy-eyed and groggy and appears to have been sedated.
