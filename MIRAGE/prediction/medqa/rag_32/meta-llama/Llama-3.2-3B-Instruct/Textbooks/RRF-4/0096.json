    "question": "A 17-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her father because she has been experiencing shortness of breath and chest pain. She says that the chest pain is worse when she breathes or coughs. Furthermore, on the way to the hospital she noticed that there were specks of blood on a tissue that she coughed into. She has no previous medical history and does not recall anything that could have provoked these symptoms. On presentation her temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 107/65 mmHg, pulse is 102/min, respirations are 21/min, and O2 saturation is 91% on room air. Further testing shows a large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels, and the patient is started on an appropriate treatment intravenously. After drug administration, the effects of the drug are monitored using a standard blood test. Surprisingly, the test results come back within normal parameters. The most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms has which of the following modes of inheritance?",

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and its mode of inheritance, let's break down the information provided: 1. **Symptoms and Presentation:** - Shortness of breath - Chest pain that worsens with breathing or coughing - Presence of specks of blood on a tissue after coughing - No previous medical history or known provoking factors 2. **Physical Examination Findings:** - Temperature: 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C) - Blood pressure: 107/65 mmHg - Pulse: 102/min - Respirations: 21/min - O2 saturation: 91% on room air 3. **Diagnostic Findings:** - Large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels Given the symptoms and findings, the patient likely has a pulmonary embolism (PE). Pulmonary embolism is a blockage of an artery in the lungs that can cause sudden, severe shortness of breath, chest pain (often worsened by deep breathing or coughing), and coughing up blood (hemoptysis). The large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels on imaging further supports this diagnosis. 4. **Mode of Inheritance:** - Pulmonary embolism is primarily caused by thrombosis, which is influenced by genetic factors, particularly those related to coagulation and blood clotting. The most significant risk factors for pulmonary embolism include: - Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) - Cancer - Inherited thrombophilias (e.g., Factor V Leiden, Protein C deficiency, Antithrombin deficiency) - Surgery or prolonged immobilization - Trauma Among these risk factors, inherited thrombophilias are directly related to genetic mutations affecting blood clotting. The most common inherited thrombophilia is Factor V Leiden, which is an autosomal dominant condition. This means that if one copy of the mutated gene is inherited, the individual will express the condition. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms, given the mode of inheritance, is an autosomal dominant condition, likely related to a thrombophilia such as Factor V Leiden. **JSON Output:** ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of a pulmonary embolism, including shortness of breath, chest pain worsened by breathing or coughing, and hemoptysis.

In others, nonspecific indings may include atelectasis, an iniltrate, cardiomegaly, or an efusion (Pollack, 2011). Vascular markings in the lung region supplied by the obstructed artery can be lost. Although most women are hypoxemic, a normal arterial blood gas analysis does not exclude pulmonary embolism. Approximatelyaa third of young patients have P02 values >SO mm Hg. hus, the alveolar-arterial oxygen tension diference is a more useful indicator of disease. More than S6 percent of patients with acute pulmonary embolism will have an alveolar-arterial diference >20 mm Hg (Lockwood, 2012). Even with massive pulmonary embolism, signs, symptoms, and laboratory data to support the diagnosis may be deceptively nonspecific."

            "content": "Clinical Features Patients are aware of increasing chest tightness, wheezing, and dyspnea that are often not or poorly relieved by their usual reliever inhaler. In severe exacerbations, patients may be so breathless that they are unable to complete sentences and may become cyanotic. Examination usually shows increased ventilation, hyperinflation, and tachycardia. Pulsus paradoxus may be present, but this is rarely a useful clinical sign. There is a marked fall in spirometric values and PEF. Arterial blood gases on air show hypoxemia, and PCO2 is usually low due to hyperventilation. A normal or rising PCO2 is an indication of impending respiratory failure and requires immediate monitoring and therapy. A chest roentgenogram is not usually informative but may show pneumonia or pneumothorax."

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

            "content": "Vasoocclusive painful events may occur in any organ of the body and are manifested by pain and/or significant dysfunction (see Table 150-8). The acute chest syndrome is a vasoocclusive crisis within the lungs with evidence of a new infiltrate on chest radiograph. It is often associated with infection and infarction. The patient may first complain of chest pain but within a few hours develops cough, increasing respiratory and heart rates, hypoxia, and progressive respiratory distress. Physical examination reveals areas of decreased breath sounds and dullness on chest percussion. Treatment involves early recognition and prevention of arterial hypoxemia. Oxygen, fluids, judicious use of analgesic medications, antibiotics, bronchodilators, and RBC transfusion (rarely exchange transfusion) are indicated in therapy for acute chest syndrome. Incentive spirometry may help reduce the incidence of acute chest crisis in patients presenting with pain in the chest or abdomen."
