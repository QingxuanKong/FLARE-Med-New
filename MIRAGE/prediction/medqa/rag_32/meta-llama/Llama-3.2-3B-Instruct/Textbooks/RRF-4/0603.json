    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's analyze the given information and options step by step.\\n\\nThe patient presents with a 1-month history of a painless, nonpruritic skin lesion on her right thigh that has slowly increased in size over the past weeks. The lesion is described as a 0.8-cm hyperpigmented papule that retracts inward when squeezed. This information is crucial in narrowing down the possible diagnoses.\\n\\nOption A, Dermatofibroma, is a type of skin growth that typically occurs after a minor injury, such as a pinprick or scratch. It is usually small, firm, and painless, and does not typically exhibit the described retraction upon squeezing.\\n\\nOption B, Cherry hemangioma, is a common benign vascular lesion that is typically small, red, and dome-shaped. While it can be painful if scratched, it does not usually present as a hyperpigmented papule that retracts inward.\\n\\nOption C, Actinic keratosis, is a type of skin lesion caused by chronic sun exposure. It is often rough to the touch and may be pigmented, but it does not typically exhibit the described retraction upon squeezing.\\n\\nOption D, Seborrheic keratosis, is a benign skin growth that is typically yellowish or brownish in color and may be pigmented. It is often found on sun-exposed areas and can be slightly raised, but it does not usually present as a hyperpigmented papule that retracts inward.\\n\\nConsidering the patient's presentation of a painless, nonpruritic skin lesion on her thigh that slowly increased in size and exhibits retraction upon squeezing, the most likely diagnosis is a dermatofibroma. However, another possibility is a keloid or hypertrophic scar, but these are not listed as options. Based on the provided options, the most likely diagnosis is A.

Thus, when lesions are distributed on elbows, knees, and scalp, the most likely possibility based solely on distribution is psoriasis or dermatitis herpetiformis (Figs. 70-7 and 70-8, respectively). The primary lesion in psoriasis is a scaly papule that soon forms erythematous plaques covered with a white scale, whereas that of dermatitis herpetiformis is an urticarial papule that quickly becomes a small vesicle. In this manner, identification of the primary lesion directs the examiner toward the proper diagnosis. Secondary changes in skin can also be quite helpful. For example, scale represents excessive epidermis, while crust is the result of a discontinuous epithelial cell layer. Palpation of skin lesions can yield insight into the character of an eruption. Thus, red papules on the lower extremities that blanch with pressure can be a manifestation of many different diseases, but hemorrhagic red papules that do not blanch with pressure indicate palpable purpura"

After an incubation period of 3\u201332 days, EM usually begins as a red macule or papule at the site of the tick bite that expands slowly to form a large annular lesion (Fig. 210-1). As the lesion increases in size, it often develops a bright red outer border and partial central clearing. The center of the lesion sometimes becomes intensely erythematous and indurated, vesicular, or necrotic. In other instances, the expanding lesion remains an even, intense red; several red rings are found within an outside ring; or the central area turns blue before the lesion clears. Although EM can be located anywhere, the thigh, groin, and axilla are particularly common sites. The lesion is warm but not often painful. Approximately 20% of patients do not exhibit this characteristic skin manifestation."

Within the next few hours, the site becomes painful and pruritic, with central induration surrounded by a pale ischemic zone that itself is encircled by a zone of erythema. In most cases, the lesion resolves without treatment in just a few days. In severe cases, the erythema spreads, and the center of the lesion becomes hemorrhagic or necrotic with an overlying bulla.

Papules are raised, solid lesions <5 mm in diameter; plaques are lesions >5 mm in diameter with a flat, plateau-like surface; and nodules are lesions >5 mm in diameter with a more rounded configuration. Wheals (urticaria, hives) are papules or plaques that are pale pink and may appear annular (ringlike) as they enlarge; classic (nonvasculitic) wheals are transient, lasting only 24 h in any defined area.

He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?"

The primary lesion is a superficial pustule that ruptures and forms a characteristic yellow-brown FIguRE 71-6 Pityriasis rosea. In this patient with pityriasis rosea, multiple round to oval erythematous patches with fine central scale are distributed along the skin tension lines on the trunk."

            "content": "The classic rash of ARF is erythema marginatum (Chap. 24), which begins as pink macules that clear centrally, leaving a serpiginous, spreading edge. The rash is evanescent, appearing and disappearing before the examiner\u2019s eyes. It occurs usually on the trunk, sometimes on the limbs, but almost never on the face. Subcutaneous nodules occur as painless, small (0.5\u20132 cm), mobile lumps beneath the skin overlying bony prominences, particularly of the hands, feet, elbows, occiput, and occasionally the vertebrae. They are a delayed manifestation, appearing 2\u20133 weeks after the onset of disease, last for just a few days up to 3 weeks, and are commonly associated with carditis. Fever occurs in most cases of ARF, although rarely in cases of pure chorea. Although high-grade fever (\u226539\u00b0C) is the rule, lower grade temperature elevations are not uncommon. Elevated acute-phase reactants are also present in most cases."

Cough is prominent, developing in 70% of patients. Myalgias are usually severe. A rash begins on the upper trunk, usually on the fifth day, and then becomes generalized, involving the entire body except the face, palms, and soles. Initially, this rash is macular; without treatment, it becomes maculopapular, petechial, and confluent. The rash often goes undetected in black skin; 60% of African patients have spotless epidemic typhus. Photophobia, with considerable conjunctival injection and eye pain, is common. The tongue may be dry, brown, and furred. Confusion and coma are common. Skin necrosis and gangrene of the digits as well as interstitial pneumonia may occur in severe cases. Untreated disease is fatal in 7\u201340% of cases, with outcome depending primarily on the condition of the host. Patients"

After an incubation period of 4\u20137 days, the initial lesion\u2014a papule with surrounding erythema\u2014 appears. In 2 or 3 days, the papule evolves into a pustule, which spontaneously ruptures and forms a sharply circumscribed ulcer that generally is not indurated (Fig. 182-2). The ulcers are painful and bleed easily; little or no inflammation of the surrounding skin is evident. Approximately half of patients develop enlarged, tender inguinal lymph nodes, which frequently become fluctuant and spontaneously rupture. Patients usually seek medical care after 1\u20133 weeks of painful symptoms."

The primary lesion, a small (0.3to 1-cm) painless erythematous papule or pustule, develops at the inoculation site (usually the site of a scratch or a bite) within days to 2 weeks in about one-third to two-thirds of patients (Fig. 197\u20131A, B). Lymphadenopathy develops 1\u20133 weeks or longer after cat contact. The affected lymph node(s) are enlarged and usually painful, sometimes have overlying erythema, and suppurate in 10\u201315% of cases (Fig. 197\u20131C, D, and E). Axillary/epitrochlear nodes are most commonly involved; next in frequency are head/neck nodes and then inguinal/femoral nodes. Approximately 50% of patients have fever, malaise, and anorexia. A smaller proportion experience weight loss and night sweats mimicking the presentation of lymphoma. Fever is usually low-grade but infrequently rises to \u226539\u00b0C. Resolution is slow, requiring weeks (for fever, pain, and accompanying signs and symptoms) to months (for node shrinkage)."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"
