    "question": "An investigator is studying the frequency of polycythemia in a population of a remote, mountainous region. A representative sample of 100 men shows a normal distribution of hemoglobin concentration with a mean concentration of 17 g/dL and a standard error of 0.1 g/dL. Which of the following best represents the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL?",

    "predict": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the z-score for a hemoglobin concentration of 18 g/dL and then look up the corresponding probability in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator. Step 1: Calculate the z-score for a hemoglobin concentration of 18 g/dL: z = (X - \u03bc) / (\u03c3 / \u221an) where X = 18 g/dL, \u03bc = 17 g/dL, \u03c3 = 0.1 g/dL, and n = 100 (sample size) z = (18 - 17) / (0.1 / \u221a100) z = 1 / 0.01 z = 100 Step 2: Look up the probability in a standard normal distribution table or use a calculator. Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score greater than 100 is extremely close to 0. Therefore, the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL is almost 0. Here is the output in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL, we first calculated the z-score for a hemoglobin concentration of 18 g/dL.

This increase may be real or only apparent because of a decrease in plasma volume (spurious or relative polycythemia). The term erythrocytosis may be used interchangeably with polycythemia, but some draw a distinction between them: erythrocytosis implies documentation of increased red cell mass, whereas polycythemia refers to any increase in red cells. Often patients with polycythemia are detected through an incidental finding of elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit levels. Concern that the hemoglobin level may be abnormally high is usually triggered at 170 g/L (17 g/dL) for men and 150 g/L (15 g/dL) for women. Hematocrit levels >50% in men or >45% in women may be abnormal. Hematocrits >60% in men and >55% in women are almost invariably associated with an increased red cell mass.

In general, if the EPO and erythroid marrow responses to moderate anemia [hemoglobin <100 g/L (10 g/dL)] are intact, the red cell production rate increases to two to three times normal within 10 days following the onset of anemia. In the face of established anemia, a reticulocyte response less than two to three times normal indicates an inadequate marrow response. To use the reticulocyte count to estimate marrow response, two corrections are necessary. The first correction adjusts the reticulocyte count based on the reduced number of circulating red cells. With anemia, the percentage of reticulocytes may be increased while the absolute number is unchanged. To correct for this effect, the reticulocyte percentage is multiplied by the ratio of the patient\u2019s hemoglobin or hematocrit to the expected hemoglobin/hematocrit"

Suspected low hemoglobin or hematocrit values are more easily interpreted if previous values for the same patient are known for comparison.

Generally, anemia is recognized in the laboratory when a patient\u2019s hemoglobin level or hematocrit is reduced below an expected value (the normal range). The likelihood and severity of anemia are defined based on the deviation of the patient\u2019s hemoglobin/hematocrit from values expected for ageand sex-matched normal subjects. The hemoglobin concentration in adults has a Gaussian distribution. The and FOG-1 (friend of GATA-1) transcription factors (Chap. 89e)."

            "content": "Impaired O2 delivery to the kidney can result from a decreased red cell mass (anemia), impaired O2 loading of the hemoglobin molecule or a high O2 affinity mutant hemoglobin (hypoxemia), or, rarely, impaired blood flow to the kidney (renal artery stenosis). EPO governs the day to-day production of red cells, and ambient levels of the hormone can be measured in the plasma by sensitive immunoassays\u2014the normal level being 10\u201325 U/L. When the hemoglobin concentration falls below 100\u2013120 g/L (10\u201312 g/dL), plasma EPO levels increase in proportion to the severity of the anemia (Fig. 77-2). In circulation, EPO has a half-clearance time of 6\u20139 h. EPO acts by binding to specific receptors on the surface of marrow erythroid precursors, inducing them to pro liferate and to mature. With EPO stimulation, red cell production can increase fourto fivefold within a 1to 2-week period, but only in the presence of adequate nutrients, especially iron. The functional capacity of the erythron, therefore,"

Physical examina-tion reveals a pale woman with diminished vibration sen-sation, diminished spinal reflexes, and extensor plantar reflexes (Babinski sign). Examination of her oral cavity reveals atrophic glossitis, in which the tongue appears deep red in color and abnormally smooth and shiny due to atro-phy of the lingual papillae. Laboratory testing reveals a mac-rocytic anemia based on a hematocrit of 30% (normal for women, 37\u201348%), a hemoglobin concentration of 9.4 g/dL, an erythrocyte mean cell volume (MCV) of 123 fL (nor-mal, 84\u201399 fL), an erythrocyte mean cell hemoglobin con-centration (MCHC) of 34% (normal, 31\u201336%), and a low reticulocyte count. Further laboratory testing reveals a normal serum folate concentration and a serum vitamin B12 (cobalamin) concentration"

            "content": "The increase in the quantity of reduced hemoglobin in the mucocutaneous vessels that produces cyanosis may be brought about either by an increase in the quantity of venous blood as a result of dilation of the venules (including precapillary venules) or by a reduction in the Sao2 in the capillary blood. In general, cyanosis becomes apparent when the concentration of reduced hemoglobin in capillary blood exceeds 40 g/L (4 g/dL)."

            "content": "Thresholds for transfusion should be determined based on the patient\u2019s symptoms. In general, patients without serious underlying cardiovascular or pulmonary disease can tolerate hemoglobin levels above 7\u20138 g/dL and do not require intervention until the hemoglobin falls below that level. Patients with more physiologic compromise may need to have their hemoglobin levels kept above 11 g/dL. Usually, a unit of packed red cells increases the hemoglobin level by 1 g/dL. Transfusions are associated with certain infectious risks (Chap. 138e), and chronic transfusions can produce iron overload. Importantly, the liberal use of blood has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in the intensive care setting. Therefore, in the absence of documented tissue hypoxia, a conservative approach to the use of red cell transfusions is preferable."

Most problems arise when a patient presents with an increased red cell production index from an episode of acute blood loss that went unrecognized. The cause of the anemia and increased red cell production may not be obvious. The confirmation of a recovering state may require observations over a period of 2\u20133 weeks, during which the hemoglobin concentration will rise and the reticulocyte production index fall (Chap. 129)."
