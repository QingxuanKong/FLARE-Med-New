His HbA1C is 8.5% and serum glucose is 240 mg/dL, indicating poor glycemic control. The patient also experiences numbness in both hands and feet, which could be a sign of neuropathy. The next step in management should aim to improve glycemic control and address potential complications. Starting basal-bolus insulin (A) may be considered if the patient's glucose levels remain uncontrolled despite maximally tolerated oral therapy. Continuing metformin monotherapy (B) may not be sufficient given the patient's poor glycemic control. Adding a sulfonylurea (C) may also be considered, but the patient's HbA1C is already high, and sulfonylureas can increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Adding a thiazolidinedione (D) may also be considered, but the patient's serum glucose is high, and thiazolidinediones can also increase the risk of fluid retention and edema. Given the patient's poor glycemic control and numbness in the hands and feet, a more comprehensive approach may be necessary, including a discussion of lifestyle modifications and potential additional medications, such as insulin or other oral agents, to achieve better glycemic control.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Chlorpropamide has a prolonged half-life, particularly in older adults, and should be avoided because it is associated with a high risk of hypoglycemia. Metformin should be used with caution and only in patients free of severe renal insufficiency. Renal insufficiency should be assessed by a calculated glomerular filtration rate or, in very old patients who have reduced muscle mass, by a direct measure of creatinine clearance from a 24-h urine collection. Lifestyle changes in diet and exercise and a little weight loss can prevent or delay diabetes in high-risk individuals and are substantially more effective than metformin treatment. The risk of type 2 diabetes decreased by 58% in a study of diet and exercise, and this effect was similar at all ages and in all ethnic groups.

Powers The goals of therapy for type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) are to (1) eliminate symptoms related to hyperglycemia, (2) reduce or eliminate the long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications of DM (Chap. 419), and (3) allow the patient to achieve as normal a lifestyle as possible. To reach these goals, the physician should identify a target level of glycemic control for each patient, provide the patient with the educational and pharmacologic resources necessary to reach this level, and monitor/treat DM-related complications. Symptoms of diabetes usually resolve when the plasma glucose is <11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), and thus most DM treatment focuses on achieving the second and third goals. This chapter first reviews the ongoing treatment of diabetes in the outpatient setting and then discusses the treatment of severe hyperglycemia, as well as the treatment of diabetes in hospitalized patients."

Untreated proliferative retinopathy is a relative contraindication to vigorous exercise, because this may lead to vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment. Optimal monitoring of glycemic control involves plasma glucose measurements by the patient and an assessment of long-term control by the physician (measurement of hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] and review of the patient\u2019s self-measurements of plasma glucose). These measurements are complementary: the patient\u2019s measurements provide a picture of short-term glycemic control, whereas the HbA1c reflects average glycemic control over the previous 2\u20133 months."

However, metformin can be used in patients with stable CHF if the renal function is normal. Antiplatelet therapy reduces cardiovascular events in individuals with DM who have CHD and is recommended. Current recommendations by the ADA include the use of aspirin for primary prevention of coronary events in diabetic individuals with an increased 10-year cardiovascular risk >10% (at least one risk factor such as hypertension, smoking, family history, albuminuria, or dyslipidemia in men >50 years or women >60 years of age). ASA is not recommended for primary prevention in those with a 10-year cardiovascular risk <10%. The aspirin dose is the same as in nondiabetic individuals."

He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?"

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

Whereas glycemic control tends to dominate the management of type 1 DM, the care of individuals with type 2 DM must also include attention to the treatment of conditions associated with type 2 DM (e.g., obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, CVD) and detection/management of DM-related complications (Fig. 418-2). Reduction in cardiovascular risk is of paramount importance because this is the leading cause of mortality in these individuals."

Most individuals with type 2 DM require less frequent monitoring, although the optimal frequency of SMBG has not been clearly defined. Individuals with type 2 DM who are taking insulin should use SMBG more frequently than those on oral agents. Individuals with type 2 DM who are on oral medications should use SMBG as a means of assessing the efficacy of their medication and the impact of diet. Because plasma glucose levels fluctuate less in these individuals, one to two SMBG measurements per day (or fewer in patients who are on oral agents or are diet-controlled) may be sufficient. Most measurements in individuals with type 1 or type 2 DM should be performed prior to a meal and"

Improved glycemic control also slowed the progression of early diabetic complications. During the DCCT phase, weight gain (4.6 kg) and severe hypoglycemia (requiring assistance of another person to treat) were more common in the intensive therapy group. The benefits of an improvement in glycemic control occurred over the entire range of HbA1c values (Fig. 419-1), indicating that at any HbA1c level, an improvement in glycemic control is beneficial. The results of the DCCT predicted that individuals in the intensive diabetes management group would gain 7.7 additional years of vision, 5.8 additional years free from end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and 5.6 years free from lower extremity amputations. If all complications of DM were combined, individuals"
