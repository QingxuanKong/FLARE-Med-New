She is currently unemployed and lives in a low-income neighborhood with her 3 children. For the past 3 years, her HIV RNA viral load was undetectable, but last week, her viral load was 8,391 copies/mL (N < 50). Current medications include dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine.

The patient has a history of previously well-controlled HIV infection, but her viral load has increased to 8,391 copies/mL, which is above the undetectable threshold (N < 50). The patient also reports missing her medications every other day, which may indicate nonadherence. The physician should address the patient's nonadherence and work to identify the reasons behind it, rather than simply reminding her to take her medications or providing instructions on how to take them. The social worker's assistance with medication costs may not address the underlying issue of nonadherence. Therefore, the most appropriate response would be to have a conversation with the patient to understand the reasons behind her nonadherence and develop a plan to improve adherence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Drug resistance testing is also indicated in the setting of virologic failure and should be performed while the patient is still on the failing regimen because of the propensity for the pool of HIV quasispecies to rapidly revert to wild-type in the absence of the selective pressures of cART. In the hands of experts, resistance testing enhances the short-term ability to decrease viral load by ~0.5 log compared with changing drugs merely on the basis of drug history. In addition to the use of resistance testing to help in the selection of new drugs in patients with virologic failure, it may also be of value in selecting an initial regimen for treatment of therapy-na\u00efve individuals.

Patients initiating antiretroviral therapy must be willing to commit to life-long treatment and understand the importance of adherence to their prescribed regimen. The importance of adherence is illustrated by the observation that treatment interruption is associated with rapid increases in HIV RNA levels, rapid declines in CD4+ T cell counts, and an increased risk of clinical progression.

HIV is capable of rapidly developing resistance to any single agent, and therapy must be given as a multidrug combination.

            "content": "Many clinical laboratory tests offer useful information on the progress of disease and the response to therapy. One example is the measurement of viral load in HIV-1-infected patients who are taking antiretroviral agents. According to current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a successful antiretroviral response is defined by a fall in plasma HIV-1 levels of 0.5 log10 copies/mL, and a key goal of treatment is a reduction in the viral load to below the level of detection, which is typically in the range of 40\u201375 copies/mL. Other examples of the use of clinical laboratory testing for monitoring disease include measurement of tumor markers such as PSA, especially following surgical removal of tumors. In this situation, the expectation is that successful treatment of a tumor will cause a decrease in the level of the tumor marker. A later increase in the level of the tumor marker suggests a recurrence of the disease. Finally, the clinical laboratory offers"

The history should include a review of symptoms, general medical history, review of past surgery, and current medications. The woman\u2019s most troubling symptoms must be ascertained\u2014how often she leaks urine, how much urine she leaks, what provokes urine loss, what improves or worsens the problem, and what treatment (if any) she had in the past. It is essential to keep the patient\u2019s chief symptom at the forefront to avoid inappropriate management. Consider, for example, a woman whose chief concern is that once a month, while leading a business seminar, she has a sudden, overwhelming urge to void followed by complete bladder emptying. She finds this leakage devastating and is considering quitting her job because of her acute embarrassment. On occasion, she leaks a few drops of urine during exercise, but this minor leakage does not bother her. During the evaluation, urodynamics reveal minimal stress"

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

These represent the first class of drugs licensed for the treatment of HIV infection. They are indicated for this use as part of combination regimens. It should be stressed that none of these drugs should be used as monotherapy for HIV infection due to the relative ease with which drug resistance may develop under such circumstances. Thus, when lamivudine, emtricitabine, or tenofovir is used to treat hepatitis B infection in the setting of HIV infection, one should ensure that the patient is also on additional antiretroviral medication. The reverse transcriptase inhibitors block the HIV replication cycle at the point of RNA-dependent DNA synthesis,"

Recent studies have shown that, although acyclovir-like drugs are effective in the developing world, their clinical and virologic benefits seem reduced from those in European and U.S. populations. The mechanism of this phenomenon is uncertain. Acyclovir therapy does not reduce the rate of HIV acquisition; however, HIV load among MSM in the United States decreased by 1.3 log10 in contrast to 0.9 log10 among Peruvian MSM and 0.5 log10 among African women."

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."
