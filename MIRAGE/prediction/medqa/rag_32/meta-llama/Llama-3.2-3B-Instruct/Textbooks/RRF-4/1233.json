    "question": "A 30-year-old Japanese woman is brought to the emergency department after fainting at work. She says she was only unconscious for a moment and recovered quickly. She reports increasing fatigue and joint pain for the past 4 months. Her blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, and her temperature is 36.6\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F). On physical examination, the patient is fully conscious. Her radial pulse is absent at her right wrist and 1+ at her left wrist. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:\nHemoglobin: 10.9 g/dL\nHematocrit: 34.7%\nLeukocyte count: 5,500/mm3\nNeutrophils: 65%\nLymphocytes: 30%\nMonocytes: 5%\nMean corpuscular volume: 78.2 \u03bcm3\nPlatelet count: 190,000/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate: 56 mm/h\nWhat complications is this patient at risk for?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings. The patient is a 30-year-old Japanese woman who fainted at work, and her vital signs show hypotension (low blood pressure) and bradycardia (slow heart rate). She also has anemia (low hemoglobin and hematocrit), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). These findings suggest that the patient may have a blood disorder, possibly a clotting disorder or a condition that affects blood cell production. The patient's symptoms of fatigue and joint pain may be related to anemia or another underlying condition. Considering the patient's Japanese ethnicity, the possibility of a clotting disorder such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) should be considered. TTP is a rare disorder characterized by the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels, which can lead to organ damage and even death. The patient's symptoms of fainting, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated ESR are consistent with TTP. Therefore, the patient is at risk for complications such as myocardial infarction (heart attack), tongue infarction (gangrene), and polyneuropathy (nerve damage), but the most likely complication is myocardial infarction due to the presence of thrombocytopenia and the potential for blood clots to form in the coronary arteries.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Pyelonephritis is the most common serious medical complication of pregnancy. Twenty to thirty percent of patients with untreated bacteriuria will develop pyelonephritis. When in doubt, admit a patient with pyelonephritis and administer IV antibiotics. Urosepsis must be considered in any elderly patient with altered mental status.

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

            "content": "Granulocytosis is common. The white count can fluctuate substantially and unpredictably during and between painful crises, infectious episodes, and other intercurrent illnesses. Vasoocclusion causes protean manifestations. Intermittent episodes of vasoocclusion in connective and musculoskeletal structures produce ischemia manifested by acute pain and tenderness, fever, tachycardia, and anxiety. These recurrent episodes, called painful crises, are the most common clinical manifestation. Their frequency and severity vary greatly. Pain can develop almost anywhere in the body and may last from a few hours to 2 weeks. Repeated crises requiring hospitalization (>3 episodes per year) correlate with reduced survival in adult life, suggesting that these episodes are associated with accumulation of chronic end-organ damage. Provocative factors include infection, fever, excessive exercise, anxiety, abrupt changes in temperature, hypoxia, or hypertonic dyes."

The sedimentation rate may be mildly elevated in some patients. Determination of the INR, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet count is advisable."
