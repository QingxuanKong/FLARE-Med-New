    "question": "A 27-year-old man with a history of cocaine abuse comes to the physician 2 weeks after undergoing successful arthroscopic repair of a torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee. There were no complications. He was discharged with prescriptions for oxycodone and acetaminophen. He complains of severe pain that prevents him from participating in physical therapy and wakes him from sleep. Physical examination of the left knee shows a healing incision; there is no joint effusion, erythema, or evidence of wound dehiscence, and his gait is normal. When the physician recommends switching to ibuprofen for pain, he becomes visibly angry and demands a refill of oxycodone. Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient's request?",

        "A": "Prescribe a long-acting opioid for better pain relief if he is willing to sign a pain contract",
        "B": "Request further information about which drugs he has taken recently and in the past",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is experiencing severe pain that is preventing him from participating in physical therapy, which is a common goal after arthroscopic surgery. However, the patient's reaction to the suggestion to switch to ibuprofen indicates that he may be experiencing opioid-induced hyperalgesia, a condition where the patient becomes more sensitive to pain after taking opioids. This is a common side effect of long-term opioid use. The patient's reaction also suggests that he may be experiencing opioid withdrawal symptoms, which can occur when the body is no longer receiving the opioid. The patient's demand for a refill of oxycodone indicates that he is likely dependent on the opioid. The most appropriate response is to request further information about the patient's recent drug use and medical history to assess the risk of substance abuse and addiction. This is a crucial step in addressing the patient's pain management and ensuring his safety.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

It is difficult to find a man-made substance that can act in the same way as the anterior cruciate ligament and demonstrate the same physical properties. Surgeons have devised ingenious ways of reconstructing the anterior cruciate ligament. Two of the commonest methods use the patellar ligament (tendon) and hamstrings to reconstruct the ligament. The patient had further surgical procedures. The tibial collateral ligament was explored and resutured. Using arthroscopic techniques, the tear in the medial meniscus was d\u00e9brided to prevent further complications.

A careful history should delineate the chronology of the knee complaint and whether there are predisposing conditions, trauma, or medications that might underlie the complaint. For example, patellofemoral disease (e.g., OA) may cause anterior knee pain that worsens with climbing stairs. Observation of the patient\u2019s gait is also important. The knee should be carefully inspected in the upright (weight-bearing) and supine positions for swelling, erythema, malalignment, visible trauma, muscle wasting, and leg length discrepancy. The most common malalignment in the knee is genu varum (bowlegs) or genu valgum (knock-knees) resulting from asymmetric cartilage loss medially or laterally. Bony swelling of the knee joint commonly results from hypertrophic osseous changes seen with disorders such as OA and neuropathic arthropathy."

            "content": "A 45-year-old man with no significant medical history was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 10 days ago after suffering third-degree burns over 40% of his body. He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

Nowadays, physicians are well informed on the significance of meniscal preservation when there is potential for healing.Directly after surgery, the knee is immobilized with a brace and weight-bearing is protected to allow the meniscus to heal. When healing is complete, range of motion and strength will need to be regained. Physical"

A young long-distance runner came to her physician with acute swelling around the lateral aspect of her ankle. This injury occurred directly after accidentally running into a pothole in the pavement. A fractured ankle was suspected. Plain anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the ankle revealed no evidence of any bone injury to account for the patient\u2019s soft tissue swelling. The patient was given a pair of crutches and analgesics and told to rest. A diagnosis of a simple sprain was made. Over the ensuing weeks the swelling and edema within the soft tissue of the ankle decreased and the patient began to run, but noted that the ankle kept \u201cgiving way.\u201d She went to an orthopedic surgeon for further assessment. There was a positive anterior drawer test of the ankle joint."

Patient history should include loca-tion, quality, severity, timing, and radiation of pain along with any referred pain, associated signs and symptoms, modify-ing factors, or prior treatments, including both conservative and surgical measures. Other details within the history and physical examination are equally important in establishing a diagnosis and successfully developing a treatment plan. If you listen carefully to your patients, they will often tell you their diagnosis.For example, location of \u201chip pain\u201d can narrow a dif-ferential diagnosis.

            "content": "The following three brief scenarios of a patient with hemoptysis demonstrate three distinct patterns: A 46-year-old man presents to his internist with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."
