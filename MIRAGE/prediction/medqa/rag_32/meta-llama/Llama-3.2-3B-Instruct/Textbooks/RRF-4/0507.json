    "question": "A 68-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a cough, dyspnea, and fever for 1 day. The cough is productive of small amounts of green phlegm. He has metastatic colon cancer and has received three cycles of chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin; his last chemotherapy session was 2.5 months ago. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and has been treated with antibiotics and prednisolone for acute exacerbations three times in the past year. His medications include a fluticasone-salmeterol inhaler and a tiotropium bromide inhaler. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 48 years. His temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (103.1\u00b0F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 88/69 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. Pulmonary examination shows diffuse crackles and rhonchi. An x-ray of the chest shows a left upper-lobe infiltrate of the lung. Two sets of blood cultures are obtained. Endotracheal aspirate Gram stain shows gram-negative rods. Two large bore cannulas are inserted and intravenous fluids are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",

The patient has a history of metastatic colon cancer and has received chemotherapy, which increases the risk of neutropenia and subsequent infections. The patient's oxygen saturation is low, and the chest x-ray shows a left upper-lobe infiltrate, which is consistent with pneumonia. The endotracheal aspirate Gram stain shows gram-negative rods, which suggests a bacterial infection. The patient's symptoms and test results suggest a severe infection that requires broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's neutropenia due to chemotherapy increases the risk of antibiotic resistance and requires empirical therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest sepsis, which requires prompt and aggressive treatment. The patient's oxygen saturation is low, and the patient is in distress, which requires oxygen therapy and respiratory support. The patient's symptoms and test results suggest a severe infection that requires hospitalization and aggressive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and oxygen therapy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\" } ``` The final answer is D. Cefepime and levofloxacin. This choice is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for the patient's severe bacterial pneumonia, given the patient's history of neutropenia due to chemotherapy, gram-negative rods on the endotracheal aspirate Gram stain, and the need for broad-spectrum antibiotics. Cefepime is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic that is effective against gram-negative bacteria, and levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria. This combination provides broad-spectrum coverage and is effective against the likely causative organism.",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases.

The list of diseases that can cause persistent cough without other symptoms and without detectable abnormalities on physical examination is long. It includes serious illnesses such as sarcoidosis or Hodgkin\u2019s disease in young adults, lung cancer in older patients, and (worldwide) pulmonary tuberculosis. An abnormal chest film prompts an evaluation aimed at explaining the cough. In a patient with chronic productive cough, examination of expectorated sputum is warranted. Purulent-appearing sputum should be sent for routine bacterial culture and, in certain circumstances, mycobacterial culture as well. Cytologic examination of mucoid sputum may be useful to assess for malignancy and to distinguish neutrophilic from eosinophilic bronchitis. Expectoration of blood\u2014whether streaks of blood, blood mixed with airway secretions, or pure blood\u2014deserves a special approach to assessment and management (see"
