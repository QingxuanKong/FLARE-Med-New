    "question": "Please refer to the summary above to answer this question\nA cardiologist at another institution is trying to replicate the table in the abstract with a very similar study that he is conducting. After collecting data on changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up, he is curious if the changes in the aforementioned measurements are statistically significant. Which of the following is the most appropriate statistical method to compare the groups?\"\n\"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma\nIntroduction:\nActive asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.\nPatients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.\nAnalyses were performed from baseline to month 12.\nResults:\nAt baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants\nPulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants\nPlacebo: 395 participants\nTable 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value\nPlaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 \u00b1 2.8 1.2 \u00b1 4.7 15.8 \u00b1 2.9 < 0.01\nLDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 \u00b1 3.6 -11.2 \u00b1 14.3 -8.4 \u00b1 3.9 0.28\nFEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 \u00b1 2.21 0.34 \u00b1 5.54 -0.22 \u00b1 3.21 0.27\nACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 \u00b1 1.22 0.46 \u00b1 3.25 0.12 \u00b1 1.33 0.43\nConclusion:\nPulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.\nSource of funding: Southeast Institute for Advanced Lung and Cardiovascular Studies, American Center for Advancement of Cardiovascular Health\"",

The data is already analyzed and the results are provided in a table format. The null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the groups. We can use the p-value from the analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine if the differences between the groups are statistically significant. The p-value represents the probability of observing the differences between the groups, if there is no real difference. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the differences between the groups are statistically significant. In this case, the p-value for the change in plaque volume is 0.01, which is less than 0.05, indicating that the differences between the groups are statistically significant. Therefore, we can conclude that pulmharkimab is effective in reducing plaque volume compared to the placebo group.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Reversibility is demonstrated by a >12% and 200-mL increase in FEV1 15 min after an inhaled short-acting \u03b22-agonist or in some patients by a 2to 4-week trial of oral corticosteroids (OCS) (prednisone or prednisolone 30\u201340 mg daily). Measurements of PEF twice daily may confirm the diurnal variations in airflow obstruction. Flow-volume loops show reduced peak flow and reduced maximum expiratory flow. Further lung function tests are rarely necessary, but whole-body plethysmography shows increased airway resistance and may show increased total lung capacity and residual volume. Gas diffusion is usually normal, but there may be a small increase in gas transfer in some patients."

Compliance may be a problem, and periodic medication reviews are helpful (Sawicki, 2012). In general, women with moderate to severe asthma ideally measure and record either their FEV1 or PEFR twice daily. The FEVl ideally is >80 percent of predicted. For PEFR, predicted values range from 380 to 550 L/min. Each woman has her own baseline value, and therapeutic adjustments can be made using this (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2016a; Rey, 2007)."

Administered by subcutaneous injection every 2\u20134 weeks to asthmatic patients, it lowers free plasma IgE to undetectable levels and significantly reduces the magnitude of both early and late bronchospastic responses to antigen challenge. Omalizumab\u2019s most important clinical effect is reduction in the frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations, while enabling a reduction in corticosteroid requirements. Combined analysis of several clinical trials has shown that the patients most likely to respond are those with a history of repeated exacerbations, a high requirement for corticosteroid treatment, and poor pulmonary function. Similarly, the exacerbations most often prevented are the most severe; omalizumab treatment reduced exacerbations requiring hospitalization by 88%. Because exacerbations drive so much of"

            "content": "The hallmark of COPD is airflow obstruction (discussed above). Pulmonary function testing shows airflow obstruction with a reduction in FEV1 and FEV1/FVC (Chap. 306e). With worsening disease severity, lung volumes may increase, resulting in an increase in total lung capacity, functional residual capacity, and residual volume. In patients with emphysema, the diffusing capacity may be reduced, reflecting the lung parenchymal destruction characteristic of the disease. The degree of airflow obstruction is an important prognostic factor in COPD and is the basis for the Global Initiative for Lung Disease (GOLD) severity classification (Table 314-1). More recently it has been shown that a multifactorial index incorporating airflow obstruction, exercise performance, dyspnea, and body mass index is a better predictor of mortality rate than pulmonary function alone. In 2011, the GOLD added an additional classification system incorporating symptoms and exacerbation history; the utility of this"

Cholesterol fat-lowering diet books abound in most bookstores and allow the patient to choose a diet she will best follow. The role of exercise and cigarette cessation should be stressed to all patients. Patients with a family history of cardiovascular disease (history of premature coronary artery problems and strokes) should be tested and started on conservative programs in their 20s. After 3 to 6 months, if the LDL remains above 160 mg/dL with zero to one risk factor or above 130 mg/dL with two or more risk factors, then medical therapy should be initiated. Any woman with coronary heart disease or equivalents such as diabetes or other forms of atherosclerotic disease (peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and symptomatic carotid artery disease) should initiate lifestyle changes if her LDL is 100 mg/dL or more and drug therapy if her LDL is 130 mg/dL or more.

            "content": "Airflow limitation, also known as airflow obstruction, is typically determined by spirometry, which involves forced expiratory maneuvers after the subject has inhaled to total lung capacity. Key parameters obtained from spirometry include the volume of air exhaled within the first second of the forced expiratory maneuver (FEV1) and the total volume of air exhaled during the entire spirometric maneuver (forced vital capacity [FVC]). Patients with airflow obstruction related to COPD have a chronically reduced ratio of FEV1/FVC. In contrast to asthma, the reduced FEV1 in COPD seldom shows large responses to inhaled bronchodilators, although improvements up to 15% are common. Asthma patients can also develop chronic (not fully reversible) airflow obstruction."

Inhaled glucocorticoids reduce the frequency of exacerbations by 25\u201330% in most analyses. The use of inhaled glucocorticoids should be considered in patients with frequent exacerbations or those who have an asthmatic component, i.e., significant reversibility on pulmonary function testing or marked symptomatic improvement after inhaled bronchodilators. Similar magnitudes of reduction have been reported for anticholinergic and long-acting \u03b2-agonist therapy. The influenza vaccine has been shown to reduce exacerbation rates in patients with COPD. As outlined above, daily azithromycin administered to subjects with COPD and an exacerbation history reduces exacerbation frequency."

The diagnostic follow-up of positive screening results was determined by participants and their physicians. The PLCO trial differed from previous lung cancer screening studies in that women and never smokers were eligible. The study was designed to detect a 10% reduction in lung cancer mortality in the interventional group. A total of 154,901 individuals between 55 and 74 years of age were enrolled (77,445 assigned to annual CXR screenings; 77,456 assigned to usual care). Participant demographics and tumor characteristics were well balanced between the two groups.
