He reports that the fever lasts for 7 to 10 days, then subsides completely for about a week before returning again. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Physical examination shows nontender cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. An x-ray of the chest shows bilateral mediastinal masses. Resection of a cervical lymph node is performed.

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the question: The patient presents with episodic fever, recurrent night sweats, and weight loss, which are classic symptoms of a systemic illness. The presence of nontender cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy and bilateral mediastinal masses on chest x-ray suggests a lymphoproliferative disorder. The histopathological examination of the resected cervical lymph node is crucial in determining the specific diagnosis. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are most consistent with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), a type of lymphoma that originates from the lymphocytes. The presence of B symptoms (fever, night sweats, and weight loss) and the histopathological examination of the lymph node are key diagnostic features of HL. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30: This is a hallmark of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are characteristic of Hodgkin lymphoma. The Reed-Sternberg cells are large, multinucleated cells that are positive for CD15 and CD30, making this option a strong candidate for the correct answer. B. Cells with BCR-ABL rearrangement: This is a characteristic of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a different type of cancer that affects the white blood cells and is not typically associated with lymphadenopathy or the symptoms described in the patient. C. Cells overexpressing Bcl-2: This is a feature of follicular lymphoma, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is also a type of lymphoma but is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. D. Cells with t(8;14) chromosomal translocation: This is a characteristic of Burkitt lymphoma, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is more common in children and is not consistent with the patient's age and symptoms. Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and the histopathological examination of the resected lymph node, the most likely diagnosis is Hodgkin lymphoma, and the characteristic feature of Reed-Sternberg cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30 is the correct answer.

            "content": "The physician will be aided in the pursuit of an explanation for the lymphadenopathy by a careful medical history, physical examination, selected laboratory tests, and perhaps an excisional lymph node biopsy. The medical history should reveal the setting in which lymphadenopathy is occurring. Symptoms such as sore throat, cough, fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, or pain in the nodes should be sought. The patient\u2019s age, sex, occupation, exposure to pets, sexual behavior, and use of drugs such as diphenylhydantoin are other important historic points. For example, children and young adults usually have benign (i.e., nonmalignant) disorders that account for the observed lymphadenopathy such as viral or bacterial upper respiratory infections; infectious mononucleosis; toxoplasmosis; and, in some countries, tuberculosis. In contrast, after age 50, the incidence of malignant disorders increases and that of benign disorders decreases."

He undergoes surgical resection and is found to have high-risk stage III CRC with five positive lymph nodes. After surgery, he feels entirely well with no symptoms. Of note, he has no other illnesses. What is this patient\u2019s overall prognosis? Based on his prognosis, what"

The nodes may be single or multiple, are usually nontender, are discrete, and vary in firmness. Lymphadenopathy also may be found in suboccipital, supraclavicular, inguinal, and mediastinal areas. Generalized lymphadenopathy occurs in 20\u201330% of symptomatic patients. Between 20% and 40% of patients with lymphadenopathy also have headache, malaise, fatigue, and fever (usually with a temperature of <40\u00b0C [<104\u00b0F]). A smaller proportion of symptomatic individuals have myalgia, sore throat, abdominal pain, maculopapular rash, meningoencephalitis, and confusion. Rare complications associated with infection in the normal immune host include pneumonia, myocarditis, encephalopathy, pericarditis, and polymyositis. Signs and symptoms associated with acute infection usually resolve within several weeks, although the lymphadenopathy may persist for some months. In one"

Hematogenous and lymphatic dissemination (stage 1 disease) is marked by the onset of fever. Typically, bouts of high temperatures lasting several days are separated by afebrile periods. Lymphadenopathy is prominent in T. b. gambiense trypanosomiasis. The nodes are discrete, movable, rubbery, and nontender. Cervical nodes are often visible, and enlargement of the nodes of the posterior cervical triangle, or Winterbottom\u2019s sign, is a classic finding. Pruritus and maculopapular rashes are common. Inconstant findings include malaise, headache, arthralgias, weight loss, edema, hepatosplenomegaly, and tachycardia. The differential diagnosis of stage 1 HAT includes many diseases that are common in the tropics and are associated with fevers. HIV infection, malaria, and typhoid fever are common in populations at risk for HAT and need to be considered."

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

More chronic forms of lymphadeni-tis, including infections with atypical mycobacteria, as well as cat-scratch fever, are diagnosed based on serologic findings or excisional biopsy. The lymphadenopathy associated with infectious mononucleosis can be diagnosed based on serology. When the neck nodes are firm, fixed, and others are also pres-ent in the axillae or groin, or the history suggests lymphoma, excisional biopsy is indicated. In these cases, it is essential to obtain a chest radiograph to look for the presence of a medias-tinal mass.

Although in children it is often the consequence of primary infection, in adults it may be due to either recent infection or reactivation of old disseminated foci. The lesions are usually yellowish granulomas 1\u20132 mm in diameter that resemble millet seeds (thus the term miliary, coined by nineteenth-century pathologists). Clinical manifestations are nonspecific and protean, depending on the predominant site of involvement. Fever, night sweats, anorexia, weakness, and weight loss are presenting symptoms in the majority of cases. At times, patients have a cough and other respiratory symptoms due to pulmonary involvement as well as abdominal symptoms. Physical findings include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Eye examination may reveal choroidal tubercles, which are pathognomonic of miliary TB, in up to 30% of cases. Meningismus occurs in fewer than 10% of cases."

In endemic areas of the Americas and the Mediterranean basin, immunocompetent infants and small children as well as immunodeficient adults are affected especially often. The most common presentation of VL is an abrupt onset of moderateto high-grade fever associated with rigor and chills. Fever may continue for several weeks with decreasing intensity, and the patient may become afebrile for a short period before experiencing another bout of fever. The spleen may be palpable by the second week of illness and, depending on the duration of illness, may become hugely enlarged (Fig. 251-3). Hepatomegaly (usually moderate in degree) soon follows. Lymphadenopathy is common in most endemic regions of the world except the Indian subcontinent, where it is rare.
