    "question": "A 62-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 40 minutes after his wife noticed during breakfast that the left side of his face was drooping. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and shoes before coming to the hospital. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. His current medications include metformin, enalapril, and atorvastatin. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. He drinks one glass of wine daily. He is alert and oriented to time, place and person. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 99/min and blood pressure is 170/100 mm Hg. Examination shows equal and reactive pupils. There is drooping of the left side of the face. Muscle strength is decreased in the left upper and lower extremities. Plantar reflex shows an extensor response on the left side. Speech is dysarthric. There is a bruit on the right side of the neck. Fundoscopy shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count, coagulation profile, and serum concentrations of glucose and electrolytes are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

These symptoms are highly suggestive of a carotid artery dissection or stroke. The patient's medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia increases the risk of vascular events. The presence of a bruit on the right side of the neck is a red flag for vascular disease. The patient's blood pressure is elevated at 170/100 mmHg, which is also consistent with a vascular event. Given the acute onset of symptoms, the most appropriate next step is to perform an imaging study to evaluate the vascular system, particularly the carotid arteries. Duplex ultrasonography of the neck is the most appropriate next step as it is a non-invasive and quick test that can evaluate blood flow and detect stenosis or dissection in the carotid arteries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" ``` The rationale for this choice is as follows: * The patient's symptoms of unilateral facial drooping, weakness in the left upper and lower extremities, and bruit on the right side of the neck are highly suggestive of a carotid artery dissection or stroke. * The patient's medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia increases the risk of vascular events. * The elevated blood pressure is consistent with a vascular event. * Duplex ultrasonography of the neck is a non-invasive and quick test that can evaluate blood flow and detect stenosis or dissection in the carotid arteries, making it the most appropriate next step in management.",

His heart fail-ure must be treated first, followed by careful control of the hypertension. He was initially treated with a diuretic (furo-semide, 40 mg twice daily). On this therapy, he was less short of breath on exertion and could also lie flat without dyspnea. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhib-itor was added (enalapril, 20 mg twice daily), and over the next few weeks, he continued to feel better. Because of continued shortness of breath on exercise, digoxin at 0.25 mg/d was added with a further modest improvement in exercise tolerance. The blood pressure stabilized at 150/90 mm Hg, and the patient will be educated regarding the relation between his hypertension and heart failure and the need for better blood pressure control. Cautious addition of a \u03b2 blocker (metoprolol) will be considered. Blood lipids, which are currently in the normal range, will be monitored."

His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic.

Enalapril lowered his blood pressure to almost normotensive levels. However, after several weeks on enalapril, the patient returned complaining of a persistent cough.

            "content": "History and Physical Examination The chest discomfort, often severe enough to be described as frank pain, is typically located in the sub-sternal region or sometimes in the epigastrium, and radiates to the left arm, left shoulder, and/or neck. Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."

Therefore, they should be carried out only if the results can be expected to modify the patient\u2019s management. The prevention of heart disease, especially of CAD, is one of the most important tasks of primary care health givers as well as cardiologists. Prevention begins with risk assessment, followed by attention to lifestyle, such as achieving optimal weight, physical activity, and smoking cessation, and then aggressive treatment of all abnormal risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (Chap. 417). After a complete diagnosis has been established in patients with known heart disease, a number of management options are usually available. Several examples may be used to demonstrate some of the 1441 principles of cardiovascular therapeutics: 1."

He saw his PCP for evaluation of low back pain. X-rays of the spine showed some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine plus several wedge deformities in the thoracic spine. The patient is a long-time smoker (up to two packs per day) and has two to four glasses of wine with dinner, more on the weekends. He has chronic bronchitis, presumably from smoking, and has been treated on numerous occasions with oral prednisone for exacerba-tions of bronchitis. He is currently on 10 mg/d prednisone. Examination shows kyphosis of the thoracic spine, with some tenderness to fist percussion over the thoracic spine. The dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measure-ment of the lumbar spine is \u201cwithin the normal limits,\u201d but the radiologist noted that the reading may be misleading because of degenerative changes.

A chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a right 2.8 \u00d7 1.6 cm infrahilar mass and postobstructive pneumonia. The patient was an active smoker. Past medical history was notable for laryngeal carcinoma treated 15 years prior with radiation therapy, renal cell carcinoma, peripheral vascular disease, and hypothyroidism. On review of systems, he denied headache, nausea, and vomiting. He had chronic hip pain, managed with acetaminophen with codeine.

The retina is the only tissue in which arteries and arterioles can be examined directly. With increasing severity of hypertension and atherosclerotic disease, progressive funduscopic changes include increased arteriolar light reflex, arteriovenous crossing defects, hemorrhages and exudates, and, in patients with malignant hypertension, papilledema. Examination of the heart may reveal a loud second heart sound due to closure of the aortic valve and an S4 gallop attributed to atrial contraction against a noncompliant left ventricle. Left ventricular hypertrophy may be detected by an enlarged, sustained, and laterally displaced apical impulse. An abdominal bruit, particularly a bruit that lateralizes and extends throughout systole into diastole, raises the possibility of renovascular hypertension. Kidneys of patients with polycystic kidney disease may be palpable in the abdomen. The physical"

In more severe HF, the patient must sit upright, may have labored breathing, and may not be able to finish a sentence because of shortness of breath. Systolic blood pressure may be normal or high in early HF, but it generally is reduced in advanced HF because of severe LV dysfunction. The pulse pressure may be diminished, reflecting a reduction in stroke volume. Sinus tachycardia is a nonspecific sign caused by increased adrenergic activity. Peripheral vasoconstriction leading to cool peripheral extremities and cyanosis of the lips and nail beds is also caused by excessive adrenergic activity."

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"
