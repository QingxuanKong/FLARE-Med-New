    "question": "A 24-year-old woman gravida 2, para 1 at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal visit. She feels well. Her earlier pregnancy was uncomplicated. This is her 4th prenatal visit. She had an ultrasound scan 2 weeks ago that showed a live intrauterine pregnancy consistent with a 22-week gestation with no anomalies. She had a normal Pap smear 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 24-week gestation. Her blood group and type is B positive.

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate next step in management for this 24-year-old woman at 24 weeks' gestation, let's consider her medical history and the information provided during the prenatal visit. She had an uncomplicated earlier pregnancy, a normal Pap smear 2 years ago, and her vital signs are within normal limits. The ultrasound scan 2 weeks ago confirmed a live intrauterine pregnancy consistent with a 22-week gestation with no anomalies. The pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 24-week gestation. Given that she is at 24 weeks' gestation, the primary concern is to monitor fetal growth and well-being, as well as her own health status. The next step should focus on assessing fetal well-being and maternal health rather than immediately proceeding with a specific test or procedure. The oral glucose challenge test (A) is typically performed between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation to screen for gestational diabetes, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario. Cardiotocography (B) is a test used to monitor fetal heart rate and is not typically performed at this stage. A swab for GBS culture (C) is usually performed at 35-37 weeks of gestation to screen for Group B streptococcal colonization. The Tdap vaccination (D) is recommended during pregnancy, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management at this time. Given these considerations, the most appropriate next step is to continue with routine prenatal care, including regular monitoring of fetal growth and well-being, and assessing maternal health status. This may include evaluating her blood pressure, assessing fetal heart rate, and performing a cervical examination to confirm the size and station of the fetus. However, since the question does not specify any concerns with the pregnancy or the patient's health, the most appropriate next step is simply to continue with routine prenatal care.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}}",

Maternal blood pressure and weight and their extent of change are examined. Symptoms such as headache, altered vision, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, bleeding, vaginal luid leakage, and dysuria are sought. Mter 20 weeks' gestation, uterine examination measures size from the symphysis to the fundus. In late pregnancy, vaginal examination often provides valuable information that includes conirmation of the presenting part and its station, clinical estimation of pelvic capacity and configuration, amnionic luid volume adequacy, and cervical consistency, efacement, and dilatation (Chap. 22, p. 435)."

The yolk sac can normally be seen by the middle of the ifth week. As shown in Figure 9-3, after 6 weeks, an embryo is seen as a linear structure immediately adjacent to the yolk sac. Cardiac motion is typically noted at this point. Up to 12 weeks' gestation, the crown-rump length is predictive of gestational age within 4 days (Chap. 10, p. 183). Prenatal care is ideally initiated early. Major goals are to: (1) deine the health status of the mother and fetus, (2) estimate the gestational age, and (3) initiate a plan for continued obstetrical care. Typical components of the initial visit are summarized in Table Subsequent care may range from relatively infrequent routine visits to prompt hospitalization because of serious maternal or fetal disease."

            "content": "Identification of the inappropriately growing fetus remains a challenge. Eary establishment of gestational age, ascertainment of maternal weight gain, and careful measurement of uterine fundal growth throughout pregnancy will identiy many cases of abnormal fetal growth in low-risk women. Risk factors, including aprior growth-restricted etus, raise the recurrence risk to nearly 20 percent (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2015). In women with risk factors, serial sonographic evaluation is considered. Although examination frequency varies depending on indications, an initial early dating examination followed by an examination at 32 to 34 weeks, or when otherwise clinically indicated, will identiy many growthrestricted fetuses. Even so, deinitive diagnosis frequently cannot be made until delivery."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy.

Advise the pregnant woman to eat food types she wants in reasonable amounts and salted to taste. 2. Ensure that food is amply available for socioeconomically deprived women. 3. Monitor weight gain, with a goal of approximately 25 to 35elb in women with a normal BMI. 4. Explore food intake by dietary recall periodically to discover the occasional nutritionally errant diet. 5. Give tablets of simple iron salts that provide at least 27 mg of elemental iron daily. Give folate supplementation before and in the early weeks of pregnancy. Provide iodine supplementation in areas of known dietary insuiciency. 6. Recheck the hematocrit or hemoglobin concentration at 28 to 32 weeks' gestation to detect signiicant anemia. TABLE 9-6. Some Contraindications to Exercise During Pregnancy"

Bleeding usually does not develop until near the end of the second trimester or later, but it can begin even before mid pregnancy. And undoubtedly, some late abortions are caused by an abnormally located placenta. Bleeding from a previa usu in a woman who has had an uneventful prenatal course. his so-called sentinel bleed is rarely so profuse as to prove fatal. Usu ally it ceases, only to recur. However, in perhaps 10 percent of women, particularly those with a placenta implanted near but not over the cervical os, there is no bleeding until labor onset. Bleeding at this time varies from slight to profuse, and it may clinically mimic placental abruption."

With accurate dating, a small, irregular intrauterine sac without a fetal pole on transvaginal ultrasound is diagnostic of an abnormal pregnancy. Maternal Rh type should be determined and RhoGAM given if the type is Rh . It has been estimated that 50% of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended.

Currently, excessive uterine size occurs in only 28% of patients. The endometrial cavity may be expanded by both chorionic tissue and retained blood. Excessive uterine size is generally associated with markedly elevated levels of hCG, because uterine enlargement results in part from trophoblastic overgrowth. Preeclampsia Preeclampsia was observed in 27% of patients with a complete hydatidiform mole. Preeclampsia is now reported in only 1 of 74 patients with complete mole at the initial visit.
