    "question": "A 56-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor with intermittent chest pain. He reports a 2-month history of exertional chest pain that commonly arises after walking 5 or more blocks. He describes the pain as dull, burning, non-radiating substernal pain. His past medical history is notable for hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. He takes simvastatin and losartan. His temperature is 98.9\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 150/85 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On exam, he is well-appearing and in no acute distress. S1 and S2 are normal. No murmurs are noted. An exercise stress test is performed to further evaluate the patient\u2019s pain. Which of the following substances is released locally to increase coronary blood flow during exertion?",

    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Understanding the scenario**: A 56-year-old man presents with intermittent chest pain that occurs after walking 5 or more blocks. The pain is described as dull, burning, and non-radiating substernal pain. He has a history of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension, and his blood pressure is elevated at 150/85 mmHg. 2. **Identifying the type of pain**: The patient's pain is described as exertional and non-radiating, which is characteristic of angina pectoris. Angina is typically caused by a temporary reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle, often due to coronary artery disease. 3. **Understanding the role of exercise in angina**: During exercise, the body's demand for oxygen increases, which can lead to a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand if the coronary arteries are narrowed or diseased. To counteract this, the body releases various substances to increase coronary blood flow. 4. **Identifying the correct substance**: Let's review the options: - A. Adenosine: Released by the heart during periods of increased demand, adenosine causes vasodilation of the coronary arteries, increasing blood flow to the heart muscle. - B. Inorganic phosphate: Not directly involved in increasing coronary blood flow. - C. Prostaglandin E2: Involved in inflammation and pain mediation, but not directly involved in increasing coronary blood flow. - D. Transforming growth factor beta: Involved in cell growth and differentiation, not directly involved in increasing coronary blood flow. 5. **Conclusion**: Based on the above analysis, the substance released locally to increase coronary blood flow during exertion is adenosine. Here's the output in JSON format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the substance released to increase coronary blood flow during exertion, we need to consider the pathophysiology of angina pectoris and the effects of exercise on the cardiovascular system. The patient's symptoms are consistent with angina pectoris, and exercise can exacerbate the condition by increasing oxygen demand. To counteract this, the body releases substances to increase coronary blood flow. Adenosine is a key player in this process, causing vasodilation of the coronary arteries and increasing blood flow to the heart muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" } ```",

For symptomatic patients without a prior history of CAD and a normal or nearly normal resting ECG who are able to exercise, the American Colloge of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend standard exercise treadmill testing (ETT) as the initial testing strategy. The guidelines further suggest that patients who are categorized as low risk by ETT (e.g., those achieving >10 metabolic equivalents [METS] without chest pain or ECG changes) be treated initially with medical therapy, and those with high-risk ETT findings (i.e., typical angina with >2 mm ST-segment depression in multiple leads, ST elevation during exercise, drop in blood pressure, or sustained ventricular arrhtyhmias) be referred for coronary angiography."

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

            "content": "Exercise electrocardiography (\u201cstress testing\u201d) is commonly employed for completion of risk stratification of patients who have undergone an initial evaluation that has not revealed a specific cause of chest discomfort and has identified them as being at low or selectively intermediate risk of ACS. Early exercise testing is safe in patients without high-risk findings after 8\u201312 h of observation and can assist in refining their prognostic assessment. For example, of low-risk patients who underwent exercise testing in the first 48 h after presentation, those without evidence of ischemia had a 2% rate of cardiac events through 6 months, whereas the rate was 15% among patients with either clear evidence of ischemia or an equivocal result. Patients who are unable to exercise may undergo pharmacological stress testing with either nuclear perfusion imaging or echocardiography. Notably, some experts have deemed the routine use of stress testing for low-risk patients unsupported by direct"

            "content": "In interpreting ECG stress tests, the probability that coronary artery disease (CAD) exists in the patient or population under study (i.e., pretest probability) should be considered. Overall, false-positive or false-negative results occur in one-third of cases. However, a positive result on exercise indicates that the likelihood of CAD is 98% in males who are >50 years with a history of typical angina pectoris and who develop chest discomfort during the test. The likelihood decreases if the patient has atypical or no chest pain by history and/or during the test."
