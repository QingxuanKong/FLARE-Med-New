    "question": "A 45-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He was diagnosed with HIV 15 years ago. He was taking triple antiretroviral therapy but stopped a few months ago because he was feeling well. He lives in Wyoming. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 47/mm3 (N \u2265 500). The patient currently refuses to restart antiretroviral therapy. Which of the following medication regimens is most appropriate at this time?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 47/mm3, which is below the normal range (< 500/mm3), indicating advanced immunosuppression. The patient has been living with HIV for 15 years and has stopped antiretroviral therapy (ART) a few months ago. The patient's refusal to restart ART makes it essential to initiate new treatment to prevent further immunosuppression and potential opportunistic infections. The patient lives in Wyoming, which has a high incidence of certain opportunistic infections. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not indicate any specific opportunistic infections. Therefore, the most appropriate medication regimen should cover a broad spectrum of pathogens, including those commonly found in Wyoming. The patient's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is low, indicating the need for a potent antiretroviral regimen. The choice of regimen should also consider the patient's refusal to adhere to ART, so the selected regimen should have a good tolerability profile. Considering these factors, the most appropriate medication regimen is C. Trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin. This regimen includes a sulfonamide (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) for Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis, azithromycin for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) prophylaxis, and itraconazole for fungal prophylaxis. This combination is commonly used for HIV-positive individuals with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts and is effective in preventing opportunistic infections in the Western United States. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Following the initiation of therapy one should expect a rapid, at least 1-log (tenfold) reduction in plasma HIV RNA levels within 1\u20132 months and then a slower decline in plasma HIV RNA levels to <50 copies/mL within 6 months. During this same time there should be a rise in the CD4+ T cell count of 100\u2013150/\u03bcL that is also particularly brisk during the first month of therapy. Subsequently, one should anticipate a CD4+ T cell count increase of 50\u2013100 cells/year until numbers approach normal. Many clinicians feel that failure to achieve these endpoints is an indication for a change in therapy. Other reasons for a change in therapy include a persistently declining CD4+ T cell count, a consistent increase in HIV RNA levels to >200 copies/mL, clinical deterioration, or drug toxicity (Table 226-25). As in the case of initiating therapy, changing therapy may have a lasting impact on future therapeutic options. When changing therapy because of"

In addition, one may wish to administer a 6-week course of therapy to uninfected individuals immediately following a high-risk exposure to HIV. The combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine is also indicated for pre-exposure prophylaxis in individuals at high risk of HIV infection. For patients diagnosed with an opportunistic infection and HIV infection at the same time, one may consider a 2to 4-week delay in the initiation of antiretroviral therapy during which time treatment is focused on the opportunistic infection.

As with any laboratory measurement, one may wish to obtain two determinations prior to any significant changes in patient management based on CD4+ T cell count alone. Patients with HIV infection should have CD4+ T cell measurements performed at the time of diagnosis and every 3\u20136 months thereafter. More frequent measurements should be made if a declining trend is noted. For patients who have been on cART for at least 2 years"

Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

However, the degree of risk depends primarily on the state of the immune system at the time of travel. For persons whose CD4+ T cell counts are normal or >500/ \u03bcL, data suggest no greater risk during travel than for persons without HIV infection. Individuals with AIDS (CD4+ T cell counts of <200/\u03bcL) and others who are symptomatic need special counseling and should visit a travel medicine practitioner before departure, especially when traveling to the developing world."

In general, the standard 6-month daily regimen is equally efficacious in HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients for treatment of drug-susceptible TB. As for any other adult living with HIV (Chap. 226), first-line ART for TB patients should consist of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Although TB treatment modalities are similar to those in HIV-negative patients, adverse drug effects may be more pronounced in HIV-infected patients. In this 1."
