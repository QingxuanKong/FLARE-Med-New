The voiding cystourethrography shows retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition, further supporting the diagnosis of VUR. Given the patient's history of recurrent UTIs and the ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography findings, the likely diagnosis is vesicoureteral reflux nephropathy. This condition is characterized by scarring of the kidneys due to the backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureters and kidneys.

In the majority of UTIs, bacteria establish infection by ascending from the urethra to the bladder. Continuing ascent up the ureter to the kidney is the pathway for most renal parenchymal infections. However, introduction of bacteria into the bladder does not inevitably lead to sustained and symptomatic infection. The interplay of host, pathogen, and environmental factors determines whether tissue invasion and symptomatic infection will ensue (Fig. 162-1). For example, bacteria often enter the bladder after sexual intercourse, but normal voiding and innate host defense mechanisms in the bladder eliminate these organisms. Any foreign body in the urinary tract, such as a urinary catheter or stone, provides an inert surface for bacterial colonization.

Voiding cystourethrography is of value in the diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux and bladder neck and urethral obstructions. Postvoiding films reveal residual urine.

VUR stems from abnormal retrograde urine flow from the bladder into one or both ureters and kidneys because of mislocated and incompetent ureterovesical valves (Fig. 340-4). Although high-pressure sterile reflux may impair normal growth of the kidneys, when coupled with recurrent UTIs in early childhood, the result is patchy interstitial scarring and tubular atrophy. Loss of functioning nephrons leads to hypertrophy of the remnant glomeruli and eventual secondary FSGS. Reflux nephropathy often goes unnoticed until early adulthood when chronic kidney disease is detected during routine evaluation or during pregnancy.

            "content": "all children with febrile infections would undergo complete evaluations including renal ultrasonography (US) as well as invasive studies such as voiding cystourethrogra-phy (VCUG). However, defining pyelonephritis as having a positive renal cortical scan, only 30% to 40% of children with febrile UTI will have reflux. Thus the majority of children with febrile infections, and a greater percentage of those with afe-brile infections (cystitis), will be anatomically normal.180 These data have led to a change in imaging guidelines for children with UTI.Guidelines put out by the American Academy of Pediat-rics have markedly changed the way children with infections are evaluated.181 These guidelines suggest that infants less than 2 months of age with febrile infections should undergo both a renal US and VCUG. Children between 2 months and 2 years who have their first documented infection only need have a renal ultrasound performed. A VCUG is only needed if there are abnormalities detected on"

Imaging should be considered to rule out obstruction, which could prolong the recovery period despite appropriate antimicrobial treatment.Acute pyelonephritis requires 7 to 14 days of antibiotic therapy. Mild or moderate cases, even if febrile, can safely be treated as an outpatient with oral antibiotics. Fluoroquino-lones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are ideal for treating pyelonephritis. Nitrofurantoin should not be used as it does not penetrate renal parenchyma. Patients with concern for sepsis or inability to tolerate oral intake may require hospitalization with IV antibiotics while awaiting culture results. Fevers may persist for up to 72 hours despite appropriate treatment. The presence of persistent fevers or symptoms after this time period warrants cross-sectional imaging to rule out renal or perinephric abscess. Treatment for renal or"

            "content": "An imaging study can be performed after initiation of UTI treatment with no need to wait days or weeks before performing the test. Renal ultrasound (RUS) is the best study to evaluate the urinary tract in children. A voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) or radionuclide cystogram (NCG) is performed to detect urethral/bladder abnormalities and/or VUR. Recent American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for infants with a first UTI between 2 and 24 months of age recommend a VCUG if an RUS reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings suggestive of either high grade VUR or obstructive uropathy and in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances. VCUG should also be performed if there is a recurrence of a febrile UTI. Although the VCUG provides additional anatomic detail, the NCG may detect more children with mild VUR and involves less radiation. An international grading system has been used to describe reflux (Fig. 167-1).The incidence of renal scarring in patients with low-grade VUR is"

Furthermore, urethral diverticulum and recurrent urinary tract infections increase the risk for women.The majority of patients present with irritative and obstructive voiding symptoms, bleeding, or a palpable mass. Urothelial carcinoma is the most common histology; 29% of women have adenocarcinoma, and both genders can have squamous cell carcinoma. Untreated or refractory UC typically metastasizes through lymphatic channels to the inguinal and pelvic lymph nodes and hematologically to distant organs. Cys-toscopic biopsy establishes the diagnoses. An MRI of the pelvis is extremely helpful for defining local extension of the disease while CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis identify meta-static disease. Finally, it is also important to evaluate the entire urinary tract.The 5-year overall survival rates for distal urethral tumors is significantly better than for proximal cancers, 68% versus 40%, respectively.143,146 The median 5-year cancer-specific sur-vival is"

A discrepancy >1 cm in kidney length suggests either a unilateral developmental abnormality or disease process or renovascular disease with arterial insufficiency affecting one kidney more than the other. The diagnosis of renovascular disease can be undertaken with different techniques, including Doppler sonography, nuclear medicine studies, or CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. If there is a suspicion of reflux nephropathy (recurrent childhood urinary tract infection, asymmetric renal size with scars on the renal poles), a voiding cystogram may be indicated. However, in most cases, by the time the patient has CKD, the reflux has resolved, and even if still present, repair does not improve renal function. Radiographic contrast imaging studies are not particularly helpful in the investigation of CKD. Intravenous or intraarterial dye should be avoided where"
