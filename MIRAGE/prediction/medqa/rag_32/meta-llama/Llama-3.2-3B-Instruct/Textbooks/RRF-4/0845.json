    "question": "An investigator is studying traumatic knee joint injuries in college athletes. Images and tissue samples are collected from 4 athletes with cartilaginous injury and 4 athletes with bone fractures. After 8 weeks, the athletes with bone fractures show almost complete resolution, while the athletes with cartilaginous injuries show only minimal signs of healing. The investigator hypothesizes that this is due to the absence of progenitor cells for matrix regeneration. Transplant of which of the following tissues would most likely promote healing in the group with cartilaginous injury?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key to answering this question lies in understanding the healing process of cartilage and the role of different tissues in this process. Cartilage has limited ability for repair, and the absence of progenitor cells for matrix regeneration is a significant factor in the healing process. The investigator has already observed minimal signs of healing in the athletes with cartilaginous injuries. To promote healing in this group, we need to introduce a tissue that can provide progenitor cells for matrix regeneration. The perichondrium is a layer of connective tissue that surrounds the cartilage and contains stem cells that can differentiate into chondrocytes and other cell types. Transplanting perichondrium into the area of the cartilaginous injury would likely provide the necessary progenitor cells for matrix regeneration and promote healing. The other options, proteoglycans, osteoblasts, and mature chondrocytes, are not the best choices because they do not provide the same level of progenitor cells for matrix regeneration as the perichondrium does.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

There is no inflammatory response, but an increase in synthesis of proteo-glycan and collagen dependent entirely on the chondrocyte. The healing power of cartilage is often inadequate, and over-all regeneration is incomplete. Therefore, superficial cartilage injuries are slow to heal and often result in persistent structural defects.In contrast to superficial injuries, deep injuries involve the underlying bone and soft tissue. This leads to the exposure of vascular channels of the surrounding damaged tissue that may help in the formation of granulation tissue. Hemorrhage allows for the initiation of the inflammatory response and the subse-quent mediator activation of cellular function for repair. As the granulation tissue is laid down, fibroblasts migrate toward the wound and synthesize fibrous tissue that undergoes chondrifica-tion. Gradually, hyaline cartilage is formed, which restores the"

            "content": "Major injuries to a joint also can produce anatomic abnormalities that leave the joint susceptible to OA. For example, a fracture through the joint surface often causes OA in joints in which the disease is otherwise rare such as the ankle and the wrist. Avascular necrosis can lead to collapse of dead bone at the articular surface, producing anatomic irregularities and subsequent OA. Tears of ligamentous and fibrocartilaginous structures that protect the joints, such as the anterior cruciate ligament and the meniscus in the knee and the labrum in the hip, can lead to premature OA. Meniscal tears increase with age and when chronic are often asymptomatic but lead to adjacent cartilage damage and accelerated OA. Even injuries in which the affected person never received a diagnosis may increase risk of OA. For example, in the Framingham Study subjects, men with a history of major knee injury, but no surgery, had a 3.5-fold increased risk for subsequent knee OA."

            "content": "Grade III injuries may also improve with conservative treatment, and often these injuries are initially treated non-operatively. The majority of MCL injuries occur in the mid-substance or at the femoral insertion side. There is a small subset of tibial-sided grade III tears that are associated with worse clinical outcome following conservative treatment, and therefore surgical repair is often recommended. Recon-struction is rare because surgical repair is usually effective in restoring the MCL. LCL injuries are much less common than MCL ligament injuries, but, similarly, most are man-aged conservatively.With return of range of motion and normal gait pattern, patients are functionally progressed towards return to sports. A functional brace during sports is often advised.Cruciate LigamentsThe cruciate ligaments are situated centrally within the intercon-dylar notch of the knee. The biomechanical function of both the ACL and the PCL is complex and three-dimensional, but both play an"

Gradually, hyaline cartilage is formed, which restores the structural and functional integrity of the injured site.TendonTendons and ligaments are specialized structures that link mus-cle and bone, and bone and bone, respectively. They consist of parallel bundles of collagen interspersed with spindle cells. Tendons and ligaments can be subjected to a variety of injuries, such as laceration, rupture, and contusion. Due to the mobility of the underlying bone or muscles, the damaged ends usually separate. Tendon and ligament healing progresses in a similar fashion as in other areas of the body (i.e., through hematoma formation, organization, laying down of reparative tissue, and scar formation). Matrix is characterized by accumulation of types I and III collagen along with increased water, DNA, and glycosaminoglycan content. As the collagen fibers"

In sports, the major stabilizing structures such as the ACL and the medial collateral ligament (MCL) are frequently injured. Other common knee injuries involve the menisci, posterolateral corner (PLC), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and patellofemoral joint.MenisciThe menisci are crescent-shaped pieces of fibrocartilage that provide joint stability, shock absorption, load distribution, and proprioception to the knee. Sudden meniscal tears often happen during sports, usually during contact or twisting injuries to the knee. Symptoms associated with a meniscus tear include pain, swelling, stiffness, catching, and locking of the knee. Radio-graphs are typically obtained to assess for a concomitant bony injury, the presence of (early) osteoarthritis, and leg alignment abnormalities. However, since menisci are radiolucent and are not seen on radiographs, an"
