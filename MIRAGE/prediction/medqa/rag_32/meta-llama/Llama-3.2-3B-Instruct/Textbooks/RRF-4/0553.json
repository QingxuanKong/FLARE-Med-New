It may be a particularly effective agent in patients with low-renin primary hypertension, resistant hypertension, and primary aldosteronism. In patients with CHF, low-dose spironolactone reduces mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure when given in addition to conventional therapy with ACEIs, digoxin, and loop diuretics. Because spironolactone binds to progesterone and androgen receptors, side effects may include gynecomastia, impotence, and menstrual abnormalities. These side effects are circumvented by a newer agent, eplerenone, which is a selective aldosterone antagonist."

With these caveats, the ratio has been reported to be useful as a screening test in measurements obtained with patients taking their usual antihypertensive medications. A high ratio in the absence of an elevated plasma aldosterone level is considerably less specific for primary aldosteronism since many patients with primary hypertension have low renin levels in this setting, particularly African Americans and elderly patients."

The accepted screening test is concurrent measurement of plasma renin and aldosterone with subsequent calculation of the aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) (Fig. 406-12); serum potassium needs to be normalized prior to testing. Stopping antihypertensive medication can be cumbersome, particularly in patients with severe hypertension.

High-renin patients may have a vasoconstrictor form of hypertension, whereas low-renin patients may have volume-dependent hypertension. Inconsistent associations between plasma aldosterone and blood pressure have been described in patients with primary hypertension. The association between aldosterone and blood pressure is more striking in African Americans, and PRA tends to be low in hypertensive African Americans. This raises the possibility that subtle increases in aldosterone may contribute to hypertension in at least some groups of patients who do not have overt primary aldosteronism. Furthermore, spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, may be a particularly effective antihypertensive agent for some patients with primary hypertension, including some patients with \u201cdrug-resistant\u201d hypertension."

Although more costly, lurasidone is then prescribed, which, over the course of several weeks of treatment, improves his symptoms and is tolerated by the patient. What signs and symptoms would support an initial diagnosis of schizophrenia? In the treatment of schizophre-nia, what benefits do the second-generation antipsychotic drugs offer over the traditional agents such as haloperidol? In addition to the management of schizophrenia, what other clinical indications warrant consideration of the use of drugs nominally classified as antipsychotics? A 19-year-old male student is brought into the clinic by his mother who has been concerned about her son\u2019s erratic behavior and strange beliefs. He destroyed a TV because he felt the TV was sending harassing messages to him. In addition, he reports hearing voices telling him that fam-ily members are trying to poison his food. As a result, he is not eating. After a diagnosis is made, haloperidol is"

Loop diuretics (furosemide) work better than thiazide diuretics at lower glomerular filtration rates and higher serum creatinine levels. Control of hypertension with concurrent renal insufficiency is difficult and is probably best handled by an internist or nephrologist. Thiazides and loop diuretics should not be used concurrently because profound diuresis may occur and lead to renal impairment. Concurrent use of nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) limits the effectiveness of this class of drugs. Other side effects that further limit the usefulness of thiazide diuretics include hyperuricemia, which may contribute to acute gout attacks, glucose intolerance, and hyperlipidemias (26). The metabolic side effects of these drugs limit their popularity."

Before testing, patients must receive adequate sodium and potassium. Antihypertensive medications should be held, if possible, and spironolactone, \u03b2-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers should be avoided. Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism have an ele-vated plasma aldosterone concentration level with a suppressed plasma renin activity; a plasma aldosterone concentrationto-plasma renin activity ratio of 1:25 to 30 is strongly sugges-tive of the diagnosis.98 False-positive results can occur, particularly in patients with chronic renal failure. Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism also fail to suppress aldosterone levels with sodium loading. This test can be performed by performing a 24-hour urine collection for cortisol, sodium, and aldosterone after 5 days of a high-sodium diet or alternatively giving the"

Unilateral adrenalectomy, often done via a laparoscopic approach, is curative in 40\u201370% of patients with an adenoma. Transient hypoaldosteronism may occur up to 3 months postoperatively, resulting in hyperkalemia. Potassium should be monitored during this time, and hyperkalemia should be treated with potassium-wasting diuretics and with fludrocortisone, if needed. Patients with bilateral hyperplasia should be treated medically. The drug regimen for these patients, as well as for patients with an adenoma who are poor surgical candidates, should include an aldosterone antagonist and, if necessary, other potassium-sparing diuretics."
