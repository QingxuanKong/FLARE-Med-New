She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the breasts shows a secondary mound formed by the nipple and areola. Pubic hair is sparse and lightly pigmented. Abdominal examination shows bilateral firm, nontender inguinal masses. Pelvic examination shows a blind-ended vaginal pouch. Ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?",

The ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries. These findings suggest that the patient has a condition related to the development of the reproductive system.\\n\\nThe presence of a blind-ended vaginal pouch and the absence of a visible uterus or ovaries on ultrasonography are key findings that point towards a condition known as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS). In AIS, the body is genetically male (46,XY) but is resistant to androgens, leading to the development of female secondary sexual characteristics.\\n\\nGiven this diagnosis, let's evaluate the potential treatment options:\\n\\nA. Gonadectomy: This is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of the gonads (ovaries or testes). In the case of AIS, gonadectomy is often recommended to prevent the development of gonadoblastoma, a rare tumor that can occur in undifferentiated gonads. This option is a plausible choice for treating AIS.\\n\\nB. Testosterone therapy: This option is not appropriate for AIS, as the patient's body is resistant to androgens. Testosterone therapy would not be effective in treating the underlying condition.\\n\\nC. Vaginal dilatory therapy: This option is not relevant to the treatment of AIS. Vaginal dilators are used to treat conditions such as vaginal stenosis or vaginismus, not AIS.\\n\\nD. Prednisolone therapy: This option is not relevant to the treatment of AIS. Prednisolone is a corticosteroid used to treat various conditions such as inflammatory disorders or allergic reactions, not AIS.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition is gonadectomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Typical findings include the appearance of a 1to 3-cm, round, freely mobile, often tender, and firm mass immediately beneath the areola during sexual maturity rating stage III. Large, hard, or fixed enlargements and masses associated with any nipple discharge warrant further investigation. Reassurance is usually the only treatment required. If the condition worsens and is associated with psychological morbidity, it may be treated with bromocriptine. Surgical treatment with reduction mammoplasty can be helpful with massive hypertrophy. Irregular menses is the most common complaint of early adolescent girls. As regular, ovulatory cycles become established, pain with menstruation (dysmenorrhea) is a frequent complaint."

The diagnosis of ovarian masses in prepubertal girls is difficult because the condition is rare in this age group and, consequently, there is a low index of suspicion. Many symptoms are nonspecific, and acute symptoms are more likely to be attributed to more common entities such as appendicitis. Abdominal palpation and bimanual rectoabdominal examination are important in any child who has nonspecific abdominal or pelvic symptoms. An ovarian mass that is abdominal in location can be confused with other abdominal masses occurring in children, such as Wilms\u2019 tumor or neuroblastoma. Acute pain is often associated with torsion. The ovarian ligament becomes elongated as a result of the abdominal location of ovarian tumors, thus creating a predisposition to torsion. Adnexal torsion is more likely to occur with an ovarian mass than with a normal size ovary. While torsion of a normal ovary is rare in adolescents and adults, it is more likely to occur in"

It is suggested that when the cyst is asymptomatic, small (<5\u201310 cm in diameter), unilocular, and thin walled, with a normal CA125 level, the risk of malignancy is extremely low and these masses can be followed conservatively, without surgery (220,264,265).

A solid, irregular, fixed pelvic mass is highly suggestive of an ovarian malignancy. If an upper abdominal mass or ascites is present, the diagnosis of ovarian cancer is almost certain. Because the patient usually reports abdominal symptoms, she may not have a pelvic examination, and a tumor may be missed. In patients who are at least 1 year past menopause, the ovaries should be atrophic and not palpable. It was proposed that any palpable pelvic mass in these patients should be considered potentially malignant, a situation that was referred to as the postmenopausal palpable ovary syndrome (91). This concept was challenged, because subsequent authors reported that only about 3% of palpable masses measuring less than 5 cm in postmenopausal women are malignant (57)."

Some aspects of the examination\u2014such as assessment of vital signs and measurement of height, weight, blood pressure, and calculation of a body mass index\u2014 should be performed routinely during most office visits. Typically, examination of the breasts and abdomen and a complete examination of the pelvis are considered to be essential parts of the gynecologic examination. It is often helpful to ask the patient if the gynecologic examination was difficult for her in the past; this"

Most masses are 2 to 3 cm in diameter when detected, but they can become extremely large (i.e., the giant fibroadenoma). On physical examination, they are firm, smooth, and rubbery. They do not elicit an in\ufb02ammatory reaction, are freely mobile, and cause no dimpling of the skin or nipple retraction. They are often bilobed, and a groove can be palpated on examination. On mammographic and ultrasonographic imaging, the typical features are of a well-defined, smooth, solid mass with clearly defined margins and dimensions that are longer than wide and craniocaudad dimensions that are less than the length."

The senior physician realized that a potential cause of the abdominal pain was a pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). The patient was rushed for an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed no fetus or sac in the uterus. She was also noted to have a positive pregnancy test. The patient underwent surgery and was found to have a ruptured fallopian tube caused by an ectopic pregnancy. Whenever a patient has apparent pelvic pain, it is important to consider the gender-related anatomical differences. Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age."

The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative."
