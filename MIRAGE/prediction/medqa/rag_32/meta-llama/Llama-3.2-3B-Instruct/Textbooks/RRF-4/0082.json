    "question": "A 44-year-old African-American woman comes to the physician for a routine examination. She is concerned about cancer because her uncle died of metastatic melanoma 1 year ago. She has no history of serious illness and does not take any medication. She has been working in a law firm for the past 20 years and travels to the Carribean regularly with her husband. Examination of her skin shows no abnormal moles or warts. This woman is at greatest risk of which of the following types of melanoma?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the patient's risk factors for melanoma. The patient is an African-American woman with a family history of melanoma (her uncle died of metastatic melanoma), which increases her risk of developing melanoma. She also has a history of sun exposure, as she travels to the Caribbean regularly. According to the documents, African-Americans are at higher risk for acral lentiginous melanoma, which is more common in dark-skinned populations. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of history of serious illness make her more susceptible to melanoma. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Desmoplastic melanoma is associated with a fibrotic response, neural invasion, and a greater tendency for local recurrence, but it is not the most common type of melanoma in African-Americans. B. Nodular melanoma is more common in men and typically arises de novo, which does not fit the patient's profile. C. Acral lentiginous melanoma is more common in dark-skinned populations, such as African-Americans, and is often found on the palms, soles, nail beds, and mucous membranes. This matches the patient's risk factors. D. Superficial spreading melanoma is the most common type of melanoma overall, but it is not as common in African-Americans as acral lentiginous melanoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

It contains blood vessels that serve but do not enter the epidermis. It also contains nerve processes that either terminate in the dermis or penetrate the basal lamina to enter the epithelial compartment. Because the blood vessels and sensory nerve endings are concentrated in this layer, they are particularly apparent in the dermal papillae."

            "content": "Speculation about melanoma occurring during pregnancy based largely on anecdotal evidence and small case series concluded that it occurred with increased frequency, was more aggressive in its natural history, and was caused in part by the hormonal changes that also produced hyperpigmentation (so-called melasma) during pregnancy. However, more complete epidemiologic data suggest that melanoma is no more frequent in pregnant women than in nonpregnant women in the same age group, that melanoma is not more aggressive during pregnancy, and that hormones seem to have little or nothing to do with the etiology. Pregnant and nonpregnant women do not differ in the location of primary tumor, depth of primary tumor, tumor ulceration, or vascular invasion."

Stamford, CT: Appleton & Lange, 1998: 432.) \u25a0Malignant melanoma may metastasize, and 10% of patients with metastatic melanoma have no known 1\u00b0 lesion. Metastasis may be local (to nearby skin), regional (between the original lesion and its regional lymph nodes), or distant (via lymphatic or hematogenous spread to almost every organ in the body). Early recognition and treatment are essential. All adults should be examined for lesions that are suspicious for melanoma according to the ABCDE criteria, which identify dysplastic nevi and superficial spreading melanoma (see mnemonic)."

Cutaneous melanoma is predominantly a malignancy of white-skinned people (98% of cases), and the incidence correlates with latitude of residence, providing strong evidence for the role of sun exposure. Men are affected slightly more than women (1.3:1), and the median age at diagnosis is the late fifties. Dark-skinned populations (such as those of India and Puerto Rico), blacks, and East Asians also develop melanoma, albeit at rates 10\u201320 times lower than those in whites. Cutaneous melanomas in these populations are diagnosed more often at a higher stage, and patients tend to have worse outcomes. Furthermore, in nonwhite populations, there is a much higher frequency of acral (subungual, plantar, palmar) and mucosal melanomas. In 2014, more than 76,000 individuals in the United States were expected to develop melanoma, and"

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"
