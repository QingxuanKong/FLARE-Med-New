However, due to an unexpected bleeding event, the physician had to order a blood transfusion to replace the blood lost in the surgery. After this, the patient became irritable and had difficulty breathing, suggesting an allergic reaction, which was immediately treated with epinephrine.

To establish the diagnosis, he obtained an ultrasound scan of the pelvis, which confirmed that the mass stemmed from the uterus. The patient was referred to a gynecologist, and after a long discussion regarding her symptomatology, fertility, and risks, the surgeon and the patient agreed that a hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus) would be an appropriate course of therapy. The patient sought a series of opinions from other gynecologists, all of whom agreed that surgery was the appropriate option. The fibroid was removed with no complications."

Neither the patient nor the family physician had any concerns about the pregnancy. However, the patient did complain of unilateral swelling of her left leg, which had gradually increased over the previous 2 days. Furthermore, the evening before her visit she developed some sharp chest pain, which was exacerbated by deep breaths. The family physician ordered a duplex ultrasound scan of the left leg venous system. Ultrasound scanning of the vascular tree can demonstrate flow and occlusion of arteries and veins."

These anastomose with the superior, superficial, and deep epigastric venous systems to drain into the internal thoracic veins, which in turn drain into the brachiocephalic veins and the superior vena cava. After the initial inferior vena cava thrombosis, the veins of the anterior abdominal wall and other collateral pathways hypertrophy to accommodate the increase in blood flow. A 52-year-old woman visited her family physician with complaints of increasing lethargy and vomiting. The physician examined her and noted that compared to previous visits she had lost significant weight. She was also jaundiced, and on examination of the abdomen a well-defined 10-cm rounded mass was palpable below the liver edge in the right upper quadrant (Fig. 4.185)."

Mild symptoms such as pruritus and urticaria can be controlled by administration of 0.3\u20130.5 mL of 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) epinephrine SC or IM, with repeated doses as required at 5to 20-min intervals for a severe reaction. The failure to use epinephrine within the first 20 min of symptoms is a risk factor for poor outcome in studies of anaphylaxis to food. If the antigenic material was injected into an extremity, the rate of absorption may be reduced by prompt application of a tourniquet proximal to the reaction site, administration of 0.2 mL of 1:1000 epinephrine into the site, and removal without compression of an insect stinger, if present. An IV infusion should be initiated to provide a route for administration of 2.5 mL epinephrine, diluted 1:10,000, at 5to 10-min intervals, volume expanders such as normal saline, and vasopressor agents such as dopamine if"

Epinephrine and airway equipment should always be immediately available during antivenom infusion. An acute anaphylactic reaction may be heralded by a single hive or mild itching or may present as bronchospasm or acute cardiovascular collapse. If the patient develops an acute reaction to antivenom, the infusion should be temporarily stopped and the reaction immediately treated with IM epinephrine and IV antihistamines and glucocorticoids. Once the reaction has been controlled, if the severity of the envenomation warrants additional antivenom, the dose should be diluted further in isotonic saline and restarted as soon as possible.

Excessive bleeding from the operative field unas-sociated with bleeding from other sites usually suggests inad-equate mechanical hemostasis.Massive blood transfusion is a well-known cause of throm-bocytopenia. Bleeding following massive transfusion can occur because of hypothermia, dilutional coagulopathy, platelet dys-function, fibrinolysis, or hypofibrinogenemia. Another cause of hemostatic failure related to the administration of blood is a hemolytic transfusion reaction. The first sign of a transfusion reaction may be diffuse bleeding. The pathogenesis of this bleed-ing is thought to be related to the release of ADP from hemolyzed red blood cells, resulting"
