    "question": "An investigator is studying the function of different enzymes in various human cell types. A subset of normal human cells with an elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase is harvested and isolated.

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the role of bisphosphoglycerate mutase and its relationship with other enzymes in the cell. Bisphosphoglycerate mutase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) in red blood cells. 2,3-BPG is a crucial molecule that helps regulate oxygen delivery in the blood by binding to hemoglobin and reducing its affinity for oxygen. The presence of 2,3-BPG is increased in red blood cells, where it is produced by the action of bisphosphoglycerate mutase. The question asks which enzyme is most likely to be absent in cells with an elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase. We need to consider the metabolic pathways and enzymes involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate, producing energy for the cell. Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the final step of glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate into pyruvate. In gluconeogenesis, the reverse pathway of glycolysis, phosphoenolpyruvate is converted back into glucose. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is an enzyme that catalyzes this step. Bisphosphoglycerate mutase is not directly involved in gluconeogenesis. However, the production of 2,3-BPG in red blood cells is related to the glycolytic pathway, which is also involved in gluconeogenesis. Glutathione reductase is an enzyme involved in the antioxidant defense system, reducing oxidized glutathione to its reduced form. It is not directly related to glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of carbon dioxide and water to bicarbonate and protons, which is important for maintaining acid-base balance in the blood. It is not directly related to glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. Considering the relationship between bisphosphoglycerate mutase and glycolysis, the enzyme most likely to be absent in cells with an elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase is pyruvate kinase, which is involved in glycolysis. This is because the increased production of 2,3-BPG by bisphosphoglycerate mutase would lead to a decrease in the need for pyruvate kinase activity in glycolysis. The answer is B. Pyruvate kinase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

First, a relatively small group of enzymes are actively secreted into the blood by certain cell types. For example, the liver secretes zymogens (inactive precursors) of the enzymes involved in blood coagulation. Second, a large number of enzyme species are released from cells during normal cell turnover. These enzymes almost always function intracellularly and have no physiologic use in the plasma. In healthy individuals, the levels of these enzymes are fairly constant and represent a steady state in which the rate of release from damaged cells into the plasma is balanced by an equal rate of removal from the plasma. Increased plasma levels of these enzymes may indicate tissue damage (Fig. 5.20). (B) cells."

Affinity chromatography (Figure 8\u20139C) takes advantage of the biologically important binding interactions that occur on protein surfaces. If a substrate molecule is covalently coupled to an inert matrix such as a polysaccharide bead, the enzyme that operates on that substrate will often be specifically retained by the matrix and can then be eluted (washed out) in nearly pure form. Likewise, short DNA oligonucleotides of a specifically designed sequence can be immobilized in this way and used to purify DNA-binding proteins that normally recognize this sequence of nucleotides in chromosomes. Alternatively, specific antibodies can be coupled to a matrix to purify protein molecules recognized by the antibodies. Because of the great specificity of all such affinity columns, 1000to 10,000-fold purifications can sometimes be achieved in a single pass."

In fact, for most types of cancer, the incidence rises steeply with age\u2014 as would be expected if cancer is caused by a progressive, random accumulation 20 of a set of mutations in a single lineage of cells. As discussed later, these indirect arguments have now been confirmed by sys-0 tematically sequencing the genomes of the tumor cells from individual cancer patients and cataloging the mutations that they contain."

            "content": "Immunoprecipitation is a useful variation on the theme of affinity chromatography. Specific antibodies that recognize the protein to be purified are attached to small agarose beads. Rather than being packed into a column, as in affinity chromatography, a small quantity of the antibody-coated beads is simply added to a protein extract in a test tube and mixed in suspension for a short period of time\u2014 thereby allowing the antibodies to bind the desired protein. The beads are then collected by low-speed centrifugation, and the unbound proteins in the supernatant are discarded. This method is commonly used to purify small amounts of enzymes from cell extracts for analysis of enzymatic activity or for studies of associated proteins. bead with covalently attached substrate"

In the RBC, glycolysis is modified by inclusion of these shunt reactions."

Both fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and adenosine monophosphate inhibit fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase of gluconeogenesis and activate phosphofructokinase-1 of glycolysis. This results in reciprocal regulation of the two pathways. 0.5. The metabolism of ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase produces reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) from the oxidized (NAD+) form. What effect is the fall in the NAD+/NADH ratio expected to have on gluconeogenesis? Explain."
