Since she started high school one year ago, her academic performance has decreased. She also has had difficulty finding friends at the new school. She is afraid that her classmates will make fun of her and think that she is \u201cstupid.\u201d One month ago, when she had to give a presentation, she could not stop wondering how her classmates were going to react if she said something wrong. During the presentation, her heart started racing and she became flushed. Since this event, she avoids saying anything in class. She spends her breaks in the restroom because she is worried that nobody will talk to her. Physical and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, the girl avoids eye contact and appears uncomfortable and anxious. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?",

The key features of her condition include academic underachievement, social anxiety, fear of being judged, avoidance behaviors, and physical symptoms such as a racing heart and flushing. These symptoms are consistent with social anxiety disorder (SAD) in adolescents. The patient's symptoms have been worsening over the past year, and she has avoided speaking in class due to fear of being judged. This is a classic presentation of social anxiety disorder in adolescents. The appropriate pharmacotherapy for SAD in adolescents is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Among the options provided, fluoxetine is an SSRI commonly used to treat SAD in adolescents. It is effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, and it has a favorable safety profile in this age group.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

True or false: Withdrawing a nonbeneficial treatment is ethically similar to withholding a nonindicated one. When can a physician refuse to continue treating a patient on the grounds of futility? An eight-year-old child is in a serious accident. She requires emergent transfusion, but her parents are not present. Conditions in which confidentiality must be overridden. Involuntary commitment or isolation for medical treatment may be undertaken for what reason? A 10-year-old child presents in status epilepticus, but her parents refuse treatment on religious grounds. A son asks that his mother not be told about her recently discovered cancer. False. Patients may change their minds at any time. Exceptions to the requirement of informed consent include emergency situations and patients without decision-making capacity."

One of our patients, functioning normally in every other way, carried the unshakable idea that people were sneaking into her house at night when she was away and rearranging the furniture. She functioned extremely well through her eighties but had a schizophrenic sister. Also, several physicians under our care have woven extensive delusional ideas around tenuous scientific theories; these ideas have applied to personal life events as well as physical and psychologic symptoms and in some cases have resulted in bizarre regimens of self-medication. Rarely, a patient comes to the hospital for some other medical reason and it is found that he or she has been living quietly in the community, preoccupied with a bizarre delusional system yet appearing neither depressed nor schizophrenic. Certainly one often sees delusions in depressed patients who decompensate as their depression deepens."

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"
