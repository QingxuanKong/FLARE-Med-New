While talking about inflammasomes, he describes the process via an example: products of cellular stress are detected by NLRP3, which includes NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing 3; the latter interacts with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) via the pyrin domain, which leads to the formation of a protein speck that consists of multimers of ASC dimers. Which of the following enzymes will be activated as the next step in the process?",

The next step in the process would involve the activation of caspase 1, which is a key effector enzyme in the inflammasome. Caspase 1 is responsible for cleaving the inactive pro-forms of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 to produce the mature, active forms of these pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Activation of the inflammasome proceeds in several stages. The first is the aggregation of LRR domains of several NLRP3 molecules, or other NLRP molecules, by a specific trigger or recognition event. This aggregation induces the pyrin domains of NLRP3 to interact with pyrin domains of another protein named ASC (also called PYCARD). ASC is an adaptor protein composed of an amino-terminal pyrin domain and a carboxy-terminal CARD domain. Pyrin and CARD domains are each able to form polymeric filamentous structures (Fig. 3.20). The interaction of NLRP3 with ASC further drives the formation of a polymeric ASC filament, with the pyrin domains in the center and CARD domains facing outward. These CARD domains then interact with CARD domains of the inactive"

The free TXNIP may then displace HSP90 and SGT1 from NLRP3, again causing its activation. In both of these cases, NLRP3 activation involves aggregation of multiple monomers via their LLR and NOD domains to induce signaling. Finally, phagocytosis of particulate matter, such as the adjuvant alum, a crystalline salt of aluminum potassium sulfate, may lead to the rupture of lysosomes and release of the active protease cathepsin B, which can activate NLRP3 by an unknown mechanism."

            "content": "Inappropriate inflammasome activation has been associated with various diseases. Gout has been known for many years to cause inflammation in the cartilaginous tissues by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals, but how urate crystals caused inflammation was a mystery. Although the precise mechanism is still unclear, urate crystals are known to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, which induces the inflammatory cytokines associated with the symptoms of gout. Mutations in the NOD domain of NLRP2 and NLRP3 can activate inflammasomes inappropriately, and they are the cause of some inherited autoinflammatory diseases, in which inflammation occurs in the absence of infection. Mutations in NLRP3 in humans are associated with hereditary periodic fever syndromes, such as familial cold inflammatory syndrome and Muckle\u2013Wells syndrome (discussed in more detail in Chapter 13). Macrophages from patients with these conditions show spontaneous production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2. We"
