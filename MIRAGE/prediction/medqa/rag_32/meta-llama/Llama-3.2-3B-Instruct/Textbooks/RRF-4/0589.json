She was in her aerobics class when the pain started but denies any trauma to the region. She has a history of recurrent ovarian cysts. Menses occur regularly at 28-day intervals. Her temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (99.3\u00b0F). Abdominal examination shows tenderness in the right lower quadrant with guarding. Pelvic ultrasound shows a large simple cyst on the right ovary. Right ovarian artery flow is detectable on Doppler, but there is no flow detected in the right ovarian vein. Which of the following ligaments is most likely to have been involved?",

Pain usually begins with ovulation and lasts until the end of menses. The uterus is often bulky, and the ovaries are enlarged with multiple functional cysts. The uterus, parametria, and uterosacral ligaments are tender. Transuterine venography is the primary method for diagnosis, although other modalities, such as pelvic ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and laparoscopy, may disclose varicosities (93).

The diagnosis of ovarian masses in prepubertal girls is difficult because the condition is rare in this age group and, consequently, there is a low index of suspicion. Many symptoms are nonspecific, and acute symptoms are more likely to be attributed to more common entities such as appendicitis. Abdominal palpation and bimanual rectoabdominal examination are important in any child who has nonspecific abdominal or pelvic symptoms. An ovarian mass that is abdominal in location can be confused with other abdominal masses occurring in children, such as Wilms\u2019 tumor or neuroblastoma. Acute pain is often associated with torsion. The ovarian ligament becomes elongated as a result of the abdominal location of ovarian tumors, thus creating a predisposition to torsion.

Paratubal cysts represent embryologic remnants that may be confused with an ovarian mass; they are typically asymptomatic, but can be associated with adnexal torsion (Fig. 14.14). Adnexal or ovarian torsion is a challenging diagnosis to make in prepubertal girls or adolescents; torsion of a mass is more likely to occur than is torsion of normal adnexa, although this can occur. Doppler ultrasound examination may not predict the presence of torsion, although discrepancy in ovarian volume and large volume of the torsed adnexa may be helpful in making the diagnosis (116,117). Management should consist of detorsion rather than oophorectomy, even if the mass appears to have no blood \ufb02ow, as recovery of ovarian function is likely (118)."

The adnexa may be untwisted and a cystectomy performed if appropriate.

Her vital signs include the following: temperature 99.8\u00b0F, blood pressure 132/64 mm Hg, pulse 78 bpm, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, she had left upper abdominal tenderness with evidence of hepatomegaly and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory data revealed the following: alanine aminotransferase, 527 IU/L (normal 10\u201335 IU/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 425 IU/L (normal < 35 IU/L); and bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL (normal 0.1\u20130.3 mg/dL). What medications do OTC cold and flu preparations typically contain? Which of the OTC medications might have contrib-uted to the patient\u2019s current symptoms? KH, a 55-year-old woman, presents to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and complaints of new-onset flu symptoms over the past several days. Her past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis and chronic lower back pain secondary to a work-related fall 2 years ago. Her"

            "content": "Symptoms The majority of women with epithelial ovarian cancer have vague and nonspecific symptoms (3,85\u201387). In early-stage disease, if the patient is premenopausal, she may experience irregular menses. If a pelvic mass is compressing the bladder or rectum, she may report urinary frequency or constipation (85\u201387). Occasionally, she may perceive lower abdominal distention, pressure, or pain, such as dyspareunia. Acute symptoms, such as pain secondary to rupture or torsion, are unusual. In advanced-stage disease, patients have symptoms related to the presence of ascites, omental metastases, or bowel metastases. The symptoms include abdominal distention, bloating, constipation, nausea, anorexia, or early satiety. Premenopausal women may report irregular or heavy menses, whereas vaginal bleeding may occur in postmenopausal women (86)."

            "content": "The abdomen is often tender in one or both the lower quadrants. Significant distention or rebound tenderness may be present if there is there is a ruptured endometrioma. Bimanual and rectovaginal examinations can reveal a fixed, retroverted uterus with tender nodules in the uterosacral region or thickening of the cul-de-sac. An adnexal mass, if present, usually is fixed to the broad ligament and cul-de-sac. The clinical diagnosis of endometriosis is accurate approximately 50% of the time. Definitive diagnosis is made by laparoscopy or laparotomy. In the setting of chronic pain symptoms, as noted above, with an acute exacerbation a leaking endometrioma should be suspected. If there is a characteristic mass on ultrasound, laparoscopy is indicated. Gastrointestinal Tract Causes of Acute Pelvic Pain"

            "content": "Leaking or Rupture of an Ovarian Cyst Functional cysts (e.g., follicle or corpus luteum) are the most common ovarian cysts and are more likely to rupture than benign or malignant neoplasms. The pain associated with rupture of the ovarian follicle at the time of ovulation is called mittelschmerz. The small amount of blood leaking into the peritoneal cavity and high concentration of follicular \ufb02uid prostaglandins contribute to this midcycle pelvic pain. The pain is usually mild to moderate and self-limited, and with an intact coagulation system, hemoperitoneum is unlikely. A hemorrhagic corpus luteum cyst develops during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The rapidly expanding ovarian capsule or, with rupture, the blood in the peritoneal cavity is responsible for the acute pain. Rupture of this cyst can produce either a small amount of intraperitoneal bleeding or frank hemorrhage, resulting in significant blood loss and hemoperitoneum."
