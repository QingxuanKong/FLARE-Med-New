    "question": "A 79-year-old woman presents to her physician complaining of a persistent non-productive cough and dyspnea after contracting a cold in the past month. She describes herself as being \u201cgenerally healthy\u201d before the cold started. Medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient takes hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. Her parents are both deceased. She does not smoke and only drinks alcohol occasionally. During a review of symptoms, she described a month-long trip to St. Louis, Missouri, to visit family. At the physician\u2019s office, her temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. A focused chest exam reveals mild crepitus on the right side. A chest X-ray shows a cavitary lesion in the right lung which is confirmed on chest computed tomography (CT). A lung biopsy is performed to rule out cancer and reveals necrotic granulomatous inflammation with oval yeast in macrophages. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step analysis of the question: **Step 1: Review the patient's symptoms and medical history** The patient is an 79-year-old woman who presents with a persistent non-productive cough and dyspnea after contracting a cold in the past month. She has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and takes hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. **Step 2: Analyze the patient's exposure history** The patient recently visited St. Louis, Missouri, to visit family, which is a region known to have a high incidence of certain fungal infections. **Step 3: Review the diagnostic test results** The chest X-ray shows a cavitary lesion in the right lung, which is confirmed on chest computed tomography (CT). A lung biopsy reveals necrotic granulomatous inflammation with oval yeast in macrophages. **Step 4: Consider the differential diagnosis** Based on the patient's symptoms, exposure history, and diagnostic test results, the possible diagnoses are: * Blastomycosis (A) * Sporotrichosis (B) * Histoplasmosis (C) * Onychomycosis (D) **Step 5: Eliminate less likely options** Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nails, which is unlikely to cause a cavitary lesion in the lung. **Step 6: Consider the geographic distribution of the disease** Blastomycosis is more common in the Midwestern United States, particularly in Missouri, which matches the patient's exposure history. **Step 7: Consider the clinical presentation** The patient's symptoms of persistent cough and dyspnea, combined with the cavitary lesion and necrotic granulomatous inflammation on lung biopsy, are consistent with blastomycosis. **Step 8: Choose the most likely diagnosis** Based on the patient's exposure history, diagnostic test results, and clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is blastomycosis. Here is the answer in the required format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and medical history, combined with her exposure history and diagnostic test results, suggest that blastomycosis is the most likely diagnosis. Blastomycosis is a fungal infection that is more common in the Midwestern United States, particularly in Missouri, and can cause a cavitary lesion in the lung with necrotic granulomatous inflammation. The patient's symptoms of persistent cough and dyspnea, combined with the cavitary lesion and necrotic granulomatous inflammation on lung biopsy, are consistent with blastomycosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Her most recent laboratory values include a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that is above goal at 160 mg/dL (goal < 100 mg/dL) and a hemo-globin A1c that is well controlled at 6%. Her blood pressure is high at 160/100 mm Hg. Her prescription medications include simvastatin, metformin, and benazepril. She also takes over-the-counter ibuprofen for occasional knee pain and a multivitamin supplement once daily. She has heard good things about natural products and asks you if taking a garlic supplement daily could help to bring her blood"

CXR, MRI, and cardiac catheterization may be helpful, but echocardiography is key to diagnosis and reveals rapid early filling with a normal or near-normal EF. Cardiac biopsy may reveal fibrosis or evidence of infiltration. ECG frequently shows LBBB. Therapeutic options are limited and generally are palliative only. Medical treatment includes cautious use of diuretics for \ufb02uid overload, vasodilators to \u2193 filling pressure, and anticoagulation if not contraindicated. Major risk factors for CAD include age, male gender, hyperlipidemia, DM, hypertension, obesity, a family history, and smoking. The classic triad of angina consists of substernal chest pain that is provoked by exertion and relieved by rest or nitrates."

His physician initially prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic commonly used to treat hyper-tension. His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic. Because the patient had elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, hydrochlorothiazide was replaced with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril lowered his blood pressure to almost normotensive levels. However, after several weeks on enalapril, the patient returned complaining of a persistent cough. In addition, some signs of angioedema were detected. How does enalapril lower blood pressure? Why does it occasionally cause coughing and angioedema? What other drugs could be used to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and decrease blood pressure,"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Reflex activity may therefore occur below the injury, but communication with the brain is lost. A 25-year-old woman complained of increasing lumbar back pain. Over the ensuing weeks she was noted to have an enlarging lump in the right groin, which was mildly tender to touch. On direct questioning, the patient also complained of a productive cough with sputum containing mucus and blood, and she had a mild temperature. The chest radiograph revealed a cavitating apical lung mass, which explains the pulmonary history."

The physical examination in cardiogenic pulmonary edema is notable for evidence of increased intracardiac pressures (S3 gallop, elevated jugular venous pulse, peripheral edema) and rales and/or wheezes on auscultation of the chest. In contrast, the physical examination in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is dominated by the findings of the precipitating condition; pulmonary findings may be relatively normal in the early stages. The chest radiograph in cardiogenic pulmonary edema typically shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette, vascular redistribution, interstitial thickening, and perihilar alveolar infiltrates; pleural effusions are common. In noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, heart size is normal, alveolar infiltrates are distributed more uniformly throughout the lungs, and pleural effusions are uncommon."
