He has a past medical history of asthma, and his current medications include albuterol and fluticasone. His temperature is 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/60 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, the patient seems uncomfortable. He requests that the lights in the room stay turned off during the physical exam. The patient's cardiac exam demonstrates a normal rate and rhythm, and his pulmonary exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Musculoskeletal exam reveals diminished mobility of the neck in all four directions, with flexion of the neck causing the patient discomfort.

This suggests meningeal irritation, which is a common finding in meningitis.\\n\\nThe cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results show an elevated cell count, low glucose, and elevated protein levels, which are consistent with bacterial meningitis. The CSF pressure is also elevated.\\n\\nGiven these findings, the most likely diagnosis is bacterial meningitis.\\n\\nNow, let's evaluate the treatment options:\\n\\nA. Acyclovir is typically used to treat viral infections, such as herpes simplex encephalitis, which is not supported by the provided information.\\n\\nB. Amphotericin and 5-flucytosine are antifungal medications, which are not indicated in this case.\\n\\nC. Ceftriaxone and vancomycin are antibiotics that are commonly used to treat bacterial meningitis, especially when the causative organism is not yet identified. This combination is a reasonable choice for empirical treatment of bacterial meningitis.\\n\\nD. IV fluids and monitoring are important for managing dehydration and hemodynamic instability, but they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.\\n\\nTherefore, the best treatment for this patient's most likely diagnosis is C.

The headache may last for days or, rarely, weeks. Most characteristic is the relation of the cranial pain to upright posture, and its relief within moments after assuming the recumbent position. Actually, the syndrome includes more than headache. There may be pain at the base of the skull posteriorly and in the back of the neck and upper thoracic spine, mild stiffness of the neck and shoulders, and nausea and vomiting. At times, the signs of meningeal irritation are so prominent as to raise the question of postlumbar puncture meningitis, although lack of fever usually excludes this possibility.

Suspicion of its presence is raised by the recent onset of anosmia or by the occurrence of a watery nasal discharge that is salty to the taste and increases in volume when the head is dependent. One way of confirming the presence of a CSF leak is to measure the glucose concentration of nasal secretions; ordinarily they contain little glucose, but in CSF rhinorrhea the amount of glucose approximates that obtained by lumbar puncture (two-thirds of the serum value). A \u201cdipstick\u201d used for urine testing is sometimes adequate but these are regrettably decresingly available on general hospital wards. Another bedside test for CSF rhinorrhea or otorrhea is to estimate the amount of protein in the fluid.

Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

The patient had noted progressive weakness over several days, to the point that he was unable to rise from bed. Past medical history was notable for small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, liver, and adrenals. The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced. Blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, increasing to 160/98 mmHg after 1 L of saline, with a JVP at 8 cm. There was generalized muscle weakness.

The spinal fluid is often sterile, but on occasion an organism is cultured. If the patient is stuporous or comatose, there is a risk associated with performing a lumbar puncture, and one should proceed first with imaging procedures. By imaging, one can see the ear or sinus lesions or bone erosion. The meninges around the empyema enhance and the collection of pus can be visualized more dependably with MRI. Empyema that follows meningitis in children tends to localize on the undersurface of the temporal lobe and may require coronal views to be well visualized."

Assessment of the patient\u2019s general appearance and vital signs, skin and soft tissue examination, and the neurologic evaluation are of particular importance. The patient may appear either anxious and agitated or lethargic and apathetic. Fever is usually present, although elderly patients and compromised hosts (e.g., patients who are uremic or cirrhotic and those who are taking glucocorticoids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be afebrile despite serious underlying infection. Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate helps determine the degree of hemodynamic and metabolic compromise. The patient\u2019s airway must be evaluated to rule out the risk of obstruction from an invasive oropharyngeal infection."

The combination of unrelenting headache, stiff neck, fatigue, night sweats, and fever with a CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis and a mildly decreased glucose concentration is highly suspicious for tuberculous meningitis. The last tube of fluid collected at LP is the best tube to send for a smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). If there is a pellicle in the CSF or a cobweb-like clot on the surface of the fluid, AFB can best be demonstrated in a smear of the clot or pellicle. Positive smears are typically reported in only 10\u201340% of cases of tuberculous meningitis in adults. Cultures of CSF take 4\u20138 weeks to identify the organism and are positive in ~50% of adults. Culture remains the gold standard to make"

During the general examination, signs of anemia (pale conjunctivae), cyanosis, and cirrhosis (spider angiomata, gynecomastia) should be sought. Examination of the chest should focus on symmetry of movement; percussion (dullness is indicative of pleural effusion; hyperresonance is a sign of emphysema); and auscultation (wheezes, rhonchi, prolonged expiratory phase, and diminished breath sounds are clues to disorders of the airways; rales suggest interstitial edema or fibrosis). The cardiac examination should focus on signs of elevated right heart pressures (jugular venous distention, edema, accentuated pulmonic component to the second heart sound); left ventricular dysfunction (S3 and S4 gallops); and valvular disease (murmurs). When examining the abdomen with the patient in the supine position, the physician should note whether there is paradoxical movement of the abdomen: inward motion during inspiration is a sign of diaphragmatic"

The CSF protein content is high, (100 to 400 mg/100 mL or more) but the glucose is normal. Elevation of the sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and peripheral neutrophilic leukocytosis are additional indicators to the diagnosis. The last of these tests is abnormal in two-thirds of cases. Blood cultures demonstrate the organism in a similar proportion. Cultures from the CSF are infrequently positive. The decades old series reported by Baker and colleagues is still a valuable reference, as is the more recent discussion by Darouiche.

            "content": "In outline, the clinical syndrome of aseptic meningitis consists of fever, headache, signs of meningeal irritation, and a predominantly lymphocytic pleocytosis in the spinal fluid with normal glucose. Usually the onset is acute and the temperature is elevated, from 38 to 40\u00b0C (100.4 to 104\u00b0F). Headache that is more severe than that associated with other febrile states is the most frequent symptom. A variable but usually mild degree of lethargy, irritability, and drowsiness may occur. Photophobia and pain on movement of the eyes are common additional complaints. Stiffness of the neck and spine on forward bending attests to the presence of meningeal irritation (meningismus), but at first it may be so slight as to pass unnoticed. When there are accompanying neurologic signs, they too tend to be mild or fleeting: paresthesia in an extremity, or wavering Babinski signs."
