    "question": "A clinical trial is conducted to test the efficacy of a new drug, A, to treat tinea versicolor. A total of 500 participants are recruited for the study and are randomized into 2 groups in equal numbers. Group 1, the study treatment group, is given drug A, while group 2, the control group, is given the current standard antifungal therapy. After the completion of therapy, 190 participants from the study treatment group and 165 participants from the control group are cured. Which calculation below represents the number needed to treat for the new drug?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT), we need to determine the number of participants who received the new drug (study treatment group) and the number of participants who were cured. We are given that 190 participants from the study treatment group and 165 participants from the control group were cured. Since the study is randomized and equal numbers of participants were assigned to each group, we can assume that the cure rates are representative of the overall population. We need to calculate the cure rate for the study treatment group and then use this rate to calculate the NNT. The cure rate for the study treatment group is 190/250 = 0.76. The NNT is the reciprocal of the cure rate, which is 1/0.76 = 1.316. However, this value is not among the answer choices. To get the NNT, we need to consider the number of participants who were not cured in the study treatment group, which is 250 - 190 = 60. The NNT is then 250/60 = 4.17. However, this value is not among the answer choices either. We can express the NNT as a fraction with a numerator and a denominator, which are the number of participants who were not cured in the study treatment group and the total number of participants in the study, respectively. The NNT is then 250/60, which is equal to 4.17. However, this value can be simplified to 25/2.17, which is approximately 11.55, or 25/2.17. Since 25/2.17 is approximately equal to 11.55, we can round it to 12/2.17, which is approximately 5.57. However, this value is not among the answer choices. We can express the NNT as a fraction with a numerator and a denominator, which are the number of participants who were cured in the study treatment group and the total number of participants in the study, respectively. The NNT is then 190/500, which is equal to 0.38. The NNT is the reciprocal of the cure rate, which is 1/0.38 = 2.63. However, this value is not among the answer choices. We can express the NNT as a fraction with a numerator and a denominator, which are the number of participants who were not cured in the study treatment group and the total number of participants in the study, respectively. The NNT is then 250/500, which is equal to 0.5. The NNT is the reciprocal of the cure rate, which is 1/0.5 = 2. However, this value is among the answer choices. Therefore, the correct answer is B. 250/25, which is equal to 10.\" } \"answer_choice\": \"B\" } ``` The final answer is B. 250/25, which is equal to 10.",

Topical therapy is generally effective for uncomplicated tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and limited tinea pedis. Topical agents are not effective as monotherapy for tinea capitis or onychomycosis (see below). Topical imidazoles, triazoles, and allylamines may be effective therapies for dermatophyte infections, but nystatin is not active against dermatophytes. Topicals are generally applied twice daily, and treatment should continue for 1 week beyond clinical resolution of the infection. Tinea pedis often requires longer treatment courses and frequently relapses. Oral antifungal agents may be required for recalcitrant tinea pedis or tinea corporis."

The study may be masked in one of two ways: single-masked, in which patients do not know which treatment group they are in, or double-masked, in which neither the patients nor their physicians know who is in which group. Double-masked studies are the gold standard for studying treatment effects. Advantages of randomized controlled trials are as follows: They involve minimal bias. They have the potential to demonstrate causal relationships. Disadvantages include the following: They are costly and time intensive. Informed consent may be diffcult to obtain. Some interventions (e.g., surgery) are not amenable to masking. Ethical standards cannot allow all variables to be controlled."

One unblinded, placebo-controlled trial assessed the use of FMT in 42 patients with recurrent C. difficile infection (defined as at least one relapse after treatment with vancomycin or metronidazole for \u226510 d). Patients were pretreated with oral vancomycin. The experimental group then received FMT via nasoduodenal tube from healthy volunteer donors (<60 years of age) selected from the community. Controls underwent sterile lavage or received oral vancomycin alone. In 10 weeks of follow-up, infection was cured (with cure defined as three negative fecal tests for C. difficile toxin) in 81% of patients in the FMT group (13 of 16) but in only 23% (3 of 13) in the bowel-lavage control arm and 31% (4 of 13) in the vancomycin-only group. Metagenomic analysis of microbiota samples collected before and after treatment revealed an increased representation of Bacteroidetes and"

The smaller the NNT, the more efficacious a treatment. For example, in an RCT comparing laparoscopic cholecystectomy to observation to prevent recur-rent idiopathic acute pancreatitis, the number needed to treat was five patients.24 The NNT should also be weighed against the adverse effects of the intervention.Number Needed to Harm. While NNT reports the number of patients who undergo the intervention before a single patient benefits, number needed to harm (NNH) describes how many patients undergo the intervention for one person to have an adverse event. The higher the NNH, the safer a treatment is. In general, interventions with a low NNT and high NNH are pre-ferred. However, NNT and NNH should not be used in isolation when determining the appropriateness of intervention as neither number takes into account the degree of benefit to"

Randomization is the best method for distributing all foreseen confounding factors, as well as unknown confounders, equally between the experimental and control groups. When properly carried out, such studies are rarely invalidated and are considered the gold standard in evaluating drugs. A critical factor in evaluating the data regarding a new drug is access to all the data. Unfortunately, many large studies are never published because the results are negative, ie, the new drug is not better than the standard therapy. This missing data phenomenon falsely exaggerates the benefits of new drugs because negative results are hidden. *I thank Ralph Gonzales, MD, for helpful comments."

In addition, posaconazole has been found to be effective against fluconazole-resistant Candida species. The results of a large-scale study of the use of posaconazole as salvage therapy for aspergillosis indicated that it is an alternative to other agents for salvage therapy; however, that study predated the use of voriconazole and the echinocandins."

Using information gathered in phases 1 and 2, phase 3 trials are designed to minimize errors caused by placebo effects, variable course of the disease, etc. Therefore, double-blind and crossover techniques are often used. Phase 3 trials are usually performed in settings similar to those anticipated for the ultimate use of the drug. Phase 3 studies can be difficult to design and execute and are usually expensive because of the large numbers of patients involved and the masses of data that must be collected and analyzed. The drug is formulated as intended for the market. The investigators are usually specialists in the disease being treated. Certain toxic effects, especially those caused by immunologic processes, may first become apparent in phase 3."
