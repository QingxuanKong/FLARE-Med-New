    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the symptoms and examination findings of the stillborn infant and relate them to the potential causes. The infant has a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, club feet, absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae, and is stillborn at 38 weeks' gestation. These findings suggest a congenital disorder affecting the skeletal system. The absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae is a key finding that points towards a disorder affecting vertebral development. Among the options provided, we need to identify the one that is most closely related to congenital skeletal abnormalities. Maternal oligohydramnios (A) is a condition characterized by a decrease in amniotic fluid volume, which can be associated with various fetal anomalies but is not directly linked to the specific skeletal abnormalities described. Intrauterine alcohol exposure (B) is a known risk factor for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, which can include skeletal abnormalities, but the specific findings in this case do not strongly suggest this as the primary cause. Maternal diabetes (C) can increase the risk of various congenital anomalies, including skeletal abnormalities, but the findings in this case do not specifically point towards diabetes as the primary cause. Chromosome 18 trisomy (D) is a genetic disorder that can cause a range of congenital anomalies, including skeletal abnormalities such as sacral agenesis, which is the absence of the sacrum. This condition is often associated with other congenital anomalies and is a strong predisposing factor for the described findings in the stillborn infant. Therefore, the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition is chromosome 18 trisomy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

In breech presentations, the fetal pelvis is situated in thematernal pelvis. This can increase hip flexion and limit overall fetal hip motion, causing further stretching of the alreadylax joint capsule and exposing the posterior aspect of thefemoral head. The altered relationship between the acetabulum and femoral head causes abnormal acetabular development. Postnatal positioning of the hips in a tight swaddlewith the hips adducted and extended can displace the hip joint. Congenital muscular torticollis, metatarsus adductus, and clubfoot are associated with DDH. An infant with any of these three conditions should receive a careful examination of the hips."

Multiple factors aid determination of the best delivery route for a given mother-fetus pair. These include fetal characteristics, maternal pelvic dimensions, coexistent pregnancy complications, provider experience, patient preference, hospital capabilities, and gestational age. Compared with their term counterparts, preterm breech fetuses have distinct complications related to their small size and immaturity.

If fetal lung maturity is conirmed, salvage of both the healthy fetus and its jeopardized sibling is possible. Unfortunately, ideal management if twins are immature is problematic but should be based on the chances of intact survival for both fetuses.

Face the monitor squarely and position it so that it is viewed at a neutral angle, such as 15 degrees downward. 5. Avoid reaching, bending, or twisting while scanning. 6. Frequent breaks may prevent muscle strain. Stretching and strengthening exercises can be helpful. The earlier that sonography is performed, the more accurate the gestational age assessment. Specific criteria for \"re-dating\" a pregnancy, that is, reassigning the gestational age and estimated date of delivery using initial sonogram findings, are shown in Table 1 0-1. The only exception to revising the gestational age based on early sonography is if the pregnancy resulted from assisted reproductive technology, in which case accuracy of gestational age assessment is presumed."

            "content": "A 65-year-old man is referred to you from his primary care physician (PCP) for evaluation and management of pos-sible osteoporosis. He saw his PCP for evaluation of low back pain. X-rays of the spine showed some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine plus several wedge deformities in the thoracic spine. The patient is a long-time smoker (up to two packs per day) and has two to four glasses of wine with dinner, more on the weekends. He has chronic bronchitis, presumably from smoking, and has been treated on numerous occasions with oral prednisone for exacerba-tions of bronchitis. He is currently on 10 mg/d prednisone. Examination shows kyphosis of the thoracic spine, with some tenderness to fist percussion over the thoracic spine. The dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measure-ment of the lumbar spine is \u201cwithin the normal limits,\u201d but the radiologist noted that the reading may be misleading because of degenerative changes. The hip measurement shows a T score (number of standard"

Extensor plantar responses (with normal tone in trunk and extremities), absence of deep tendon reflexes, and weakness (greater distally than proximally) are usually found. Loss of vibratory and proprioceptive sensation occurs. The median age of death is 35 years. Women have a significantly better prognosis than men. Cardiac involvement occurs in 90% of patients. Cardiomegaly, symmetric hypertrophy, murmurs, and conduction defects are reported. Moderate mental retardation or psychiatric syndromes are present in a small percentage of patients. A high incidence of diabetes mellitus (20%) is found and is associated with insulin resistance and pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction. Musculoskeletal deformities are common and include pes cavus, pes equinovarus, and scoliosis. MRI of the spinal cord shows atrophy (Fig. 450-2)."
