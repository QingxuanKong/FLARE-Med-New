He has had frequent episodes of a productive cough over the past 3 years. He had smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years but quit 1 year ago. He appears distressed. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 91%. Chest auscultation reveals diffuse wheezes and coarse crackles. A chest x-ray shows increased lung lucency bilaterally and flattening of the diaphragm. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a 2-day history of productive cough and worsening shortness of breath, with a history of frequent episodes of productive cough over the past 3 years and a significant smoking history. The patient's symptoms and lung exam findings, including diffuse wheezes and coarse crackles, suggest chronic bronchitis or possibly bronchiectasis. The chest x-ray shows increased lung lucency bilaterally and flattening of the diaphragm, which is consistent with bronchiectasis. The patient's oxygen saturation is low, indicating hypoxemia. The patient's age and smoking history also raise the possibility of COPD. The patient's symptoms and lung exam findings are most consistent with bronchiectasis, which is a complication of chronic bronchitis. The patient's oxygen saturation is low, indicating the need for oxygen therapy. The patient's symptoms and lung exam findings suggest that the patient is experiencing an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis. The most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for bronchiectasis is a combination of bronchodilators and a mucolytic agent. Albuterol is a bronchodilator that can help to relieve bronchospasm and improve lung function. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that can help to reduce inflammation and prevent bronchospasm. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that can help to reduce inflammation and swelling in the airways. Tiotropium is an anticholinergic agent that can help to relax the smooth muscle in the airways and improve lung function. Theophylline is a methylxanthine that can help to relax the smooth muscle in the airways and improve lung function. However, theophylline can have toxic effects at high doses, so it should be used with caution. Based on the patient's symptoms and lung exam findings, the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy is a combination of albuterol and montelukast, with or without prednisone and tiotropium. However, since tiotropium is not mentioned as a first line treatment in the given options, albuterol and montelukast are the best choices.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

It is important to assess oxygenation in severe cases of bronchiolitis. Pulse oximetry is adequate for monitoring oxygen saturation.

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) may also occur in patients with RA and is heralded by symptoms of dry cough and progressive shortness of breath. ILD can be associated with cigarette smoking and is generally found in patients with higher disease activity, although it may be diagnosed in up to 3.5% of patients prior to the onset of joint symptoms. Diagnosis is readily made by high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) scan. Pulmonary function testing shows a restrictive pattern (e.g., reduced total lung capacity) with a reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). The presence of ILD confers a poor prognosis.

FIGURE 300-5 Large bilateral proximal PE on a coronal chest CT image in a 54-year-old man with lung cancer and brain metastases. He had developed sudden onset of chest heaviness and shortness of breath while at home. There are filling defects in the main and segmental pulmonary arteries bilaterally (white arrows). Only the left upper lobe segmental artery is free of thrombus. chEst roEntgEnography A normal or nearly normal chest x-ray often occurs in PE. Well-established abnormalities include focal oligemia (Westermark\u2019s sign), a peripheral wedged-shaped density above the diaphragm (Hampton\u2019s hump), and an enlarged right descending pulmonary artery (Palla\u2019s sign)."

            "content": "The most common clinical presentation is a persistent productive cough with ongoing production of thick, tenacious sputum. Physical findings often include crackles and wheezing on lung auscultation, and some patients with bronchiectasis exhibit clubbing of the digits. Mild to moderate airflow obstruction is often detected on pulmonary function tests, overlapping with that seen at presentation with other conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis are usually characterized by changes in the nature of sputum production, with increased volume and purulence. However, typical signs and symptoms of lung infection, such as fever and new infiltrates, may not be present."

A Doppler ultrasound scan revealed marked stenosis of the subclavian artery at the outer border of the rib with abnormal flow distal to the narrowing. Within this region of abnormal flow there was evidence of thrombus adherent to the vessel wall. This patient underwent surgical excision of the cervical rib and had no further symptoms. A 52-year-old man presented with headaches and shortness of breath. He also complained of coughing up small volumes of blood. Clinical examination revealed multiple dilated veins around the neck. A chest radiograph demonstrated an elevated diaphragm on the right and a tumor mass, which was believed to be a primary bronchogenic carcinoma. By observing the clinical findings and applying anatomical knowledge, the site of the tumor can be inferred."

            "content": "In virtually all instances, evaluation of chronic cough merits a chest radiograph. The list of diseases that can cause persistent cough without other symptoms and without detectable abnormalities on physical examination is long. It includes serious illnesses such as sarcoidosis or Hodgkin\u2019s disease in young adults, lung cancer in older patients, and (worldwide) pulmonary tuberculosis. An abnormal chest film prompts an evaluation aimed at explaining the cough. In a patient with chronic productive cough, examination of expectorated sputum is warranted. Purulent-appearing sputum should be sent for routine bacterial culture and, in certain circumstances, mycobacterial culture as well. Cytologic examination of mucoid sputum may be useful to assess for malignancy and to distinguish neutrophilic from eosinophilic bronchitis. Expectoration of blood\u2014whether streaks of blood, blood mixed with airway secretions, or pure blood\u2014deserves a special approach to assessment and management (see"

ILD ASSOCIATED WITH CIGARETTE SMOKING Desquamative Interstitial Pneumonia \u2022 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS DIP is a rare but distinct clinical and pathologic entity found almost exclusively in cigarette smokers. The histologic hallmark is the extensive accumulation of macrophages in intraalveolar spaces with minimal interstitial fibrosis. The peak incidence is in the fourth and fifth decades. Most patients present with dyspnea and cough. Lung function testing shows a restrictive pattern with reduced DlCO and arterial hypoxemia. The chest x-ray and HRCT scans usually show diffuse hazy opacities."
