The patient lives with his daughter and was chatting with her when suddenly his speech became distorted with random and disconnected words that made no sense.

The patient is experiencing sudden onset speech changes, with distorted and disconnected words, and physical frustration. The speech changes are accompanied by weakness of the right arm. This suggests a left hemisphere lesion, as the left hemisphere is responsible for language processing and motor control of the right arm. The left frontal lobe is responsible for executive functions, including planning and decision-making, which may also be affected. The left temporal lobe is involved in processing auditory information and memory, which may also be affected. However, the primary symptoms are related to language processing and motor control, which points towards a left hemisphere lesion. Considering the options, the left frontal lobe (A) is the most likely location of the damage, given the combination of speech changes and right arm weakness. The left frontal lobe is also involved in executive functions, which may explain the patient's frustration and difficulty with communication.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

The patient is inattentive and unable to perceive the elements of his situation. He may talk incessantly and incoherently, and look distressed and perplexed; his expression may be in keeping with vague notions of being annoyed or threatened by someone. From his manner and the content of speech, it is evident that he misinterprets the meaning of ordinary objects and sounds, misidentifies the people around him, and is experiencing vivid visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations, often of a most unpleasant type. At first the patient can be brought into touch with reality and may identify the examiner and answer other questions correctly; but almost at once he relapses into a preoccupied, confused state, giving incorrect answers and being unable to think coherently.

She made an uneventful recovery, but was extremely concerned about the nature of her illness and went to see her local doctor. A diagnosis of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) was made. A TIA is a neurological deficit resolving within 24 hours. It is a type of stroke. Neurological deficits may be permanent or transient. Most transient events resolve within 21 days; any failure of resolution beyond 21 days is an established stroke. An investigation into the cause of the TIA was undertaken. Eighty-five percent of all strokes result from cerebral infarction, of which most are due to embolization. A duplex Doppler scan of the carotid vessels was performed."

The history also helps to bring a focus to the neurologic examination that follows. Each complaint should be pursued as far as possible to elucidate the location of the lesion, the likely underlying pathophysiology, and potential etiologies. For example, a patient complains of weakness of the right arm. What are the associated features? Does the patient have difficulty with brushing hair or reaching upward (proximal) or buttoning buttons or opening a twist-top bottle (distal)? Negative associations may also be crucial.

The patient found initiation of abduction difficult and there was a weakness of lateral rotation of the humerus. The wasted muscles were the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The cause of the muscle wasting was disuse. Muscle atrophy (wasting) occurs through a variety of disorders. Disuse atrophy is one of the most common causes. Examples of disuse atrophy include the loss of muscle bulk after fracture immobilization in a plaster cast. The opposite effect can also be demonstrated\u2014when muscles are overused they become bulkier (hypertrophy)."

A simple amalgam will suffice\u2014that of a middle-aged man of uneasy, brooding, asocial, eccentric nature who gradually develops a dominating idea or belief of his own importance, of having in his possession special powers that make him the envy of others who become bent on persecuting him. As the delusion grows, he becomes more preoccupied, less efficient, and increasingly suspicious of others, with a tendency to interpret every one of their words, gestures, or actions as having some reference to himself. On examining such a person, one is impressed with his capacity for careful reasoning, even betraying good intelligence. Whatever the delusional theme\u2014erotomanic (a delusion that another person, usually of higher status, is in love with the patient), grandiose, jealous, persecutory, or somatic, the last being the most common\u2014the patient\u2019s arguments are logical and buttressed cogently by"

The patient\u2019s hand was placed over her right buttock, a position that acts to externally rotate and extend the shoulder, exposing the supraspinatus tendon for ultrasound scan examination. The ultrasound revealed a completely torn tendon with fluid in the subacromial subdeltoid bursa (eFig. 7.128). The patient underwent a surgical repair and made a good recovery. A 35-year-old baseball pitcher came to the clinic with a history of a recurrent dislocation of the shoulder (eFig. 7.129). An MRI scan was performed to assess the shoulder joint prior to any treatment. The MRI demonstrates the anatomical structures in multiple planes, allowing the physician to obtain an overview of the shoulder and to assess any intraarticular or extraarticular structures that may have been damaged and require surgical repair."

The signs of either the adrenal insufficiency or the cerebral lesion may be the first to appear. In the case described by Siemerling and Creutzfeldt, the first recorded example of this disorder, bronzing of the skin of the hands appeared at 4 years of age; quadriparesis, with dysarthria and dysphagia (i.e., pseudobulbar palsy), became evident at 7 years; a single seizure occurred at 8 years; and by 9 years, shortly before death, the patient was decerebrate and unresponsive. In personally observed cases, the first abnormalities appeared at 9 to 10 years and took the form of episodic vomiting, decline in scholastic performance and change in personality with inappropriate giggling and crying. After a time, severe vomiting and an episode of circulatory collapse"
