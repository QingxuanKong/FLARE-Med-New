    "question": "A 47-year-old female presents to her primary physician for follow up after an ED visit for nephrolithiasis 1 week prior. CT scan in the ED revealed a 4-mm stone occluding the right ureter. She was able to pass the stone without assistance over the course of 5 hours. Pathology report on the stone states it was composed of calcium oxalate. She says that the pain of passing the stone was excruciating and asks how she can prevent kidney stones in the future. Which of the following interventions is most likely to prevent renal calculi formation in the future for this patient?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the type of stone the patient had and the risk factors associated with it. The patient had a 4-mm calcium oxalate stone that occluded the right ureter and was able to pass on its own. Calcium oxalate stones are the most common type of kidney stone and are often associated with higher urine calcium, higher urine oxalate, and lower urine citrate. The patient's symptoms and the pathology report confirm that she had a calcium oxalate stone. Now we need to evaluate the options to determine which one is most likely to prevent renal calculi formation in the future for this patient. Option A, decreasing calcium intake, may not be effective as calcium is a necessary nutrient for the body. Option B, decreasing sodium intake, may be beneficial as high sodium intake can increase the risk of stone formation. Option C, increasing consumption of nuts and seeds, is not directly related to reducing the risk of calcium oxalate stones. Option D, urine acidification with cranberry juice, is not effective in preventing kidney stones as cranberry juice does not acidify the urine. The most effective option to prevent renal calculi formation in the future for this patient is decreasing sodium intake.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

However, there are standard approaches to patients with acute and chronic presentations that can reasonably guide the clinical evaluation. It typically requires weeks to months (and often much longer) for a kidney stone to grow to a clinically detectable size. Although the passage of a stone is a dramatic event, stone formation and growth are characteristically clinically silent. A stone can remain asymptomatic in the kidney for years or even decades before signs (e.g., hematuria) or symptoms (e.g., pain) become apparent. Thus, it is important to remember that the onset of symptoms, typically attributable to a stone moving into the ureter, does not provide insight into when the stone actually formed. The factors that induce stone movement are unknown."

If the stone lodges in the upper part of the ureter, pain may radiate anteriorly; if the stone is in the lower part of the ureter, pain can radiate to the ipsilateral testicle in men or the ipsilateral labium in women.

            "content": "A thiazide diuretic, in doses higher than those used to treat hypertension, can substantially lower urine calcium excretion. Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that thiazide diuretics can reduce calcium oxalate stone recurrence by ~50%. When a thiazide is prescribed, dietary sodium restriction is essential to obtain the desired reduction in urinary calcium excretion. While bisphosphonates may reduce urine calcium excretion in some individuals, there are no data on whether this class of medication can reduce stone formation; therefore, bisphosphonates cannot be recommended solely for stone prevention at present. A reduction in urine oxalate will in turn reduce the supersaturation of calcium oxalate. In patients with the common form of nephrolithiasis, avoiding high-dose vitamin C supplements is the only known strategy that reduces endogenous oxalate production."

            "content": "This can result in an increase in unabsorbed fatty acids and bile salts which undergo saponification by binding with calcium in the bowel. The increase in unbound oxalate is absorbed by the large intestine and subsequently excreted in the urine, favoring the formation of calcium oxalate stones. Uric acid stones will form in a context of acidic urinary pH, low uri-nary volume, and high oral intake of purines. Countering these factors by alkalinizing the urine and increasing urine output Figure 40-1. Struvite (infectious) stones are evident on a plain radiograph of the abdomen. The red arrows highlight a left Stag-horn calculus filling the renal pelvis and calyces and several stones in the right lower pole of the kidney.may lead to dissolution of uric acid stones and reduced fur-ther formation.9 Proteus species, Klebsiella species, and other urease-producing bacteria metabolize urea into ammonium and bicarbonate. The alkaline milieu (pH >7) predisposes to infec-tious (struvite) stones"

            "content": "A 25-year-old man developed severe pain in the left lower quadrant of his abdomen. The pain was diffuse and relatively constant but did ease for short periods of time. On direct questioning the patient indicated that the pain was in the inguinal region and radiated posteriorly into his left infrascapular region (loin). A urine dipstick was positive for blood (hematuria). A diagnosis of a ureteric stone (calculus) was made. The patient\u2019s initial infrascapular pain, which later radiated to the left groin, relates to passage of the ureteric stone along the ureter. The origin of the pain relates to ureteral distention. A series of peristaltic waves along the ureter transport urine along the length of the ureter from the kidney to the bladder. As the ureteric stone obstructs the kidney, the ureter becomes distended, resulting in an exacerbation of the pain. The peristaltic waves are superimposed upon the distention, resulting in periods of exacerbation and periods of relief."

            "content": "For all stone types, consistently diluted urine reduces the likelihood of crystal formation. The urine volume should be at least 2 L/d. Because of differences in insensible fluid losses and fluid intake from food sources, the required total fluid intake will vary from person to person. Rather than specify how much to drink, it is more helpful to educate patients about how much more they need to drink in light of their 24-h urine volume. For example, if the daily urine volume is 1.5 L, then the patient should be advised to drink at least 0.5 L more per day in order to increase the urine volume to the goal of 2 L/day. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SPECIFIC STONE TYPES Calcium Oxalate Risk factors for calcium oxalate stones include higher urine calcium, higher urine oxalate, and lower urine citrate. This stone type is insensitive to pH in the physiologic range."
