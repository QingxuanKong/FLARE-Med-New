    "question": "A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because he was vomiting and seemed abnormally sleepy at home. On presentation, he is found to be confused and very lethargic. His parents said that he has had a fever and cough for several days prior to presentation and was given an over the counter medication. Physical exam of this patient reveals mild hepatomegaly and dry mucous membranes. Which of the following effects would the drug most likely also have on the nephron?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Constriction of afferent arteriole and no effect on efferent arteriole",
        "B": "Dilation of afferent arteriole and no effect on efferent arteriole",
        "C": "No effect on afferent arteriole and constriction of efferent arteriole",
        "D": "No effect on afferent arteriole and dilation of efferent arteriole"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "To answer this question, we need to identify the likely cause of the patient's symptoms and then determine the effect of the likely medication on the nephron. Step 1: Identify the likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The patient is a 13-year-old boy who presents with vomiting, lethargy, fever, cough, and mild hepatomegaly. The physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, which suggests dehydration. These symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of acetaminophen (paracetamol) overdose, which is a common over-the-counter medication that can cause liver damage and lead to hepatomegaly and liver failure if taken in excess. Step 2: Determine the effect of the likely medication on the nephron. Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys. However, it also has a minor effect on the nephron, specifically on the afferent arteriole. Acetaminophen can cause constriction of the afferent arteriole, which reduces blood flow to the glomerulus and increases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This effect is likely to be the correct answer. The correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is likely suffering from acetaminophen overdose, which can cause liver damage and lead to hepatomegaly and liver failure. Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys, but it also causes constriction of the afferent arteriole, reducing blood flow to the glomerulus and increasing the GFR. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Dilation of afferent arteriole and no effect on efferent arteriole is incorrect, as acetaminophen causes constriction of the afferent arteriole. The other options are also incorrect, as acetaminophen does not have a significant effect on the efferent arteriole or no effect on the afferent arteriole.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home. She was rushed to the emergency department, at which time she was alert but complained of headache. A consulting neurologist placed her on levetiracetam, 500 mg bid.
