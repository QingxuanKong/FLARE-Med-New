    "question": "After a T cell progenitor leaves the bone marrow, most of its development takes place in the thymus. It passes through several stages during its maturation. Positive selection is an important process during maturation of T lymphocytes, and it ensures the preservation of self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted T cells. During which of the following developmental stages does a T cell undergo this process?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, let's go through the stages of T cell development in the thymus and identify where positive selection occurs. According to the documents, T cell development begins with the migration of T cell progenitors from the bone marrow to the thymus. In the thymus, T cells undergo several stages of development, including the expression of pre-T cell receptors, the commitment to either the \\u03b2:\\u03b2 or \\u03b1:\\u03b2 lineage, and the expression of CD4 and CD8 co-receptors. Positive selection occurs after the expression of these co-receptors, but before the cells differentiate into single-positive CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. Positive selection is a critical process that ensures the preservation of self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted T cells. Based on this information, let's evaluate the options: A. Pre-T cell: This stage occurs before the expression of CD4 and CD8 co-receptors, so positive selection does not occur during this stage. B. Double-positive T cell: This stage occurs after the expression of CD4 and CD8 co-receptors, and positive selection does occur during this stage. C. Single-positive CD4+ T cell: This stage occurs after positive selection, so positive selection does not occur during this stage. D. Single-positive CD8+ T cell: This stage also occurs after positive selection, so positive selection does not occur during this stage. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

            "content": "how the specificity and affinity of the receptor for self ligands are tested to determine whether the immature lymphocyte will either survive and join the mature repertoire, or die. In general, it seems that developing lymphocytes whose receptors interact weakly with self antigens, or that bind self antigens in a particular way, receive a signal that enables them to survive. This process, known as positive selection, is particularly critical in the development of \u03b1:\u03b2 T cells, which recognize composite antigens consisting of peptides bound to MHC molecules, because it ensures that an individual\u2019s T cells will be able to respond to peptides bound to one\u2019s own MHC molecules."

            "content": "The principal mechanism of central tolerance is the antigen-induced deletion (death) of self-reactive T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes during their maturation in central (generative) lymphoid organs (i.e., in the thymus for T cells and in the bone marrow for B cells). In the thymus, many autologous (self) protein antigens are processed and presented by thymic APCs. Any immature T cell that encounters such a self antigen undergoes apoptosis (a process called deletion, or negative selection), and the T cells that complete their maturation are thereby depleted of self-reactive cells. An exciting advance has been the identification of a protein called AIRE (autoimmune regulator), which stimulates expression of some peripheral tissue-restricted self antigens in the thymus and is thus critical for deletion of immature T cells specific for these antigens. Mutations in the AIRE gene are the cause of an autoimmune polyendocrinopathy (Chapter 20). Not all immature T cells that see self antigens"

Random TCR\u03b1 and \u03b2 chain gene rearrangements generate a large pool of immature thymocytes expressing a varied repertoire of specificities. The T-cell receptors on many of these cells fail to have sufficient binding strength to the self peptide:self MHC complexes on thymic epithelium and so receive no signals. These cells die by neglect. Another fraction of immature thymocytes are positively selected because their T-cell receptors bind with sufficient strength to the self peptide:self MHC complexes on thymic epithelium to generate T-cell receptor-dependent survival signals. From this cohort of positively selected thymocytes, negative selection removes those thymocytes whose receptors have excessively strong reactivity to self peptides complexed with self MHC molecules (resulting in clonal deletion), thereby establishing self-tolerance of the mature T-cell population. A small subset of positively selected cells"

            "content": "T lymphocytes have a central role in the generation of immune responses by acting as helper cells in both humoral and cellular immune responses and by acting as effector cells in cellular responses. T-cell precursors originate in bone marrow and move to the thymus, where they mature into functional T cells. During their thymic maturation, T cells that can recognize antigen in the context of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are selected, while self-responding T cells are removed (75)."

            "content": "Early experiments using bone marrow chimeras (see Appendix I, Section A-32) and thymic grafting provided evidence that MHC molecules in the thymus influence the MHC-restricted T-cell repertoire. However, mice transgenic for rearranged T-cell receptor genes provided the first conclusive evidence that the interaction of the T cell with self peptide:self MHC complexes is necessary for the survival of immature T cells and their maturation into naive CD4 or CD8 T cells. For these experiments, the rearranged \u03b1and \u03b2-chain genes were cloned from a T-cell clone (see Appendix I, Section A-20) whose origin, antigen specificity, and MHC restriction were known. When such genes are introduced into the mouse genome, they are expressed early during thymocyte development. As a consequence of expressing functional transgene-encoded TCR\u03b1-and \u03b2-chain proteins in developing T cells, the rearrangement of endogenous T-cell receptor genes is inhibited, albeit to different degrees. In general, endogenous"
