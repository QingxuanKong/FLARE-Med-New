On arrival, she is in acute distress but is fully oriented. Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun and the patient is transferred to the intensive care unit of a burn center. 20 hours later, she has several large, tarry black stools and develops hypotension and tachycardia. Despite appropriate lifesaving measures, she dies. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's tarry black stools?",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and the potential causes of tarry black stools in a burn patient. The patient has sustained burns over 45% of her body, which can lead to significant fluid loss and hypovolemic shock. The development of tarry black stools, also known as melena, can be caused by several factors in a burn patient. The key is to consider the patient's clinical presentation and the pathophysiology of burn injuries. The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest that she is experiencing hypovolemic shock, which can lead to decreased blood flow to various organs, including the gastrointestinal tract. In a burn patient, the most likely cause of tarry black stools is erosion of tortuous submucosal arterioles, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding. This is a common complication in burn patients due to the release of vasoactive substances from the damaged tissues, which can cause vasodilation and bleeding from the gastric mucosa. The other options are less likely causes of tarry black stools in this patient. Decreased prostaglandin synthesis (A) is not a direct cause of tarry black stools. Bacterial colonization of the gastric antrum (C) is a possible cause of melena, but it is less likely in a burn patient without a clear source of infection. Decreased gastric blood flow (D) may contribute to the development of melena, but it is not the most likely cause in this patient's clinical context.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The burn (and/or inhalation injury) drives an inflammatory response that leads to capillary leak; as plasma leaks into the extravascular space, crystalloid administration maintains the intravascular volume. Therefore, if a patient receives a large fluid bolus in a prehospital setting or emergency department, the fluid has likely leaked into the interstitium, and the patient still requires ongoing burn resusci-tation according to the estimates. Continuation of fluid volumes should depend on the time since injury, urine output, and mean arterial pressure (MAP). As the capillary leak closes, the patient will require"

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Treatment of pulmonary edema may include the use of intravenous furosemide, supplemental oxygen, morphine sulfate, and elevation of the head of the bed. Intravenous aminophylline may be useful if cardiogenic asthma is present. Electrocardiography, in addition to laboratory evaluation, including arterial blood gas, serum electrolyte, and renal function chemistry measurements, should be obtained expediently. If the patient\u2019s condition does not improve rapidly, she should be transferred to an intensive care unit. Arrhythmias Nearly all arrhythmias found in otherwise healthy patients are asymptomatic and of limited consequence. In patients with underlying cardiac disease, however, even brief episodes of arrhythmias may result in significant cardiac morbidity and mortality."
