    "question": "A 63-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic instability. Several days prior, he had been swimming in the Gulf coast when he stepped on a sharp rock and cut his right foot. Three days ago, the patient presented to the emergency room after noticing painful redness spreading along his skin up from his right foot and was subsequently admitted for antibiotic treatment. Currently, his temperature is 101.8\u00b0F (38.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 84/46 mmHg with a mean arterial pressure of 59 mmHg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 14/min. His telemetry shows sinus tachycardia. His blood cultures are pending, but Gram stain demonstrated gram-negative bacilli. Which of the following best describes the form of shock and the skin exam?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. The patient has hemodynamic instability, fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and gram-negative bacilli on Gram stain. These findings suggest septic shock. In septic shock, the skin is typically warm and flushed due to peripheral vasodilation. Therefore, the correct answer should be a type of shock that is associated with warm skin. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest hypovolemic shock (B), which is characterized by cool skin and peripheral vasoconstriction. Neurogenic shock (C) is also unlikely, as there is no mention of a spinal cord injury or other neurological condition. Obstructive shock (D) is not applicable, as there is no evidence of airway obstruction. Distributive shock (A) is the most likely diagnosis, characterized by warm skin and peripheral vasodilation, which is consistent with septic shock. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Distributive shock with warm skin.\" \"answer_choice\": \"A\"",

He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

            "content": "The clinical manifestations of shock depend on the precipitating insult. In hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock, patients exhibit hypotension, a weak rapid pulse, tachypnea, and cool, clammy, cyanotic skin. As already noted, in septic shock, the skin may be warm and flushed owing to peripheral vasodilation. The primary threat to life is the underlying initiating event (e.g., myocardial infarction, severe hemorrhage, bacterial infection). However, the cardiac, cerebral, and pulmonary changes rapidly aggravate the situation. If patients survive the initial period, worsening renal function can provoke a phase dominated by progressive oliguria, acidosis, and electrolyte imbalances. Prognosis varies with the origin of shock and its duration. Thus, more than 90% of young, otherwise healthy patients with hypovolemic shock survive with appropriate management; by comparison, septic or cardiogenic shock is associated with substantially worse outcomes, even with state-of-the-art care."

Clinical indicators include reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP), tachycardia, tachypnea, cool skin and extremities, acute altered mental status, and oliguria. Hypotension is usually, though not always, present. The end result of multiorgan hypoperfusion is tissue hypoxia, often with accompanying lactic acidosis. Since the MAP is the product of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance (SVR), reductions in blood pressure can be caused by decreases in cardiac output and/or SVR. Accordingly, once shock is contemplated, the initial evaluation of a hypotensive patient should include an early bedside assessment of the adequacy of cardiac output (Fig. 321-2). Clinical evidence of diminished cardiac output includes a narrow pulse pressure\u2014a marker that correlates with stroke volume\u2014 and cool extremities with delayed"

VIDEO 297e-17 The right coronary artery (RCA) is totally occluded with filling defects in the vessel after contrast injection, indicating thrombus is present in the vessel. VIDEO 297e-18 An angioplasty wire is threaded through the thrombotic lesion, but this does not restore blood flow to the distal vessel.

Excessive sweating suggests hypoglycemia or shock, and excessively dry skin, diabetic acidosis, or uremia. Large blisters, sometimes bloody, may form over pressure points such as the buttocks if the patient has been motionless for a time; this sign is particularly characteristic of the deeply unresponsive and prolonged motionless state of acute sedation, alcohol and opiate intoxication. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), disseminated intravascular coagulation, and diffuse fat embolism after bone injury may cause diffuse petechiae or purpura; the last of these are often aggregated in the anterior axillary folds."

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

They are initiated by autophosphorylation of select tyrosine residues in their receptors. C. They are mediated by binding to adrenergic receptors, which are a class of nuclear receptors. D. They result in the activation of glycogen and triacylglycerol synthesis. Q3. NE bound to certain receptors causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. Why might NE be used clinically in the treatment of septic shock?

Focused History: AZ\u2019s father reports that the boy has always been quite sensitive to the sun. His skin turns red (erythema) and his eyes hurt (photophobia) if he is exposed to the sun for any period of time."

            "content": "Hypotension and DIC predispose to acrocyanosis and ischemic necrosis of peripheral tissues, most commonly the digits. Cellulitis, pustules, bullae, or hemorrhagic lesions may develop when hematogenous bacteria or fungi seed the skin or underlying soft tissue. Bacterial toxins may also be distributed hematogenously and elicit diffuse cutaneous reactions. On occasion, skin lesions may suggest specific pathogens. When sepsis is accompanied by cutaneous petechiae or purpura, infection with N. meningitidis (or, less commonly, H. influenzae) should be suspected (see Fig. 25e-42); in a patient who has been bitten by a tick while in an endemic area, petechial lesions also suggest Rocky Mountain spotted fever (see Fig. 211-1). A cutaneous lesion seen almost exclusively in neutropenic patients is ecthyma gangrenosum, often caused by P. aeruginosa. This bullous lesion surrounded by edema undergoes central hemorrhage and necrosis (see Fig. 189-1)."

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"
