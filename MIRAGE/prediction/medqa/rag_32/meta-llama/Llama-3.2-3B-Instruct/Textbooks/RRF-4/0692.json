    "question": "A 47-year-old man presents to his family physician with a sudden onset of severe pain and redness in his eyes that started this morning. He is having difficulty seeing properly and is extremely worried about losing his vision. Further history reveals that he has had progressive lower back pain for over 2 months now. The pain is usually at its worst in the morning, but it remains throughout the day. It gets better with movement, however, so he tends to do some light exercises every day. He also has heel pain and feels significant pressure while walking. Laboratory analysis reveals increased ESR and CRP serum levels. Which of the following would most likely be seen in this patient?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with sudden onset of severe pain and redness in his eyes, difficulty seeing, and progressive lower back pain. The pain is worse in the morning but improves with movement. He also has heel pain and pressure while walking. Laboratory analysis shows increased ESR and CRP serum levels. These symptoms, combined with the patient's age and the presence of eye pain, suggest a diagnosis of gout. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, redness, and tenderness in one or more joints, most often the big toe. It is caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, which can form sharp, needle-like urate crystals in the joints. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a gout attack, and the elevated ESR and CRP levels support this diagnosis. The presence of eye pain, also known as uveitis, is a common complication of gout. The patient's heel pain and pressure while walking may be related to his gouty arthritis. The correct answer is D. Hemochromatosis, as hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder that can increase the risk of developing gout. Hemochromatosis can lead to increased iron absorption, which can contribute to elevated uric acid levels and gout. However, it is not a direct cause of gout, but rather a risk factor. The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Hx/PE: Presents with pain and stiffness of the shoulder and pelvic girdle musculature with difficulty getting out of a chair or lifting the arms above the head. Other symptoms include fever, malaise, and weight loss. Weakness is generally not appreciated on exam. Dx: Labs reveal a markedly \u2191ESR, often associated with anemia. Tx: Low-dose prednisone (10\u201320 mg/day). Table 2.9-5 outlines the presentation and treatment of common pediatric orthopedic injuries."

            "content": "The mean age at onset is 6 years, with a range of 3 to 8 years. It is twice as common in male children. The patient or family will describe an acute onset of pain in the groin/hip, anterior thigh, or knee. Irritation of the obturator nerve can cause referred pain in the thigh and knee when the pathology is at the hip. Patients with transient synovitis are often afebrile, walk with a painful limp, and have normal to minimally elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate compared with bacterial diseases of the hip (Table 199-1). Table 197-3 lists the differential diagnosis of a limping child. Anteroposterior and frog-leg radiographs of the hip are usually normal. Ultrasonography may reveal a joint effusion. It is mandatory to rule out septic arthritis in the presence of effusion with a joint aspiration and cell count."

Her vital signs include the following: temperature 99.8\u00b0F, blood pressure 132/64 mm Hg, pulse 78 bpm, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, she had left upper abdominal tenderness with evidence of hepatomegaly and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory data revealed the following: alanine aminotransferase, 527 IU/L (normal 10\u201335 IU/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 425 IU/L (normal < 35 IU/L); and bilirubin, 2.9 mg/dL (normal 0.1\u20130.3 mg/dL).

Interestingly, the height of the patient and the previous lens surgery would suggest a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and a series of blood tests and review of the family history revealed this was so. A 35-year-old male patient presented to his family practitioner because of recent weight loss (14 lb over the previous 2 months). He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

He saw his PCP for evaluation of low back pain. X-rays of the spine showed some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine plus several wedge deformities in the thoracic spine. The patient is a long-time smoker (up to two packs per day) and has two to four glasses of wine with dinner, more on the weekends. He has chronic bronchitis, presumably from smoking, and has been treated on numerous occasions with oral prednisone for exacerba-tions of bronchitis. He is currently on 10 mg/d prednisone. Examination shows kyphosis of the thoracic spine, with some tenderness to fist percussion over the thoracic spine. The dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measure-ment of the lumbar spine is \u201cwithin the normal limits,\u201d but the radiologist noted that the reading may be misleading because of degenerative changes.

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"
