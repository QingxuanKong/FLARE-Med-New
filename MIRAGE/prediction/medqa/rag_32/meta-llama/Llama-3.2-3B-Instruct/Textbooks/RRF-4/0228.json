He reports that he graduated from college last month and returned 3 days ago from a 2 week vacation to Vietnam and Cambodia. For the past 2 days, he has developed a worsening headache, malaise, and pain in his hands and wrists. The patient has a past medical history of asthma managed with albuterol as needed. He is sexually active with both men and women, and he uses condoms \u201cmost of the time.\u201d On physical exam, the patient\u2019s temperature is 102.5\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 112/66 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. He has tenderness to palpation over his bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints and a maculopapular rash on his trunk and upper thighs. Tourniquet test is negative. Laboratory results are as follows:\n\nHemoglobin: 14 g/dL\nHematocrit: 44%\nLeukocyte count: 3,200/mm^3\nPlatelet count: 112,000/mm^3\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 142 mEq/L\nCl-: 104 mEq/L\nK+: 4.6 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nBUN: 18 mg/dL\nGlucose: 87 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 0.9 mg/dL\nAST: 106 U/L\nALT: 112 U/L\nBilirubin (total): 0.8 mg/dL\nBilirubin (conjugated): 0.3 mg/dL\n\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thought process for the given question: **Step 1: Review the patient's symptoms and history** The patient presents with fatigue, worsening headache, malaise, pain in his hands and wrists, and a maculopapular rash on his trunk and upper thighs. He has a history of recent travel to Vietnam and Cambodia, and he is sexually active with both men and women. **Step 2: Analyze the patient's physical examination findings** The patient has tenderness to palpation over his bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints, which suggests arthritis. The maculopapular rash on his trunk and upper thighs could be indicative of a viral or bacterial infection. **Step 3: Review the laboratory results** The patient's laboratory results show a mild leukopenia (leukocyte count: 3,200/mm^3), thrombocytopenia (platelet count: 112,000/mm^3), and elevated liver enzymes (AST: 106 U/L, ALT: 112 U/L). **Step 4: Consider the patient's travel history and potential diagnoses** Given the patient's recent travel to Vietnam and Cambodia, we should consider diseases common in those regions. Chikungunya, dengue fever, and hepatitis A are all possible diagnoses. **Step 5: Analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results** Chikungunya is characterized by severe joint pain, fever, and rash, but it does not typically cause thrombocytopenia or elevated liver enzymes. Dengue fever can cause thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes, but it typically presents with more severe symptoms, such as hemorrhagic manifestations. **Step 6: Eliminate options** Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, we can eliminate Chikungunya (A) and Dengue fever (B). **Step 7: Consider the remaining options** Hepatitis A (D) is unlikely, as it typically presents with jaundice, which is not present in this case. **Step 8: Choose the most likely diagnosis** Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and travel history, the most likely diagnosis is Epstein-Barr virus (C). Epstein-Barr virus causes infectious mononucleosis, which is characterized by fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, and fatigue. It can also cause thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes. **Answer** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and travel history are consistent with Epstein-Barr virus infection, also known as infectious mononucleosis. This diagnosis is supported by the presence of fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. Epstein-Barr virus is a common cause of infectious mononucleosis, which is typically acquired through close contact with an infected person, such as during college or travel. The patient's recent travel to Vietnam and Cambodia increases the risk of exposure to Epstein-Barr virus. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with this diagnosis, making it the most likely cause of his illness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

She admits to having taken a \u201chandful\u201d of Lorcet (hydrocodone/acetaminophen, an opioid/nonopioid analgesic combination), Soma (carisoprodol, a centrally acting muscle relaxant), and Cymbalta (duloxetine HCl, an antidepressant/ antifibromyalgia agent) 2 days earlier. On physical examina-tion, the sclera of her eyes shows yellow discoloration. Labora-tory analyses of blood drawn within an hour of her admission reveal abnormal liver function as indicated by the increased indices: alkaline phosphatase 302 (41\u2013133),* alanine amino-transferase (ALT) 351 (7\u201356),* aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1045 (0\u201335),* bilirubin 3.33 mg/dL (0.1\u20131.2),* and pro-thrombin time of 19.8 seconds (11\u201315).* In addition, plasma bicarbonate is reduced, and she has ~45% reduced glomerular filtration rate from the normal value"

            "content": "Laboratory testing is likely to identify the cause of chronic fatigue in only about 5% of cases. Beyond a few standard screening tests, laboratory evaluation should be guided by the history and physical examination; extensive testing is more likely to lead to false-positive results that require explanation and unnecessary investigation and should be avoided in lieu of frequent clinical follow-up. A reasonable approach to screening includes a complete blood count with differential (to screen for anemia, infection, and malignancy), electrolytes (including sodium, potassium, and calcium), glucose, renal function, liver function, and thyroid function. Testing for HIV and adrenal function can also be considered. Published guidelines defining chronic fatigue syndrome also recommend an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) as part of the evaluation for mimics, but unless the value is very high, such nonspecific testing in the absence of other features is unlikely to clarify the situation."
