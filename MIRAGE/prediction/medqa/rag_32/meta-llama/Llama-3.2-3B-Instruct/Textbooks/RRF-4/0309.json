On physical examination, the patient is unconscious with a GCS of 9/15 and is cyanotic. There are open fractures of the left femur and left tibia, a likely shoulder dislocation, multiple contusions on the limbs and thorax, and a puncture wound on the left side of his chest. There are no breath sounds on the left side and there is hyperresonance to percussion on the left.

The diagnosis is made by physical examination showing an enlarged hemithorax with no breath sounds, hyperresonance to percussion, and shift of the mediastinum to the contralateral side. Tension pneumothorax must be treated as a medical emergency. If the tension in the pleural space is not relieved, the patient is likely to die from inadequate cardiac output or marked hypoxemia. A large-bore needle should be inserted into the pleural space through the second anterior intercostal space. If large amounts of gas escape from the needle after insertion, the diagnosis is confirmed. The needle should be left in place until a thoracostomy tube can be inserted."

The patient should be placed immediately in Trendelenburg\u2019s posi-tion to trap the air in the apex of the left ventricle.

Pulsus paradoxus (i.e., an inspiratory reduction in systolic pressure >10 mmHg) may also be noted. The diagnosis is confirmed by echocardiography, and treatment consists of immediate pericardiocentesis or the creation of an open subxiphoid pericardial window.

            "content": "A 65-year-old man undergoes cystoscopy because of the presence of microscopic hematuria in order to rule out urologic malignancy. The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."

Tension pneumothorax: A pulmonary or chest wall defect acts as a one-way valve, drawing air into the pleural space during inspiration but trapping air during expiration. Etiologies include penetrating trauma, infection, and positive-pressure mechanical ventilation. Shock and death result unless the condition is immediately recognized and treated. Presents with acute onset of unilateral pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea. Exam reveals tachypnea, diminished or absent breath sounds, hyperreso F IGU R E 2.1 5-7. Tension pneumothorax. Note the hyperlucent lung feld, hyperexpanded lower diaphragm, collapsed lung, tracheal de viation, mediastinal shift, and compression of the opposite lung on AP CXR."

            "content": "Thoracic injury is the second leading cause of trauma death. Pulmonary contusion, pneumothorax, and rib fractures occur most commonly, and patients may present without external signs of trauma. Patients with pulmonary parenchymal injury should receive supportive treatment to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Most pediatric blunt thoracic injuries can be managed without surgery. Injury to the heart and great vessels is rare but requires urgent diagnosis and treatment. Great vessel injury should be suspected if a widened mediastinum is seen on chest radiograph. Injury to the abdomen occurs in approximately 8% of pediatric trauma patients and is the third leading cause of trauma death. The relative size and closer proximity of intra-abdominal organs in children increase the risk of significant injury after blunt trauma. Penetrating trauma may result in a child who is asymptomatic or who presents in hypovolemic shock."

            "content": "As a result of this procedure, the pressure in this patient\u2019s portal system is lower and similar to that of the systemic venous system, so reducing the potential for bleeding at the portosystemic anastomoses (i.e., the colostomy). A 62-year-old man came to the emergency department with swelling of both legs and a large left varicocele (enlarged and engorged varicose veins around the left testis and within the left pampiniform plexus of veins). The patient was known to have a left renal cell carcinoma and was due to have this operated on the following week. Anatomically it is possible to link all of the findings with the renal cell carcinoma by knowing the biology of the tumor. Renal cell carcinoma tends to grow steadily and predictably. Typically, when the tumor is less than 3 to 4 cm, it remains confined to the kidney. Large tumors have the propensity to grow into the renal vein, the inferior vena cava and the right atrium and through the heart into the pulmonary artery."

            "content": "On examination the patient had a low-grade temperature and was tachypneic (breathing fast). There was reduced expansion of the left side of the chest. When the chest was percussed it was noted that the anterior aspect of the left chest was dull, compared to the resonant percussion note of the remainder of the chest. Auscultation (listening with a stethoscope) revealed decreased breath sounds, which were hoarse in nature (bronchial breathing). A diagnosis of chest infection was made. Chest infection is a common disease. In most patients the infection affects the large airways and bronchi. If the infection continues, exudates and transudates are produced, filling the alveoli and the secondary pulmonary lobules. The diffuse patchy nature of this type of infection is termed bronchial pneumonia. Given the patient\u2019s specific clinical findings, bronchial pneumonia was unlikely."

            "content": "If the patient remains tachycardic or hypotensive after the first 2 L of isotonic \ufb02uid, transfusion with packed RBCs may be indicated. To remember the Glasgow Coma Scale, think 4-eyes, Jackson-5, V6 engine. Four points can be assigned for eye response, five points for verbal response, and six points for motor response. Patients with chest trauma and shock may have cardiac tamponade. The relevant signs are JVD, hypotension, and muf\ufb02ed heart sounds. This can be diagnosed with bedside ultrasound. If tamponade is diagnosed, an immediate pericardiocentesis is necessary. Disability/Exposure: Disability (CNS dysfunction) is assessed and quantified with the GCS. Exposure requires that the patient be completely disrobed and assessed for injury and temperature status on both the front and back of the body. Hypothermia is a common problem in trauma and can worsen bleeding; once the exam is done, the patient should be covered with warm blankets."
