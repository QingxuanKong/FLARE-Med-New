Respiratory viral panel returns positive for influenza A and the patient is started on a standard five day course of oseltamivir. Despite therapy, his shortness of breath continues to worsen and his oxygen saturation decreases to the point where ICU transfer and intubation are required. Chest radiograph shows bilateral infiltrates. Clinical criteria are consistent with development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the process of regeneration of alveolar lining after damage to alveoli occurs in the context of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, which can be caused by various insults such as pneumonia, sepsis, or trauma. The regeneration of alveolar lining is a critical process for recovery from ARDS. Let's evaluate each option given: A. Sweeping of debris out of the alveoli by ciliated cells: While ciliated cells do play a role in clearing debris from the airways, they are not directly involved in the regeneration of alveolar lining. B. Excess mucus production by goblet cells: Goblet cells produce mucus, which can be a barrier to gas exchange in ARDS, but they are not directly involved in the regeneration of alveolar lining. C. Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells: Type II pneumocytes are the primary cells responsible for producing surfactant, a critical substance that reduces surface tension in the alveoli, allowing for easier lung expansion and gas exchange. After damage to alveoli, there is an increase in the number of type II pneumocytes, which proliferate to replace damaged cells and restore surfactant production. D. Proliferation of club cells: Club cells are not a well-defined cell type in the lung, and their proliferation is not directly involved in the regeneration of alveolar lining. Considering the above information, the correct answer is C. Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells, which involves the increase in type II pneumocytes to restore surfactant production and facilitate lung recovery after alveolar damage in ARDS.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",

Choi Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical syndrome of severe dyspnea of rapid onset, hypoxemia, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates leading to respiratory failure. ARDS is caused by diffuse lung injury from many underlying medical and surgical disorders. The lung injury may be direct, as occurs in toxic inhalation, or indirect, as occurs in sepsis (Table 322-1). The clinical features of ARDS are listed in Table 322-2. By expert consensus, ARDS is defined by three categories based on the degrees of hypoxemia (Table 322-2). These stages of mild, moderate, and severe ARDS are associated with mortality risk and with the duration of mechanical ventilation in survivors. The annual incidence of ARDS is estimated to be as high as 60 cases/100,000 population. Approximately 10% of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions involve patients with acute respiratory failure; ~20% of these patients meet the criteria for ARDS."

Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

A lung biopsy may be necessary to make the diagnosis. Asymptomatic infiltrates found incidentally after radiation therapy need not be treated. However, prednisone should be administered to patients with fever or other symptoms. The dosage should be tapered slowly after the resolution of radiation pneumonitis, because abrupt withdrawal of glucocorticoids may cause an exacerbation of pneumonia. Delayed radiation fibrosis may occur years after radiation therapy and is signaled by dyspnea on exertion. Often it is mild, but it can progress to chronic respiratory failure. Therapy is supportive."

            "content": "Clinically, ARDS passes through several stages. Initially, patients develop tachypnea and dyspnea with no remarkable findings on clinical evaluation or on chest x-ray. Chest x-rays eventually reveal bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. As lung compliance becomes impaired, functional residual capacity, tidal volume, and vital capacity decrease. The PaO2 decreases and, characteristically, increases only marginally with oxygen supplementation. An attempt should be made to maintain the arterial oxygen level above 90%. This may be achievable initially by administering oxygen by mask. For patients with severe hypoxemia, endotracheal intubation with positive-pressure ventilation should be instituted. Traditionally, the goal was to maintain normal arterial gases, with increased minute ventilation and pressure as needed to maintain these, with little insight into the long-term repercussions that this modality employs. Data over the past 5 to 10 years show that \u201cnormal\u201d or increased tidal"

            "content": "Vasoocclusive painful events may occur in any organ of the body and are manifested by pain and/or significant dysfunction (see Table 150-8). The acute chest syndrome is a vasoocclusive crisis within the lungs with evidence of a new infiltrate on chest radiograph. It is often associated with infection and infarction. The patient may first complain of chest pain but within a few hours develops cough, increasing respiratory and heart rates, hypoxia, and progressive respiratory distress. Physical examination reveals areas of decreased breath sounds and dullness on chest percussion. Treatment involves early recognition and prevention of arterial hypoxemia. Oxygen, fluids, judicious use of analgesic medications, antibiotics, bronchodilators, and RBC transfusion (rarely exchange transfusion) are indicated in therapy for acute chest syndrome. Incentive spirometry may help reduce the incidence of acute chest crisis in patients presenting with pain in the chest or abdomen."

Extrapulmonary manifestations of PCP are rare but can include involvement of almost any organ, most notably lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. Physical Examination The physical examination findings in PCP are nonspecific. Patients have decreased oxygen saturation\u2014at rest or with exertion\u2014that, without treatment, progresses to severe hypoxemia. Patients may initially have a normal chest examination and no adventitious sounds but later, without treatment, develop diffuse rales and signs of consolidation. Oral thrush in a patient with HIV infection indicates an increased risk for PCP."
