The patient reports that he first noticed the swelling several weeks ago, but it is not always present. He has hypertension treated with enalapril. His father was diagnosed with a seminoma at the age of 25 years. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 10-cm, soft, cystic, nontender right scrotal mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a painless, right-sided scrotal swelling that is soft, cystic, and transilluminating, which suggests a hydrocele. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass, which indicates that it is not a hernia. The absence of bowel sounds in the mass also supports this diagnosis. The patient's father was diagnosed with testicular cancer, which increases the risk of testicular cancer in the patient. However, the mass is not palpable in the testis, and the examination of the testis shows no abnormalities, which makes testicular cancer less likely. The most likely cause of the mass is a patent processus vaginalis, which is a common cause of hydroceles, especially in men with a family history of testicular cancer. The patent processus vaginalis is a remnant of the processus vaginalis that fails to close after the testes have descended into the scrotum, allowing fluid to accumulate and form a hydrocele. The dilation of the pampiniform plexus (option B) is more commonly associated with varicoceles, and twisting of the spermatic cord (option C) would likely cause pain and a more firm mass. An imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis (option D) could contribute to a hydrocele, but it is not the most likely cause in this case.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

An ultrasound scan revealed normal right and left testes and a large fluid collection around the right testis. A diagnosis of a right-sided hydrocele was made. Scrotal masses are common in young males, and determining the exact anatomical site of the scrotal mass is of utmost clinical importance. Any mass that arises from the testis should be investigated to exclude testicular cancer. Masses that arise from the epididymis and scrotal lesions, such as fluid (hydrocele) or hernias, are also clinically important but are not malignant. The ultrasound scan revealed fluid surrounding the testis, which is diagnostic of a hydrocele. Simple cysts arising from and around the epididymis (epididymal cysts) can be easily defined.

As part of her differential diagnosis, the resident considered the possibility that the man had testicular cancer with regional abdominal para-aortic nodal involvement (the lateral aortic, or lumbar, nodes). A primary testicular neoplasm is the most common tumor in men between the ages of 25 and 34 and accounts for between 1% and 2% of all malignancies in men.

If an abnormal mass is present, an inability to feel its upper edge suggests that it may originate from the inguinal canal and might be a hernia. By placing the hand over the lump and asking the patient to cough, the lump bulges outward. An attempt should be made to reduce the swelling by applying gentle, firm pressure over the lump. If the lump is reducible, the hand should be withdrawn and careful observation will reveal recurrence of the mass. The position of an abnormal mass in the groin relative to the pubic tubercle is very important, as are the presence of increased temperature and pain, which may represent early signs of strangulation or infection. As a general rule: An inguinal hernia appears through the superficial inguinal ring above the pubic tubercle and crest. A femoral hernia (see below) appears through the femoral canal below and lateral to the pubic tubercle."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a"

He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian"

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

The patient\u2019s age, social history, including alcohol and smoking history, preced-ing illness history, and synchronous upper aerodigestive tract physical examination findings can significantly impact the dif-ferential diagnosis and the investigation to work up a neck mass. A thorough history and head and neck examination, including fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy, are therefore paramount to com-plete evaluation. With regard to age, in children, a neck mass is far more likely to be congenital, inflammatory, or infectious, whereas in adults, neck masses >2 cm have a >80% probability of being malignant. Typically, the first investigation is an FNA biopsy, which can be performed with ultrasound or CT guid-ance when the mass is not easily palpable or largely cystic with a small solid component. Imaging is critical in"
