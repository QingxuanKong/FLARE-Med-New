    "question": "A 40-year-old man comes to the emergency department with a 4-day history of left leg pain. Over the weekend, he scraped his left thigh when he fell on a muddy field while playing flag football with some friends. Since that time, he has had progressively worsening redness and pain in his left thigh. Past medical history is unremarkable. His temperature is 39.4\u00b0C (103.0\u00b0F), heart rate is 120/min, and blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg. Physical exam is significant for a poorly-demarcated area of redness on his left thigh, extending to about a 10 cm radius from a small scrape. This area is extremely tender to palpation, and palpation elicits an unusual 'crunchy' sensation. CT scan shows free air in the soft tissue of the left leg. The organism that is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation is also a common cause of which of the following conditions?",

        "A": "Bacterial pneumonia",

        "C": "Food-borne illness",
        "D": "Urinary tract infection"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's analyze the given information step by step: 1. The patient has a 4-day history of left leg pain, worsening redness, and pain in the left thigh after a fall. 2. The patient has a fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. 3. The physical exam reveals a poorly-demarcated area of redness on the left thigh, extending to about a 10 cm radius from a small scrape, which is extremely tender to palpation and elicits a 'crunchy' sensation. 4. The CT scan shows free air in the soft tissue of the left leg. Given these symptoms and findings, the most likely diagnosis is an abscess or an infected wound, which is a common complication of a traumatic injury. Now, let's analyze the potential choices: A. Bacterial pneumonia - This is not directly related to the patient's presentation, which involves a localized infection in the thigh, not a respiratory infection. B. Bacterial sinusitis - This is also not directly related to the patient's presentation, which involves a localized infection in the thigh, not a sinus infection. C. Food-borne illness - There is no mention of food consumption or gastrointestinal symptoms, so this is unlikely. D. Urinary tract infection - While urinary tract infections can cause fever and pain, the patient's symptoms and findings are more suggestive of a localized infection in the thigh, not a urinary tract infection. However, the organism that is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation is Staphylococcus aureus, which is a common cause of skin and soft tissue infections, including abscesses. Staphylococcus aureus is also a common cause of food-borne illness, specifically in the context of food poisoning, such as from contaminated meat or dairy products. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's presentation is suggestive of a skin and soft tissue infection, and Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of such infections. Staphylococcus aureus is also a common cause of food-borne illness, specifically food poisoning. So, the correct answer is C. Food-borne illness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

On further questioning, he reported that the pain also radiated over the lateral part of the foot, particularly around the lateral malleolus. The areas of pain correspond to dermatomes L4 to S3 nerves. Over the following weeks, the patient began to develop muscular weakness, predominantly footdrop. These findings are consistent with loss of the motor function and sensory change in the common fibular nerve, which is a branch of the sciatic nerve in the lower limb. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a mass in the posterior aspect of the right side of the pelvis. The mass was anterior to the piriformis muscle and adjacent to the rectum."

The chest pain was due to pulmonary emboli. Small emboli were thrown off from the leading edge of the thrombus through the heart to lodge in the lungs. Small emboli cause typical pleuritic chest pain, which is exacerbated by breathing. In isolation these small pulmonary emboli may affect respiratory function, but they may be the precursor to a large and potentially fatal pulmonary embolus (eFig. 6.143). Anticoagulation was instituted and the patient had an uneventful delivery. A 45-year-old man had recently taken up squash. During a game he attempted a forehand shot and noticed severe sudden pain in his heel. He thought his opponent had hit him with his racket. When he turned, though, he realized his opponent was too far away to have hit him."

Diabetes can lead to vascular disease of large and medium arteries, narrowing the lumen and reducing blood supply to the extremities, thereby impairing healing. In addition, diabetes can also affect blood supply to nerves, which leads to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy results in reduced sensation, and therefore minor injuries can often go unnoticed. This patient has developed an ulcer on his heel, which is a pressure point and likely to be under repeated strain. The nurse examined the ulcer and found that the ulcer was looking infected with pus at the base of the ulcer and asked for a specialist orthopedic opinion, who requested an x-ray and an MRI. The MRI and x-ray both demonstrated infection invading into the calcaneus with destruction of the bone (Fig. 6.141A,B)."

Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

A 62-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe interscapular pain. His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."

Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis?

Afterward an appreciable subcutaneous hematoma developed in the ankle. The diagnostic possibilities include a bone or soft tissue injury. A bony injury was excluded because there was no bone tenderness. The patient had a significant soft tissue injury. On examination he had significant swelling of the ankle with a subcutaneous hematoma. He was unable to stand on tiptoe on the right leg, and in the prone position a palpable defect was demonstrated within the calcaneal tendon. A diagnosis of calcaneal tendon rupture was made. This patient has a typical history of ruptured calcaneal tendon and the clinical findings support this. Magnetic resonance imaging was carried out and confirmed the diagnosis (eFig. 6.144). The patient underwent an operative repair. The tendon healed well, though the patient has not gone back to playing squash."
