    "question": "A 27-year-old woman presents to the office with concerns about her long struggle with her physical appearance since adolescence. She says she has always been \"large\" and was constantly targeted by her classmates and coworkers for being so. Her main concern at the moment is her acne and unwanted facial hair on her upper lip, for which she often visits a local spa. She has tried numerous diet plans, exercise regimens, and cosmetic products with little to no effect. Recently, she underwent a glucose tolerance test that showed a plasma glucose level of 160 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L) after 2 hours of a 75 g dose of oral glucose. She has a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a menstrual cycle that occurs every 45 days. Her pulse is 72/min and the blood pressure is 138/80 mm Hg. On physical examination, her height is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) and her weight is 85 kg (187 lb), and she has severe inflammatory acne over the cheeks and forehead and dark coarse hairs on the back. What is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely diagnosis for the patient, we need to analyze the provided information and consider the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. The patient is a 27-year-old woman with a history of acne, unwanted facial hair on her upper lip, and a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. She also has a menstrual cycle that occurs every 45 days. The patient underwent a glucose tolerance test, which showed a plasma glucose level of 160 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L) after 2 hours of a 75 g dose of oral glucose. This result indicates impaired glucose tolerance. The patient's symptoms of acne and unwanted facial hair are suggestive of hyperandrogenism, which is a common feature of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age and is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries. The patient's family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus is also consistent with PCOS, as women with PCOS are at increased risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The patient's physical examination findings of severe inflammatory acne and dark coarse hairs on the back are also consistent with PCOS. The patient's menstrual cycle that occurs every 45 days is also consistent with PCOS, as women with PCOS often have irregular menstrual cycles. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The patient should eat nothing after midnight prior to the test day. On the morning of the test, adults are then given 75 g of glucose in 300 mL of water; children are given 1.75 g of glucose per kilogram of ideal body weight. The glucose load is consumed within 5 minutes. Blood samples for plasma glucose are obtained at 0 and 120 minutes after ingestion of glucose. An oral glucose tolerance test is normal if the fasting venous plasma glucose value is less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) and the 2-hour value falls below 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L). A fasting value of 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher or a 2-hour value of greater than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus.

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

            "content": "Blood Pressure Oral contraceptives have a dose-related effect on blood pressure. With the older high-dose pills, as many as 5% of patients could be expected to have blood pressure levels greater than 140/90 mm Hg. The mechanism is believed to be an estrogen-induced increase in renin substrate in susceptible individuals. Low-dose pills have minimal blood pressure effects, but surveillance of blood pressure is advised to detect the occasional idiosyncratic response. Glucose Metabolism Oral estrogen alone has no adverse effect on glucose metabolism, but progestins exhibit insulin antagonism (154). Older OC formulations with higher doses of progestins produced abnormal glucose tolerance tests with elevated insulin levels in the average patient. The effect on glucose metabolism, similar to the effect on lipids, is related to androgenic potency of the progestin and to its dose."

Oophorectomy in patients with hyperthecosis accompanied by hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenemia does not change insulin resistance, despite a decrease in androgen levels (70,71).

This thickened, pigmented, velvety skin lesion is most often found in the vulva and may be present on the axilla, over the nape of the neck, below the breast, and on the inner thigh (72). The HAIR-AN syndrome consists of hyperandrogenism (HA), insulin resistance (IR), and acanthosis nigricans (AN) (68,73). These patients often have high testosterone levels (>150 ng/dL), fasting insulin levels of greater than 25 \u03bcIU/mL (normal <20 to 24 \u03bcIU/mL), and maximal serum insulin responses to glucose load (75 gm) exceeding 300 \u03bcIU/mL (normal is <160 \u03bcIU/m: at 2 hours postglucose load)."

In obese, insulin-resistant women, caloric restriction that results in weight reduction will reduce the severity of insulin resistance (a 40% decrease in insulin level with a 10-kg weight loss) (75). This decrease in insulin levels should result in a marked decrease in androgen production (a 35% decrease in testosterone levels with a 10-kg weight loss) (76). Exercise reduces insulin resistance, independent from any associated weight loss, but data on the impact of exercise on the principal manifestations of PCOS are lacking."
