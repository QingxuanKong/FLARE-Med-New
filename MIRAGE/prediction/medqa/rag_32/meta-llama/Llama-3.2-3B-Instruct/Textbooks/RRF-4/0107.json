    "question": "A 29-year-old man comes in for evaluation of infertility. He has been trying to conceive for over 2 years with his wife and previous evaluation of his wife's fertility revealed no abnormalities. Physical exam reveals a tall man with long extremities, sparse body hair, gynecomastia, and small testes. Laboratory studies reveal increased serum follicle-stimulating hormone concentration and an increased estradiol:testosterone ratio. Genetic studies reveal a cytogenetic abnormality. If this abnormality was inherited from the patient's father, at which stage of spermatogenesis did this error most likely occur?",

The patient presents with infertility, tall stature, sparse body hair, gynecomastia, and small testes, which are indicative of hypogonadism. The increased serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration and estradiol:testosterone ratio further support this diagnosis. The genetic studies reveal a cytogenetic abnormality, which suggests a chromosomal disorder. The patient's father has a similar condition, which implies an X-linked inheritance pattern. Given the symptoms and genetic studies, the most likely diagnosis is Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY). Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects males, characterized by an extra X chromosome. The error most likely occurred during meiosis, specifically during spermatogenesis, where the extra X chromosome was not properly removed during meiosis I, resulting in the production of gametes with an extra X chromosome. This error would have occurred at the primary spermatocyte stage, which is the stage where the X chromosome is first reduced during meiosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Patients with unexplained infertility may be reassured that even after 12 months of failed attempts, 20% will conceive in the following 12 months and over 50% in the following 36 months.

Low production of testicular testosterone results in failure to develop later secondary sexual characteristics, such as facial hair, deepening of the voice, and libido. In adulthood, osteopenia and osteoporosis develop. Because of these findings, testosterone supplementation is indicated. Most men with KS are infertile because they produce few viable sperm. Through the use of isolation of viable sperm through testicular biopsy, coupled with in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, it is possible for men with KS to father children; all children born to these men using this technology have had a normal chromosome complement.

In addition to the extent of gynecomastia, recent onset, rapid growth, tender tissue, and occurrence in a lean subject should prompt more extensive evaluation. This should include a careful drug history, measurement and examination of the testes, assessment of virilization, evaluation of liver function, and hormonal measurements including testosterone, estradiol, and androstenedione, LH, and hCG.

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

            "content": "If abnormalities in the semen are detected, further evaluation of the male partner by a urologist is indicated to diagnose the defect. Table 32.4 lists the differential diagnoses for male factor infertility (53). Several groups have attempted to assess the distribution of male infertility diagnoses; two such distributions are shown in Table 32.5 (54,55). The first is the result of a WHO study of 7,057 men with complete diagnoses based on the WHO standard investigation of the infertile couple (54). The figures include data from cases in which the male partner was normal and the presumed cause of the couple\u2019s infertility was a female factor. The second distribution is the result of a study of 425 subfertile male patients (54). Although the two studies represent different populations (one is from a study of couples, the other from a urologic practice) and differ in their distribution of male infertility diagnoses, idiopathic male factor and varicocele predominate.

            "content": "Pretesticular azoospermia is relatively rare and results from gonadotropin deficiency, which leads to loss of spermatogenesis. The physician should perform a full endocrine history that includes information on puberty and growth and check for low serum levels of LH, FSH, and testosterone (44,47,86). Prolactin levels and pituitary imaging are indicated in cases of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (47). Hormonal treatment includes pulsatile gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH), human chorionic gonadotropin, and exogenous gonadotropins (44,47,86). The best predictors of good response are postpubertal onset of gonadotropin deficiency and testicular volume greater than 8 mL (47)."

Genotypically, they are male (XY) but have a defect that prevents normal androgen receptor function, leading to the development of the female phenotype. Serum testosterone is in the normal male range. The vagina may be absent or short."

A 30-year-old man had a diffuse and poorly defined epigastric mass. Further examination revealed asymmetrical scrotal enlargement. As part of her differential diagnosis, the resident considered the possibility that the man had testicular cancer with regional abdominal para-aortic nodal involvement (the lateral aortic, or lumbar, nodes). A primary testicular neoplasm is the most common tumor in men between the ages of 25 and 34 and accounts for between 1% and 2% of all malignancies in men. A family history of testicular cancer and maldescent of the testis are strong predisposing factors. Spread of the tumor is typically to the lymph node chains that drain the testes."
