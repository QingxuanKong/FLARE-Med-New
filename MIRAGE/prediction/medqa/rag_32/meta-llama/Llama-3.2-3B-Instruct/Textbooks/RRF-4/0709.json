Looking at the graph, we can see that the tubular fluid concentration of urea is increasing as we move along the proximal convoluted tubule. At the beginning of the proximal convoluted tubule, the tubular fluid concentration of urea is approximately 1.5 times the plasma concentration. As we move further along the proximal convoluted tubule, the tubular fluid concentration of urea continues to increase, reaching a ratio of approximately 3:1 at the end of the proximal convoluted tubule. Therefore, the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea increases from 1.5:1 to 3:1 as we move along the proximal convoluted tubule.

Thus secretion of organic anions and cations, including many toxins from the peritubular capillary into the tubular fluid, promote elimination of these compounds from plasma entering the kidneys. Hence these substances are removed from plasma by both filtration and secretion.

For this to occur the kidneys must be able to excrete urine that is either hypoosmotic or hyper-osmotic with respect to body fluids. This ability to excrete urine of varying osmolality in turn requires that solute be separated from water at some point along the nephron. As discussed in , reabsorption of solute in the proximal tubule results in reabsorption of a proportional amount of water. Hence solute and water are not separated in this portion of the nephron. Moreover, this proportionality between proximal tubule water and solute reabsorption occurs regardless of whether the kidneys excrete dilute or concentrated urine. Thus the proximal tubule reabsorbs a large portion of the filtered amount of solute and water, but it does not produce dilute or concentrated tubular fluid.

Urea is a small neutral molecule that is readily filtered at the glomerulus, and it is reabsorbed by the kidney tubules such that approximately 50% of the filtered urea is excreted in urine (see ). Urea that enters the colon is either excreted or metabolized to ammonia via colonic bacteria, with the resulting ammonia being reabsorbed or excreted. plantation. However, not all such tests measure function directly. Nevertheless, liver function tests are discussed briefly because of their link to hepatic physiology."

Of this, ~144 L (80%) is reabsorbed isosmotically in the proximal tubule and another 8 L (4\u20135%) is reabsorbed without solute in the descending limb of Henle\u2019s loop. The remainder is diluted to an osmolarity of ~60 mmol/kg by selective reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the ascending limb. In the absence of AVP, the urine issuing from the loop passes largely unmodified through the distal tubules and collecting ducts, resulting in a maximum water diuresis. In the presence of AVP, solute-free water is reabsorbed osmotically through the principal cells of the collecting ducts, resulting in the excretion of a much smaller volume of concentrated urine. This antidiuretic effect is mediated via a G protein\u2013coupled V2 receptor that increases intracellular cyclic AMP, thereby inducing translocation of aquaporin 2 (AQP 2) water"

In addition the high [Cl\u2212] (140 mEq/L) Fanconi syndrome, a renal disease that is either hereditary in tubule fluid, which is due to preferential reabsorption \u2212 or acquired, results from an impaired ability of the proximal of Na+ with HCO3 and organic solutes in the first half \u2212 tubule to reabsorb HCO3, Pi, amino acids, glucose, and of the proximal tubule, facilitates reabsorption of Cl\u2212 low-molecular-weight proteins.

Tubular reabsorption of substances filtered by the glomerulus allows the kidneys to retain substances that are essential and regulate their levels in plasma by altering the degree to which they are reabsorbed. Reabsorption of Na+ , Cl\u2212 , other anions, and organic anions and cations together with water constitutes the major function of the nephron. Approximately 25,200 mEq of Na+ and 179 L of water are reabsorbed each day. Proximal tubule cells reabsorb 67% of the glomerular ultrafiltrate, and cells of Henle\u2019s loop reabsorb about 25% of the NaCl that was filtered and about 15% of the water that was filtered. The distal segments of the nephron (distal tubule and collecting duct system) have a more limited reabsorptive capacity. However, although the proximal tubule reabsorbs Brown D, et al.
