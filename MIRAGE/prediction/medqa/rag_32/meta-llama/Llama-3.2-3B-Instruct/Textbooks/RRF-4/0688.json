    "question": "A 55-year-old man comes to the emergency department with the complaint of pain in his right toe for the past hour. The pain is so severe that it woke him up. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 40 years and binge drinks alcohol after work and on the weekends. He underwent an appendectomy when he was 14 years old. He is a long-distance truck driver. Neither of his parents had any significant medical history. His temperature is 37.7\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), blood pressure is 135/75 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, respiratory rate is 20/min, and BMI is 25 kg/m2. On examination, his right first metatarsophalangeal joint is very tender, swollen, warm, and red in color. Range of motion cannot be assessed due to extreme tenderness.\nLaboratory test\nComplete blood count:\nHemoglobin 11.5 g/dL\nLeukocytes 16,000/mm3\nPlatelets 150,000/mm3\nESR 50 mm/hr\nSynovial fluid is aspirated from the joint. The findings are:\nAppearance Cloudy, dense yellow\nWBC 30,000 cells/\u00b5L\nCulture Negative\nNeedle-shaped birefringent crystals are observed in the joint aspirate.

The laboratory test results show a cloudy, dense yellow synovial fluid with a high white blood cell count (30,000 cells/\u00b5L) and needle-shaped birefringent crystals observed in the joint aspirate. These findings are characteristic of gout.\\n\\nThe patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with acute gout, a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints. The presence of needle-shaped birefringent crystals in the synovial fluid is a diagnostic hallmark of gout.\\n\\nThe patient's long history of smoking and binge drinking also increases his risk for developing gout. However, these factors are not directly related to the underlying cause of his condition.\\n\\nThe options can be evaluated as follows:\\nA. Organic acids competing with urate for tubular secretion - This is a possible mechanism for hyperuricemia, but it is not the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition.\\nB. Increased renal reabsorption of urate - This is also a possible mechanism for hyperuricemia, but it is not the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition.\\nC. Deficiency of HGPRT - This is a rare genetic disorder that can cause hyperuricemia, but it is not consistent with this patient's presentation.\\nD. High-purine diet - This is not a direct cause of hyperuricemia, and it is not relevant to this patient's condition.\\n\\nBased on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely underlying cause of his condition is a sudden increase in serum uric acid levels, which has led to the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joint.\\n\\nThe most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition is a hyperuricemia-induced gout, which is typically caused by a sudden increase in serum uric acid levels. This can be due to various factors, such as rapid cell turnover, certain medications, or dietary factors. In this case, the patient's long history of smoking and binge drinking may have contributed to his hyperuricemia.\\n\\nHowever, the most direct cause of this patient's condition is the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joint, which is a result of the hyperuricemia.\\n\\nThe correct answer is not explicitly listed, but based on the options provided, the closest answer is C. Deficiency of HGPRT, as it is a rare genetic disorder that can cause hyperuricemia. However, this is not the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition. The correct answer is not among the options, but it is likely related to a sudden increase in serum uric acid levels, such as from a rapid cell turnover, certain medications, or dietary factors.\\n\\nHowever, since the options do not include the correct answer, I will choose the closest one, which is C.

Bacterial infection can coexist with urate crystals in synovial fluid; if there is any suspicion of septic arthritis, joint fluid must be cultured.

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

            "content": "The following three brief scenarios of a patient with hemoptysis demonstrate three distinct patterns: A 46-year-old man presents to his internist with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

            "content": "The classic presentation is the sudden development of an acutely painful, warm, and swollen joint that has a restricted range of motion. Systemic findings of fever, leukocytosis, and elevated sedimentation rate are common. In 90% of nongonococcal cases, the infection involves only a single joint, most commonly the knee, followed in decreasing frequency by the hip, shoulder, elbow, wrist, and sternoclavicular joints. The axial joints are more often involved in drug users. Joint aspiration is diagnostic if it yields purulent fluid in which the causative agent can be identified. As mentioned earlier, cartilage has limited repair potential, so prompt recognition and effective anti-microbial therapy is vital to prevent permanent joint destruction."

His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."
