Her physician prescribes high-dose niacin and recommends taking the medication along with aspirin. The side effect the physician is trying to avoid is thought to be mediated by what mechanism?",

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To answer this question, we need to consider the side effects of niacin and how it interacts with aspirin. Step 1: Identify the side effect that the physician is trying to avoid. The physician is prescribing high-dose niacin and recommends taking it along with aspirin, and the side effect they are trying to avoid is likely related to niacin. Step 2: Recall the common side effects of niacin. Niacin is known to cause several side effects, including flushing, gastrointestinal upset, and skin reactions. Step 3: Consider how aspirin might interact with niacin to mitigate a specific side effect. Aspirin is known to mitigate the prostaglandin-mediated flushing associated with niacin. Step 4: Match the correct answer choice with the mechanism of action. Based on the interaction between niacin and aspirin, the correct answer is related to the release of prostaglandins. Here is the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The physician is trying to avoid the side effect of niacin flushing, which is mediated by the release of prostaglandins. Aspirin mitigates this effect by blocking the release of prostaglandins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

His physician initially prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic commonly used to treat hyper-tension. His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic. Because the patient had elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, hydrochlorothiazide was replaced with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril lowered his blood pressure to almost normotensive levels. However, after several weeks on enalapril, the patient returned complaining of a persistent cough. In addition, some signs of angioedema were detected. How does enalapril lower blood pressure? Why does it occasionally cause coughing and angioedema? What other drugs could be used to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and decrease blood pressure,"

Niacin suppresses lipolysis in the adipocyte through its effect on the niacin receptor GPR109A and has other effects on hepatic lipid metabolism that are poorly understood. Niacin reduces plasma TG and LDL-C levels and also raises the plasma concentration of HDL-C. Because it has a number of side effects and can be difficult to use, it is at best a third-line agent for the management of severe hypertriglyceridemia. Niacin therapy is generally started at lower doses and gradually titrated up to higher doses. The most frequent side effect of niacin is cutaneous flushing, which is mediated by activating GPR109A in the skin. Niacin can cause dyspepsia and can exacerbate esophageal reflux and peptic ulcer disease. Mild elevations in transaminases occur in up to 15% of patients treated with any form of niacin.

Each type can be responsible for adverse drug effects, and adverse interactions may occur between OTC drugs and prescribed drugs. Loss of efficacy of oral contraceptives or cyclosporine with concurrent use of St. John\u2019s wort (a P-glycoprotein inducer) is an example. In addition, it is common for patients to be cared for by several physicians, and duplicative, additive, antagonistic, or synergistic drug combinations may therefore be administered if the physicians are not aware of the patients\u2019 drug histories. Every physician should determine what drugs a patient has been taking, for the previous month or two ideally, before prescribing any medications. Medications stopped for inefficacy or adverse effects should be documented to avoid pointless and potentially dangerous reexposure. A frequently overlooked source of"

The control of lipids can be achieved by the combination of a diet low in saturated and trans-unsaturated fatty acids, exercise, and weight loss. Nearly always, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are required and can lower LDL cholesterol (25\u201350%), raise HDL cholesterol (5\u20139%), and lower triglycerides (5\u201330%). A powerful treatment effect of statins on atherosclerosis, IHD, and outcomes is seen regardless of the pretreatment LDL cholesterol level. Fibrates or niacin can be used to raise HDL cholesterol and lower triglycerides (Chaps. 291e and 421). Controlled trials with lipid-regulating regimens have shown equal proportional benefit for men, women, the elderly, diabetic patients, and smokers. Compliance with the health-promoting behaviors listed above is generally very poor, and a conscientious"

            "content": "Some persons with familial combined hyperlipoproteinemia have only an elevation in LDL. Serum cholesterol is often less than 350 mg/dL. Dietary and drug treatment, usually with a reductase inhibitor, is indicated. It may be necessary to add niacin or ezetimibe to normalize LDL. This familial disorder, which is associated with increased atherogenesis and arterial thrombus formation, is determined chiefly by alleles that dictate increased production of the (a) protein moiety. Lp(a) can be secondarily elevated in patients with severe nephrosis and certain other inflammatory states. Niacin reduces levels of Lp(a) in many patients. Reduction of levels of LDL-C below 100 mg/dL decreases the risk attributable to Lp(a), as does the administration of low-dose aspirin. PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies also reduce levels of Lp(a) by about 25%."

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

Taking 81\u2013325 mg of aspirin 30 minutes beforehand blunts this prostaglandin-mediated effect. Naproxen, 220 mg once daily, also mitigates the flush. Tachyphylaxis to flushing usually occurs within a few days at doses above 1.5\u20133 g daily. Patients should be warned to expect the flush and understand that it is a harmless side effect. Pruritus, rashes, dry skin or mucous membranes, and acanthosis nigricans have been reported. The latter requires the discontinuance of niacin because of its association with insulin resistance. Some patients experience nausea and abdominal discomfort. Many can continue the drug at reduced dosage, with inhibitors of gastric acid secretion or with antacids not containing aluminum. Niacin should be avoided in patients with significant peptic disease."

Cholesterol fat-lowering diet books abound in most bookstores and allow the patient to choose a diet she will best follow. The role of exercise and cigarette cessation should be stressed to all patients. Patients with a family history of cardiovascular disease (history of premature coronary artery problems and strokes) should be tested and started on conservative programs in their 20s. After 3 to 6 months, if the LDL remains above 160 mg/dL with zero to one risk factor or above 130 mg/dL with two or more risk factors, then medical therapy should be initiated. Any woman with coronary heart disease or equivalents such as diabetes or other forms of atherosclerotic disease (peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and symptomatic carotid artery disease) should initiate lifestyle changes if her LDL is 100 mg/dL or more and drug therapy if her LDL is 130 mg/dL or more.
