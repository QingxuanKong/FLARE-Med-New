    "question": "A research group has developed a low-cost diagnostic retinal imaging device for cytomegalovirus retinitis in a population of HIV-infected patients. In a pilot study of 50 patients, the imaging test detected the presence of CMV retinitis in 50% of the patients. An ophthalmologist slit lamp examination, which was performed for each patient to serve as the gold standard for diagnosis, confirmed a diagnosis of CMV retinitis in 20 patients that were found to be positive through imaging, as well as 1 patient who tested negative with the device. If the prevalence of CMV retinitis in the population decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, how will positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the diagnostic test be affected?",

    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Understanding the terms**: - **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**: The proportion of true positive results among all positive test results. It is the probability that a person with a positive test result actually has the disease. - **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**: The proportion of true negative results among all negative test results. It is the probability that a person with a negative test result does not have the disease. 2. **Initial Situation**: - The imaging test detected CMV retinitis in 50% of the patients. - The ophthalmologist's examination confirmed a diagnosis of CMV retinitis in 20 patients who tested positive with the imaging device and in 1 patient who tested negative with the device. - This means the PPV is 20/30 (20/29 when including the patient who tested negative but was confirmed positive by ophthalmologist examination) = 66.67% and the NPV is 29/20 = 64.17%. 3. **Effect of Decrease in Prevalence**: - When the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases, the total number of actual cases of the disease decreases. - Since the test is detecting 50% of actual cases, the total number of actual positive cases will decrease. - Assuming the test's sensitivity remains the same, the proportion of true positive results among all positive test results (PPV) will decrease because there are fewer actual cases to detect. - The proportion of true negative results among all negative test results (NPV) will increase because there are more actual negative cases (since the prevalence decreases) and the test's specificity remains the same (i.e., it still correctly identifies those without the disease). 4. **Conclusion**: - PPV decreases because there are fewer actual cases to detect. - NPV increases because there are more actual negative cases and the test's sensitivity remains constant. The answer is: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The PPV decreases as the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases because there are fewer actual cases to detect. The NPV increases because there are more actual negative cases and the test's sensitivity remains constant. Therefore, the correct answer is B. PPV decreases, NPV increases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"} ```",

            "content": "Intravitreal injections of ganciclovir or the intraocular ganciclovir implant may be used to treat CMV retinitis. Concurrent therapy with a systemic anti-CMV agent is necessary to prevent other sites of end-organ CMV disease. Resistance to ganciclovir increases with duration of use. The more common mutation, in UL97, results in decreased levels of the triphosphorylated (ie, active) form of ganciclovir. The less common UL54 mutation in DNA polymerase results in higher levels of resistance and potential cross-resistance with cidofovir and foscarnet. Antiviral susceptibility testing is recommended in patients in whom resistance is suspected clinically."

            "content": "Ganciclovir is a guanosine derivative that has considerably more activity against CMV than its congener acyclovir. After intracellular conversion by a viral phosphotransferase encoded by CMV gene region UL97, ganciclovir triphosphate is a selective inhibitor of CMV DNA polymerase. Several clinical studies have indicated response rates of 70\u201390% among patients with AIDS who are given ganciclovir for the treatment of CMV retinitis or colitis. In severe infections (e.g., CMV pneumonia in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients), ganciclovir is often combined with CMV immune globulin. Prophylactic or suppressive ganciclovir may be useful in high-risk hematopoietic stem cell or organ transplant recipients (e.g., those who are CMV-seropositive before transplantation). In many patients with AIDS, persistently low CD4+ T cell counts, and CMV disease, clinical and virologic relapses occur promptly if treatment with ganciclovir is discontinued. Therefore, prolonged maintenance regimens"

            "content": "HIV infection of an exposed infant is confirmed if virologic tests are positive on two separate occasions. HIV infection can be reasonably excluded in nonbreastfed infants with at least two virologic tests performed at older than 1 month of age, with one test being performed after 4 months of age, or at least two negative antibody tests performed after 6 months of age, with an interval of at least 1 month between the tests. Loss of HIV antibody combined with negative HIV DNA PCR confirms absence of HIV infection. Persistence of a positive HIV antibody test after 18 months of age indicates HIV infection. The differential diagnosis of AIDS in infants includes primary immunodeficiency syndromes and intrauterine infections with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and syphilis. Prominenceof individual symptoms, such as diarrhea, may suggest otheretiologies."
