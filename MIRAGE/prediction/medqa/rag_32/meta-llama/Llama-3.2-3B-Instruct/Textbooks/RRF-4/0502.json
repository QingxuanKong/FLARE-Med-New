The next best step should be to perform a diagnostic workup to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the disease, rather than proceeding directly to treatment. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is a good starting point, but in this case, the results are already suspicious for malignancy. The next best step is to perform a more comprehensive diagnostic workup, which includes ultrasound and possibly other imaging studies to assess the nodule's characteristics, size, and potential for malignancy. The patient's normal TSH level and the presence of a cold nodule on radionuclide scan do not rule out malignancy, and FNAB results are already suspicious for malignancy. Therefore, the best course of action is to proceed with further diagnostic testing to confirm the diagnosis and plan for potential treatment. Surgical excision or punch biopsy may be considered if the diagnosis is confirmed, but it is not the next best step without further diagnostic evaluation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Larger masses may produce local symptoms such as difficulty in swallowing. Individuals with toxic adenomas may present with features of thyrotoxicosis. After injection of radioactive iodine, most adenomas take up iodine less avidly than normal thyroid parenchyma. On radionuclide scanning, therefore, adenomas appear as cold nodules relative to the adjacent normal thyroid gland. Toxic adenomas, however, appear as warm or hot nodules in the scan. As many as 10% of cold nodules eventually prove to be malignant. By contrast, malignancy is uncommon in hot nodules. Essential techniques used in the preoperative evaluation of suspected adenomas are ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Because of the need for evaluating capsular integrity, the definitive diagnosis of thyroid adenoma can be made only after careful microscopic examination of the resected specimen."

What are two potential treatment options for her possible chlamydial infection? How does her potential pregnancy affect the treatment decision? A 22-year-old woman presents to her college medical clinic complaining of a 2-week history of vaginal discharge. She denies any fever or abdominal pain but does report vaginal bleeding after sexual intercourse. When questioned about her sexual activity, she reports having vaginal intercourse, at times unprotected, with two men in the last 6 months.

Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of \u201closs of vision.\u201d Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver\u2019s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

The majority of these are related to cell damage caused by smoking and alcohol use. Certain viruses are also related to cancers in the head and neck, including human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). A 50-year-old overweight woman came to the doctor complaining of hoarseness of voice and noisy breathing. She was also concerned at the increase in size of her neck. On examination she had a slow pulse rate (45 beats per minute). She also had an irregular knobby mass in the anterior aspect of the lower neck, which deviated the trachea to the right. A clinical diagnosis of a multinodular goiter and hypothyroidism was made."
