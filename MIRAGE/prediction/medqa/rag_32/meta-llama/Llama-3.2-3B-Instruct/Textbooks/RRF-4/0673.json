    "question": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-week history of burning sensation in his mouth. One year ago, a peripheral blood smear performed during workup of fatigue revealed erythrocytes without central pallor. His father had gallstones, for which he underwent a cholecystectomy at the age of 26 years. Examination shows pallor of the mucosal membranes, mild scleral icterus, a swollen, red tongue, and several mouth ulcers. There is darkening of the skin over the dorsal surfaces of the fingers, toes, and creases of the palms and soles. His spleen is enlarged and palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.1 gm/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 104 \u03bcm3, and a reticulocyte count of 9%.

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thought process: The patient presents with a 3-week history of burning sensation in the mouth, pallor of mucosal membranes, mild scleral icterus, a swollen, red tongue, and several mouth ulcers. The patient's father had gallstones, which led to a cholecystectomy. The patient's laboratory studies show a low hemoglobin concentration, high mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and a reticulocyte count of 9%. These findings are suggestive of megaloblastic anemia, which is often caused by a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate. The patient's symptoms of burning sensation in the mouth and mouth ulcers are consistent with glossitis, which is often seen in megaloblastic anemia. The darkening of the skin over the dorsal surfaces of the fingers, toes, and creases of the palms and soles is also consistent with megaloblastic anemia. Considering the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely cause of the patient's oropharyngeal symptoms is a deficiency in vitamin B12. Now, let's evaluate the potential choices: A. Red blood cell transfusions: While transfusions may help alleviate the patient's anemia, they do not address the underlying cause of the megaloblastic anemia. B. Gluten-free diet: A gluten-free diet is typically recommended for patients with celiac disease, which is an autoimmune disorder that causes malabsorption of nutrients, including vitamin B12. However, there is no indication of celiac disease in the patient's history. C. Vitamin B12 injections: Vitamin B12 injections are a common treatment for megaloblastic anemia caused by a deficiency in vitamin B12. This is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. D. Folic acid supplementation: While folic acid supplementation may be necessary to treat megaloblastic anemia, it is not the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms, as the patient's reticulocyte count is elevated, suggesting that the anemia is not solely due to folic acid deficiency. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of megaloblastic anemia, including glossitis and darkening of the skin, which are consistent with a deficiency in vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 injections are a common treatment for megaloblastic anemia caused by a deficiency in vitamin B12.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

The vesicles may form bullae and quickly ulcerate. About one-third of patients also have lesions on the palate, uvula, or tonsillar pillars, and one-third have a rash on the feet (including the soles) or on the buttocks. The disease is highly infectious, with attack rates of close to 100% among young children. The lesions usually resolve in 1 week. Most cases are due to coxsackievirus A16 or enterovirus 71."

Pelvic and rectal examinations can often be deferred but, when performed, should be undertaken with great gentleness to avoid trauma; these will often show bleeding from the cervical os and blood in the stool. Pallor of the skin and mucous membranes is common except in the most acute cases or those already transfused. Infection on presentation is unusual but may occur if the patient has been symptomatic for a few weeks. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are highly atypical of aplastic anemia. Caf\u00e9 au lait spots and short stature suggest Fanconi anemia; peculiar nails and leukoplakia suggest dyskeratosis congenita; early graying (and use of hair dyes to mask it!) suggests a telomerase defect."

Nonspecific manifestations, such as weakness, listlessness, and pallor, may be present in severe cases. With long-standing anemia, abnormalities of the fingernails, including thinning, flattening, and \u201cspooning,\u201d may appear. A curious but characteristic neurobehavioral complication is pica, the compunction to consume nonfoodstuffs such as dirt or clay. In peripheral smears, red cells are microcytic and hypo-chromic ( Fig. 12.10 ). Diagnostic criteria include anemia, hypochromic and microcytic red cell indices, low serum ferritin and iron levels, low transferrin saturation, increased total iron-binding capacity, and, ultimately, response to iron therapy. For unclear reasons, the platelet count often is elevated. Erythropoietin levels are elevated, but the marrow response is blunted by the iron deficiency; thus, marrow cellularity usually is only slightly increased."
