    "question": "A 38-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his father because of altered mental status. According to the father, the patient was unable to get out of bed that morning and has become increasingly confused over the past several hours. The father also noticed it was \u201cpretty cold\u201d in his son's apartment because all of the windows were left open overnight. He has a history of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension for which he takes medication. Ten days ago, he was started on a new drug. He appears lethargic. His rectal temperature is 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F), pulse is 54/min, respirations are 8/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Examination shows weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the upper extremities. The pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. Throughout the examination, the patient attempts to remove his clothing. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's analyze the symptoms and the patient's medical history. The patient presents with altered mental status, lethargy, weakness in the lower extremities, absent deep tendon reflexes, dilated pupils, and poor reactivity to light. These symptoms suggest a neurological disorder. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which is being treated with a new medication. The patient also has a history of schizoaffective disorder, which may be relevant. Let's evaluate each option: Option A, Lisinopril, is an ACE inhibitor used to treat hypertension and heart failure. It is not typically associated with the neurological symptoms described. Option B, Fluphenazine, is a typical antipsychotic medication used to treat schizophrenia and other psychoses. It can cause neurological side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), including tremors, rigidity, and dystonia, but the symptoms described do not match these. Option C, Levothyroxine, is a thyroid hormone replacement medication used to treat hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone replacement can cause a range of symptoms, including changes in mental status, weakness, and altered reflexes, especially if the dosage is too high or if the patient has a sensitivity to the medication. This option is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Option D, Atorvastatin, is a statin medication used to lower cholesterol levels. It is not typically associated with neurological side effects like those described. Considering the patient's history of hypothyroidism and the symptoms presented, the most likely cause of these findings is the new thyroid hormone replacement medication, Levothyroxine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

            "content": "One of our adult patients with Wilson disease had been committed to a psychiatric hospital because of paranoid tendencies and fighting with his family; the presence of a tremor and mild rigidity of the limbs had been attributed at first to phenothiazine drugs. In some of Griffin\u2019s cases of adrenomyeloneuropathy, a spastic weakness of the legs and sensory ataxia progressing over several years were the main clinical manifestations; a spinocerebellar degeneration was suspected. One of our patients with Kufs lipid storage disease began to deteriorate mentally in early adult life and only much later showed an increasing rigidity, with athetotic posturing of limbs and difficulty in walking; he succumbed to his disease after more than a decade of symptoms. Another recent patient with Kufs disease presented at age 51 with vague visual difficulty, which was followed by spasticity of the legs, behavioral disinhibition, and dementia spanning 6 years. Josephs and colleagues describe 2 of 5"

His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor. With the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, he is started on a regimen"

At the end of this period, yawning, rhinorrhea, sweating, piloerection, and lacrimation are manifest. Mild at first, these symptoms increase in severity over a period of several hours and then remain constant for several days. The patient may be able to sleep during the early abstinence period but is restless, and thereafter insomnia remains a prominent feature. Dilatation of the pupils, recurring waves of \u201cgooseflesh,\u201d and twitching of the muscles appear. The patient complains of aching in the back, abdomen, and legs and of \u201chot and cold flashes\u201d; he frequently asks for blankets. At about 36 h the restlessness becomes more severe, and nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea usually develop. Temperature, respiratory rate, and blood pressure are slightly elevated.

Following a sleepless night with significant dyspnea, the patient develops nausea and vomiting and collapses. He presents to the emergency department in cardiac arrest and is unable to be resuscitated. His autopsy shows a posterior wall myocardial infarction and a fresh thrombus in an atherosclerotic right coronary artery. What went wrong? The clinician had decided, based on the patient\u2019s appearance, even before starting the history, that the patient\u2019s complaints were not serious. Therefore, he felt confident that he could perform an abbreviated and focused examination by using the URI assessment protocol rather than considering the broader range of possibilities and performing appropriate tests to confirm or refute his initial hypotheses. In particular, by concentrating on the URI, the clinician failed to elicit the full dyspnea history, which would have"

His heart fail-ure must be treated first, followed by careful control of the hypertension. He was initially treated with a diuretic (furo-semide, 40 mg twice daily). On this therapy, he was less short of breath on exertion and could also lie flat without dyspnea. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhib-itor was added (enalapril, 20 mg twice daily), and over the next few weeks, he continued to feel better. Because of continued shortness of breath on exercise, digoxin at 0.25 mg/d was added with a further modest improvement in exercise tolerance. The blood pressure stabilized at 150/90 mm Hg, and the patient will be educated regarding the relation between his hypertension and heart failure and the need for better blood pressure control. Cautious addition of a \u03b2 blocker (metoprolol) will be considered. Blood lipids, which are currently in the normal range, will be monitored."

Older patients with comorbidities (including cardiovascular disease) or predisposing factors often require inpatient fluid and electrolyte replacement, monitoring, and reassessment. The clinical manifestations of heatstroke reflect a total loss of thermo-regulatory function. Typical vital-sign abnormalities include tachypnea, various tachycardias, hypotension, and a widened pulse pressure. Although there is no single specific diagnostic test, the historical and physical triad of exposure to a heat stress, CNS dysfunction, and a core temperature >40.5\u00b0C helps establish the preliminary diagnosis."

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"
