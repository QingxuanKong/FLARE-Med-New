    "question": "A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with back pain. The patient states that he has gradually worsening back pain that seems to have worsened after moving furniture the other day. He also states that while he walks, he feels numbness and weakness in his legs. The only time the patient states his back pain is improved is when he is riding his bike or pushing a cart at the grocery store. The patient has a past medical history of osteoporosis, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. He drinks 3 alcoholic drinks every day and has a 44 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 157/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a non-tender spine with normal mobility in all 4 directions. Radiography of the spine and basic labs are ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and history. The patient presents with worsening back pain that worsens with physical activity, such as moving furniture, and improves with activities that do not require significant physical exertion, such as riding a bike or pushing a cart. This pattern is suggestive of neurological compression of the spinal cord. The patient's past medical history of osteoporosis, dyslipidemia, and diabetes may also be relevant, as these conditions can increase the risk of vertebral fractures. The patient's physical examination is notable for a non-tender spine with normal mobility in all directions, which suggests that the pain is not due to a mechanical cause such as a herniated disk or muscle strain. The radiography of the spine and basic labs are ordered to further evaluate the patient's condition. Given the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is spinal stenosis, which is a narrowing of the spinal canal that can compress the spinal cord and cause neurological symptoms such as numbness and weakness in the legs. The patient's age, smoking history, and osteoporosis also increase the risk of spinal stenosis. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D. Spinal stenosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

A 50-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with severe lower back pain that had started several days ago. In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."

On first inspection, it is difficult to \u201cadd up\u201d these clinical symptoms and signs. In essence we have a progressive paraplegia associated with severe back pain and an anomaly in blood pressure measurements, which are not compatible with the clinical state of the patient. It was deduced that the blood pressure measurements were obtained in different arms, and both were reassessed."

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian"

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."
