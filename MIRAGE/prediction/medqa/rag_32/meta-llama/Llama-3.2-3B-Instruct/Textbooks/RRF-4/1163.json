Over the past 6 months, he has had recurrent dull epigastric pain that is triggered by meals and lasts for a few days. He drinks 6 to 8 beers daily. Abdominal examination shows mild epigastric tenderness with no rebound or guarding. A CT scan of the abdomen is shown. The structure indicated by the arrows is most likely lined by which of the following?",

    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking and final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the symptoms and the CT scan findings described in the scenario. The patient has a 1-week history of diarrhea and abdominal bloating, with bulky, foul-smelling stools. He also experiences recurrent dull epigastric pain triggered by meals, which has been ongoing for 6 months. This pattern of symptoms, combined with the CT scan findings, suggests a condition affecting the small intestine. Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse, we should consider the possibility of small bowel damage or disease. The CT scan shows a structure indicated by arrows, which we need to identify. The options provided are simple ductal epithelium, granulation tissue, pyogenic membrane, and columnar mucinous epithelium. Considering the patient's symptoms and the fact that the CT scan shows a structure that is likely a complication of chronic alcohol abuse, I would suspect a condition such as a Meckel's diverticulum, which is a congenital diverticulum of the small intestine. A Meckel's diverticulum is usually lined by columnar mucinous epithelium, which is a type of epithelium that can produce mucus. This type of epithelium is also seen in other conditions such as gastric mucosa in the small intestine, which can occur in association with conditions like Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. However, the presence of foul-smelling stools and the patient's history of alcohol abuse make Meckel's diverticulum a more likely diagnosis. Therefore, the structure indicated by the arrows on the CT scan is most likely lined by columnar mucinous epithelium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Intestinal ischemia elicits severe pain but little tenderness.

What would be true about the levels of ketone bodies and glucose during periods of physiologic stress in individuals with impaired FA oxidation? Case 4: Hypoglycemia, Hyperketonemia, and Liver Dysfunction Patient Presentation: AK, a 59-year-old male with slurred speech, ataxia (loss of skeletal muscle coordination), and abdominal pain, was dropped off at the Emergency Department (ED). Focused History: AK is known to the ED staff from previous visits. He has a 6year history of chronic, excessive alcohol consumption. He is not known to take illicit drugs. At this ED visit, AK reports that he has been drinking heavily in the past day or so. He cannot recall having eaten anything in that time. There is evidence of recent vomiting, but no blood is apparent."

            "content": "APPROACH TO THE PATIENT: The clues provided by the history, symptoms, and initial preliminary observations will serve to limit extensive, ill-focused, and expensive laboratory and imaging studies. For example, a clinician evaluating a patient who has symptoms suggestive of malabsorption and who has recently undergone extensive small-intestinal resection for mesenteric ischemia should direct the initial assessment almost exclusively to defining whether a short-bowel syndrome might explain the entire clinical picture. Similarly, the development of a pattern of bowel movements suggestive of steatorrhea in a patient with long-standing alcohol abuse and chronic pancreatitis should prompt an assessment of pancreatic exocrine function."

            "content": "Thoracic disease and abdominal disease frequently coexist and may be difficult or impossible to differentiate. For example, the patient with known biliary tract disease often has epigastric pain during myocardial infarction, or biliary colic may be referred to the precordium or left shoulder in a patient who has suffered previously from angina pectoris. For an explanation of the radiation of pain to a previously diseased area, see Chap. 18. Referred pain from the spine, which usually involves compression or irritation of nerve roots, is characteristically intensified by certain motions such as cough, sneeze, or strain and is associated with hyperesthesia over the involved dermatomes. Pain referred to the abdomen from the testes or seminal vesicles is generally accentuated by the slightest pressure on either of these organs. The abdominal discomfort experienced is of dull, aching character and is poorly localized."

            "content": "Because the major symptoms of IBS\u2014abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, and alteration in bowel habits\u2014are common complaints of many GI organic disorders, the list of differential diagnoses is a long one. The quality, location, and timing of pain may be helpful to suggest specific disorders. Pain due to IBS that occurs in the epigastric or periumbilical area must be differentiated from biliary tract disease, peptic ulcer disorders, intestinal ischemia, and carcinoma of the stomach and pancreas. If pain occurs mainly in the lower abdomen, the possibility of diverticular disease of the colon, inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease), and carcinoma of the colon must be considered. Postprandial pain accompanied by bloating, nausea, and vomiting suggests gastroparesis or partial intestinal obstruction. Intestinal infestation with Giardia lamblia or other parasites may cause similar symptoms. When diarrhea is the major complaint, the possibility of lactase"

This complication has also been seen in patients with other forms of cancer treated with taxanes, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, vinorelbine, cisplatin, carboplatin, and high-dose chemotherapy (Fig. 331-5). It also has been reported in patients with AIDS, aplastic anemia, cyclic neutropenia, idiosyncratic drug reactions involving antibiotics, and immunosuppressive therapies. The patient develops right lower quadrant abdominal pain, often with rebound tenderness and a tense, distended abdomen, in a setting of fever and neutropenia. Watery diarrhea (often containing sloughed mucosa) and bacteremia are common, and bleeding may occur. Plain abdominal films are generally of little value in the diagnosis; CT scan may show marked bowel wall thickening, particularly in the cecum, with bowel wall edema, mesenteric stranding, and ascites, and may help to"
