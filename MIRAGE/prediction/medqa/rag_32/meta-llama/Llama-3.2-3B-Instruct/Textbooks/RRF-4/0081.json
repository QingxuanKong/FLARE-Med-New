    "question": "A 54-year-old male makes an appointment with his primary care physician due to chronic fatigue that has left him unable to hike or do other physically demanding activities with his friends. He has well-controlled hypertension and diabetes but has otherwise been healthy. He does not smoke but drinks socially with his friends. Physical exam reveals enlarged nodules that are not tender to palpation. A biopsy is obtained showing a characteristic change in chromosome 18. The regulation of which of the following proteins will be most abnormal in this patient?",

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Based on the provided documents, I will analyze the question step by step. The patient presents with chronic fatigue, enlarged nodules that are not tender to palpation, and a characteristic change in chromosome 18, as revealed by a biopsy. This suggests a diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia, a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. Hairy cell leukemia is characterized by a mutation in the BCR gene, which is located on chromosome 22. However, the patient's biopsy shows a characteristic change in chromosome 18. This is likely a result of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 18 and 22, which results in the formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene. The BCR-ABL fusion gene is a result of the Philadelphia chromosome, which is a hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and some cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The BCR-ABL fusion gene is a result of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, which creates a chimeric gene that encodes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. The regulation of the Ras pathway transcription factors is abnormal in hairy cell leukemia due to the BCR-ABL fusion gene. The BCR-ABL fusion protein is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates and activates various downstream targets, including Ras pathway transcription factors. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's biopsy shows a characteristic change in chromosome 18, which is likely a result of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 18 and 22, resulting in the formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene. This fusion gene is a result of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, which creates a chimeric gene that encodes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. The BCR-ABL fusion protein phosphorylates and activates various downstream targets, including Ras pathway transcription factors. Therefore, the regulation of Ras pathway transcription factors will be most abnormal in this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The heart rate of CFS patients is often slightly above normal. Laboratory tests serve primarily to exclude other diagnoses; no test can diagnose CFS. The following laboratory screen usually suffices: complete blood count; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; C-reactive protein; serum creatinine, electrolytes, calcium, and iron; blood glucose; creatine kinase; liver function tests; thyroid-stimulating hormone; anti-gliadin antibodies; and urinalysis. Serology for viral or bacterial infections usually is not helpful. No specific abnormalities have been identified on MRI or CT scans.

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

For these reasons, it is important to evaluate patients in the context of their presenting symptoms, review of systems, family and social history, and exposure to medications that may affect the endocrine system. Astute clinical skills are required to detect subtle symptoms and signs suggestive of underlying endocrine disease. For example, a patient with Cushing\u2019s syndrome may manifest specific findings, such as central fat redistribution, striae, and proximal muscle weakness, in addition to features seen commonly in the general population, such as obesity, plethora, hypertension, and glucose intolerance. Similarly, the insidious onset of hypothyroidism\u2014 with mental slowing, fatigue, dry skin, and other features\u2014can be difficult to distinguish from similar,"

He complained that his face and extremities had taken on a blue color. His medical history included chronic stable angina treated with isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin. Blood obtained for analysis was brown. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A. Carboxyhemoglobinemia B. Hemoglobin SC disease C. Methemoglobinemia D.

The patient\u2019s temperature was normal. He explained that the episode had occurred following a birthday party at which he had participated in an ice cream\u2013eating contest. The patient reported prior episodes of a similar nature following ingestion of a significant amount of dairy products. This clinical picture is most probably due to a deficiency in the activity of: A. isomaltase. B. lactase. C. pancreatic \u03b1-amylase. D. salivary \u03b1-amylase. E. sucrase. Correct answer = B. The physical symptoms suggest a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for carbohydrate degradation. The symptoms observed following the ingestion of dairy products suggest that the patient is deficient in lactase as a result of the age-dependent reduction in expression of the enzyme."

Review of the past history and growth chart demonstrates normal birth weight and birth length, but a progressive decrease in height per-centiles relative to age-matched normal ranges starting at 6 months of age, and orthostasis with febrile illnesses. Physical examination demonstrates short stature and mild generalized obesity. Genital examination reveals descended but small testes and a phallic length of \u20132 SD. Laboratory evaluations demonstrate growth hormone (GH) deficiency and a delayed bone age of 18 months. The patient is started on replacement with recombinant human GH at a dose of 40 mcg/kg per day subcutaneously. After 1 year of treatment, his height velocity has increased from 5 cm/y to 11 cm/y.

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."
