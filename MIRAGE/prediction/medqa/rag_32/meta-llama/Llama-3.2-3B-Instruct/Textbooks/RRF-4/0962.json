    "question": "A 19-year-old female presents to the emergency room with 6 days of lower abdominal pain. She states that her symptoms have progressed and she now feels feverish as well. She also notes an episode of nonbloody diarrhea 2 days ago and has been increasingly nauseous. While being evaluated in the emergency room, she vomits three times. The patient has no significant past medical history but was recently treated with ciprofloxacin for an uncomplicated urinary tract infection. She also notes irregular periods, with a last menstrual period 6 weeks ago. She is a college student who has had 3 sexual partners in the last year with inconsistent use of barrier protection. Her temperature is 100.5\u00b0C (38.1\u00b0F), blood pressure is 102/68 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, and respirations are 14/min. On exam, the patient is noticeably uncomfortable. There is marked tenderness to palpation in the suprapubic region and right lower quadrant, with voluntary guarding but no rebound. Pelvic exam shows moderate purulent discharge in the vaginal vault, cervical motion tenderness, and a tender adnexal mass on the right side. Which of the following is the best next step in treating this patient\u2019s condition?",

The patient's symptoms have progressed over 6 days, indicating a possible complication of PID. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as suprapubic tenderness, right lower quadrant tenderness, voluntary guarding, moderate purulent discharge in the vaginal vault, cervical motion tenderness, and a tender adnexal mass on the right side, are consistent with PID. The patient's recent treatment with ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection may have contributed to the development of PID. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of PID, which requires prompt treatment with antibiotics. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a need for hospitalization, but outpatient treatment is not appropriate without proper follow-up. Therefore, the best next step is to initiate outpatient treatment with antibiotics and follow up with the patient to monitor for signs of improvement or worsening of symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" } ``` The best answer is A.

The pain is similar to labor, with suprapubic cramping, and may be accompanied by lumbosacral backache, pain radiating down the anterior thigh, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and rarely syncopal episodes. The pain of dysmenorrhea is colicky in nature and, unlike abdominal pain that is caused by chemical or infectious peritonitis, is relieved by abdominal massage, counter-pressure, or movement of the body. On examination, the vital signs are normal. The suprapubic region may be tender to palpation. Bowel sounds are normal, and there is no upper abdominal tenderness and no abdominal rebound tenderness. Bimanual examination at the time of the dysmenorrheic episode often reveals uterine tenderness; severe pain does not occur with movement of the cervix or palpation of the adnexal structures. The pelvic organs are normal in primary dysmenorrhea."

They may only experience pain in the suprapubic region on palpation or on rectal or pelvic examination. A pelvic examination in women is mandatory to rule out conditions affecting urogynecologic organs that can cause abdominal pain and mimic appendicitis such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and ovarian torsion. The relative frequencies of some presenting signs are displayed in Table 356-3. Patients with simple appendicitis normally only appear mildly ill with a pulse and temperature that are usually only slightly above normal. The provider should be concerned about other disease processes beside appendicitis or the presence of complications such as perforation, phlegmon, or abscess formation if the temperature is >38.3\u00b0C (~101\u00b0F) and if there are rigors."

NSAIDs; topical heat therapy; combined OCPs, Mirena IUD. Menstrual pain for which an organic cause exists. Common causes include endometriosis and adenomyosis, tumors, fbroids, adhesions, polyps, and PID. Look for pathology. Patients may have a palpable uterine mass, cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness, a vaginal or cervical discharge, or visible vaginal pathology (mucosal tears, masses, prolapse). However, normal abdominal and pelvic exams do not rule out pathology. See Table 2.12-4 for distinguishing features of endometriosis vs. adenomyosis. First step: Obtain a \u03b2-hCG to exclude ectopic pregnancy. Second step: Order the following: A CBC with differential to rule out infection or neoplasm. UA to rule out UTI. Gonococcal/chlamydial swabs to rule out STDs/PID. Stool guaiac to rule out GI pathology."

She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet.

These complaints are new since she used to always feel \u201chot,\u201d noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to \u201cprotect her bones\u201d and omeprazole for \u201cheartburn.\u201d On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm. Her weight is 136 lb (61.8 kg), an increase of 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the last year. Her thyroid gland is not palpable and her reflexes are delayed. Laboratory findings include a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 24.9 \u03bcIU/mL"

            "content": "With later diagnosis, the classic triad is delayed menstruation, pain, and vaginal bleeding or spotting. With tubal rupture, lower abdominal and pelvic pain is usually severe and frequently described as sharp, stabbing, or tearing. Abdominal palpation elicits tenderness. Bimanual pelvic examination, especially cervical motion, causes exquisite pain. The posterior vaginal fornix may bulge from blood in the rectouterine cul-de-sac, or a tender, boggy mass may be felt beside the uterus. The uterus can also be slightly enlarged due to hormonal stimulation. Symptoms of diaphragmatic irritation, characterized by neck or shoulder pain, especially on inspiration, develop in perhaps half of women with sizable hemoperitoneum."

All women of reproductive age with acute pelvic pain should have a complete blood count with differential, ESR, urinalysis, and a sensitive qualitative urine or serum pregnancy test. If not diagnosed expeditiously, an acute process can often result in significant morbidity or mortality. For patients who have chronic pelvic pain and develop acute exacerbation, it is important to rule out a superimposed acute process. Symptoms of fever, chills, diaphoresis, abnormal vaginal bleeding, dizziness, syncope, emesis, significant diarrhea, obstipation, dysuria, hematuria, and hematochezia, and/or signs of elevated temperature, tachycardia, orthostasis, abdominal distention, abnormal bowel sounds, ascites, peritonitis, or abnormal pregnancy are all indicative of an acute process."

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"
