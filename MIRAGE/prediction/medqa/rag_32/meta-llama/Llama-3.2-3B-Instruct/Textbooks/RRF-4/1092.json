    "question": "A 69-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for trouble sleeping. The patient states that he recently retired from working the day shift at a cemetery. When the patient retired, his goal was to finally be able to go out with his wife; however, he finds that he is unable to stay awake past 6 pm in the evening. His inability to stay awake has been straining his marriage as his wife is disappointed that they cannot do any activities in the evening together. The patient has tried drinking caffeine but finds that it does not help. The patient\u2019s wife claims that the patient seems to sleep peacefully, and the patient states he feels rested when he awakes. The patient has a past medical history of irritable bowel syndrome which is managed with fiber supplements. The patient\u2019s neurological exam is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with difficulty staying awake past 6 pm in the evening, which is a significant change from his previous day shift work. The patient has tried drinking caffeine without success, and his wife reports that he sleeps peacefully and feels rested in the morning. This suggests that the patient is having trouble staying awake during the evening, but his sleep quality is not affected. This pattern is characteristic of a shift work disorder, specifically delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD) or advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD), but given the patient's recent retirement and shift from day shift to night shift work, DSPD is more likely. However, the patient's symptoms are not typical of DSPD, which is characterized by a consistent delay in the sleep-wake cycle. Instead, the patient's symptoms suggest a more gradual shift in the sleep-wake cycle, which is consistent with advanced sleep phase disorder. The patient's wife's statement that the patient sleeps peacefully and feels rested in the morning also supports this diagnosis, as individuals with ASPD often sleep earlier than desired and feel rested in the morning. However, the patient's difficulty staying awake during the evening is the most critical aspect of the case, and this is a hallmark symptom of ASPD. The patient's past medical history of irritable bowel syndrome is not relevant to the diagnosis. The patient's neurological exam being within normal limits also supports the diagnosis of ASPD, as there is no indication of neurological abnormalities. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

In particular, the duration, severity, and consistency of the symptoms are important, along with the patient\u2019s estimate of the consequences of the sleep disorder on waking function. Information from a bed partner or family member is often helpful because some patients may be unaware of symptoms such as heavy snoring or may underreport symptoms such as falling asleep at work or while driving. Physicians should inquire about when the patient typically goes to bed, when they fall asleep and wake up, whether they awaken during sleep, whether they feel rested in the morning, and whether they nap during the day. Depending on the primary complaint, it may be useful to ask about snoring, witnessed apneas, restless sensations in the legs, movements during sleep, depression, anxiety, and behaviors around the sleep episode.

Individuals differ in their optimal amount of sleep, and it can be helpful to ask how much sleep the patient obtains on a quiet vacation when he or she can sleep without restrictions. Some patients may think that a short amount of sleep is normal or advantageous, and they may not appreciate their biological need for more sleep, especially if coffee and other stimulants mask the sleepiness. A 2-week sleep log documenting the timing of sleep and daily level of alertness is diagnostically useful and provides helpful feedback for the patient.

The MSLT measures a patient\u2019s propensity to sleep under quiet conditions. The test is performed after an overnight polysomnogram to establish that the patient has had an adequate amount of good-quality nighttime sleep. The MSLT consists of five 20-min nap opportunities every 2 h across the day. The patient is instructed to try to fall asleep, and the major endpoints are the average latency to sleep and the occurrence of REM sleep during the naps. An average sleep latency across the naps of less than 8 min is considered objective evidence of excessive daytime sleepiness. REM sleep normally occurs only during the nighttime sleep episode, and the occurrence of REM sleep in two or more of the MSLT naps provides support for the diagnosis of narcolepsy."

            "content": "1.2. A 50-year-old man presented with painful blisters on the backs of his hands. He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."

He is rushed to a nearby level 1 trauma center where he is found to have multiple facial fractures, a severe, unstable cervical spine injury, and significant left eye trauma. Further examination of his left eye reveals rupture of his globe. The ophthalmolo-gist requests emergency surgery to repair and save his eye. Because the patient has suffered a recent trauma, you decide to perform a rapid sequence intubation in preparation for the surgical procedure. What muscle relaxant would you use to facilitate tracheal intubation? What is the proper dose for your chosen muscle relaxant? After intravenous infusion of your chosen muscle relaxant, you are unable to adequately visualize the patient\u2019s larynx and vocal cords and cannot successfully pass an endotracheal tube. You switch to mask ventilation but are barely able to mask ventilate the patient, and you become worried"

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

He has hypertension, and during the last 8 years, he has been adequately managed with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH\u2019s problem? What information would you gather to confirm your diagnosis? What treatment steps would you initiate?"

            "content": "This term is reserved for the condition in which nocturnal sleep is disturbed for prolonged periods and none of the symptoms of anxiety, depression, pain, or other psychiatric or medical diseases can be invoked to explain the sleep disturbance. In some patients, like those described by Hauri and Olmstead, the disorder is lifelong. Unlike the rare individuals who seem to be satisfied with 4 h or even less of sleep a night, insomniacs suffer the effects of partial sleep deprivation and resort to medications or alcohol. Their lives come to revolve around sleep to such an extent that they have been called \u201csleep pedants\u201d or \u201csleep hypochondriacs.\u201d Although statements on the quantity and quality of sleep given by insomniacs are often not to be taken as entirely valid, Rechtschaffen and Monroe have confirmed that most of them do, indeed, sleep for shorter periods, move and awaken more often, spend less time in N3 sleep than normal persons, and show a heightened physiologic arousal."
