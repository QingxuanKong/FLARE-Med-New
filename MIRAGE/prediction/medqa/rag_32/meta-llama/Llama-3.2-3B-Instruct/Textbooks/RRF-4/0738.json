    "question": "Public health researchers are reviewing data from an outbreak of hepatitis A that was traced to contaminated produce from a popular restaurant. A case series investigation with prospective and retrospective follow-up found that 500 individuals dined at the restaurant during the week of study. The incidence of hepatitis A infection was found to be 25%, and the total number of deaths recorded among the incident cases was 5 individuals. What was the case-fatality rate for the hepatitis A outbreak?",

    "predict": "To calculate the case-fatality rate, we need to divide the number of deaths by the number of cases and multiply by 100. Step 1: Calculate the number of cases Number of individuals who dined at the restaurant = 500 Incidence of hepatitis A infection = 25% Number of cases = 500 x 0.25 = 125 Step 2: Calculate the case-fatality rate Number of deaths = 5 Case-fatality rate = (Number of deaths / Number of cases) x 100 Case-fatality rate = (5 / 125) x 100 Case-fatality rate = 4% Therefore, the case-fatality rate for the hepatitis A outbreak is 4%.

Person-to-person spread of HAV is enhanced by poor personal hygiene and overcrowding; large outbreaks as well as sporadic cases have been traced to contaminated food, water, milk, frozen raspberries and strawberries, green onions imported from Mexico, and shellfish. Intrafamily and intrainstitutional spread are also common. Early epidemiologic observations supported a predilection for hepatitis A to occur in late fall and early winter. In temperate zones, epidemic waves have been recorded every 5\u201320 years as new segments of nonimmune population appeared; however, in developed countries, the incidence of hepatitis A has been declining, presumably as a function of improved sanitation, and these cyclic patterns are no longer observed. No HAV carrier state has been identified after acute hepatitis A; perpetuation of the virus in nature depends presumably on nonepidemic, inapparent subclinical infection,"

Tattooing and body piercing (for hepatitis B and C) and eating shellfish (for hepatitis A) are frequently mentioned but are actually types of exposure that quite rarely lead to the acquisition of hepatitis. Hepatitis E is one of the more common causes of jaundice in Asia and Africa but is uncommon in developed nations."

Occasionally, the migrating epidemiology of hepatitis D is expressed in explosive outbreaks of severe hepatitis, such as those that have occurred in remote South American villages as well as in urban centers in the United States. Ultimately, such outbreaks of hepatitis D\u2014either of co-infections with acute hepatitis B or of superinfections in those already infected with HBV\u2014may blur the distinctions between endemic and nonendemic areas. On a global scale, HDV infection declined at the end of the 1990s. Even in Italy, an HDV-endemic area, public health measures introduced to control HBV infection resulted during the 1990s in a 1.5%/year reduction in the prevalence of HDV infection. Still, the frequency of HDV infection during the first decade of the twenty-first century has not fallen below levels reached during the 1990s; the reservoir has been sustained by survivors infected during 1970\u20131980 and recent immigrants from still-endemic to less-endemic"
