    "question": "A 13-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician due to a left breast lump under his nipple. He noticed it last month and felt that it has increased slightly in size. It is tender to touch but has no overlying skin changes. There is no breast discharge. The patient has cryptorchidism as an infant and underwent a successful orchiopexy. In addition, he was recently diagnosed with ADHD and is currently on methylphenidate with improvement in his symptoms. He has a family history of type I diabetes in his father and breast fibroadenoma in his mother. On exam, the patient is at the 82nd percentile for height, 79th percentile for weight, and 80th percentile for BMI. He has tanner IV pubic hair. Testicular volume is 7 mL on each side, and both testes are smooth and freely mobile. Breast exam shows a normal right breast and a 3-centimeter round, firm, and slightly tender discrete mass under the left nipple. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely etiology of the patient's condition, let's consider the key points from the case: 1. The patient is a 13-year-old boy with a left breast lump under his nipple, which has increased in size over the past month. 2. The lump is tender to touch but has no overlying skin changes or breast discharge. 3. The patient has a history of cryptorchidism, which was corrected with orchiopexy. 4. He has ADHD and is on methylphenidate, which can cause breast tenderness and gynecomastia as a side effect. 5. The patient has a family history of breast fibroadenoma in his mother. 6. The patient's testicular volume is 7 mL on each side, and both testes are smooth and freely mobile. Given these points, we can rule out options: * D. Testicular cancer is unlikely since the testicular volume is normal, and there are no other suspicious findings. * B. Glandular tissue enlargement is possible, but it's not the most likely explanation given the patient's history of ADHD and methylphenidate use. * A. Klinefelter syndrome is not supported by the patient's physical exam findings, which show normal testicular volume and freely mobile testes. This leaves us with C. Lipomastia (pseudogynecomastia), which is a common cause of breast tissue enlargement in males, particularly in adolescence. The patient's history of ADHD and methylphenidate use, as well as his family history of breast fibroadenoma, further supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely etiology of this patient's condition is lipomastia (pseudogynecomastia).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

It is often idiopathic, but it may be noted in various conditions (Table 68-3). Typical findings include the appearance of a 1to 3-cm, round, freely mobile, often tender, and firm mass immediately beneath the areola during sexual maturity rating stage III. Large, hard, or fixed enlargements and masses associated with any nipple discharge warrant further investigation. Reassurance is usually the only treatment required. If the condition worsens and is associated with psychological morbidity, it may be treated with bromocriptine. Surgical treatment with reduction mammoplasty can be helpful with massive hypertrophy. Irregular menses is the most common complaint of early adolescent girls. As regular, ovulatory cycles become established, pain with menstruation (dysmenorrhea) is a frequent complaint."

During the year before presentation, her scholastic performance in school deteriorated, she gained 25 lb, she became increasingly lethargic, and nocturia and polydypsia were noted. Initial evaluation documented low follicle-stimulating hormone, elevated prolactin, and a bone age of 10.5 years. Computed tomography scanning documented a large hypothalamic neoplasm that proved to be an ectopic germinoma. The patient was also documented to be hypothyroid and hypoadrenal and to have diabetes insipidus. Despite the elevated prolactin, she had no galactorrhea because of the minimal breast development.

If the breast is large, a pillow or towel may be placed beneath the scapula to elevate the side being examined; otherwise, the breast tends to fall to the side, making palpation of the lateral hemisphere more difficult. The major features to be identified on palpation of the breast are temperature, texture and thickness of skin, generalized or focal tenderness, nodularity, density, asymmetry, dominant masses, and nipple discharge. Most premenopausal patients have normally nodular breast parenchyma. The nodularity is diffuse but predominantly in the upper outer quadrants, where there is more breast tissue. These benign parenchymal nodules are small, similar in size, and indistinct. By comparison, breast cancer usually occurs in the form of a nontender, firm mass with irregular margins.

            "content": "Clinically, a young woman usually notices a mass while showering or dressing. Most masses are 2 to 3 cm in diameter when detected, but they can become extremely large (i.e., the giant fibroadenoma). On physical examination, they are firm, smooth, and rubbery. They do not elicit an in\ufb02ammatory reaction, are freely mobile, and cause no dimpling of the skin or nipple retraction. They are often bilobed, and a groove can be palpated on examination. On mammographic and ultrasonographic imaging, the typical features are of a well-defined, smooth, solid mass with clearly defined margins and dimensions that are longer than wide and craniocaudad dimensions that are less than the length."

About 20% of breast cancers are detected in the first trimester, 45% in the second trimester, and 35% in the third trimester. Some argue that stage for stage, the outcome is the same for breast cancer diagnosed in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Primary tumors in pregnant women are 3.5 cm on average, compared to <2 cm in nonpregnant women. A dominant mass and a nipple discharge are the most common presenting signs, and they should prompt ultrasonography and breast MRI exam (if available) followed by lumpectomy if the mass is solid and aspiration if the mass is cystic. Mammography is less reliable in pregnancy due to the increased breast density. Needle aspirates of breast masses in pregnant women are often nondiagnostic or falsely positive. Even in pregnancy, most breast masses are benign (~80% are adenoma, lobular hyperplasia, milk retention cyst, fibrocystic disease,"
