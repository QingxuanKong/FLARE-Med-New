    "question": "A 72-year-old man in a nursing home was brought to the emergency department with right hand and leg weakness for 1 hour. There has been a gradual increase in the degree of weakness. The patient is disoriented. The medical history includes ischemic heart disease diagnosed 2 months ago, and long histories of diabetes and hypertension (30 and 25 years, respectively). On examination, the reflexes are hypertonic and the Babinski reflex is positive. The CT scan is shown. What is the most likely pathologic change?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with right hand and leg weakness, disorientation, and hypertonic reflexes, which suggests an upper motor neuron lesion. The gradual increase in weakness and the presence of a positive Babinski reflex further support this diagnosis. The patient's medical history of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension may be relevant, but they do not directly explain the neurological symptoms. The CT scan is mentioned, but its findings are not described. However, based on the clinical presentation, the most likely pathologic change is related to a cerebral vasculitis or small vessel disease, which is a common cause of stroke in older adults. The presence of hypertension and diabetes increases the risk of small vessel disease. Among the options, fibrinoid necrosis is a characteristic feature of small vessel disease, which is a type of vasculitis that affects the small blood vessels in the brain. It is more common in older adults and is often associated with hypertension and diabetes. The other options are not as likely given the clinical presentation and patient's medical history.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

As the symptoms suggest, the signs are symmetrical, and more severe in distal than in proximal portions of the limbs, and often confined to the legs. In some cases, the disproportionate affection of motor power may be striking, taking the form of a footand wrist-drop, but the proximal muscles are usually affected as well (indicated, for example, by climbing stairs or by difficulty in arising from a squatting position). In a few patients, the weakness appears to be most severe in the proximal muscles. Absolute paralysis of the legs had been observed in the past only rarely; immobility caused by contractures at the knees and ankles in neglected patients was a more common occurrence. Tenderness of muscles on deep pressure is a highly characteristic finding, elicited most readily in the muscles of the feet and calves.

The entire leg or the quadriceps feels stiff and heavy and gives out quickly after exercise. Mobility of the ankle may be reduced, and the advancing toe of the shoe scrapes the floor. On examination, slight hypertonicity of the legs is usually more evident than weakness, and the tendon reflexes are increased (ankle jerks may not share in this change in the elderly). Although the patient may believe that only one leg is affected, it is commonly found that both plantar reflexes are extensor, the one on the side of the stiffer leg being more clearly so. Less often, both legs are equally affected. As the compression continues, walking becomes unsteady because of the addition of sensory ataxia."

The iliopsoas, quadriceps, and hamstrings are involved in varying degrees. The muscles of the scapulae and upper limbs, usually the deltoid and triceps, are affected less frequently. Sensory changes, if present, are distal, symmetrical, and usually mild. In an attempt to delineate these types of proximal diabetic neuropathies, it must be emphasized that they overlap and that distal parts of a limb may be involved to a mild degree and the evolution of symptoms varies. Whether the proximal and distal syndromes should be distinguished on pathologic or electrophysiologic grounds is not clear."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

            "content": "The provocative test, undertaken under careful supervision when the patient is functioning normally, consists of the oral administration of 2 g of KCl in a sugar-free liquid repeated every 2 h for 4 doses, if that many are necessary to provoke an attack. The test is given in the fasting state, ideally just after exercise. The weakness typically has a latency of 1 to 2 h after the administration of K. The patient must be carefully monitored by ECG and frequent serum estimations of serum potassium. The test should never be undertaken in the presence of an attack of weakness, or when there is reduced renal function, or in those with diabetes requiring insulin. The treatment of this syndrome is the same as that for paramyotonia congenita, described further on."

            "content": "Over the following week the paralysis improved and was likely due to nerve bruising during the procedure. The patient remained asymptomatic. A 60-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department with acute right-sided weakness, predominantly in the upper limb, which lasted for 24 hours. She made an uneventful recovery, but was extremely concerned about the nature of her illness and went to see her local doctor. A diagnosis of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) was made. A TIA is a neurological deficit resolving within 24 hours. It is a type of stroke. Neurological deficits may be permanent or transient. Most transient events resolve within 21 days; any failure of resolution beyond 21 days is an established stroke. An investigation into the cause of the TIA was undertaken. Eighty-five percent of all strokes result from cerebral infarction, of which most are due to embolization. A duplex Doppler scan of the carotid vessels was performed."

            "content": "The typical case is readily identified. Paresthesias and slight numbness in the toes and fingers are the earliest symptoms; only infrequently are they absent throughout the illness. The major clinical manifestation is weakness that evolves more or less symmetrically over a period of several days to a week or two, or somewhat longer. The proximal as well as distal muscles of the limbs are involved, usually the lower extremities before the upper (thus the older term Landry ascending paralysis); the trunk, intercostal, neck, and cranial muscles may be affected later. Weakness progresses in approximately 5 percent of patients to total motor paralysis with respiratory failure within a few days. In severe cases, the ocular motor nerves are paralyzed and even the pupils may be unreactive."

Case 4: Hypoglycemia, Hyperketonemia, and Liver Dysfunction Patient Presentation: AK, a 59-year-old male with slurred speech, ataxia (loss of skeletal muscle coordination), and abdominal pain, was dropped off at the Emergency Department (ED). Focused History: AK is known to the ED staff from previous visits. He has a 6year history of chronic, excessive alcohol consumption. He is not known to take illicit drugs. At this ED visit, AK reports that he has been drinking heavily in the past day or so. He cannot recall having eaten anything in that time. There is evidence of recent vomiting, but no blood is apparent."

            "content": "retention are characteristic. Tachycardia, hypertension, restlessness, tremors, and excess sweating are due to sympathetic overactivity. The peripheral neuropathy is due to axonal degeneration (rather than demyelinization) and primarily affects motor neurons. Significant neuropathy does not occur with all acute attacks; abdominal symptoms are usually more prominent. Motor neuropathy affects the proximal muscles initially, more often in the shoulders and arms. The course and degree of involvement are variable and sometimes may be focal and involve cranial nerves. Deep tendon reflexes initially may be normal or hyperactive but become decreased or absent as the neuropathy advances. Sensory changes such as paresthesia and loss of sensation are less prominent. Progression to respiratory and bulbar paralysis and death occurs especially when the diagnosis and treatment are delayed. Sudden death may result from sympathetic overactivity and cardiac arrhythmia."
