    "question": "A 58-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of left knee pain as well as stiffness upon waking for about 10\u201315 minutes. The pain is worse after standing a lot at work and when she climbs stairs. There is no history of trauma. She has hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. Her mother died of metastatic breast cancer 15 years ago, at the age of 65 years. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Current medications include atorvastatin, labetalol, and aspirin. Over the past 2 months, she has been taking over-the-counter ibuprofen as needed for the joint pain. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 84 kg (185 lb); BMI is 31.8 kg/m2. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 114/68 mm Hg. Examination of the left knee shows tenderness on palpation of the anteromedial joint line; there is crepitus and pain with full flexion and extension. Serum uric acid concentration is 8.0 mg/dL and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 15 mm/h. Which of the following is the most likely finding on imaging of the left knee?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Osteophytes with joint-space narrowing on x-ray",
        "B": "Diffuse lytic-sclerotic bone lesions on x-ray",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. The patient presents with a 3-month history of left knee pain and stiffness, which worsens after standing and climbing stairs. She has a history of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension, and her serum uric acid concentration is elevated at 8.0 mg/dL. These findings, combined with the presence of crepitus and joint tenderness on examination, suggest a diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA). OA is a common joint disorder that can be caused by wear and tear on the joint cartilage, and it is often associated with age, obesity, and other risk factors. The patient's BMI is 31.8 kg/m^2, which is in the obese category, and she has a history of hypercholesterolemia, which is a risk factor for OA. The elevated serum uric acid concentration further supports this diagnosis, as hyperuricemia is a common finding in patients with OA. Now, let's consider the imaging options provided in the question. Osteophytes with joint-space narrowing on x-ray (A) are characteristic of OA, as they are bone spurs that form on the edges of the joint due to the degeneration of the joint cartilage. Diffuse lytic-sclerotic bone lesions on x-ray (B) are more commonly associated with other conditions, such as cancer or bone infections. Joint effusion and pannus on ultrasound (C) are more characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation and damage to the joints. A fluid-filled pouch on ultrasound (D) could be indicative of a variety of conditions, including a meniscus tear or a joint effusion, but it is not as specific for OA as osteophytes with joint-space narrowing. Therefore, the most likely finding on imaging of the left knee is osteophytes with joint-space narrowing on x-ray.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Insulin E. pH Case 10: Calf Pain Patient Presentation: CR is a 19-year-old female who is being evaluated for pain and swelling in her right calf. Focused History: Ten days ago, CR had her spleen removed following a bicycle accident in which she fractured her tibial eminence, necessitating immobilization of the right knee. She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."

She admits to having taken a \u201chandful\u201d of Lorcet (hydrocodone/acetaminophen, an opioid/nonopioid analgesic combination), Soma (carisoprodol, a centrally acting muscle relaxant), and Cymbalta (duloxetine HCl, an antidepressant/ antifibromyalgia agent) 2 days earlier. On physical examina-tion, the sclera of her eyes shows yellow discoloration. Labora-tory analyses of blood drawn within an hour of her admission reveal abnormal liver function as indicated by the increased indices: alkaline phosphatase 302 (41\u2013133),* alanine amino-transferase (ALT) 351 (7\u201356),* aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1045 (0\u201335),* bilirubin 3.33 mg/dL (0.1\u20131.2),* and pro-thrombin time of 19.8 seconds (11\u201315).* In addition, plasma bicarbonate is reduced, and she has ~45% reduced glomerular filtration rate from the normal value"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

            "content": "History and Physical Examination The chest discomfort, often severe enough to be described as frank pain, is typically located in the sub-sternal region or sometimes in the epigastrium, and radiates to the left arm, left shoulder, and/or neck. Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

            "content": "OA is the most common cause of chronic knee pain in persons over age 45, but the differential diagnosis is long. Inflammatory arthritis is likely if there is prolonged morning stiffness and many other joints are affected. Bursitis occurs commonly around knees and hips. A physical examination should focus on whether tenderness is over the joint line (at the junction of the two bones around which the joint is articulating) or is outside of it. Anserine bursitis, medial and distal to the knee, is an extremely common cause of chronic knee pain that may respond to a glucocorticoid injection. Prominent nocturnal pain in the absence of end-stage OA merits a distinct workup. For hip pain, OA can be detected by loss of internal rotation on passive movement, and pain isolated to an area lateral to the hip joint usually reflects the presence of trochanteric bursitis. No blood tests are routinely indicated for workup of patients with OA unless symptoms and signs suggest inflammatory arthritis."
