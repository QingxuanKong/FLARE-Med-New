    "question": "A 25-year-old man with a past medical history of constipation and fibromyalgia presents to the emergency department with generalized malaise and severe diarrhea. The patient states that he has not felt well for the past 24 hours and his symptoms are no longer tolerable. He denies taking any medications or illicit drugs and states he is generally healthy. His temperature is 99.3\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 122/88 mmHg, pulse is 107/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam demonstrates an ill appearing young man. Physical exam is notable for rhinorrhea, lacrimation, and piloerection. The patient\u2019s pupils are dilated and reactive to light. During placement of an ultrasound guided IV, multiple scars are noted in the antecubital fossa, and it is noted that it is very difficult to place an IV in this patient. During the exam, he begins actively vomiting. Which of the following could be an appropriate treatment for this patient\u2019s symptoms?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with generalized malaise, severe diarrhea, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, piloerection, dilated pupils, and multiple scars in the antecubital fossa. These symptoms are suggestive of a serotonin syndrome, a life-threatening condition caused by an excess of serotonin in the body. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of serotonin syndrome, which is often associated with the use of certain medications, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other serotonergic agents. The patient's history of fibromyalgia and constipation may also be relevant, as some medications used to treat these conditions can contribute to serotonin syndrome. Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most appropriate treatment would be to discontinue any serotonergic medications and provide supportive care to manage symptoms. Among the options provided, haloperidol and diphenhydramine are both antipsychotic and antihistamine medications that can be used to manage symptoms of serotonin syndrome, such as agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. However, the primary focus should be on discontinuing any serotonergic medications and providing supportive care.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The venous drainage of the testis is via the pampiniform plexus of veins that runs within the spermatic cord. A varicocele is a collection of dilated veins that arise from the pampiniform plexus. In many ways, they are similar to varicose veins that develop in the legs.

This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung.

The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy. One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC). He undergoes surgical resection and is found to have high-risk stage III CRC with five positive lymph nodes. After surgery, he feels entirely well with no symptoms. Of note, he has no other illnesses. What is this patient\u2019s overall prognosis? Based on his prognosis, what"

Focused History: AK is known to the ED staff from previous visits. He has a 6year history of chronic, excessive alcohol consumption. He is not known to take illicit drugs. At this ED visit, AK reports that he has been drinking heavily in the past day or so. He cannot recall having eaten anything in that time.

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

The patient reported prior episodes of a similar nature following ingestion of a significant amount of dairy products. This clinical picture is most probably due to a deficiency in the activity of: A. isomaltase. B. lactase. C. pancreatic \u03b1-amylase. D. salivary \u03b1-amylase. E. sucrase. Correct answer = B. The physical symptoms suggest a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for carbohydrate degradation. The symptoms observed following the ingestion of dairy products suggest that the patient is deficient in lactase as a result of the age-dependent reduction in expression of the enzyme."
