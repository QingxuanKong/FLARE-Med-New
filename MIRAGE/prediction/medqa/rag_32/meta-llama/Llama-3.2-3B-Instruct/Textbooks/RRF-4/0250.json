She vaguely explains that the necklace is to mask her scent from the moles tracking her. She has no past psychiatric history and she denies hearing voices or seeing objects. No significant past medical history. Although she has lived in the same community for years, she says she usually keeps to herself and does not have many friends.

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the best initial course of treatment for this patient, let's analyze the symptoms and behavior described. The patient is setting up bear traps and wearing a garlic necklace to ward off'mole people,' which suggests a paranoid delusional disorder. She has no past psychiatric history, denies hearing voices or seeing objects, and has a regular job and living situation, which makes a psychotic disorder less likely. The patient's behavior is more in line with a paranoid delusional disorder, which is a type of anxiety disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is often effective in treating anxiety disorders, including paranoid delusional disorder. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is typically reserved for more severe cases of depression or bipolar disorder, and is not indicated for paranoid delusional disorder. Referral to outpatient group therapy may be helpful, but CBT is a more direct and effective approach for treating this patient's symptoms. Therefore, the best initial course of treatment is CBT.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

She functioned extremely well through her eighties but had a schizophrenic sister. Also, several physicians under our care have woven extensive delusional ideas around tenuous scientific theories; these ideas have applied to personal life events as well as physical and psychologic symptoms and in some cases have resulted in bizarre regimens of self-medication. Rarely, a patient comes to the hospital for some other medical reason and it is found that he or she has been living quietly in the community, preoccupied with a bizarre delusional system yet appearing neither depressed nor schizophrenic. Certainly one often sees delusions in depressed patients who decompensate as their depression deepens."

            "content": "4. Paranoia and personality changes Occasionally, at some point in the development of Alzheimer dementia, paranoia or bizarre behavior assumes prominence. This may appear before the more obvious memory or language defects announce themselves. The patient becomes convinced that relatives are stealing his possessions or that an elderly and even infirm spouse is guilty of infidelity. He may hide his belongings, even relatively worthless ones, and go about spying on family members. Hostilities arise, and wills may be altered irrationally. Many of these patients are constantly worried, tense, and agitated. Of course, paranoid delusions may be part of a depressive psychosis and of other dementias, but most of the elderly patients in whom paranoia is the presenting problem, seem not to be depressed, and their cognitive functions are for a time relatively well preserved. Social indiscretions, rejection of old friends, embarking on imprudent financial ventures, or an amorous pursuit that is"

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

            "content": "Agoraphobia Agoraphobia is the avoidance of situations in which the patient fears she may be trapped, such as the center of a row in the theater or driving over a bridge. She fears that such a situation will trigger anxiety or a panic attack and therefore tends more and more to stay at home or limit her sphere of activity to an increasingly short list of venues. Agoraphobia and panic disorder can occur separately or together (150\u2013154). Specific Phobias Specific phobias are irrational fears of certain objects or situations, although the patient recognizes that the object or situation poses no real danger. Of particular concern in gynecology are fear of needles and fear of vomiting (150)."
