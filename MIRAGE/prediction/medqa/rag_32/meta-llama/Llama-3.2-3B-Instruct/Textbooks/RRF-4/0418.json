    "question": "A 16-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for the evaluation of fatigue for several weeks. The parents report that their son quit doing sports at school because of low energy. The patient's academic performance has declined recently. He spends most of his time in the basement playing video games and eating bowls of cereal. He has no history of serious illness. His mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis and his father has major depressive disorder. The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows conjunctival pallor, inflammation and fissuring of the corners of the mouth, and concavity of the finger nails. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 11.5 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 76 \u03bcm3\nPlatelet count 290,000/mm3\nRed cell distribution width 18% (N = 13%\u201315%)\nLeukocyte count 7,000/mm3\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?\"",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, low energy, and decline in academic performance, which are common signs of anemia. The laboratory studies show a low hemoglobin level (11.5 g/dL), low mean corpuscular volume (76 \\u00b5m3), and elevated red cell distribution width (18%). These findings suggest iron deficiency anemia. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with iron deficiency anemia, which is a common cause of anemia in adolescents. The most appropriate initial step in treatment would be to address the underlying cause of iron deficiency anemia, which is likely due to inadequate dietary intake or chronic blood loss. Iron supplementation is the most appropriate initial treatment for iron deficiency anemia. Regular blood transfusions may be considered in severe cases of anemia, but they are not the first line of treatment. Methylphenidate is not indicated for the treatment of anemia. Allogenic stem cell transplantation is a radical treatment option that is not typically considered for iron deficiency anemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in?

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

            "content": "The following three brief scenarios of a patient with hemoptysis demonstrate three distinct patterns: A 46-year-old man presents to his internist with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

Involuntary commitment or isolation for medical treatment may be undertaken for what reason? A 10-year-old child presents in status epilepticus, but her parents refuse treatment on religious grounds. A son asks that his mother not be told about her recently discovered cancer. False. Patients may change their minds at any time.

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."
