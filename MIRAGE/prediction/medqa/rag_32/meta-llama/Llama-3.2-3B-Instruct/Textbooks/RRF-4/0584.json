The patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale of 5 and is subsequently intubated. Physical exam is notable for subcutaneous emphysema in the clavicular area. Needle decompression and chest tube placement are performed, and the patient is stabilized after receiving 2 units of blood and 2 liters of fluid. Chest radiography demonstrates proper tube location and resolution of the pneumothorax. The patient is transferred to the trauma intensive care unit. On the unit, a repeat chest radiograph is notable for a recurrent pneumothorax with the chest tube in place. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The initial needle decompression and chest tube placement were successful in resolving the initial pneumothorax. However, a repeat chest radiograph shows a recurrent pneumothorax with the chest tube in place. This suggests that the pneumothorax is not resolving on its own and may be due to a complication of the initial treatment. The key difference between options A, B, C, and D is that option A is a treatment-related complication, option B is a spontaneous condition, option C is a life-threatening condition, and option D is a more severe condition that requires surgical intervention. The patient is already intubated and receiving blood and fluid resuscitation, suggesting that the patient is hemodynamically stable, which makes option C less likely. The patient is also not showing signs of cardiac tamponade or tension pneumothorax, which makes option C less likely. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is option A, inappropriate chest tube placement, which can occur due to a variety of reasons such as misplacement of the chest tube, kinking of the tube, or failure to secure the tube properly.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Three common pathological processes may occur in the pleural cavity. If air is introduced into the pleural cavity, a pneumothorax develops and the lung collapses because of its own elastic recoil. The pleural space fills with air, which may further compress the lung. Most patients with a collapsed lung are unlikely to have respiratory impairment. Under certain conditions, air may enter the pleural cavity at such a rate that it shifts and pushes the mediastinum to the opposite side of the chest. This is called tension pneumothorax and is potentially lethal, requiring urgent treatment by insertion of an intercostal tube to remove the air.

Diagnostic and therapeutic tube thoracostomy may be indicated in unstable patients based on clinical findings and clinical suspicion. In a more stable patient, a chest radiograph may be obtained to look for evidence of hemothorax. Major retroperitoneal hem-orrhage typically occurs in association with pelvic fractures, which is confirmed by pelvic radiography in the resuscitation bay. Intraperitoneal hemorrhage is probably the most common source of blood loss that induces shock. The physical exam for detection of substantial blood loss or injury is insensitive and unreliable; large volumes of intraperitoneal blood may be present before physical examination findings are apparent. Findings with intra-abdominal hemorrhage include abdominal distension, abdominal tenderness, or visible abdominal wounds. Hemodynamic abnormalities generally stimulate a search"

Acute myocardial infarction may be the cause of a motor vehicle collision or other trauma in older patients.

Their exudative nature is usually gauged by an effusion/serum protein ratio of \u22650.5 or an effusion/serum lactate dehydrogenase ratio of \u22650.6. When the condition is symptomatic, thoracentesis is usually performed first. In most cases, symptomatic improvement occurs for <1 month. Chest tube drainage is required if symptoms recur within 2 weeks. Fluid is aspirated until the flow rate is <100 mL in 24 h. Then either 60 units of bleomycin or 1 g of doxycycline is infused into the chest tube in 50 mL of 5% dextrose in water; the tube is clamped; the patient is rotated on four sides, spending 15 min in each position; and, after 1\u20132 h, the tube is again attached to suction for another 24 h. The tube is then disconnected from suction and allowed to drain by gravity. If <100 mL drains over the next 24 h, the chest tube is pulled, and"

The neck is divided into three zones, and treatment varies according to which zone is injured (see Figure 2.17-1). Diagnostic workup is individualized based on the location of the wound, suspected injuries, and the preference of the trauma surgeon. Appropriate tests may include angiography of the aorta and carotid/cerebral arteries, CT scan of the neck with or without CT angiography, Doppler ultrasound, contrast esophagography, esophagoscopy, or bronchoscopy. Immediately evaluate trauma patients for tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, open pneumothorax, massive hemothorax, \ufb02 ail chest, and airway obstruction. FIGURE 2.17-1. Zones of the neck.
