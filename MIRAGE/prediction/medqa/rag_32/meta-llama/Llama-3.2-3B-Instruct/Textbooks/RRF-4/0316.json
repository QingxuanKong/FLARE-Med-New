During this time, she has also has had low energy and has lost interest in playing the guitar. During high school, the patient went through similar episodes of low mood and poor sleep. At that time, she would repeatedly engage in binge eating and purging behavior, for which she was referred to therapy. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Her physician offers to prescribe a medication for her current symptoms. Treatment with which of the following drugs should be avoided in this patient?",

She has a history of similar episodes in the past, including binge eating and purging behavior, which suggests a possible history of bulimia nervosa. Given this information, the key is to choose a medication that is not typically used to treat bulimia nervosa or may exacerbate the condition. Among the options provided, trazodone is a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI) that is not typically used to treat bulimia nervosa. Trazodone is often used to treat depression, insomnia, and anxiety disorders, but it can have a paradoxical effect of increasing appetite and weight gain, which may be problematic for someone with a history of bulimia nervosa. Therefore, trazodone may not be the best choice for this patient.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Extreme cases require hospitalization. If the patient refuses to eat, tube feeding is the only alternative. As weight is gained over several weeks, the patient usually becomes more normal in her attitude toward eating and will continue to recover on this regimen at home. The menses do not return until considerable weight has been gained (approximately 10 percent above the weight at the time of the menarche).

Following are techniques that decrease the discomfort of both the gynecologist and the patient and enhance the likelihood of success (19). The referral should be explained on the basis of the patient\u2019s own signs, symptoms, and level of distress. For a patient suffering from clinical depression, for example, this might be difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite, and lack of energy. For a patient with an anxiety disorder, it might be palpitations, shortness of breath, and nervousness. For a patient with mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease, it might be forgetfulness or frightening episodes in which she finds herself in a neighborhood she does not recognize. With the advent of treatments that may slow dementia, these referrals are easier and more meaningful because there is now some hope for effective intervention."

Depression is often undiagnosed, and even more frequently, it is treated inadequately. If a physician suspects the presence of a major depressive episode, the initial task is to determine whether it represents unipolar or bipolar depression or is one of the 10\u201315% of cases that are secondary to general medical illness or substance abuse. Physicians should also assess the risk of suicide by direct questioning, as patients are often reluctant to verbalize such thoughts without prompting. If specific plans are uncovered or if significant risk factors exist (e.g., a past history of suicide attempts, profound hopelessness, concurrent medical illness, substance abuse, or social isolation), the patient must be referred to a mental health specialist for immediate care. The physician should"

For days or weeks, the patients, mostly adolescent boys, sleep 18 h or more a day, awakening only long enough to eat and attend to toilet needs. They appeared dull, often confused, and restless, and were sometimes troubled by hallucinations. In the series of 11 cases collected by Critchley, the age range of onset was from late teenage years to mid-1920s, with few exceptions. There may be a brief prodromal period of inertia and drowsiness. The duration of nocturnal sleep may be greatly prolonged, or, as in our patients referred to below, they may sleep for days on end. Food intake during and around the period of hypersomnia may exceed three times the normal (bulimia) and occurs almost compulsively during brief periods of semiwakefulness; to a variable extent, there are other behavioral changes such as social withdrawal, negativism, slowness of thinking, incoherence,"

            "content": "Women attempt suicide more frequently than men, but men complete the act more frequently than women (131,132). This is probably because men use more drastic or irreversible means, such as firearms, whereas women tend to overdose, which can be treated if discovered. It might seem that someone who repeatedly makes suicidal gestures is more interested in the responses of others than in ending her life. However, past attempts or gestures increase the risk of completed suicide. Patients who made a suicide attempt should be queried about the following risk factors: the intent to die (rather than escape, sleep, or make people understand her distress); increasing numbers or doses of drugs taken in a progression of attempts; and drug or alcohol misuse, especially if it, too, is increasing. Inquiry about suicidal ideation and behavior is an inherent part of every mental status examination and is mandatory for every patient with past or current depression or evidence of self-destructive"

Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"
