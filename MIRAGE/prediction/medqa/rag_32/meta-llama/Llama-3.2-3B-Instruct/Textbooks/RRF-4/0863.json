    "question": "A 25-year-old woman presents generalized abdominal pain and vomiting for the past hour. She has also had watery diarrhea for several days with no blood or pus in the stools. She is taking an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication, which she cannot remember the name of, and drinking oral rehydration solution, which has helped a little. Her past medical history shows she was hospitalized 10 years ago for an appendectomy and 4 years ago for a fractured ulna following a motor vehicle accident. Vital signs are pulse is 104/min, blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 14/min with shallow breathing, and temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F). On physical examination, pupils are constricted. Extremities are pale and cold. The abdomen is soft but mildly, diffusely tender to palpation with a palpable bladder. No rebound or guarding. Fingerstick blood glucose is 124 mg/dL. Laboratory tests are pending. A urinary catheter is placed, and intravenous fluids are started. Abdominal imaging shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with generalized abdominal pain, vomiting, watery diarrhea, and tachycardia, which are indicative of a potential gastrointestinal emergency. The presence of constricted pupils, pale and cold extremities, and mild abdominal tenderness with a palpable bladder also suggest a systemic issue that requires immediate attention. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as shallow breathing, suggest the possibility of opioid overdose. The patient's history of recent abdominal pain and vomiting, as well as the use of an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication, which she cannot remember the name of, increases the suspicion of an opioid overdose. The patient's vital signs, such as tachycardia and shallow breathing, are also consistent with opioid overdose. The absence of rebound tenderness and guarding on physical examination makes a perforation or peritonitis less likely. The patient's pale and cold extremities and constricted pupils suggest hypoperfusion, which is consistent with opioid overdose. The presence of a palpable bladder and the patient's history of recent abdominal pain and vomiting also suggest a possible opioid-induced ileus. The patient's laboratory tests are pending, but the clinical presentation is highly suggestive of opioid overdose. Therefore, the next best step in management is to administer naloxone to reverse the opioid overdose.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The absence of bowel sounds or the presence of high-pitched localized bowel sounds points toward an ileus or intestinal obstruction. An umbilical venous hum may suggest the presence of portal hypertension, and a harsh bruit over the liver is heard rarely in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or alcoholic hepatitis. Abdominal swelling caused by intestinal gas can be differentiated from swelling caused by fluid or a solid mass by percussion; an abdomen filled with gas is tympanic, whereas an abdomen containing a mass or fluid is dull to percussion. The absence of abdominal dullness, however, does not exclude ascites, because a minimum of 1500 mL of ascitic fluid is required for detection on physical examination. Finally, the abdomen should be palpated to assess for tenderness, a mass, enlargement of the spleen or liver, or presence of a nodular"

With rupture and intra-abdominal hemorrhage, the patient develops tachycardia followed by hypotension. Bowel sounds are decreased or absent. The abdomen is distended, with marked tenderness and rebound tenderness. Cervical motion tenderness is present.

            "content": "A 69-year-old retired teacher presents with a 1-month history of palpitations, intermittent shortness of breath, and fatigue. She has a history of hypertension. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

Physical examina-tion reveals a pale woman with diminished vibration sen-sation, diminished spinal reflexes, and extensor plantar reflexes (Babinski sign). Examination of her oral cavity reveals atrophic glossitis, in which the tongue appears deep red in color and abnormally smooth and shiny due to atro-phy of the lingual papillae.

These anastomose with the superior, superficial, and deep epigastric venous systems to drain into the internal thoracic veins, which in turn drain into the brachiocephalic veins and the superior vena cava. After the initial inferior vena cava thrombosis, the veins of the anterior abdominal wall and other collateral pathways hypertrophy to accommodate the increase in blood flow. A 52-year-old woman visited her family physician with complaints of increasing lethargy and vomiting. The physician examined her and noted that compared to previous visits she had lost significant weight. She was also jaundiced, and on examination of the abdomen a well-defined 10-cm rounded mass was palpable below the liver edge in the right upper quadrant (Fig. 4.185)."

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension.

Unfortunately, the predictive value of this finding is rather low. Physical examination is critically important for discovering evidence of ulcer complication. Tachycardia and orthostasis suggest dehydration secondary to vomiting or active GI blood loss. A severely tender, board-like abdomen suggests a perforation. Presence of a succussion splash indicates retained fluid in the stomach, suggesting gastric outlet obstruction."

Although attention is often directed by the history to the diseased organ or part of the body, the examination of a new patient must extend from head to toe in an objective search for abnormalities. Unless the physical examination is systematic and is performed consistently from patient to patient, important segments may be omitted inadvertently. The results of the examination, like the details of the history, should be recorded at the time they are elicited\u2014not hours later, when they are subject to the distortions of memory. Skill in physical diagnosis is acquired with experience, but it is not merely technique that determines success in eliciting signs of disease. The detection of a few scattered petechiae, a faint diastolic murmur, or a small mass in the abdomen is not a question of keener eyes and ears or more sensitive fingers but of a mind alert to those"
