    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step. The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a firm, nontender mass close to the nipple, and the mammography shows an irregular calcified mass. The core needle biopsy shows invasive ductal carcinoma. Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer, accounting for more than 80% of cases. It is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of cells in the ducts of the breast, leading to the formation of a mass. Given the patient's age and the presence of invasive ductal carcinoma, we need to determine which gene is most likely to be overexpressed in her cancer cells. The options provided are HER2, BCR-ABL, BRCA-2, and BCL-2. HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) is a gene that is often overexpressed in breast cancer, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer. BCR-ABL is a fusion gene associated with chronic myeloid leukemia. BRCA-2 is a gene associated with hereditary breast cancer and ovarian cancer, and its mutations are more commonly found in BRCA1-positive breast cancers. BCL-2 is a gene involved in apoptosis regulation and is often overexpressed in certain types of cancer, including follicular lymphoma. Given the patient's age and the type of breast cancer, the most likely gene to be overexpressed is HER2, which is commonly found in triple-negative breast cancer, a subtype of invasive ductal carcinoma. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Breast examination by the physician should be performed in good light so as to see retractions and other skin changes. The nipple and areolae should be inspected, and an attempt should be made to elicit nipple discharge. All regional lymph node groups should be examined, and any lesions should be measured.

Primary tumors in pregnant women are 3.5 cm on average, compared to <2 cm in nonpregnant women. A dominant mass and a nipple discharge are the most common presenting signs, and they should prompt ultrasonography and breast MRI exam (if available) followed by lumpectomy if the mass is solid and aspiration if the mass is cystic.

For other tests such as Pap smears, a false-positive result occurs because the test identifies a wide range of potentially premalignant states, only a small percentage of which would ever progress to an invasive cancer. This risk is closely tied to the risk of overdiagnosis in which the screening test identifies disease that would not have presented clinically in the patient\u2019s lifetime.

With the arms extended forward and in a sitting position, the woman leans forward to accentuate any skin retraction.Figure 17-18. Examination of the breast. A.

            "content": "Lumpiness, or a diffuse nodularity throughout the breast, is usually a result of normal glandular tissue. When pronounced, imaging studies may help to determine whether a discrete mass is present. Palpable masses can arise from proliferations of stromal cells or epithelial cells and are generally detected when they are 2 to 3 cm in size ( Fig. 19.22 ). Most (~95%) are benign; these tend to be round to oval and to have circumscribed borders. In contrast, malignant tumors usually invade across tissue planes and have irregular borders. However, because some cancers grow deceptively as circumscribed masses, all palpable masses require evaluation. Gynecomastia is the only common breast symptom in males. There is an increase in both stroma and epithelial cells resulting from an imbalance between estrogens, which stimulate breast tissue, and androgens, which counteract these effects."

For example, fine-needle aspiration biopsy specimen of a breast mass can make the diagnosis of malignancy but cannot dif-ferentiate between an invasive and noninvasive tumor. There-fore core-needle biopsy specimen is more advantageous when the histologic findings will affect the recommended therapy. Core biopsy specimen, like fine-needle aspiration, is relatively safe and can be performed either by direct palpation (e.g., a breast mass or a soft tissue mass) or can be guided by an imag-ing study (e.g., stereotactic core biopsy specimen of the breast). Core biopsy specimens, like fine-needle aspirations, have the disadvantage of introducing sampling error. For example, 19% to 44% of patients with a diagnosis of atypical ductal hyperpla-sia based on core biopsy specimen findings of a mammographic abnormality are found to have carcinoma upon excision of the entire lesion.110 It is crucial to ensure that"

Patients whose biopsy results showed atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia had an approximately fivefold higher risk than women with nonproliferative disease to develop invasive breast cancer in either breast. Patients with carcinoma in situ have an eight-to tenfold risk of developing breast cancer. This risk is bilateral for lobular lesions and ipsilateral for ductal lesions. A family history of breast cancer added little risk for women with nonproliferative disease, but family history plus atypia increased breast cancer risk 11-fold. The presence of cysts alone did not increase the risk of breast cancer, but cysts combined with a family history of breast cancer increased the risk about threefold (76,92\u201397).

Most of these tumors are poorly differentiated. Mammographically, the breast shows skin thickening with an infiltrative process and may or may not show a mass or calcifications. Except for biopsy of the lesion to establish the diagnosis, surgery is not part of the initial management of in\ufb02ammatory carcinoma. Mastectomy usually fails locally within 2 years of the initial diagnosis and does not improve overall or disease-free survival rates. Better results are achieved with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Mastectomy may be indicated for patients who remain free of distant metastatic disease after initial chemotherapy and radiation (123)."

Often the imaging features of a radial scar (which can be quite similar to an invasive cancer) will dictate the need for either a vacuum-assisted biopsy or surgical excision in order to exclude the pos-sibility of carcinoma.Mild ductal hyperplasia is characterized by the presence of three or four cell layers above the basement membrane. Moder-ate ductal hyperplasia is characterized by the presence of five or more cell layers above the basement membrane. Florid duc-tal epithelial hyperplasia occupies at least 70% of a minor duct lumen. It is found in >20% of breast tissue specimens, is either solid or papillary, and is associated with an increased cancer risk (see Table 17-3). Intraductal papillomas arise in the major ducts, usually in premenopausal women. They generally are <0.5 cm in diameter but may be as large as 5 cm. A common presenting symptom is nipple discharge, which"

The vast majority of benign breast masses are due to \u201cfibrocystic\u201d disease, a descriptive term for small fluid-filled cysts and modest epithelial cell and fibrous tissue hyperplasia. However, fibrocystic disease is a histologic, not a clinical, diagnosis, and women who have had a biopsy with benign findings are at greater risk of developing breast cancer than those who have not had a biopsy. The subset of women with ductal or lobular cell proliferation (about 30% of patients), particularly the small fraction (3%) with atypical hyperplasia, have a fourfold greater risk of developing breast cancer than those women who have not had a biopsy, and the increase in the risk is about ninefold for women in this"
