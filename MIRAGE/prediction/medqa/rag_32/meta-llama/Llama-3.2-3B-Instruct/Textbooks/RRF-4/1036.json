Examination shows the right upper extremity is externally rotated and slightly abducted. There is loss of the the normal rounded appearance of the shoulder. The right humeral head is palpated below the coracoid process. Sensation to pinprick over which of the following skin areas is most likely to be reduced?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the anatomy of the shoulder joint and the innervation of the skin over the shoulder region. The shoulder joint is innervated by the suprascapular nerve, which arises from the upper trunk of the brachial plexus. The suprascapular nerve supplies the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, which are responsible for shoulder abduction and external rotation. The suprascapular nerve also provides sensation to the skin over the lateral aspect of the shoulder. Given the patient's symptoms of severe right shoulder pain and inability to move the shoulder, along with the examination findings of external rotation and abduction of the right upper extremity, we can infer that the suprascapular nerve is likely injured. The sensation to pinprick over the lateral aspect of the shoulder is most likely to be reduced in a patient with suprascapular nerve injury. This is because the suprascapular nerve provides sensory innervation to this area. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Lateral aspect of the shoulder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The pain began after a fall on his outstretched hand approximately 6 months previously. The patient recalled having some minor shoulder tenderness but no other specific symptoms. He was otherwise fit and well. On examination of the shoulder, there was marked wasting of the muscles in the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae. The patient found initiation of abduction difficult and there was a weakness of lateral rotation of the humerus. The wasted muscles were the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The cause of the muscle wasting was disuse. Muscle atrophy (wasting) occurs through a variety of disorders. Disuse atrophy is one of the most common causes. Examples of disuse atrophy include the loss of muscle bulk after fracture immobilization in a plaster cast. The opposite effect can also be demonstrated\u2014when muscles are overused they become bulkier (hypertrophy)."

The ultrasound revealed a completely torn tendon with fluid in the subacromial subdeltoid bursa (eFig. 7.128). The patient underwent a surgical repair and made a good recovery. A 35-year-old baseball pitcher came to the clinic with a history of a recurrent dislocation of the shoulder (eFig. 7.129). An MRI scan was performed to assess the shoulder joint prior to any treatment. The MRI demonstrates the anatomical structures in multiple planes, allowing the physician to obtain an overview of the shoulder and to assess any intraarticular or extraarticular structures that may have been damaged and require surgical repair."

The arc between 60\u00b0 and 120\u00b0 is especially painful. Tenderness is present over the lateral aspect of the humeral head just below the acromion.

As soft tissue struc-tures are typically damaged in these injuries, an MRI can be obtained to evaluate these structures.Relocation of the shoulder is generally accomplished with the patient in supine position and the arm under gentle traction and slight abduction. Some sedation is helpful as it relaxes the patient\u2019s musculature. Whether or not to immobilize a first-time-dislocated shoulder remains controversial, as does the position of immobilization."

Radiographs should include comparison views to assess the physis. There may be widening of the proximal humeral physis in the affected arm, but the films may be normal.

Pulmonary injuries occur in over one-third of patients. Most scapula fractures are treated nonoperatively with a sling and early range of motion. Surgery is performed when there is involve-ment of the glenoid with a major articular step-off or if there is a glenoid rim fracture with subluxation of the joint.Shoulder DislocationsThe shoulder is the most commonly dislocated large joint. Most dislocations are anterior. They are often associated with injuries to the anterior inferior glenoid labrum (Bankart lesion), impac-tion fractures of the humeral head (Hill-Sachs lesion) (Fig. 43-7), and rotator cuff tears in the elderly.

            "content": "Bicipital tendinitis, or tenosynovitis, is produced by friction on the tendon of the long head of the biceps as it passes through the bicipital groove. When the inflammation is acute, patients experience anterior shoulder pain that radiates down the biceps into the forearm. Abduction and external rotation of the arm are painful and limited. The bicipital groove is very tender to palpation. Pain may be elicited along the course of the tendon by resisting supination of the forearm with the elbow at 90\u00b0 (Yergason\u2019s supination sign). Acute rupture of the tendon may occur with vigorous exercise of the arm and is often painful. In a young patient, it should be repaired surgically. Rupture of the tendon in an older person may be associated with little or no pain and is recognized by the presence of persistent swelling of the biceps produced by the retraction of the long head of the biceps. Surgery is usually not necessary in this setting."

            "content": "For further discussion of peripheral nerve disorders, see Chap. 459. Pain arising from the shoulder can on occasion mimic pain from the spine. If symptoms and signs of radiculopathy are absent, then the differential diagnosis includes mechanical shoulder pain (tendonitis, bursitis, rotator cuff tear, dislocation, adhesive capsulitis, or rotator cuff impingement under the acromion) and referred pain (subdiaphragmatic irritation, angina, Pancoast tumor). Mechanical pain is often worse at night, associated with local shoulder tenderness and aggravated by passive abduction, internal rotation, or extension of the arm. Pain from shoulder disease may radiate into the arm or hand, but focal neurologic signs (sensory, motor, or reflex changes) are absent."

The full syndrome is characterized by pain at the trapezius ridge and tip of the shoulder, with radiation into the anterior-upper part of the arm, radial forearm, often the thumb, and sometimes the index finger as well. There may also be paresthesia and sensory impairment in the same regions; tenderness in the area above the spine of the scapula and in the supraclavicular and biceps regions; weakness in flexion of the forearm (biceps) and in contraction of the deltoid when sustaining arm abduction; and diminished or absent biceps and supinator reflexes (the triceps reflex is retained or sometimes has the appearance of being slightly exaggerated because of flaccidity of the biceps)."
