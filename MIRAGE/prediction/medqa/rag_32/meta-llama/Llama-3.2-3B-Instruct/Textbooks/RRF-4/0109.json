    "question": "A 28-year-old man comes to the physician because of diarrhea and crampy abdominal pain for 5 weeks. He has had up to 4 bowel movements per day. Several times he noticed mucoid strings with the stool. He has abdominal bloating. Over the past month, has had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss. He has not had fever, cough, or bloody stools. He had a painful rash on his lower extremity 3 weeks ago that resolved spontaneously. He works as a pharmacy technician. His temperature is 37.3\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 115/77 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft and nontender. His hemoglobin concentration is 11.9 g/dL, MCV is 79 fL, ferritin is 106 ng/dL, and platelet count is 410,000/mm3; serum concentrations of glucose, creatinine, and electrolytes are within the reference range. This patient's condition is most likely associated with which of the following findings?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. The patient presents with diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, mucoid strings with stool, abdominal bloating, and weight loss. The patient also had a painful rash on the lower extremity that resolved spontaneously. The laboratory results show a low hemoglobin concentration, elevated MCV, and normal ferritin and platelet count. The serum concentrations of glucose, creatinine, and electrolytes are within the reference range. Given these symptoms and laboratory results, we can consider several potential diagnoses, including inflammatory bowel disease, infectious enteritis, and VIPoma. However, the presence of mucoid strings with stool and the resolution of the rash are particularly suggestive of VIPoma, a rare tumor that secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). The elevated MCV and low hemoglobin concentration are also consistent with VIPoma, as VIP can cause bone marrow suppression. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Increased serum VIP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

He is then switched to celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily, and on this regimen his joint symptoms and heartburn resolve. Two years later, he returns with increased joint symptoms. His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor. With the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, he is started on a regimen"

            "content": "The physical examination may point to the potential causes (see Table 150-2). The physiologic stability of the patient may be abnormal with acute blood loss and acute hemolysis, manifesting as tachycardia, blood pressure changes, and, most ominously, an altered state of consciousness. The presence of jaundice suggests hemolysis. Petechiae and purpura indicate a coagulopathy. Hepatosplenomegaly and adenopathy suggest infiltrative disorders. Growth failure or poor weight gain suggests an anemia of chronic disease. An essential element of the physical examination is the investigation of the stool for the presence of occult blood."

            "content": "Diarrhea is the most common manifestation caused by C. difficile. Stools are almost never grossly bloody and range from soft and unformed to watery or mucoid in consistency, with a characteristic odor. Patients may have as many as 20 bowel movements per day. Clinical and laboratory findings include fever in 28% of cases, abdomi-859 nal pain in 22%, and leukocytosis in 50%. When adynamic ileus (which is seen on x-ray in ~20% of cases) results in cessation of stool passage, the diagnosis of CDI is frequently overlooked. A clue to the presence of unsuspected CDI in these patients is unexplained leukocytosis, with \u226515,000 white blood cells (WBCs)/\u03bcL. Such patients are at high risk for complications of C. difficile infection, particularly toxic megacolon and sepsis."

Symptoms started about 4 years ago and have slowly progressed to the point that he is disabled. He has fainted several times but always recovers conscious-ness almost as soon as he falls. Review of symptoms reveals slight worsening of constipation, urinary retention out of proportion to prostate size, and decreased sweating. He is otherwise healthy with no history of hypertension, diabetes, or Parkinson\u2019s disease. Because of urinary retention, he was placed on the \u03b11 antagonist tamsulosin, but the fainting spells got worse. Physical examination revealed a blood pres-sure of 167/84 mm Hg supine and 106/55 mm Hg standing. There was an inadequate compensatory increase in heart rate (from 84 to 88 bpm), considering the degree of ortho-static hypotension. Physical examination is otherwise unre-markable with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or parkinsonian"

Case 4: Hypoglycemia, Hyperketonemia, and Liver Dysfunction Patient Presentation: AK, a 59-year-old male with slurred speech, ataxia (loss of skeletal muscle coordination), and abdominal pain, was dropped off at the Emergency Department (ED). Focused History: AK is known to the ED staff from previous visits. He has a 6year history of chronic, excessive alcohol consumption. He is not known to take illicit drugs. At this ED visit, AK reports that he has been drinking heavily in the past day or so. He cannot recall having eaten anything in that time. There is evidence of recent vomiting, but no blood is apparent."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."

Focused History: LT is a widower and lives alone in a suburban community on the East Coast. He no longer drives. His two children live on the West Coast and come east infrequently. Since the death of his wife 11 months ago, he has been isolated and finds it hard to get out of the house. His appetite has changed, and he is content with cereal, coffee, and packaged snacks. Chewing is difficult."
