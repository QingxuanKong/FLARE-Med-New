    "question": "A 27-year-old female is brought to the emergency department by police when she attacked her date outside of a pizza restaurant. The patient refused to explain her behavior to the police. She seemed to be responding to internal stimuli when being initially interviewed. The patient has a past medical history of depression, anxiety, and obesity. The patient has a known history of medication non-compliance. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam the patient is poorly kempt and has an odd body odor. Inspection of her oropharynx reveals multiple ulcers. Cardiac exam is unrevealing with the exception of a friction rub. Since the incident, the patient has calmed down and is currently resting. She is no longer responding to internal stimuli and is more cooperative. Lab values are obtained and are below.\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 135 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 3.9 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 70 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.7 mg/dL\nCa2+: 10.0 mg/dL\nMg2+: 1.5 mEq/L\n\nHemoglobin: 10 g/dL\nHematocrit: 35%\nReticulocyte count: 4.9%\nPlatelet count: 275,000/mm^3\nLeukocyte count: 5,500/mm^3\n\nWhich of the following is the next best step in management for this patient's underlying condition?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of violence, such as attacking her date outside of a pizza restaurant, and has a history of depression, anxiety, and medication non-compliance. The physical exam reveals multiple ulcers in the oropharynx, which may indicate a psychiatric condition such as psychosis or a substance-induced condition. The lab values show a low hemoglobin level, low reticulocyte count, and a platelet count within the normal range, which may indicate a bleeding tendency or a condition that affects the bone marrow. The patient is also showing signs of agitation and poor cooperation, which may indicate a psychiatric condition. Given the combination of psychiatric symptoms, the presence of ulcers, and the patient's history of depression and anxiety, the underlying condition that needs to be addressed is likely a psychiatric condition such as psychosis or a substance-induced condition. The patient's symptoms of violence and agitation also suggest a need for immediate intervention to ensure the patient's safety. The next best step in management would be to order a urine toxicology screen to determine if the patient has ingested any substances that may be contributing to her behavior and to identify any potential overdose or poisoning. This would allow for prompt treatment and stabilization of the patient's condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

Assessment of the patient\u2019s general appearance and vital signs, skin and soft tissue examination, and the neurologic evaluation are of particular importance. The patient may appear either anxious and agitated or lethargic and apathetic. Fever is usually present, although elderly patients and compromised hosts (e.g., patients who are uremic or cirrhotic and those who are taking glucocorticoids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be afebrile despite serious underlying infection. Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate helps determine the degree of hemodynamic and metabolic compromise.

Past medical history was notable for small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, liver, and adrenals. The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced. Blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, increasing to 160/98 mmHg after 1 L of saline, with a JVP at 8 cm. There was generalized muscle weakness.

She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."

Although attention is often directed by the history to the diseased organ or part of the body, the examination of a new patient must extend from head to toe in an objective search for abnormalities. Unless the physical examination is systematic and is performed consistently from patient to patient, important segments may be omitted inadvertently. The results of the examination, like the details of the history, should be recorded at the time they are elicited\u2014not hours later, when they are subject to the distortions of memory. Skill in physical diagnosis is acquired with experience, but it is not merely technique that determines success in eliciting signs of disease. The detection of a few scattered petechiae, a faint diastolic murmur, or a small mass in the abdomen is not a question of keener eyes and ears or more sensitive fingers but of a mind alert to those"
