    "question": "A 16-year-old female patient with a history of mental retardation presents to your clinic with her mother. The mother states that she wants her daughter to have a bilateral tubal ligation after she recently discovered her looking at pornographic materials. She states that her daughter is not capable of understanding the repercussions of sexual intercourse, and that she does not want her to be burdened with a child that she would not be able to raise. Upon discussions with the patient, it is clear that she is not able to understand that sexual intercourse can lead to pregnancy. What should your next step be?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Schedule the patient for the requested surgery",
        "B": "Wait until the patient is 18 years old, and then schedule for surgery",
        "C": "Refuse the procedure because it violates the ethical principle of autonomy",
        "D": "Refuse the procedure because it is unlikely that the patient will get pregnant"
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: ```json { \"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The key issue here is the patient's mental retardation and the mother's desire to perform a bilateral tubal ligation without the patient's understanding or consent. The patient's inability to understand the repercussions of sexual intercourse and the potential for pregnancy is a concern. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that minors have the right to confidentiality and informed consent for medical procedures, including contraception and sterilization. However, the law varies by state, and some states allow minors to consent to sterilization with parental consent or court approval. In this case, the patient's mental retardation raises concerns about her ability to provide informed consent. The mother's statement that the patient is not capable of understanding the repercussions of sexual intercourse is not a valid reason to deny the patient's autonomy and the right to make her own decisions about her body. Therefore, the next step should be to refuse the procedure and involve the patient in the decision-making process, or to seek court approval if necessary.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\" } ``` The correct answer is C. Refuse the procedure because it violates the ethical principle of autonomy. This is because the patient's mental retardation raises concerns about her ability to provide informed consent, and the mother's statement that the patient is not capable of understanding the repercussions of sexual intercourse is not a valid reason to deny the patient's autonomy and the right to make her own decisions about her body.",

            "content": "The medical history, surgical history, family history, and review of systems should focus on uncovering potential systemic and obstructive disorders shown in Table 28.1. A complete obstetric history should include the number of vaginal deliveries, operative vaginal deliveries, or presence of a third-or fourth-degree laceration, which is critical for patients with fecal incontinence. Length of the second stage of labor, birth weight, and the use of episiotomy should be ascertained because they may pose risk factors for sphincter damage and denervation. The sexual history should include questions about rape, anal intercourse, and dyspareunia. Use of over-the-counter, prescription, and illegal drugs should be recorded as well as food allergies."

The patient\u2019s sexual history, relationships, and practices should be understood, and her functional level of satisfaction in these areas should be determined. The physician should avoid being judgmental, particularly with respect to questions about sexual practices and sexual orientation (see Chapter 11)."
