His family has noticed progressive confusion. History is significant for liver cirrhosis and alcoholism. His heart rate is 112/min, temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.7\u00b0F), and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. On examination, he is jaundiced, lethargic, is oriented to person and place but not date, and has moderate ascites. Neurological examination reveals asterixis, and his stool is guaiac-positive. Liver function test are shown below:\nTotal albumin 2 g/dL\nProthrombin time 9 seconds\nTotal bilirubin 5 mg/dL\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) 100 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase (AST) 220 U/L\nWhich of the following is a feature of this patient condition?",

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "To solve this question, let's break down the key points from the patient's presentation and the provided options: 1. **Patient's Presentation**: - Black, tarry stools - Denies vomiting of blood or abdominal pain - History of liver cirrhosis and alcoholism - Jaundiced, lethargic, and has moderate ascites - Neurological examination reveals asterixis - Liver function tests show elevated AST and ALT, with a prolonged prothrombin time 2. **Understanding the Condition**: - The patient's presentation suggests hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver disease characterized by cognitive disturbances ranging from mild confusion to coma. Asterixis (a flapping tremor) is a hallmark sign. - The presence of black, tarry stools (melena) and elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) supports this diagnosis, as these are indicative of liver dysfunction. - The patient's history of liver cirrhosis and alcoholism further supports this diagnosis, as these conditions are risk factors for hepatic encephalopathy. 3. **Analyzing the Options**: - **A. Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis**: While ammonia levels can be elevated in hepatic encephalopathy, they are not the best initial test for confirming the diagnosis. Ammonia levels are more useful in assessing the severity of encephalopathy. - **B. It is a diagnosis of exclusion**: This is accurate. Hepatic encephalopathy is often diagnosed by exclusion of other causes of altered mental status. - **C. It only occurs in patients with cirrhosis**: This is not entirely accurate. While cirrhosis is a common underlying condition for hepatic encephalopathy, it can occur in other liver diseases as well. - **D. EEG usually shows focal localising abnormality**: This is incorrect. Hepatic encephalopathy typically shows diffuse patterns on EEG, not focal localising abnormalities. **Conclusion**: The best answer is **B**. It is a diagnosis of exclusion. Hepatic encephalopathy is often diagnosed by excluding other causes of altered mental status and by demonstrating the characteristic clinical and laboratory findings of liver dysfunction and the specific signs of hepatic encephalopathy. **Step-by-Step Thinking Summary**: - Patient's presentation and history suggest liver disease and hepatic encephalopathy. - The presence of black, tarry stools, elevated liver enzymes, and asthenia supports this diagnosis. - Understanding the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy and its association with liver disease helps in making this diagnosis. - Reviewing the options and considering the pathophysiology and clinical presentation leads to the conclusion that hepatic encephalopathy is diagnosed by exclusion of other causes of altered mental status.",

In alcoholic hepatitis and in contrast to other causes of fatty liver, AST and ALT are usually elevated twoto sevenfold. They are rarely >400 IU, and the AST/ALT ratio is >1 (Table 363-2). Hyperbilirubinemia is accompanied by modest increases in the alkaline phosphatase level. Derangement in hepatocyte synthetic function indicates more serious disease.

If so, is the bilirubin elevation due to an increased unconjugated or conjugated fraction? If the hyperbilirubinemia is accompanied by other liver test abnormalities, is the disorder hepatocellular or cholestatic? If cholestatic, is it intraor extrahepatic? All of these questions can be answered with a thoughtful history, physical examination, and interpretation of laboratory and radiologic tests and procedures."

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?"

Direct-reacting bilirubin (composed mostly of conjugated bilirubin) is not neurotoxic to the infant but signifies a serious underlying disorder involving cholestasis or hepatocellular injury. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with direct-reacting hyperbilirubinemia involves the determination of the levels of liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase), bacterial and viral cultures, metabolic screening tests, hepatic ultrasound, sweat chloride test, and occasionally liver biopsy. In addition, the presence of dark urine and gray-white (acholic) stools with jaundice after the second week of life strongly suggests biliary atresia. The treatment of disorders manifested by direct"

            "content": "In patients with cirrhosis, encephalopathy is often found as a result of certain precipitating events such as hypokalemia, infection, an increased dietary protein load, or electrolyte disturbances. Patients may be confused or exhibit a change in personality. They may actually be quite violent and difficult to manage; alternatively, patients may be very sleepy and difficult to rouse. Because precipitating events are so commonly found, they should be sought carefully. If patients have ascites, this should be tapped to rule out infection. Evidence of GI bleeding should be sought, and patients should be appropriately hydrated. Electrolytes should be measured and abnormalities corrected. In patients presenting with encephalopathy, asterixis is often present. Asterixis can be elicited by having patients extend their arms and bend their wrists back. In this maneuver, patients who are encephalopathic have a \u201cliver flap\u201d\u2014i.e., a sudden forward movement of the wrist. This requires patients to"

The patient had noted progressive weakness over several days, to the point that he was unable to rise from bed. Past medical history was notable for small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, liver, and adrenals. The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation.

The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"
