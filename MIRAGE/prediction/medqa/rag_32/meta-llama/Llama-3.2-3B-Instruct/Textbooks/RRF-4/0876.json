    "question": "A 42-year-old woman with a history of depression and headaches presents to the emergency room with severe, pulsating pain around the crown of her head beginning 12 hours ago. She last took ibuprofen 2 hours ago but did not feel any improvement in the pain. She has been nauseous and unable to get out of bed and is currently laying in the dark with the lights off. Her depression has improved, and she has stopped taking her sertraline 2 months ago. Other than ibuprofen as needed, she is not currently taking any additional medications. Which of the following would be the best treatment for her acute symptoms?",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with severe, pulsating pain around the crown of her head, which began 12 hours ago, and has not improved with ibuprofen. This symptomatology is suggestive of a migraine headache, specifically a cluster headache. The patient's history of depression and recent stop of sertraline may be relevant, but it does not directly impact the treatment of the acute migraine headache. The options for treating cluster headaches include 100% oxygen, which is a first-line treatment, and sumatriptan, which is also effective. Propranolol is a preventive treatment for migraines, not acute treatment. Therefore, the best answer is either B or D. However, given the severity and recent onset of the headache, 100% oxygen is generally considered the first-line treatment for acute cluster headaches. Sumatriptan can also be effective but may have a longer onset of action. Therefore, the best answer is B. 100% oxygen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The special case of chronic headache, confronted often by neurologists, is discussed below and in Chap. 9. In some patients with chronic pain, the symptoms and signs of depression are quite apparent. If the pain has been present for less than 1 year and had its onset at the same time as other depressive symptoms, response to antidepressant treatment is likely to be favorable. Far more difficult to understand, and to manage, are patients with persistent pain as the only complaint; the head, face, and lower back are the most common loci.

Chrousos, MD A 25-year-old woman with menarche at 13 years and menstrual periods until about 1 year ago complains of hot flushes, skin and vaginal dryness, weakness, poor sleep, and scanty and infrequent menstrual periods of a year\u2019s dura-tion. She visits her gynecologist, who obtains plasma levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, both of which are moderately elevated. She is diagnosed with premature ovarian failure, and estrogen and pro-gesterone replacement therapy is recommended. A dual-energy absorptiometry scan (DEXA) reveals a bone density t-score of <2.5 SD, ie, frank osteoporosis. How should the ovarian hormones she lacks be replaced? What extra mea-sures should she take for her osteoporosis while receiving treatment? \u25a0 THE OVARY (ESTROGENS, PROGESTINS, OTHER OVARIAN HORMONES, ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES, INHIBITORS & ANTAGONISTS, & OVULATIONINDUCING AGENTS)"

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

            "content": "Patients reacting to a medical or neurologic illness seldom express feelings of sadness or despair without mentioning physical accompaniments such as easy fatigability, anxiety, headaches, dizziness, loss of appetite, reduced interest in life and love, trouble in falling asleep, or premature awakening. It follows that whenever these symptoms become manifest in the course of medical disease, they should arouse suspicion of a depressive reaction (Table 48-1). Chronic pain is a frequent somatic manifestation of depression. The pain may be based on an attendant disease but is prolonged, disabling, sometimes vague in nature, and recalcitrant to straightforward medical and surgical approaches. Furthermore, depressed mood exacerbates and prolongs pain of any type. All patients with chronic pain syndromes should be evaluated psychiatrically, as pointed out in Chap. 7."

            "content": "The principal complication of LP is headache, occurring in 10\u201330% of patients. Younger age and female gender are associated with an increased risk of post-LP headache. Headache usually begins within 48 h but may be delayed for up to 12 days. Head pain is dramatically positional; it begins when the patient sits or stands upright; there is relief upon reclining or with abdominal compression. The longer the patient is upright, the longer the latency before head pain subsides. The pain is usually a dull ache but may be throbbing; its location is occipitofrontal. Nausea and stiff neck often accompany headache, and occasionally, patients report blurred vision, photophobia, tinnitus, and vertigo. In more than three-quarters of patients, symptoms completely resolve within a week, but in a minority they can persist for weeks or even months."

Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of \u201closs of vision.\u201d Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver\u2019s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

The patient is preoccupied with them and makes behavioral changes she hopes will avert future attacks: avoiding specific situations, assuring herself there is an escape route from certain situations, or refusing to be alone. The symptoms of panic attacks are often confused with the symptoms of cardiac or pulmonary disease. They lead to many fruitless trips to the emergency department and to costly, even invasive, medical investigations. A careful history can establish the correct diagnosis in most cases (153\u2013155)."
