    "question": "A 69-year-old gentleman presents to his primary care physician for pain in his right shoulder. The patient was helping his son move this past weekend, and he noticed after the move that he had pain and weakness in his right shoulder. The patient thought that this pain was just him being in poor shape so he started going to the gym and lifting weights which made his symptoms significantly worse. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, obesity, and asthma. His current medications include albuterol, lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide. On physical exam you note an obese gentleman who seems to be in pain. You note prominent weakness of external rotation of his right upper extremity. When you ask the patient to slowly lower his right arm to his side when he holds it overhead, you note that he suddenly drops his arm and appears to be in pain. The patient's strength is 1/5 for abduction of the right arm. Which of the following is most likely injured in this patient?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely injured muscle, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and examination findings. The patient presents with pain and weakness in his right shoulder, which worsens with weightlifting. This suggests a musculoskeletal issue. The patient has a history of diabetes, obesity, and asthma, but these conditions are not directly related to shoulder pain. The patient's physical examination reveals prominent weakness of external rotation of his right upper extremity, and he is unable to lower his arm to his side when holding it overhead, resulting in sudden pain and a 1/5 strength for abduction of the right arm. These findings are classic for a specific rotator cuff injury. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. The supraspinatus muscle is responsible for abduction of the arm, especially in the first 15 degrees of movement, and is often injured in cases of repetitive overhead activities. The infraspinatus muscle is involved in external rotation of the arm. The teres minor muscle assists in external rotation and adduction of the arm. The subscapularis muscle helps in internal rotation of the arm. Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most likely injured muscle is the supraspinatus, as it is responsible for the abduction of the arm and is often injured in cases of repetitive overhead activities. The patient's weakness in external rotation could be due to the infraspinatus or teres minor muscles, but the primary complaint of weakness in abduction points towards the supraspinatus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

The pain began after a fall on his outstretched hand approximately 6 months previously. The patient recalled having some minor shoulder tenderness but no other specific symptoms. He was otherwise fit and well. On examination of the shoulder, there was marked wasting of the muscles in the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae. The patient found initiation of abduction difficult and there was a weakness of lateral rotation of the humerus. The wasted muscles were the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The cause of the muscle wasting was disuse. Muscle atrophy (wasting) occurs through a variety of disorders. Disuse atrophy is one of the most common causes. Examples of disuse atrophy include the loss of muscle bulk after fracture immobilization in a plaster cast. The opposite effect can also be demonstrated\u2014when muscles are overused they become bulkier (hypertrophy)."

The areas of pain correspond to dermatomes L4 to S3 nerves. Over the following weeks, the patient began to develop muscular weakness, predominantly footdrop. These findings are consistent with loss of the motor function and sensory change in the common fibular nerve, which is a branch of the sciatic nerve in the lower limb.

In addition, the patient should be questioned as to the activities or movement(s) that elicit shoulder pain. While arthritis is suggested by pain on movement in all planes, pain with specific active motion suggests a periarticular (nonarticular) process. Shoulder pain may originateintheglenohumeral oracromioclavicularjoints,subacromial (subdeltoid) bursa, periarticular soft tissues (e.g., fibromyalgia, rotator cuff tear/tendinitis), or cervical spine (Fig. 393-4). Shoulder pain is referred frequently from the cervical spine but may also be referred from intrathoracic lesions (e.g., a Pancoast tumor) or from gallbladder, hepatic, or diaphragmatic disease. These same visceral causes may also manifest as focal scapular pain. Fibromyalgia should be suspected"

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

He saw his PCP for evaluation of low back pain. X-rays of the spine showed some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine plus several wedge deformities in the thoracic spine. The patient is a long-time smoker (up to two packs per day) and has two to four glasses of wine with dinner, more on the weekends. He has chronic bronchitis, presumably from smoking, and has been treated on numerous occasions with oral prednisone for exacerba-tions of bronchitis. He is currently on 10 mg/d prednisone. Examination shows kyphosis of the thoracic spine, with some tenderness to fist percussion over the thoracic spine. The dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measure-ment of the lumbar spine is \u201cwithin the normal limits,\u201d but the radiologist noted that the reading may be misleading because of degenerative changes. The hip measurement shows a T score (number of standard"

A 50-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with severe lower back pain that had started several days ago. In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."

Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

At the time of surgery, the initial dissection mobilized the kidney on its vascular pedicle; however, a large portion of tumor became detached in the inferior vena cava. The tumor embolus passed through the right atrium and right ventricle and occluded the pulmonary artery. This could not be cleared at the time of surgery, and the patient succumbed. A 65-year-old businessman came to the emergency department with severe lower abdominal pain that was predominantly central and left sided. He had pain radiating into the left loin, and he also noticed he was passing gas and fecal debris as he urinated. A CT scan of his abdomen and pelvis was performed (eFig. 4.191)."
