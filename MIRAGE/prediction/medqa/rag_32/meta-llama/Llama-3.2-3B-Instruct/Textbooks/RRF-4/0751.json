The patient also has physical characteristics such as low-set ears and retrognathia, which are commonly associated with Potter syndrome, a condition caused by bilateral renal agenesis (absence of one or both kidneys) in the fetus. This condition leads to oligohydramnios (decreased amniotic fluid), which in turn causes the lungs to underdevelop and leading to pulmonary hypoplasia. The physical characteristics of low-set ears and retrognathia are also consistent with Potter syndrome. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is Potter syndrome, which is associated with bilateral renal agenesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Four questions a neonatal provider will ask pertain to expected gestional age, amnionic fluid color, fetal number, and additional fetal risks. Several conditions are associated with a nonvigorous presentation. These may include immaturity, hypoxemia or acidosis from any cause, sepsis syndrome, recent drugs administered to the mother, and central nervous system developmental abnormalities. Those related to the respiratory tract are lung abnormalities, upper airway obstruction, pneumothorax, and meconium aspiration."

Oligohydramnios (amniotic ultrasound fluid index \u22642 cm) is associated with IUGR and major congenital anomalies, particularly of the fetal kidneys, and with chromosomal syndromes. Bilateral renal agenesis results in diminished production of amniotic fluid and a specific deformation syndrome (Potter syndrome), which includes clubfeet, characteristic compressed facies, low-set ears, scaphoid abdomen, and diminished chest wall size accompanied by pulmonary hypoplasia and, often, pneumothorax. Uterine compression in the absence of amniotic fluid retards lung growth, and patients with this condition die of respiratory failure rather than renal insufficiency. Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (donor) and complications from amniotic fluid leakage also are associated with oligohydramnios. Oligohydramnios increases the risk of fetal distress"

Alveoli must be free from foreign material, such as meconium, amniotic fluid debris, and infectious exudates, which increases airway resistance, reduces lung compliance, and leads to respiratory distress and hypoxia.

First, the air-filled bowel in the chest compresses the mobile mediastinum, which shifts to the opposite side of the chest, compromising air exchange in the contralateral lung. Second, pulmonary hypertension develops. This phenomenon results in persistent fetal circulation with resultant decreased pulmonary perfusion and impaired gas exchange. Finally, the lung on the affected side is often hypoplastic, such that it is essentially nonfunctional. Varying degrees of pulmonary hypo-plasia on the opposite side may compound these effects. The second and third factors are thought to be the most important.

If fetal lung maturity is conirmed, salvage of both the healthy fetus and its jeopardized sibling is possible. Unfortunately, ideal management if twins are immature is problematic but should be based on the chances of intact survival for both fetuses. Often the compromised fetus is severely growth restricted or anomalous.

Pretreat mothers at risk for preterm delivery (< 30 weeks\u2019 gestation) with corticosteroids; if > 30 weeks, monitor fetal lung maturity via a lecithin-to-sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio and the presence of phosphatidylglycerol in amniotic \ufb02 uid. Persistent PDA, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, barotrauma from positive pressure ventilation, intraventricular hemorrhage, and NEC are complications of treatment."

The observed LHR may be expressed as a percentage of the expected mean for ges-tational age of the observed/expected lung-to-head ratio (o/e LHR), which is considered extreme if <15%, severe at 15% to 25%, moderate at 26% to 35%, and mild at 36% to 45%. The most reliable prenatal predictor of postnatal survival is absence of liver herniation, where in 710 fetuses, there was significantly higher survival rate in fetuses without herniation (74% without herniation vs. 45% with herniation).Following delivery, the diagnosis of CDH is made by CXR (Fig. 39-3). The differential diagnosis includes broncho-pulmonary foregut malformations, in which the intrathoracic loops of bowel may be confused for lung or foregut pathol-ogy. The vast majority of infants with CDH develop immedi-ate respiratory distress, which is due to the combined effects of three factors. First, the air-filled bowel in the chest compresses the mobile"

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

In addition, low-birthweight newborns are at higher risk for motor and other neurological disabilities. Risk is greatest at the lowest extremes of birth weight (Baschat, 2009, 2014; Llurba, 2013)."

Almost all infants born to mothers with myasthenia have maternal anti-AChR antibodies. Signs include ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, weak facial movements, poor feeding, hypotonia, respiratory difficulty, and variable extremity weakness. Neonates with transient myasthenia gravis require cholinesterase inhibitors and supportive care for a few days to weeks until the weakness remits."
