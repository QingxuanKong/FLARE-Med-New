    "question": "A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of nausea for the last two weeks. During this period, she has had increased urinary frequency and fatigue. She also reports two episodes of non-bloody vomiting. There is no personal history of serious illness. Her last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago. Physical examination shows bilateral breast tenderness. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is positive. Which of the following is the most accurate predictor of the gestational age?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most accurate predictor of gestational age in a pregnant woman, we need to consider the options provided. The question mentions that the patient is 6 weeks pregnant and has had increased urinary frequency and fatigue, which are common symptoms during early pregnancy. The positive pregnancy test confirms this. In early pregnancy, precise knowledge of gestational age is crucial for optimal treatment and management of potential complications. Several methods can be used to estimate gestational age, including ultrasound measurements and clinical assessment. The options provided are all ultrasound measurements that can be used to estimate gestational age. - A: The ratio of head to abdominal circumference is not a commonly used measurement for estimating gestational age. - B: Femoral length is a measurement that can be used to estimate gestational age, but it is not the most accurate. - C: Crown-rump length (CRL) is a commonly used measurement for estimating gestational age in early pregnancy. It is the distance from the top of the head to the buttocks and is typically measured between 5-14 weeks of gestation. - D: Biparietal length (BPL) is another measurement used to estimate gestational age, measuring the distance between the two sides of the fetal head. It is typically used between 10-20 weeks of gestation. Given the patient's gestational age of 6 weeks, the most accurate predictor of gestational age would be C: Crown-rump length (CRL). This is because CRL is typically used to estimate gestational age between 5-14 weeks of gestation, which aligns with the patient's estimated gestational age.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

These vary in severity and usually commence between the first and second missed menstrual period and continue until 14 to 16 weeks' gestation. Although nausea and vomiting tend to be worse in the morning-thus erroneously termed morning sickness-both symptoms frequently continue throughout the day. Lacroix and coworkers (2000) found that nausea and vomiting were reported by three fourths of pregnant women and lasted an average of35 days. Halfhad reliefby 14 weeks, and 90 percent by 22 weeks. In 80 percent of these women, nausea lasted all day."

The ages defining primary amenorrhea were decreased by 1 year to continue to represent two standard deviations above the mean age of developing secondary sexual characteristics and menses (1). Failure to begin breast development by age 13 warrants investigation. A woman who previously menstruated can develop secondary amenorrhea, which is defined as absence of menstruation for three normal menstrual cycles (2).

That said, gestational age can also be estimated with considerable precision by carefully performed clinical uterine size examination that is coupled with knowledge of the last menses. Uterine size similar to a small orange roughly correlates with a 6-week gestation; a large orange, with an 8-week pregnancy; and a grapefruit, with one at 12 weeks (Margulies, 2001)."

Some of these patients can vomit at will, regurgitating food from the stomach like a ruminant animal. Vomiting may persist for weeks with no cause being found. Weight loss may occur, but seldom to the degree anticipated. As remarked earlier, the usual first-trimester vomiting of pregnancy may continue throughout the entire 9 months, and occasionally pregnancy will be interrupted because of it. Anorexia may be a prominent associated symptom and must be differentiated from anorexia nervosa\u2013bulimia, another closely related disease of young women. Factitious elf-induced vomiting is more aligned with malingering, with which hysteria may be allied."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy.

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

            "content": "On physical examination, the findings of a palpable tender sigmoid colon or discomfort during insertion of the finger into the rectum and hard feces in the rectum are suggestive of IBS. The diagnosis of IBS is usually based on history and physical examination, and although suggestive, especially in young women, the findings are not specific. A CBC, thyroid function study, stool sample to test for white cells and occult blood, and sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy or barium enema are usually required, particularly in older individuals and in young individuals who have not responded to initial treatment. The results of these studies are all normal in patients with IBS."

            "content": "The pain of primary dysmenorrhea usually begins a few hours before or just after the onset of a menstrual period and may last 48 to 72 hours. The pain is similar to labor, with suprapubic cramping, and may be accompanied by lumbosacral backache, pain radiating down the anterior thigh, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and rarely syncopal episodes. The pain of dysmenorrhea is colicky in nature and, unlike abdominal pain that is caused by chemical or infectious peritonitis, is relieved by abdominal massage, counter-pressure, or movement of the body. On examination, the vital signs are normal. The suprapubic region may be tender to palpation. Bowel sounds are normal, and there is no upper abdominal tenderness and no abdominal rebound tenderness. Bimanual examination at the time of the dysmenorrheic episode often reveals uterine tenderness; severe pain does not occur with movement of the cervix or palpation of the adnexal structures. The pelvic organs are normal in primary dysmenorrhea."

Some women experience mittelschmerz, described as midcycle pelvic discomfort that is thought to be caused by the rapid expansion of the dominant follicle at the time of ovulation. A constellation of premenstrual moliminal symptoms such as bloating, breast tenderness, and food cravings often occur several days before menses in ovulatory cycles, but their absence cannot be used as evidence of anovulation. Methods that can be used to determine whether ovulation is likely include a serum progesterone level >5 ng/mL ~7 days before expected menses, an increase in basal body temperature of 0.24\u00b0C (>0.5\u00b0F) in the second half of the cycle due to the thermoregulatory effect of progesterone, or the detection of the urinary LH surge using ovulation predictor kits. Because ovulation occurs ~36 h after"
