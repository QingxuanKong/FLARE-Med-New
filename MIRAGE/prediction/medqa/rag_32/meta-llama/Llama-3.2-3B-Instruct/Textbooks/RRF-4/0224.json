    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question requires identifying the manner in which the causal virus spreads to the central nervous system (CNS) in the given scenario. The patient's history of flu-like symptoms and exposure to Mexico, where he went spelunking, suggests a viral infection. The patient's symptoms of acute agitation, photophobia, and dysphagia, followed by coma and death, are consistent with encephalitis. The autopsy suggests a viral infection. The key to answering this question lies in understanding the characteristics of the viruses that are commonly associated with encephalitis and the manner in which they spread to the CNS. The correct answer can be deduced by analyzing the patient's symptoms, history, and the characteristics of the viruses that are known to cause encephalitis. The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with a viral infection that spreads to the CNS through retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons. This is a common route of entry for certain viruses, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), which can reactivate from latent infections in dorsal root ganglia and spread to the CNS. The other options are less likely, as hematogenous dissemination to the meninges is more typical of bacterial infections, infection of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes is not a well-established mechanism of viral encephalitis, and retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons is a characteristic of HSV infection. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

However, most adults with HSV encephalitis have clinical or serologic evidence of mucocutaneous HSV-1 infection before the onset of CNS symptoms. In ~25% of the cases examined, the HSV-1 strains from the oropharynx and brain tissue of the same patient differ; thus some cases may result from reinfection with another strain of HSV-1 that reaches the CNS. Two theories have been proposed to explain the development of actively replicating HSV in localized areas of the CNS in persons whose ganglionic and CNS isolates are similar.

            "content": "The main neurologic symptoms, following a 2to 4-day prodromal period of fever, headache, and malaise consist of apprehension, dysarthria, and psychomotor overactivity, followed by dysphagia (hence salivation and \u201cfrothing at the mouth\u201d), spasms of throat muscles induced by attempts to swallow water or in rare cases by the mere sight of water (\u201chydrophobia\u201d), dysarthria, numbness of the face, diplopia, and spasms of facial muscles. These features indicate the involvement of the tegmental medullary nuclei. Generalized seizures, confusional psychosis, and a state of agitation may follow. A less common paralytic form (\u201cdumb\u201d rabies of older writings, in distinction to the above described \u201crabid\u201d form) as a result of spinal cord infection may accompany or replace the state of excitement. The paralytic form is most likely to follow bat bites or, in the past, the administration of rabies vaccination. Coma gradually follows the acute encephalitic symptoms and, with rare exceptions as noted"

In such cases, the basal ganglia are affected more than the cerebral cortex and white matter as in the case studied by our colleagues Dooling and Richardson. Instances have followed cardiac arrest, drowning, asphyxiation, and carbon monoxide poisoning."

            "content": "Documented CSF pleocytosis indicates that mumps virus invades the CNS in ~50% of cases; however, symptomatic CNS disease, typically in the form of aseptic meningitis, occurs in <10% of cases, with a male predominance. CNS symptoms of aseptic meningitis (e.g., stiff neck, headache, and drowsiness) appear ~5 days after parotitis and also occur often in the absence of parotid involvement. Within the first 24 h polymorphonuclear leukocytes may predominate in CSF (1000\u20132000 cells/\u03bcL), but by the second day nearly all the cells are lymphocytes. The glucose level in CSF may be low and the protein concentration high, a pattern reminiscent of bacterial meningitis. Mumps meningitis is a self-limited manifestation without significant risk of death or long-term sequelae. Cranial nerve palsies have occasionally led to permanent sequelae, particularly deafness. The reported incidence of mumps-associated hearing loss varies between 1 in 1000 and 1 in 100,000. In ~0.1% of infections, mumps virus may"

HSV encephalitis should always be suspected in patients with signs and symptoms consistent with acute encephalitis with focal findings on clinical examination, neuroimaging studies, or EEG. The diagnostic procedure of choice in these patients is CSF PCR analysis for HSV. A positive CSF PCR establishes the diagnosis, and a negative test dramatically reduces the likelihood of HSV encephalitis (see above). The anatomic distribution of lesions may provide an additional clue to diagnosis. Patients with rapidly progressive encephalitis and prominent brainstem signs, symptoms, or neuroimaging abnormalities may be infected by flaviviruses (WNV, St. Louis encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus), HSV, rabies, or"

The nervous system is particularly susceptible to certain viruses such as rabies virus and poliovirus. Some viruses infect specific CNS cell types, while others preferentially involve particular brain regions (such as the medial temporal lobes, or the limbic system) that lie along the viral route of entry. Intrauterine viral infection following transplacental spread of rubella and CMV may cause destructive lesions, and Zika virus causes developmental abnormalities of the brain. In addition to direct infection of the nervous system, the CNS also can be injured by immune mechanisms after systemic viral infections."

Coronal (A) and axial (B) T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images demonstrate expansion and high signal intensity involving the right medial temporal lobe and insular cortex (arrows). C. Coronal diffusion-weighted image demonstrates high signal intensity indicating restricted diffusion involving the right medial temporal lobe and hippocampus (arrows) as well as subtle involvement of the left inferior temporal lobe (arrowhead). This is most consistent with neuronal death and can be seen in acute infarction as well as encephalitis and other inflammatory conditions. The suspected diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis was confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction analysis."
