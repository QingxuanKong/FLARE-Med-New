Which of the following is a general anesthetic most likely responsible for her death?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's consider the symptoms and the context provided. The patient is an 18-year-old otherwise healthy female who underwent general anesthesia for a fractured femur repair and died 5 days later due to massive hepatic necrosis. The key to solving this question lies in understanding the potential hepatotoxic effects of the anesthetic agents listed. Halothane is known for its potential to cause hepatitis and liver failure, particularly with repeated exposure. This is because halothane can induce an immune-mediated reaction that leads to the formation of antibodies against liver cells, which can result in liver damage and necrosis. The fact that the patient died 5 days after the surgery, which is a timeframe when the liver's natural repair mechanisms may not be sufficient to mitigate the damage, further supports the likelihood of halothane-induced liver injury. The other options, lidocaine, midazolam, and desflurane, are not as commonly associated with severe hepatotoxicity as halothane. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's death is halothane-induced liver injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

A 22-year-old woman presents to her college medical clinic complaining of a 2-week history of vaginal discharge. She denies any fever or abdominal pain but does report vaginal bleeding after sexual intercourse. When questioned about her sexual activity, she reports having vaginal intercourse, at times unprotected, with two men in the last 6 months.

A medical student was asked to inspect the abdomen of two patients. On the first patient he noted irregular veins radiating from the umbilicus. On the second patient he noted irregular veins, coursing in a caudal to cranial direction, over the anterior abdominal wall from the groin to the chest. He was asked to explain his findings and determine the significance of these features."

Physical examina-tion reveals a pale woman with diminished vibration sen-sation, diminished spinal reflexes, and extensor plantar reflexes (Babinski sign). Examination of her oral cavity reveals atrophic glossitis, in which the tongue appears deep red in color and abnormally smooth and shiny due to atro-phy of the lingual papillae. Laboratory testing reveals a mac-rocytic anemia based on a hematocrit of 30% (normal for women, 37\u201348%), a hemoglobin concentration of 9.4 g/dL, an erythrocyte mean cell volume (MCV) of 123 fL (nor-mal, 84\u201399 fL), an erythrocyte mean cell hemoglobin con-centration (MCHC) of 34% (normal, 31\u201336%), and a low reticulocyte count. Further laboratory testing reveals a normal serum folate concentration and a serum vitamin B12 (cobalamin) concentration"

The patient had noted 2 days of abdominal pain and fever, and his clinical evaluation and CT scan were consistent with appendicitis. His clinical find-ings resolved after laparoscopic appendectomy. The patient immigrated to the USA 10 years ago from a rural area of Peru where his family trades in sheepskins.

It is interesting to note that the ancient Greeks seem to have been aware of this fact, because the Greek word for the liver, h\u00afepar, derives from the verb h\u00afepaomai, which means \u201cmend\u201d or \u201crepair.\u201d Hence h\u00afepar roughly translates as \u201crepairable.\u201d1 The importance of the liver dates back to even biblical times, for the Babylonians (c. 2000 b.c.) considered the liver to be the seat of the soul. There are scattered reports of liver surgery for battlefield injuries, but the first recorded elec-tive hepatic resection was done in 1888 in Germany by Langen-buch. There followed reports of liver resections in the United States (Tiffany, 1890) and Europe (Lucke, 1891), as well as the first large series of hepatic resections by Keen in 1899.2,3 In 1908, Pringle described in Annals of Surgery the \u201carrest of hepatic hemorrhage due to trauma\u201d by compression of the porta hepatis, a maneuver that now"
