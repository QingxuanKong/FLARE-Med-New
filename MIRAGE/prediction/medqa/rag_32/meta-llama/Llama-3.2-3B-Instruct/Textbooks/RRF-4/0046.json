            "content": "Meta-analyses typically focus on summary measures of relative treatment benefit, such as odds ratios or relative risks. Clinicians also should examine what absolute risk reduction (ARR) can be expected from the therapy. A useful summary metric of absolute treatment benefit is the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one adverse outcome event (e.g., death, stroke). NNT is simply 1/ARR. For example, if a hypothetical therapy reduced mortality rates over a 5-year follow-up by 33% (the relative treatment benefit) from 12% (control arm) to 8% (treatment arm), the ARR would be 12% \u2013 8% = 4%, and the NNT would be 1/0.04, or 25. Thus, it would be necessary to treat 25 patients for 5 years to prevent 1 death. If the hypothetical treatment was applied to a lower-risk population, say, with a 6% 5-year mortality, the 33% relative treatment benefit would reduce absolute mortality by 2% (from 6% to 4%), and the NNT for the same therapy in this lower-risk group of patients would be 50.

Thus, the initial clinical strategy should be to use a two-drug combination first (ACEI and beta blocker; if beta blocker intolerant, then ACEI and ARB; if ACEI intolerant, then ARB and beta blocker). In symptomatic patients (NYHA class II\u2013IV), an aldosterone antagonist should be strongly considered, but four-drug therapy should be avoided. A recent trial called the Aliskiren Trial on Acute Heart Failure Outcomes (ASTRONAUT) tested a direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, in addition to other heart failure medications, within a week after discharge from a hospitalization for decompensated HFrEF. No significant difference in cardiovascular death or hospitalization at 6 or 12 months was noted. Aliskiren was associated with a reduction in circulating natriuretic peptides, but any disease-modifying effect was overcome by"

The most compelling evidence for the benefits of antiplatelet therapy (mainly with aspirin) in STEMI is found in the comprehensive overview by the Antiplatelet Trialists\u2019 Collaboration. Data from nearly 20,000 patients with MI enrolled in 15 randomized trials were pooled and revealed a relative reduction of 27% in the mortality rate, from 14.2% in control patients to 10.4% in patients receiving antiplatelet agents."

Total mortality benefits in the range of a 20\u201335% reduction over 2\u20135 years have been observed in a series of clinical trials.

In general, there appears to be a gradient of increasing ICD benefit with EFs ranging lower than"

            "content": "The combination of clopidogrel and aspirin is also effective in patients with unstable angina. Thus, in 12,562 such patients, the risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke was 9.3% in those randomized to the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin and 11.4% in those given aspirin alone. This 20% relative risk reduction with combination therapy was highly statistically significant. However, combining clopidogrel with aspirin increases the risk of major bleeding to about 2% per year. This bleeding risk persists even if the daily dose of aspirin is \u2264100 mg. Therefore, the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin should only be used when there is a clear benefit. For example, this combination has not proven to be superior to clopidogrel alone in patients with acute ischemic stroke or to aspirin alone for primary prevention in those at risk for cardiovascular events."
