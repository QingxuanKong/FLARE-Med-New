This is indicative of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection. The question asks for the most appropriate intervention to decrease vertical transmission of this organism. Group B Streptococcus is a common cause of neonatal sepsis and can be transmitted to the newborn during delivery. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for all women at 35-37 weeks of gestation who are colonized with GBS, regardless of intrapartum risk factors. This is to prevent GBS disease in the newborn. The correct answer is B. Administer ampicillin intrapartum. This will help reduce the risk of transmission of GBS to the newborn during delivery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

            "content": "During pregnancy, infections or drugs can induce hemolysis in G6PD deficiency heterozygotes or homozygotes, and severity is related to enzyme activity. Anemia is usually episodic, although some variants induce chronic nonspherocytic hemolysis. Because young erythrocytes contain more enzyme activity, anemia ultimately stabilizes and is corrected soon after the inciting cause is eliminated. Newborn screening for G6PD deiciency is not recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (20 16b)."

In the new model, women were seen once in the irst trimester and screened for certain risks. hose without anticipated complications-80 percent of those screened-were seen again at 26, 32, and 38 weeks. Compared with routine prenatal care, which required a median of eight visits, the new model required a median of only ive. No disadvantages were attributed to the regimen with fewer visits, and these indings were consistent with other randomized trials (Clement, 1999; McDuie, 1996)."
