    "question": "A 41-year-old man comes to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea for the past 2 days. His abdominal discomfort is worse shortly after meals. He has also had progressive perioral numbness and upper-extremity muscle cramping for the past 24 hours. Six months ago, he underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass to treat obesity. He underwent a total thyroidectomy to treat a Hurthle cell lesion 4 days ago. His mother died of lung cancer at age 68. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. His only current medication is a multivitamin supplement. He appears fatigued. His temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse is 72/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. While measuring the patient's blood pressure, the nurse observes spasm of the patient's hand. Physical examination shows a well-healing surgical wound on the neck. The abdomen is mildly tender to palpation with well-healed laparoscopic incisional sites. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:\nNa+ 138 mEq/L\nK+ 4.2 mEq/L\nCl- 102 mEq/L\nHCO3- 25 mEq/L\nMg2+ 1.7 mEq/L\nPhosphorus 4.3 mg/dL\n25-hydroxyvitamin D 20 ng/mL (N: 20-100 ng/mL)\nParathyroid hormone 115 pg/mL\nTotal bilirubin, serum 0.7 mg/dL\nAlanine aminotransferase, serum 14 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase, serum 15 U/L\nAlkaline phosphatase, serum 42 U/L\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient?\"",

Additionally, the patient has progressive perioral numbness and upper-extremity muscle cramping, which could indicate hypocalcemia. The patient has undergone a total thyroidectomy 4 days ago, which could lead to hypoparathyroidism. The patient's serum calcium level is low (1.7 mg/dL), and the parathyroid hormone level is elevated (115 pg/mL), which is consistent with hypoparathyroidism. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest hypocalcemia, which is a medical emergency. Therefore, the most appropriate initial step is to administer calcium gluconate to correct the hypocalcemia and prevent further neurological symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

Diarrhea may occur with larger doses. More severe hypomagnesemia should be treated parenterally, preferably with IV MgCl2, which can be administered safely as a continuous infusion of 50 mmol/d (100 meq Mg2+/d) if renal function is normal. If GFR is reduced, the infusion rate should be lowered by 50\u201375%. Use of IM MgSO4 is discouraged; the injections are painful and provide relatively little magnesium (2 mL of 50% MgSO4 supplies only 4 mmol). MgSO4 may be given IV instead of MgCl2, although the sulfate anions may bind calcium in serum and urine and aggravate hypocalcemia. Serum magnesium should be monitored at intervals of 12\u201324 h during therapy, which may continue for several days because of impaired renal conservation of magnesium (only 50\u201370% of the daily IV magnesium dose is retained) and delayed repletion of intracellular deficits,"

The serum alkaline phosphatase level is almost always elevated in biliary obstruction. A rise in alkaline phosphatase often precedes clinical jaundice and may be the only abnormality in routine liver function tests. There may be a twoto tenfold elevation of serum aminotransferases, especially in association with acute obstruction. Following relief of the obstructing process, serum aminotransferase elevations usually return rapidly to normal, while the serum bilirubin level may take 1\u20132 weeks to return to normal. The alkaline phosphatase level usually falls slowly, lagging behind the decrease in serum bilirubin."

Hypotension that is refractory to vasopressors or volume expansion may be an early sign. Nausea, lethargy, and weakness may progress to respiratory failure, paralysis, and coma, with hypoactive tendon reflexes, at serum magnesium levels >4 mmol/L. Other findings may include gastrointestinal hypomotility or ileus; facial flushing; pupillary dilation; paradoxical bradycardia; prolongation of PR, QRS, and QT intervals; heart block; and, at serum magnesium levels approaching 10 mmol/L, asystole. Hypermagnesemia, acting via the CaSR, causes hypocalcemia and hypercalciuria due to both parathyroid suppression and impaired cTAL calcium reabsorption."
