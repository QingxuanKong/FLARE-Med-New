    "question": "A 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increasing shortness of breath and a non-productive cough for 2 months. She has been unable to perform her daily activities. She has had malaise and bilateral ankle pain during this period. She noticed her symptoms after returning from a vacation to Arizona. She is a research assistant at the university geology laboratory. She is originally from Nigeria and visits her family there twice a year; her last trip was 3 months ago. Her temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 112/72 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is no palpable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Her left eye is notable for ciliary injection and photophobia. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count is within the reference range. An x-ray of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thought process and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with increasing shortness of breath, non-productive cough, malaise, and bilateral ankle pain after returning from a vacation to Arizona. The symptoms started after returning from a trip to Nigeria, which could be relevant for certain infectious diseases. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as ciliary injection and photophobia, are suggestive of conjunctivitis. The patient's occupation as a research assistant in a geology laboratory and her travel history to Nigeria are also relevant. The patient's symptoms and signs, such as conjunctivitis and cough, could be related to an infection. Considering the patient's recent travel history to Nigeria and her symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is histoplasmosis, which is a fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, commonly found in the soil of caves and soil contaminated with bat or bird droppings. Histoplasmosis is often acquired through inhalation of the spores. The patient's symptoms and signs, such as conjunctivitis and cough, are consistent with histoplasmosis. The patient's occupation and travel history also support this diagnosis. The other options, sarcoidosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, and Hodgkin's lymphoma, are less likely given the patient's symptoms and signs, as well as her recent travel history.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of \u201closs of vision.\u201d Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver\u2019s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

Graham, Centre for International Child Health, University of Melbourne, Australia; with permission.) 1110 postprimary disease. Depending on the extent of reactivity, the effusion may be small, remain unnoticed, and resolve spontaneously or may be sufficiently large to cause symptoms such as fever, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea. Physical findings are those of pleural effusion: dullness to percussion and absence of breath sounds. A chest radiograph reveals the effusion and, in up to one-third of cases, also shows a parenchymal lesion. Thoracentesis is required to ascertain the nature of the effusion and to differentiate it from manifestations of other etiologies. The fluid is straw colored and at times hemorrhagic; it is an exudate with a protein concentration >50% of that in serum (usually ~4\u20136 g/dL), a normal to low glucose concentration, a pH of ~7.3"

            "content": "Physical Examination The clinician\u2019s suspicion of respiratory disease often begins with a patient\u2019s vital signs. The respiratory rate is often informative, whether elevated (tachypnea) or depressed (hypopnea). In addition, pulse oximetry should be measured, as many patients with respiratory disease have hypoxemia, either at rest or with exertion. The classic structure of the respiratory examination proceeds through inspection, percussion, palpation, and auscultation as described below. Often, however, auscultatory findings will lead the clinician to perform further percussion or palpation in order to clarify these findings."

She recalls getting up early that morning to do her weekly errands and had skipped breakfast. She drank a cup of coffee for lunch and had nothing to eat during the day. She met with friends at 8 p.m. and had a few drinks. As the evening progressed, she soon became weak and dizzy and was taken to the hospital. Laboratory tests revealed her blood glucose to be 45 mg/dl (normal = 70\u201399). She was given orange juice and immediately felt better. The biochemical basis of her alcohol-induced hypoglycemia is an increase in: A. fatty acid oxidation. B. the ratio of the reduced oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. C. oxaloacetate and pyruvate. D. use of acetyl coenzyme A in fatty acid synthesis."

Review of systems was negative for fever, orthostatic dizziness, nausea and vomiting, or headache. Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission. On examination at hour 6, the heart rate was 72 sitting and 90 standing, and blood pressure was 105/50 mmHg lying and standing. Her jugular venous pressure (JVP) was indistinct with no peripheral edema. On abdominal examination, the patient had a slight increase in bowel sounds but a nontender abdomen and no organomegaly."

This illness is marked by a prominent sore throat and the gradual onset of fever, which often reaches 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F) on the second or third day of illness. Cough is almost always present, and coryza and regional lymphadenopathy are frequently seen. Physical examination may show pharyngeal edema, injection, and tonsillar enlargement with little or no exudate. If pneumonia has developed, auscultation and x-ray of the chest may indicate areas of patchy infiltration."
