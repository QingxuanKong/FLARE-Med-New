    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient is a 7-year-old boy who has lost consciousness, has a petechial rash, neck rigidity, and a fever. The symptoms of petechial rash and neck rigidity are indicative of meningitis. The patient has been experiencing a 'running nose' for a few days, which could be indicative of meningococcemia, a condition caused by Neisseria meningitidis. The patient's low blood pressure (90/50 mmHg) is likely due to the sepsis caused by the bacterial infection. Given the clinical presentation, the most likely cause of the patient's low blood pressure is meningococcemia.\\n\\nThe other options are less likely:\\nB. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is unlikely as there is no mention of heart failure or cardiac symptoms.\\nC. Adrenocortical insufficiency would typically present with hypotension, but the patient also has a petechial rash and neck rigidity, which are not typical symptoms of adrenal insufficiency.\\nD. Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that typically presents with episodic hypertension, tachycardia, and other symptoms, which are not present in this patient.\\n\\nThe empiric intravenous antibiotics started and the lumbar puncture performed are appropriate for suspected meningitis or meningococcemia.\\n\\nAnswer: C. Adrenocortical insufficiency is not the most likely cause of the patient's low blood pressure, but it is not the correct answer among the options provided. The correct answer is not listed, but the most likely cause is meningococcemia.\\n\\nHowever, since the options do not include meningococcemia, the closest answer is C. Adrenocortical insufficiency is not the correct answer, but it is the closest to the correct diagnosis, meningococcemia.\\n\\nHowever, since this is not an option, I will choose the closest answer which is not correct but is the most likely cause of low blood pressure in this context.\\n\\nAnswer: C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

Assessment of the patient\u2019s general appearance and vital signs, skin and soft tissue examination, and the neurologic evaluation are of particular importance. The patient may appear either anxious and agitated or lethargic and apathetic. Fever is usually present, although elderly patients and compromised hosts (e.g., patients who are uremic or cirrhotic and those who are taking glucocorticoids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be afebrile despite serious underlying infection.

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

He is rushed to a nearby level 1 trauma center where he is found to have multiple facial fractures, a severe, unstable cervical spine injury, and significant left eye trauma. Further examination of his left eye reveals rupture of his globe. The ophthalmolo-gist requests emergency surgery to repair and save his eye. Because the patient has suffered a recent trauma, you decide to perform a rapid sequence intubation in preparation for the surgical procedure. What muscle relaxant would you use to facilitate tracheal intubation? What is the proper dose for your chosen muscle relaxant? After intravenous infusion of your chosen muscle relaxant, you are unable to adequately visualize the patient\u2019s larynx and vocal cords and cannot successfully pass an endotracheal tube.

With moderate hypovolemia (~20\u201340% of the blood volume), the patient becomes increasingly anxious and tachycardic; although normal blood pressure may be maintained in the supine position, there may be significant postural hypotension and tachycardia. If hypovolemia is severe (\u226540% of the blood volume), the classic signs of shock appear; the blood pressure declines and becomes unstable even in the supine position, and the patient develops marked tachycardia, oliguria, and agitation or confusion. Perfusion of the central nervous system is well maintained until shock becomes severe. Hence, mental obtundation is an ominous clinical sign. The transition from mild to severe hypovolemic shock can be insidious or extremely rapid. If severe shock is not reversed rapidly, especially in elderly patients and those with comorbid illnesses,"

He noted that there was reduced sensation in both legs, and there was virtually no power in extensor or flexor groups. The patient was tachycardic, which was believed to be due to pain, and the blood pressure obtained in the ambulance measured 120/80 mm Hg. It was noted that the patient\u2019s current blood pressure was 80/40 mm Hg; however, the patient did not complain of typical clinical symptoms of hypotension. On first inspection, it is difficult to \u201cadd up\u201d these clinical symptoms and signs. In essence we have a progressive paraplegia associated with severe back pain and an anomaly in blood pressure measurements, which are not compatible with the clinical state of the patient. It was deduced that the blood pressure measurements were obtained in different arms, and both were reassessed."

Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice?

A 33-year-old man was playing cricket for his local Sunday team. As the new bowler pitched the ball short, it bounced higher than he anticipated and hit him on the side of his head. He immediately fell to the ground unconscious, but after about 30 seconds he was helped to his feet and felt otherwise well. It was noted he had some bruising around his temple. He decided not to continue playing and went to watch the match from the side. Over the next hour he became extremely sleepy and was eventually unrousable. He was rushed to hospital. When he was admitted to hospital, the patient\u2019s breathing was shallow and irregular and it was necessary to intubate him. A skull radiograph demonstrated a fracture in the region of the pterion. No other abnormality was demonstrated other than minor soft tissue bruising over the left temporal fossa. A CT scan was performed."
