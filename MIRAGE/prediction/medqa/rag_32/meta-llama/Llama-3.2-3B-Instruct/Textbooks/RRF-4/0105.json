    "question": "A 28-year-old woman presents following a suicide attempt 2 days ago. She says that her attempt was a result of a fight with her boyfriend and that she slit her wrists in an attempt to keep him from breaking up with her. In the past, she has had many turbulent relationships, both romantic and in her family life. Her family members describe her as being very impulsive and frequently acting to manipulate people\u2019s feelings. Since she was admitted to the hospital, she has spit at several staff members and alternated between sobbing and anger. She has no significant past medical history. The patient denies any history of smoking, alcohol use, or recreational drug use. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and behavior described in the scenario: \\n\\nThe patient is a 28-year-old woman who has made a suicide attempt by slitting her wrists after a fight with her boyfriend. She has a history of turbulent relationships, both romantic and in her family life, and is described by her family members as being very impulsive and frequently acting to manipulate people's feelings. In the hospital, she has exhibited aggressive behavior, such as spitting at staff members and alternating between sobbing and anger.\\n\\nConsidering these symptoms, the patient's behavior suggests a pattern of emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and unstable relationships, which are characteristic of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). BPD is a mental health condition marked by a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity starting by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following criteria from A. A), B) B), C) D), E) F), or G)\\n\\nThe patient's behavior of engaging in self-harm (slitting her wrists) and having a history of turbulent relationships, as well as her emotional dysregulation and impulsivity, are all consistent with the diagnostic criteria for BPD. \\n\\nThe other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and behavior as well:\\n\\nA. Histrionic Personality Disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking, but the patient's behavior does not suggest excessive emotionality or attention seeking.\\n\\nC. Dependent Personality Disorder is characterized by a pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of, which is not indicated in the patient's behavior.\\n\\nD. Narcissistic Personality Disorder is characterized by a grandiose sense of self-importance, a fixation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love, and a need for constant admiration, which is not present in the patient's behavior.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Borderline Personality Disorder.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

If a patient is actively contemplating suicide, she must see a psychiatrist immediately (132,133). Other mental health professionals may be helpful but are less likely to have dealt extensively with and assumed responsibility for suicidal patients, to be able to determine whether the patient should be hospitalized, and to have admitting privileges. Until she is in the physical presence of a psychiatrist, or in a safe environment such as a hospital emergency room, a suicidal patient should be observed and protected at all times\u2014 every second\u2014whether she is in the consulting room or the bathroom. The staff member assigned to remain with her may not leave to make a telephone call, go to the bathroom, or get a cup of coffee.

This is probably because men use more drastic or irreversible means, such as firearms, whereas women tend to overdose, which can be treated if discovered. It might seem that someone who repeatedly makes suicidal gestures is more interested in the responses of others than in ending her life. However, past attempts or gestures increase the risk of completed suicide. Patients who made a suicide attempt should be queried about the following risk factors: the intent to die (rather than escape, sleep, or make people understand her distress); increasing numbers or doses of drugs taken in a progression of attempts; and drug or alcohol misuse, especially if it, too, is increasing. Inquiry about suicidal ideation and behavior is an inherent part of every mental status examination and is mandatory for every patient with past or current depression or evidence of self-destructive"

            "content": "Despite the above comments regarding impulsivity, most suicides are planned. Furthermore, the intention of committing suicide is more often than not communicated to someone significant in the patient\u2019s life. The message may be in the form of a direct verbal statement of intent, or it may be indirect, such as giving away a treasured possession or revising a will. It is known that successful suicide is 3 times more common in men than in women and particularly common among men older than 40 years of age. Patients with a history of suicide in either mother or father carry a higher risk than those without such a history. A previous suicide attempt adds to the risk. As alluded to earlier, important deterrents to suicide are devout Catholicism or comparable religious belief against suicide, concern about the suffering it would cause the family, and fear of death sincerely expressed by the patient. However, no single one of these attributes stands out as entirely predictive of suicide. As a"

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of \u201closs of vision.\u201d Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver\u2019s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

Suicidal behavior is often categorized in terms of violence of the method. Generally, over\u2014 doses with legal or illegal substances are considered nonviolent in method, whereas jump- ing, gunshot wounds, and other methods are considered violent. Another dimension for classification is medical consequences of the behavior, with high\u2014lethality attempts being defined as those requiring medical hospitalization beyond a visit to an emergency depart- ment. An additional dimension considered includes the degree of planning versus impul\u2014 siveness of the attempt, a characteristic that might have consequences for the medical outcome of a suicide attempt."
