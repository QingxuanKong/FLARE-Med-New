She has a 10-year history of hypertension and an esophageal stricture due to severe gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia 20 years ago and treated with medroxyprogesterone. Menarche started at 11 years of age and her last menstrual period was 8 years ago. Her last mammography and PAP smear 6 months ago showed no abnormalities. Her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 45 years. The patient does not have any children. Current medications include lansoprazole and hydrochlorothiazide. Her blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Treatment is begun with a drug that prevents further bone resorption and reduces her risk of developing breast cancer. This drug puts her at an increased risk of which of the following adverse effects?",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to identify the type of drug that is used to prevent further bone resorption and reduce the risk of developing breast cancer, and then determine which of the provided options is a known adverse effect of that drug. The patient has a history of endometrial hyperplasia, which increases her risk of breast cancer. A drug that is commonly used to prevent further bone resorption and reduce breast cancer risk is raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Raloxifene is often prescribed for postmenopausal women to treat osteoporosis and reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer. Now, let's evaluate the options: A. Skin infections - Not a known adverse effect of raloxifene. B. Osteosarcoma - Raloxifene has not been associated with an increased risk of osteosarcoma. C. Hypercholesterolemia - Raloxifene can actually have a beneficial effect on lipid profiles by increasing HDL-C and decreasing LDL-C. D. Deep vein thrombosis - Raloxifene can increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, so this is the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Because risk factors for breast cancer interact, evaluating the risk conferred by combinations of risk factors is difficult. There are several risk assessment models available to predict the risk of breast cancer. From the Breast Cancer Detec-tion Demonstration Project, a mammography screening program conducted in the 1970s, Gail et al developed the model most frequently used in the United States, which incorporates age, age at menarche, age at first live birth, the number of breast biopsy specimens, any history of atypical hyperplasia, and number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer.52 It predicts the cumula-tive risk of breast cancer according to decade of life. To calculate breast cancer risk using the Gail model, a woman\u2019s risk factors are translated into an overall risk score by multiplying her rela-tive risks from several categories (Table 17-6).

A similar plot for breast cancer shows two components: a straight-line increase with age but with a decrease in slope beginning at the age of menopause. The three dates in a woman\u2019s life that have a major impact on breast cancer incidence are age at menarche, age at first full-term pregnancy, and age at menopause.

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

Reassurance that after full maturation the asymmetry will be less obvious and that all women have some degree of asymmetry is needed by some. The breast bud is a pea-sized mass below the nipple that is often tender. Occasionally young women present with a breast mass; usually these are benign fibroadenomas or cysts (Table 68-2). Breast cancer is extremely rare in this age group. An ultrasound evaluation is better for the evaluation of young, dense breasts and avoids the radiation exposure of mammography. Peripubertal girls (sexual maturity rating stage III) often complain of vaginal discharge. If the discharge is clear without Drugs Antiandrogens Antibiotics (isoniazid, ketoconazole, metronidazole) Antacids (H2 blockers) Cancer chemotherapy (especially alkylating agents) Cardiovascular drugs Drugs of abuse Alcohol Amphetamines Heroin Marijuana"

Because therapy is most likely to benefit those at highest risk, it is important to review a woman\u2019s risk factors for osteoporosis when making treatment decisions. Bone mineral density screening should be considered for high-risk women (Table 34.3). Nonmodifiable risk factors include age, family history, Asian or Caucasian race, history of a prior fracture, small body frame, early menopause, and prior oophorectomy. Modifiable risk factors include smoking, decreased intake of calcium and vitamin D, and a sedentary lifestyle.

            "content": "A number of trials have suggested that annual or biennial screening with mammography or mammography plus clinical breast examination in normal-risk women older than age 50 years decreases breast cancer mortality. Each trial has been criticized for design flaws. In most trials, breast cancer mortality rate is decreased by 15\u201330%. Experts disagree on whether average-risk women age 40\u201349 years should receive regular screening (Table 100-3). The U.K. Age Trial, the only randomized trial of breast cancer screening to specifically evaluate the impact of mammography in women age 40\u201349 years, found no statistically significant difference in breast cancer mortality for screened women versus controls after about 11 years of follow-up (relative risk 0.83; 95% confidence interval 0.66\u20131.04); however, <70% of women received screening in the intervention arm, potentially diluting the observed effect. A meta-analysis of eight large randomized trials showed a 15% relative reduction in mortality"
