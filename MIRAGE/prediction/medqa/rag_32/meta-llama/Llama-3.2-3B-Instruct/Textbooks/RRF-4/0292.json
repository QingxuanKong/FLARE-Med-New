    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a large, pedunculated tumor in the left atrium, which is likely a cardiac myxoma. This type of tumor can obstruct blood flow and lead to various complications. The key to answering this question is to consider the potential risks associated with a pedunculated left atrial myxoma. According to Document [11], a pedunculated left atrial myxoma can cause obstruction of blood flow, leading to sudden cardiac death, especially if it becomes pedunculated and prolapses into the left ventricle during diastole. This can cause a sudden and catastrophic reduction in cardiac output, leading to sudden cardiac death. The other options are not directly related to the specific risk associated with a pedunculated left atrial myxoma. Abrupt hypotension (A) may be a symptom of various conditions, but it is not the most specific risk associated with this type of tumor. Acute arterial occlusion (C) is a possible complication of a cardiac myxoma, but it is not the most likely risk in this scenario. Septic embolism (D) is a potential complication of infective endocarditis, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Sudden cardiac death is the most likely risk for this patient due to the presence of a pedunculated left atrial myxoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, neurologic, or pulmonary disease help focus the differential diagnosis, as do findings relevant to the jugular venous pressure and waveforms, the arterial pulses, other heart sounds, the lungs, the abdomen, the skin, and the extremities. In many instances, laboratory studies, an ECG, and/or a chest x-ray may have been obtained earlier and may contain valuable information. A patient with suspected infective endocarditis, for example, may have a murmur in the setting of fever, chills, anorexia, fatigue, dyspnea, splenomegaly, petechiae, and positive blood cultures. A new systolic murmur in a patient with a marked fall in blood pressure after a recent MI suggests myocardial rupture.

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

Classic physical exam findings include jugular venous distention with Kussmaul\u2019s sign, diminished cardiac apical impulses, peripheral edema, ascites, pulsatile liver, a pericardial knock, and, in advanced disease, signs of liver dysfunction, such as jaundice or cachexia. The \u201cpericardial knock\u201d is an early diastolic sound that reflects a sudden impediment to ventricular filling, similar to an S3 but of higher pitch.Several findings are characteristic on noninvasive and invasive testing. CVP is often elevated 15 to 20 mmHg or higher. ECG commonly demonstrates nonspecific low voltage QRS complexes and isolated repolarization abnormalities. Chest X-ray may demonstrate calcification of the pericardium, which is highly suggestive of constrictive pericarditis in patients with heart failure, but this is present in only 25% of cases.274 Cardiac CT or MRI (cMRI) typically demonstrate increased pericardial"

Neither the patient nor the family physician had any concerns about the pregnancy. However, the patient did complain of unilateral swelling of her left leg, which had gradually increased over the previous 2 days. Furthermore, the evening before her visit she developed some sharp chest pain, which was exacerbated by deep breaths. The family physician ordered a duplex ultrasound scan of the left leg venous system. Ultrasound scanning of the vascular tree can demonstrate flow and occlusion of arteries and veins."

With severe PS, patients may report exertional dyspnea or early-onset fatigue. Anginal chest pain from RV oxygen supply-demand mismatch and syncope may occur with very severe forms of obstruction, particularly in the presence of a destabilizing trigger such as atrial fibrillation, fever, infection, or anemia."

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"
