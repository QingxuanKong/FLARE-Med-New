    "question": "A 15-year-old boy with poorly controlled asthma presents to the emergency room complaining of severe shortness of breath. His mother reports that he had trouble breathing soon after he started playing soccer with some friends and was unable to use his inhaler as it was empty. His family history is notable for emphysema in his paternal uncle and cirrhosis in his maternal grandfather. The child\u2019s temperature is 99.0\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, respirations are 28/min, and oxygen saturation is 91% on room air. Physical examination demonstrates wheezing bilaterally in all lung fields. The child is started on supplemental oxygen and a nebulized bronchodilator. Which of the following is a downstream effect of this medication?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Decreased leukotriene activity",
        "B": "Activation of muscarinic receptors",
        "C": "Decreased phosphodiesterase activity",
        "D": "Increased adenylate cyclase activity"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "To answer this question, we need to understand the mechanism of action of bronchodilators, which are commonly used to treat asthma and other respiratory conditions. Step 1: Identify the type of medication used to treat asthma. The medication used to treat asthma in this scenario is a bronchodilator, specifically a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA). Step 2: Understand the mechanism of action of SABAs. SABAs work by stimulating beta-2 receptors in the smooth muscle of the airways, leading to relaxation of the airway muscles and dilation of the airways. Step 3: Determine the downstream effect of SABAs. The downstream effect of SABAs is the activation of adenylate cyclase, which increases the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in the airway smooth muscle cells. Increased cAMP leads to the relaxation of the airway muscles, resulting in bronchodilation. Therefore, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The downstream effect of the medication is the activation of adenylate cyclase, leading to increased cAMP production and subsequent relaxation of airway muscles, resulting in bronchodilation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

During the wheezing phase, percussion of the chest usually reveals only hyperresonance, but auscultation usually reveals diffuse wheezes and crackles throughout the breathing cycle. With more severe disease, grunting and cyanosis may be present. Routine laboratory tests are not required to confirm the diagnosis. It is important to assess oxygenation in severe cases of bronchiolitis. Pulse oximetry is adequate for monitoring oxygen saturation. Frequent, regular assessments and cardiorespiratory monitoring of infants are necessary because respiratory failure may develop precipitously in very tired infants even though blood gas values taken before rapid decompensation are reassuring."

Status asthmaticus is an acute exacerbation of asthma that does not respond adequately to therapeutic measures and may require hospitalization. Exacerbations may progress over several days or occur suddenly and can range in severity from mild to life threatening. Significant respiratory distress, dyspnea, wheezing, cough, and a decrease in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) characterize deterioration in asthma control. During severe episodes of wheezing, pulse oximetry is helpful in monitoring oxygenation. In status asthmaticus, arterial blood gases may be necessary for measurement of ventilation. As airway obstruction worsens and chest compliance decreases, carbon dioxide retention can occur. In the face of tachypnea, a normal pCO2 (40 mm Hg) indicates impending respiratory arrest."

Reversibility is demonstrated by a >12% and 200-mL increase in FEV1 15 min after an inhaled short-acting \u03b22-agonist or in some patients by a 2to 4-week trial of oral corticosteroids (OCS) (prednisone or prednisolone 30\u201340 mg daily). Measurements of PEF twice daily may confirm the diurnal variations in airflow obstruction. Flow-volume loops show reduced peak flow and reduced maximum expiratory flow. Further lung function tests are rarely necessary, but whole-body plethysmography shows increased airway resistance and may show increased total lung capacity and residual volume. Gas diffusion is usually normal, but there may be a small increase in gas transfer in some patients."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

            "content": "The majority of the manifestations of respiratory disease present as abnormalities of auscultation. Wheezes are a manifestation of airway obstruction. While most commonly a sign of asthma, peribronchial edema in the setting of congestive heart failure can also result in diffuse wheezes, as can any other process that causes narrowing of small airways. For this reason, clinicians must take care not to attribute all wheezing to asthma. Rhonchi are a manifestation of obstruction of medium-sized airways, most often with secretions. In the acute setting, this manifestation may be a sign of viral or bacterial bronchitis. Chronic rhonchi suggest bronchiectasis or COPD. Stridor, a high-pitched, focal inspiratory wheeze, usually heard over the neck, is a manifestation of upper airway obstruction and should prompt expedited evaluation of the patient, as it can precede complete upper airway obstruction and respiratory failure."

Review of the past history and growth chart demonstrates normal birth weight and birth length, but a progressive decrease in height per-centiles relative to age-matched normal ranges starting at 6 months of age, and orthostasis with febrile illnesses. Physical examination demonstrates short stature and mild generalized obesity. Genital examination reveals descended but small testes and a phallic length of \u20132 SD. Laboratory evaluations demonstrate growth hormone (GH) deficiency and a delayed bone age of 18 months. The patient is started on replacement with recombinant human GH at a dose of 40 mcg/kg per day subcutaneously. After 1 year of treatment, his height velocity has increased from 5 cm/y to 11 cm/y. How does GH stimulate growth in children? What other hormone deficiencies are sug-gested by the patient\u2019s history and physical examination? What"

Case 6: Dark Urine and Yellow Sclerae Patient Presentation: JF is a 13-year-old boy who presents with fatigue and yellow sclerae. Focused History: JF began treatment ~4 days ago with a sulfonamide antibiotic and a urinary analgesic for a urinary tract infection. He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

            "content": "Most hospitalized children show marked improvement in 2 to 5 days with supportive treatment alone. The course of the wheezing phase varies, however. Tachypnea and hypoxia may progress to respiratory failure requiring assisted ventilation. Apnea is a major concern for very young infants with bronchiolitis. Most cases of bronchiolitis resolve completely, although minor abnormalities of pulmonary function and bronchial hyperreactivity may persist for several years. Recurrence is common but tends to be mild and should be assessed and treated similarly to the first episode. The incidence of asthma seems to be higher for children hospitalized for bronchiolitis as infants, but it is unclear whether this is causal or whether children prone to asthma are more likely to be hospitalized with bronchiolitis. There is a 1% to 2% mortality rate, highest among infants with preexisting cardiopulmonary or immunologic impairment."

Asthma manifestations range from mild wheezing to severe bronchoconstriction, which obstructs airways and decreases airflow. his lowers the forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (FEVJFVC) ratio and the peak expiratory flow (PEF). The work ofbreathing progressively increases, and patients note chest tightness, wheezing, or breathlessness. Subsequent alterations in oxygenation primarily reflect ventilation-perfusion mismatching because the distribution of airway narrowing is uneven. Varied manifestations of asthma have led to a simple classiication that considers severity, onset, and duration of symptoms (Table 51-1). With persistent or worsening bronchial obstruction, clinical stages progress as shown in Figure"

His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor.
