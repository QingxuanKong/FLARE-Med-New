    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, we need to consider the patient's symptoms and history. The patient presents with yellowing of the eyes (jaundice) and has a history of intermittent fasting and binge drinking. The patient also has a history of a similar episode 4 years ago after an appendectomy. The patient's physical examination is unremarkable besides scleral icterus. We need to consider the possible causes of jaundice and how they relate to the patient's history and symptoms. The patient's symptoms could be related to liver dysfunction or bile duct obstruction. The patient's history of binge drinking could be a contributing factor to liver damage. The patient's history of intermittent fasting could also be a contributing factor to liver damage. We need to consider the possible causes of jaundice and how they relate to the patient's history and symptoms. The patient's symptoms could be related to a decrease in the activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, which is involved in the conjugation of bilirubin. This would lead to a decrease in the excretion of bilirubin and resulting in jaundice. The other options do not directly relate to the patient's symptoms and history. Autoimmune-mediated fibrosis of the biliary tract and chronic viral infection of the liver are possible causes of jaundice, but they are not directly related to the patient's history of intermittent fasting and binge drinking. Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase is a possible cause of jaundice, but it is not directly related to the patient's history of binge drinking. Defective bilirubin excretion is not a possible cause of jaundice in this case. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms is decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

In his clinical notes, he described these findings as a \u201cbag of worms\u201d (Fig. 5.86). The bag of worms was a varicocele. The venous drainage of the testis is via the pampiniform plexus of veins that runs within the spermatic cord. A varicocele is a collection of dilated veins that arise from the pampiniform plexus. In many ways, they are similar to varicose veins that develop in the legs. Typically, the patient complains of a dragging feeling in the scrotum and around the testis, which is usually worse toward the end of the day.

A 33-year-old man was playing cricket for his local Sunday team. As the new bowler pitched the ball short, it bounced higher than he anticipated and hit him on the side of his head. He immediately fell to the ground unconscious, but after about 30 seconds he was helped to his feet and felt otherwise well. It was noted he had some bruising around his temple. He decided not to continue playing and went to watch the match from the side. Over the next hour he became extremely sleepy and was eventually unrousable. He was rushed to hospital. When he was admitted to hospital, the patient\u2019s breathing was shallow and irregular and it was necessary to intubate him. A skull radiograph demonstrated a fracture in the region of the pterion. No other abnormality was demonstrated other than minor soft tissue bruising over the left temporal fossa. A CT scan was performed."

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

Case 3: Blood on the Toothbrush Patient Presentation: LT is an 84-year-old man whose gums have been bleeding for several months. Focused History: LT is a widower and lives alone in a suburban community on the East Coast. He no longer drives. His two children live on the West Coast and come east infrequently.

The examining physician discovers postural hypotension and moderate vitiligo (depigmented areas of skin) and obtains routine blood tests. She finds hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis and suspects Addison\u2019s disease. She performs a standard ACTH 1\u201324 stimulation test, which reveals an insufficient plasma cortisol response compatible with primary adrenal insuf-ficiency. The diagnosis of autoimmune Addison\u2019s disease is made, and the patient must start replacement of the hormones he cannot produce himself. How should this patient be treated? What precautions should he take?"

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

A medical student was asked to inspect the abdomen of two patients. On the first patient he noted irregular veins radiating from the umbilicus. On the second patient he noted irregular veins, coursing in a caudal to cranial direction, over the anterior abdominal wall from the groin to the chest. He was asked to explain his findings and determine the significance of these features."
