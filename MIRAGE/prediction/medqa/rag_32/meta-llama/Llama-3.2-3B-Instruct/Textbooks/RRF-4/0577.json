    "question": "A 63-year-old man from the countryside presents with leg swelling and right upper abdominal tenderness. He reports a history of myocardial infarction 4 years ago, but he has no supporting documentation. At the moment, his only medication is aspirin. He also stated that he used to have \u2018high blood sugars\u2019 when checked in the hospital 4 years ago, but he did not follow up regarding this issue. He works as a farmer and noticed that it became much harder for him to work in the last few days because of fatigue and syncope. He has a 24-pack-year history of smoking and consumes alcohol occasionally. The vital signs include: blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and temperature 36.5\u2103 (97.7\u2109). On physical examination, the patient is pale and acrocyanotic. There is a visible jugular vein distention and bilateral lower leg pitting edema. The pulmonary auscultation is significant for occasional bilateral wheezes. Cardiac auscultation is significant for a decreased S1, S3 gallop, and grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border in the 4th left intercostal space. Abdominal percussion and palpation are suggestive of ascites. The hepatic margin is 3 cm below the right costal margin. Hepatojugular reflux is positive. Which of the following is the most likely clinical finding observed in this patient on an echocardiogram?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Left ventricular ejection fraction of 41%",
        "B": "Increased peak tricuspid regurgitation",

These findings suggest right-sided heart failure. The patient's history of myocardial infarction and high blood sugars also raise the suspicion of cardiomyopathy. The echocardiogram findings will likely show signs of right ventricular dysfunction.\\n\\nGiven the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely clinical finding observed on an echocardiogram is right ventricular dilation and/or hypertrophy, which is consistent with right ventricular failure. This is supported by the presence of a grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border, which may indicate tricuspid regurgitation.\\n\\nThe other options are less likely:\\nA. Left ventricular ejection fraction of 41%: This is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, which suggest right-sided heart failure.\\nC. Hypokinetic wall of the left ventricle: There is no indication of left ventricular dysfunction in the patient's presentation.\\nD. Abnormal left ventricular relaxation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with right ventricular dysfunction rather than left ventricular dysfunction.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely clinical finding observed on an echocardiogram is B.

Right pleural effusion in the absence of clinically apparent ascites may be seen in advanced cirrhosis. The abdominal examination should focus on the size and consistency of the liver, on whether the spleen is palpable and hence enlarged, and on whether ascites is present. Patients with cirrhosis may have an enlarged left lobe of the liver, which is felt below the xiphoid, and an enlarged spleen. A grossly enlarged nodular liver or an obvious abdominal mass suggests malignancy. An enlarged tender liver could signify viral or alcoholic hepatitis; an infiltrative process such as amyloidosis; or, less often, an acutely congested liver secondary to right-sided heart failure. Severe right-upper-quadrant tenderness with respiratory arrest on inspiration (Murphy\u2019s sign) suggests cholecystitis.

In many instances, laboratory studies, an ECG, and/or a chest x-ray may have been obtained earlier and may contain valuable information. A patient with suspected infective endocarditis, for example, may have a murmur in the setting of fever, chills, anorexia, fatigue, dyspnea, splenomegaly, petechiae, and positive blood cultures.

A chest radiograph demonstrated translucent notches along the inferior border of ribs III to VI (eFig. 3.119). He was referred to a cardiologist and a diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta was made. The rib notching was caused by dilated collateral intercostal arteries. Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. This narrowing can markedly reduce blood flow to the lower body. Many of the vessels above the narrowing therefore enlarge due to the increased pressure so that blood can reach the aorta below the level of the narrowing. Commonly, the internal thoracic, superior epigastric, and musculophrenic arteries enlarge anteriorly. These arteries supply the anterior intercostal arteries, which anastomose with the posterior intercostal arteries that allow blood to flow retrogradely into the aorta. Enlargement of the intertcostal vessels results in notching of the ribs."

Dyspnea may occur with multiple conditions considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain and thus is not discriminative, but the presence of dyspnea is important because it suggests a cardiopulmonary etiology.

            "content": "A 65-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe central chest pain that radiated to the neck and predominantly to the left arm. He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

            "content": "The neck veins in patients with severe TR are distended with prominent c-v waves and rapid y descents (in the absence of TS). TR is more often diagnosed by examination of the neck veins than by auscultation of the heart sounds. Other findings may include marked hepatomegaly with systolic pulsations, ascites, pleural effusions, edema, and a positive hepatojugular reflex. A prominent RV pulsation along the left parasternal region and a blowing holosystolic murmur along the lower left sternal margin, which may be intensified during inspiration (Carvallo\u2019s sign) and reduced during expiration or the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver, are characteristic findings. The murmur of TR may sometimes be confused with that of MR unless attention is paid to its variation during the respiratory cycle and the extent of RV enlargement is appreciated. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is usually present in the chronic phase of the disease."

Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."

It is also a common, isolated finding in patients after cardiac surgery without other hemodynamic abnormalities. Venous hypertension sometimes can be elicited by performance of the abdominojugular reflex or with passive leg elevation. When these signs are positive, a volume-overloaded state with limited compliance of an overly distended or constricted venous system is present. The abdominojugular reflex is elicited with firm and consistent pressure over the upper portion of the abdomen, preferably over the right upper quadrant, for at least 10 s. A positive response is defined by a sustained rise of more than 3 cm in JVP for at least 15 s after release of the hand. Patients must be coached to refrain from breath holding or a Valsalva-like maneuver during the procedure. The"

Abdominal findings are infrequent with purely acute cardiopulmonary problems, except in the case of underlying chronic cardiopulmonary disease or severe right ventricular dysfunction leading to hepatic congestion. Vascular Pulse deficits may reflect underlying chronic atherosclerosis, which increases the likelihood of coronary artery disease. However, evidence of acute limb ischemia with loss of the pulse and pallor, particularly in the upper extremities, can indicate catastrophic consequences of aortic dissection. Unilateral lower-extremity swelling should raise suspicion about venous thromboembolism."
