Upon further questioning, the patient is found to have unprotected sex with both men and women with 3-5 partners per month. On workup, he is found to have an HIV viral load of 15,000 copies/mL with a CD4+ of 170 cells/mm^3. He is started on medical therapy. What should be included in his medication regimen?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of a sore throat and low-grade fever, which are common symptoms of various infections. However, given the patient's history of unprotected sex with multiple partners, a high-risk behavior for HIV transmission, and a high HIV viral load, the primary concern is the patient's HIV infection. The patient's CD4+ count is 170 cells/mm^3, which is considered immunocompromised. The patient needs antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress the virus and prevent further immunosuppression. The patient's symptoms of sore throat can be managed with antibiotics, but the primary focus should be on initiating ART. Among the options provided, fluconazole is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections, not relevant to this scenario. Folinic acid and tetrahydrofolic acid are folate supplements, not antiretroviral medications. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that can be used to treat bacterial infections, such as chlamydia or mycoplasma, but it is not a primary treatment for HIV infection. The patient's ART regimen should include a combination of antiretroviral medications to suppress the HIV virus. However, among the options provided, none directly indicate a specific antiretroviral medication regimen. In a real-world scenario, the patient would be started on a combination of medications such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC), and either raltegravir (RAL) or etravirine (ETR), but these options are not listed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

For more than a decade, HIV incidence has remained stable at approximately 50,000 per year, with the proportion of new infections increasing in recent years among men who have sex with men and falling among women and IDUs. Among adults and adolescents newly diagnosed with HIV infection in 2011 (regardless of stage of infection), ~79% were males and ~21% were women. Of new HIV diagnoses among men, ~79% were attributed to male-to-male sexual contact, ~12% to heterosexual contact, ~6% to injection drug use, and ~4% to a combination of male-to-male sexual contact and injection drug use. Of new HIV diagnoses among women, ~86% were due to heterosexual contact and ~14% to injection drug use 82% 66% 37% 33% 25% 290,924 1,148,200 HIV-infected HIV-Linked to Retained in Prescribed Suppressed diagnosed HIV care HIV care ART viral load"

            "content": "In overview, the ideal strategy to suppress viral load and minimize vertical HIV transmission includes: (1) preconceptional ART, (2) antepartum ART, (3) intrapartum continuation of the antepartum oral ART regimen plus IV zidovudine, and (4) newborn ART prophylxis. ART is recommended for all HIVinfected pregnant women, and it should be initiated as early in pregnancy as possible. Treatment reduces the risk of perinatal transmission regardless of CD4 T-cell count or HIV RNA level. Adherence is essential because the risk of viral drug resistance is lessened. As for nonpregnant adults, pregnant women are treated with at least three antiviral agents. The Panel on Treatment of HI V-Infected Pregnant Women and Prevention of Perinatal Transmission (2016) has issued guidelines for four diferent scenarios during pregnancy (Table 65-5). he following paragraphs summarize these recommendations."

The examining physician discovers postural hypotension and moderate vitiligo (depigmented areas of skin) and obtains routine blood tests. She finds hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis and suspects Addison\u2019s disease. She performs a standard ACTH 1\u201324 stimulation test, which reveals an insufficient plasma cortisol response compatible with primary adrenal insuf-ficiency.

His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented.

Physical examination demonstrates short stature and mild generalized obesity. Genital examination reveals descended but small testes and a phallic length of \u20132 SD.

Varying degrees of clinical severity have been reported, and although it has been suggested that symptomatic seroconversion leading to the seeking of medical attention indicates an increased risk for an accelerated course of disease, there does not appear to be a correlation between the level of the initial burst of viremia in acute HIV infection and the subsequent course of disease. The typical clinical findings in the acute HIV syndrome are listed in Table 226-10; they occur along with a burst of plasma viremia. It has been reported that several symptoms of the acute HIV syndrome (fever, skin rash, pharyngitis, and myalgia) occur less frequently in those infected by injection drug use compared with those infected by sexual contact. The syndrome is typical of an acute viral syndrome and has been likened to acute infectious"
