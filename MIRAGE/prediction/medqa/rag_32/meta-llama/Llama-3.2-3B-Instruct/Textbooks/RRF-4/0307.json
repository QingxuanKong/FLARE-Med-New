    "question": "A 67-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with sudden onset of slurred speech. The patient\u2019s eldest daughter says that he couldn\u2019t move his arm during the episode. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and a hemorrhagic stroke 6 years ago, which was treated surgically. After admission, the patient gets increasingly worse and loses consciousness. A noncontrast CT of the head shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient is taken to the operating room, where the SAH evacuated, and the vessel is repaired. Postoperatively, the patient is unresponsive. Several days later, a repeat CT of the head shows an enlarging aneurysm in a different vessel in the brain. The patient\u2019s daughter is asked to consent to a non-emergent, life-saving operation since the patient is in a comatose state. She does not consent to the operation even though the physician stresses it would be life-saving. Upon further discussion, the physician finds out that the patient was abusive and neglectful to his children, and the daughter wants \u201cto live in peace.\u201d The patient has no written advanced directive. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?",

The patient has no written advanced directive, and the daughter's primary motivation for withholding consent appears to be personal and emotional, rather than a genuine concern for the patient's best interests. The patient's past history of abuse and neglect to his children raises concerns about the daughter's ability to make decisions on his behalf. In this situation, the physician should prioritize the patient's medical needs over the daughter's personal wishes, as the patient is unable to make decisions for himself and may not have the capacity to do so. The physician should contact another family member or a court to obtain consent for the life-saving operation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

An empty bottle of bupro-pion is on the bedside table. In the emergency department, she is unresponsive to verbal and painful stimuli. She has a brief generalized seizure, followed by a respiratory arrest. The emergency physician performs endotracheal intubation and administers a drug intravenously, followed by another sub-stance via a nasogastric tube. The patient is admitted to the intensive care unit for continued supportive care and recovers the next morning. What drug might be used intravenously to prevent further seizures? What substance is commonly used to adsorb drugs still present in the gastrointestinal tract?"

            "content": "Patients with an uncomplicated concussive injury who have already regained consciousness by the time they are seen in a hospital and have a normal neurologic examination pose few difficulties in management. They should not be discharged until a decision is made about appropriate examinations (CT scans, skull films), if necessary and the results prove to be negative. Also, the patient should probably not be released until the capacity for consecutive memories has been regained and arrangements have been made for observation by the family of signs of possible, although unlikely, delayed complications (subdural and epidural hemorrhage, intracerebral bleeding, and edema). A program instituted by Mittenberg and colleagues (2001) has shown that reassurance and explanation of the concussive injury and anticipated aftereffects reduce the incidence of postconcussive symptoms at 6 months. Most such patients become mentally clear, have mild or no headache, and are found to have a normal"

As the aneurysm ruptures, the patient complains of a sudden-onset \u201cthunderclap\u201d headache that produces neck stiffness and may induce vomiting. In a number of patients death ensues, but many patients reach the hospital, where the diagnosis is established. An initial CT scan demonstrates blood within the subarachnoid space, and this may be associated with an intracerebral bleed. Further management usually includes cerebral angiography, which enables the radiologist to determine the site, size, and origin of the aneurysm."

Patients presenting with intracranial hemorrhages that do not follow typical patterns should undergo cerebral angiography or MRI to evaluate for possible underlying lesions, such as AVM or tumor.Hemorrhagic stroke most commonly occurs within the basal ganglia or cerebellum. The patient is usually hypertensive on admission and has a history of poorly controlled hyperten-sion. Such patients are more likely to present with lethargy or obtundation compared to those who suffer an ischemic stroke. Depressed mental status results from mass effect from the hema-toma in deep structures, which can produce midline shift or herniation. Ischemic stroke does not cause mass effect acutely. Therefore, patients are more likely to present with normal con-sciousness and a focal neurologic deficit. Hemorrhagic strokes tend to present with a relatively gradual decline in neurologic function as the hematoma expands, rather than the immediately maximal"

Debate also continues regarding optimal care for unruptured intracranial aneurysms, with a recent large-scale study showing no clear benefit to open surgical vs. endovascu-lar approaches.65SAH patients often require 1 to 3 weeks of ICU care after aneurysm occlusion for medical complications that accompany neurologic injury. In addition to routine ICU concerns, SAH patients are also at risk for cerebral vasospasm. In vasospasm, cerebral arteries constrict pathologically and can cause isch-emia or stroke from 4 to 21 days after SAH. Current vasospasm prophylaxis includes maintenance of optimal perfusion with hypertension and mild hypervolemia, as well as administration of nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker that may decrease the"

The study was based on long-term observations of 568 patients who sustained an aneurysmal bleed between 1958 and 1965 and were managed only by a conservative medical program. A followup search in 1981 and 1982 disclosed that 378, or two-thirds of the patients, had died; 40 percent of the deaths had occurred within 6 months of the original hemorrhage. For the patients who survived the original hemorrhage for 6 months, the chances of survival during the next two decades were significantly worse than those of a matched normal population. Rebleeding occurred at a rate of 2.2 percent per year during the first decade and 0.86 percent per year during the second, and these were fatal in 78 percent of cases. Although these statistics reflect the outcome prior"
