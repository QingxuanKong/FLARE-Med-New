The patient is a 2-day-old male newborn with jaundice, mildly distended abdomen, and hepatosplenomegaly. The laboratory results show anemia (Hemoglobin 11 g/dL), increased reticulocytes (9%), and a positive anti-Rh antibody titer. The maternal blood group is Rh-negative, and the fetal blood group is Rh-negative. The serum bilirubin levels are elevated (total 11.3 mg/dL, direct 0.3 mg/dL). Given these findings, we can rule out Biliary duct malformation (C) as the cause of the jaundice. RBC sickling (A) is a concern given the family history of sickle cell disease, but the laboratory results do not support this diagnosis. Anti-B antibodies (D) are also less likely, as the patient's blood group is B, and the anti-B antibodies would be expected to react with the maternal blood group. The most likely cause of this patient's condition is hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), which is caused by anti-D antibodies. The positive anti-Rh antibody titer in the mother and the Rh-negative fetal blood group confirm this diagnosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" } ``` The patient's condition is most likely caused by hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), which is a condition where maternal anti-D antibodies cross the placenta and destroy the fetal red blood cells, leading to anemia and jaundice.

            "content": "Physical evidence of jaundice is observed in infants when bilirubin levels reach 5 to 10 mg/dL (versus 2 to 3 mg/dL in adults). When jaundice is observed, the laboratory evaluation for hyperbilirubinemia should include a total bilirubin measurement to determine the magnitude of hyperbilirubinemia. Bilirubin levels greater than 5 mg/dL on the first day of life or greater than 13 mg/dL thereafter in term infants should be evaluated further with measurement of indirect and direct bilirubin levels, blood typing, Coombs test, complete blood count, blood smear, and reticulocyte count. These tests must be performed before treatment of hyperbilirubinemia with phototherapy or exchange transfusion. In the absence of hemolysis or evidence for either the common or the rare causes of nonhemolytic indirect hyperbilirubinemia, the diagnosis is either physiologic or breast milk jaundice. Jaundice present after 2 weeks of age is pathologic and suggests a direct-reacting hyperbilirubinemia."

The dose of RhoGAM (300 \u03bcg) is based on the ability of this amount of anti-Rh-positive antibody to bind all the possible fetal Rh-positive erythrocytes entering the maternal circulation during the fetal-to-maternal transfusion at birth (approximately 30 mL). RhoGAM may bind Rh-positive fetal erythrocytes or interfere with maternal anti-Rh-positive antibody production by another, unknown mechanism. RhoGAM is effective only in preventing sensitization to the D antigen. Other blood group antigens that can cause immune hydrops and erythroblastosis include Rh C, E, Kell, and Duffy. Anti-Kell alloimmunity produces lower amniotic bilirubin levels and a lower reticulocyte count because, in addition to hemolysis, it inhibits erythropoiesis."

Fetal protection from unconjugated bilirubin is lost after delivery if not cleared rapidly. Because clearance is totally dependent on neonatal hepatic function, varying degrees of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia result. Even in the mature newborn, serum bilirubin levels usually rise for 3 to 4 days to reach up to 10 mg/ dL. After this, concentrations usually fall rapidly. In one large study, 1 to 2 percent of neonates delivered at 35 weeks' gestation or later had a maximum serum bilirubin level >20 mg/ dL (Eggert, 2006). Concomitant glucose-6-phosphate deiciency worsens hyperbilirubinemia (Chang, 2017).

Immune hydrops that results from Rh incompatibility can be predicted with reasonable certainty, because its severity correlates well with rapidly rising Rh antibody titers in the mother during pregnancy. Antenatal identification and management of the at-risk fetus have been facilitated by amniocentesis and the advent of chorionic villus and fetal blood sampling. The direct anti-globulin test (direct Coombs test) (Chapter 12) using fetal cord blood yields a positive result if the red cells have been coated by maternal antibody. In addition, cloning of the RHD gene has resulted in efforts to determine fetal Rh status by sequencing cell free DNA in maternal blood. When identified, cases of severe intrauterine hemolysis may be treated by fetal intravascular transfusions via the umbilical cord and early delivery.

There is an \u2191 risk among an Rh-women who have had a previous SAB or TAB as well as among those who have undergone a previous delivery with no RhoGAM given. Sensitized Rhmothers with titers > 1:16 should be closely monitored with serial ultrasound and amniocentesis for evidence of fetal hemolysis. In severe cases, initiate preterm delivery when fetal lungs are mature. Prior to delivery, intrauterine blood transfusions may be given to correct a low fetal hematocrit. If the mother is Rh at 28 weeks and the father is Rh or unknown, give RhoGAM (Rh immune globulin). If the baby is Rh , give RhoGAM postpartum."

The patient had noted progressive weakness over several days, to the point that he was unable to rise from bed. Past medical history was notable for small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, liver, and adrenals. The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced. Blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, increasing to 160/98 mmHg after 1 L of saline, with a JVP at 8 cm. There was generalized muscle weakness.

(Used with permission from Dr. April Bleich.) 15-5, these include decreased colloid oncotic pres sure, increased hydrostatic (or central venous) pressure, and enhanced vascular permeability. Immune hydrops results from transplacental passage of maternal antibodies that destroy fetal red cells. The resultant anemia stimulates marrow erythroid hyperplasia and extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen and liver. The latter likely causes portal hypertension and impaired hepatic protein synthesis, which lowers plasma oncotic pressure (Nicolaides, 1985). Fetal anemia also may raise central venous pressure (Weiner, 1989). Finally, tissue hypoxia from anemia may increase capillary permeability, such that luid collects in the fetal thorax, abdominal cavity, andlor subcutaneous tissue. he degree of anemia in immune hydrops is typically severe."

When jaundice appears, the serum bilirubin typically rises to levels ranging from 85\u2013340 \u03bcmol/L (5\u201320 mg/dL). The serum bilirubin may continue to rise despite falling serum aminotransferase levels. In most instances, the total bilirubin is equally divided between the conjugated and unconjugated fractions. Bilirubin levels >340 \u03bcmol/L (20 mg/dL) extending and persisting late into the course of viral hepatitis are more likely to be associated with severe disease. In certain patients with underlying hemolytic anemia, however, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and sickle cell anemia, a high serum bilirubin level is common, resulting from superimposed hemolysis. In such patients, bilirubin levels >513 \u03bcmol/L (30 mg/dL) have been observed and are not necessarily associated with a poor prognosis."

Anti-immunoglobulin antibodies were first developed by Robin Coombs, and the test for this disease is still called the Coombs test. Hemolytic disease of the newborn occurs when a mother makes IgG antibodies specific for the rhesus or Rh bloodgroup antigen expressed on the red blood cells of her fetus. Rh-negative mothers make these antibodies when they are exposed at delivery to Rh-positive fetal red blood cells bearing the paternally inherited Rh antigen. During subsequent pregnancies, these antibodies are transported across the placenta to the fetus. This normal process is generally beneficial, as it protects newborn infants against infection. However, IgG anti-Rh antibodies coat the fetal red blood cells, which are then destroyed by phagocytic cells in the liver, causing a hemolytic anemia in the fetus and newborn infant."
