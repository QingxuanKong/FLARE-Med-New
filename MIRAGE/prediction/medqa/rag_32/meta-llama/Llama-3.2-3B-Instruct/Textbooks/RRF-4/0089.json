    "question": "A 26-year-old G1P0 woman presents to her primary care physician\u2019s office with feelings of anxiety and trouble with sleep. She finds it difficult initiating sleep, occasionally has palpitations, and feels fatigued. She denies having similar symptoms in the past or starting any new medications or illicit drugs. She is currently 10 weeks pregnant and is closely followed by her obstetrician. Her temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/70 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical exam, the patient is mildly diaphoretic. The skin is warm and the thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged with thyroid bruits. Laboratory studies are significant for a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.01 \u00b5U/mL (normal is 0.5-5.0 \u00b5U/mL) and an elevated free thyroxine (FT4) that is inappropriate for her pregnancy. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including anxiety, palpitations, fatigue, and difficulty initiating sleep, which are consistent with an overactive thyroid gland. The physical examination findings of a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with thyroid bruits further support this diagnosis. The laboratory results show a low TSH level and an elevated FT4 level, indicating hyperthyroidism. However, the patient is pregnant, and the treatment options for hyperthyroidism during pregnancy must be carefully considered. Methimazole and propylthiouracil are commonly used antithyroid medications, but propylthiouracil is preferred during the first trimester of pregnancy due to a lower risk of congenital anomalies compared to methimazole. Radioiodine therapy is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of radiation exposure to the fetus. Thyroidectomy is not a suitable option during pregnancy. Therefore, the best treatment option for this patient is propylthiouracil.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Questioning of her parents reveals that they are homeless and have been living in their car (a small van). The nights have been cold, and they have used a small char-coal burner to keep warm inside the vehicle. What is the most likely diagnosis? What treatment should be instituted immediately? If her mother is pregnant, what additional measures should be taken?"

Symptoms of increased adrenergic stimulation include palpitations, nervous-ness, fatigue, emotional lability, hyperkinesis, and tremors. The most common GI symptoms include increased frequency of bowel movements and diarrhea. Female patients often develop amenorrhea, decreased fertility, and an increased incidence of miscarriages. Children experience rapid growth with early bone maturation, whereas older patients may present with cardiovas-cular complications such as atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure.On physical examination, weight loss and facial flush-ing may be evident. The skin is warm and moist, and African American patients often note darkening of their skin. Tachycar-dia or atrial fibrillation is present, with cutaneous vasodilation leading to a widening of the pulse pressure and a rapid falloff in the transmitted pulse"

He immediately fell to the ground unconscious, but after about 30 seconds he was helped to his feet and felt otherwise well. It was noted he had some bruising around his temple. He decided not to continue playing and went to watch the match from the side. Over the next hour he became extremely sleepy and was eventually unrousable. He was rushed to hospital. When he was admitted to hospital, the patient\u2019s breathing was shallow and irregular and it was necessary to intubate him. A skull radiograph demonstrated a fracture in the region of the pterion.
