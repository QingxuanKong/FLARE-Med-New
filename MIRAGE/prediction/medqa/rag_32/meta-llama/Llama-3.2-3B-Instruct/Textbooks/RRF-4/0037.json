    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the symptoms and laboratory results presented in the scenario. The patient is a 3-month-old boy with persistent diarrhea, oral candidiasis, and signs and symptoms suggestive of RSV pneumonia. He has a low weight percentile and is being evaluated for an immunodeficiency disease. Laboratory results show negative HIV PCR. The key to solving this question lies in identifying the immunodeficiency disease that is consistent with these symptoms and laboratory results. Oral candidiasis is a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV infection, but the negative HIV PCR result makes this less likely. Persistent diarrhea and RSV pneumonia are also common in patients with HIV infection, but the negative HIV PCR result again makes this less likely. The low weight percentile and signs of immunodeficiency suggest a primary immunodeficiency disease. Selective IgA deficiency is a primary immunodeficiency disease characterized by a lack of IgA antibodies, which can lead to recurrent infections, including oral candidiasis, diarrhea, and respiratory infections like RSV pneumonia. This disease is also consistent with the patient's low weight percentile and signs of immunodeficiency. Defective T cell function, grossly reduced levels of B cells, and defective isotype switching are all potential causes of immunodeficiency diseases, but they are not as specifically consistent with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results as selective IgA deficiency. Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings in this patient is selective IgA deficiency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The risk of opportunistic infections and other AIDS-defining conditions is related to the depletion of CD4 T cells. A combination of CD4 cell count and percentage and clinical manifestations is used to classify HIV infection in children (Tables 125-1 and 125-2). Initial symptoms with vertical transmission vary and may include failure to thrive, neurodevelopmental delay, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, chronic or recurrent diarrhea, interstitial pneumonia, or oral thrush.

In patients with primary immunodeficiencies, infections develop at multiple sites (e.g., ears, sinuses, lungs, skin), whereas in individuals with anatomic problems (e.g., sequestered pulmonary lobe, ureteral reflux), infections are confined to a single anatomic site. Asplenia is associated with recurrent and severe infections, even in the presence of protective antibody titers. Infection with HIV should be considered in any patient presenting with a history suggesting a T-cell immunodeficiency. The diagnosis of patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases depends on early recognition of signs and symptoms, followed by laboratory tests to evaluate immune function. Recognizing the patient who may have an immunodeficiency disease prompts an evaluation and referral to an immunologist (see Table 72-3)."

            "content": "Edward Chu, MD are the possible benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy? The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy. One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC). He undergoes surgical resection and is found to have high-risk stage III CRC with five positive lymph nodes. After surgery, he feels entirely well with no symptoms. Of note, he has no other illnesses. What is this patient\u2019s overall prognosis? Based on his prognosis, what"

            "content": "Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), once the hallmark of AIDS, has dramatically declined in incidence following the development of effective prophylactic regimens and the widespread use of cART. It is, however, still the single most common cause of pneumonia in patients with HIV infection in the United States and can be identified as a likely etiologic agent in 25% of cases of pneumonia in patients with HIV infection, with an incidence in the range of 2\u20133 cases per 100 person-years. Approximately 50% of cases of HIV-associated PCP occur in patients who are unaware of their HIV status. The risk of PCP is greatest among those who have experienced a previous bout of PCP and those who have CD4+ T cell counts of <200/\u03bcL. Overall, 79% of patients with PCP have CD4+ T cell counts <100/\u03bcL and 95% of patients have CD4+ T cell counts <200/\u03bcL. Recurrent fever, night sweats, thrush, and unexplained weight loss also are associated with an increased incidence of PCP. For these reasons, it is strongly"

            "content": "In addition to disease caused by specific secondary infections, patients with HIV infection may also experience a chronic diarrheal syndrome for which no etiologic agent other than HIV can be identified. This entity is referred to as AIDS enteropathy or HIV enteropathy. It is most likely a direct result of HIV infection in the GI tract. Histologic examination of the small bowel in these patients reveals low-grade mucosal atrophy with a decrease in mitotic figures, suggesting a hyporegenerative state. Patients often have decreased or absent small-bowel lactase and malabsorption with accompanying weight loss."

            "content": "In the United States, most pregnant women are screened and, if indicated, treated for HIV infection. Infants born to HIV-infected mothers receive prophylaxis and are prospectively tested for infection. The diagnosis of HIV infection in most infants born in the United States is confirmed before development of clinical signs of infection. HIV infection can be diagnosed definitively by 1 month of age and in virtually all infected infants by 6 months of age using viral diagnostic assays (RNA polymerase chain reaction [PCR], DNA PCR, or virus culture). Maternal antibodies may be detectable until 12 to 15 months of age, and a positive serologic test is not considered diagnostic until 18 months of age."

Patients with high levels of HIV RNA in plasma progress to symptomatic disease faster than do patients with low levels of HIV RNA (Fig. 226-22). Some patients referred to as long-term nonprogressors show little if any decline in CD4+ T cell counts over extended periods of time. These patients generally have extremely low levels of HIV RNA; a subset, referred to as elite nonprogressors, exhibits HIV RNA levels <50 copies/mL. Certain other patients remain entirely asymptomatic despite the fact that their CD4+ T cell counts show a steady progressive decline to extremely low levels. In these patients, the appearance of an opportunistic disease may be the first manifestation of HIV infection. During the asymptomatic period of HIV infection, the average rate of CD4+ T cell decline is ~50/\u03bcL per year. When the CD4+ T cell count falls to <200/\u03bcL, the resulting state of immunodeficiency is severe enough to place"
