He isolates a group of cells that are shown by flow cytometry to be positive for the cell surface marker CD8. He then mixes this cell population with a group of infected cells, crosslinks extracellular interactions, and immunoprecipitates the CD8 protein. He identifies a protein bound to CD8 that is composed of two chains from an adjacent cell. Which of the following best describes the primary function of the protein that was most likely identified?",

CD8+ T cells, also known as cytotoxic T cells, play a crucial role in the immune response by recognizing and killing virus-infected cells or tumor cells. The interaction between CD8+ T cells and MHC class I molecules is a key step in this process. In this scenario, the researcher has isolated CD8+ T cells and mixed them with infected cells, crosslinked extracellular interactions, and immunoprecipitated the CD8 protein. The fact that a protein bound to CD8 is composed of two chains from an adjacent cell suggests that it is a co-receptor, which is essential for the recognition of MHC class I molecules. Given the options, the most likely function of the protein is to bind exogenous peptides that are present in the endosome, which is a critical step in the presentation of antigens to CD8+ T cells. This allows the T cells to recognize and kill infected cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

They are characterized by the type of T-cell receptors they express and by the expression of certain markers. The two main classes of T cells express either a cell-surface protein called CD8 or another called CD4. These are not just random markers, but are important for a T cell\u2019s function, because they help to determine the interactions between the T cell and other cells. Recall from Section 1-10 that T cells detect peptides derived from foreign antigens that are displayed by MHC molecules on a cell\u2019s surface. CD8 and CD4 function in antigen recognition by recognizing different regions of MHC molecules and by being involved in the signaling of the T-cell receptor that is engaged with its antigen. Thus, CD4 and CD8 are known as co-receptors and they provide a functional difference between CD8 and CD4 T cells,"

CD4 and CD8 were known as markers for these functional sets for some time before it became clear that the distinction was based on the ability of T cells to recognize different classes of MHC molecules. We now know that CD8 recognizes MHC class I molecules and CD4 recognizes MHC class II. During antigen recognition, CD4 or CD8 (depending on the type of T cell) associates with the T-cell receptor on the T-cell surface and binds to invariant sites on the MHC portion of the composite peptide:MHC ligand, away from the peptide-binding site. This binding contributes to the overall effectiveness of the T-cell response, and so CD4 and CD8 are called co-receptors."

            "content": "The receptor for antigen on most T cells, the \u03b1:\u03b2 T-cell receptor, is composed of two protein chains, TCR\u03b1 and TCR\u03b2, and resembles in many respects a single Fab fragment of immunoglobulin. \u03b1:\u03b2 T-cell receptors are always membrane-bound and recognize a composite ligand of a peptide antigen bound to an MHC molecule. Each MHC molecule binds a wide variety of different peptides, but the different variants of MHC each preferentially recognize sets of peptides with particular sequences and physical features. The peptide antigen is generated intracellularly, and is bound stably in a peptide-binding cleft on the surface of the MHC molecule. There are two classes of MHC molecules, and these are bound in their nonpolymorphic domains by CD8 and CD4 molecules that distinguish two different functional classes of \u03b1:\u03b2 T cells. CD8 binds MHC class I molecules and can bind simultaneously to the same peptide:MHC class I complex being recognized by a T-cell receptor, thus acting as a co-receptor and"

Included in this very large Ig superfamily are antibodies, TCRs, MHC proteins, the CD4, CD8, and CD28 co-receptors, the B7 co-stimulatory proteins, and most of the invariant polypeptide chains associated with TCRs and BCRs, as well as the various Fc receptors on lymphocytes and other leukocytes. Many of these proteins are dimers or higher oligomers, in which Ig or Ig-like domains of one chain interact with those in another (Figure 24\u201348)."

Naive T cells fall into two large classes, of which one carries the co-receptor CD8 on its surface and the other bears the co-receptor CD4. CD8 T cells all differentiate into CD8 cytotoxic T cells (sometimes called cytotoxic lymphocytes, or CTLs), which kill their target cells (Fig. 9.28). They are important in the defense against intracellular pathogens, especially viruses. Virus-infected cells display fragments of viral proteins as peptide:MHC class I complexes on their surface, and these are recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes."

The CD3 proteins and \u03b6 chains do not bind antigens; instead, they are attached to the TCR and initiate intracellular biochemical signals after TCR recognition of antigen. T cells also express a number of other molecules that serve important functions in immune responses. CD4 and CD8 are expressed on distinct T-cell subsets and act as coreceptors during T-cell activation. During antigen recognition, CD4 molecules on T cells bind to invariant portions of class II MHC molecules (described later) on selected antigen-presenting cells (APCs); in an analogous fashion, CD8 binds to class I MHC molecules. CD4 is expressed on 50% to 60% of T cells, whereas CD8 is expressed on about 40% of T cells. The CD4-and CD8-expressing T cells\u2014 called CD4+ and CD8+ cells, respectively\u2014perform different but overlapping functions. CD4+ T cells are called helper T cells because they secrete soluble molecules http://ebooksmedicine.net"

Cd8 T cells can specifically mediate the destruction of infected or malignant cells. In order to do this, Cd8 T cells induce _______ cell death, which can be induced in two different ways. First, Cd8 T cells possess ligands such as _______, _______, or _______ that can induce the _______ apoptosis pathway. In contrast, cell death can also be induced through an intrinsic pathway. To initiate this mechanism, _______ are released, which allow the entrance of granzymes into the cell. once the granzymes have gained access to the cell\u2019s cytoplasm, these can cleave and activate _______, which in turn cleaves _______, allowing _______ to degrade dna. Granzyme B also cleaves _______, and as a consequence disrupts the mitochondrial membrane, allowing for release of _______ and formation of the _______."
