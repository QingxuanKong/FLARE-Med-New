She has a past medical history significant for sarcoidosis which was recently diagnosed 6 months ago and is currently being treated. She reports that the pain started 2 weeks ago and is localized to the left hip and groin. The pain has been getting progressively more intense. Her temperature is 98.1\u00b0F (36.7\u00b0C), blood pressure is 122/78 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: **Step 1: Analyze the patient's symptoms and medical history** The patient is a 39-year-old African-American woman with a recent diagnosis of sarcoidosis, which is an inflammatory disease that can affect various parts of the body, including the joints. She presents with hip pain that started 2 weeks ago and has been getting progressively more intense. The pain is localized to the left hip and groin. **Step 2: Consider the differential diagnosis** Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the differential diagnosis for hip pain in a patient with sarcoidosis includes: * Osteomyelitis (infection of the bone) * Septic arthritis (infection of the joint) * Avascular necrosis (death of bone tissue due to lack of blood supply) * Tendinitis or bursitis (inflammation of tendons or bursae) * Sarcoidosis-related joint inflammation **Step 3: Evaluate the options for diagnostic tests** The options for diagnostic tests include: * MRI of the hip (A) * Radiograph of the hip (B) * Radionuclide scan of the hip (C) * Ultrasound of the hip (D) **Step 4: Choose the most sensitive test** Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most sensitive test for diagnosing sarcoidosis-related joint inflammation is the MRI of the hip. MRI can detect changes in the joint and surrounding tissues, including inflammation and bone marrow edema, which are common in sarcoidosis. **Answer:** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest sarcoidosis-related joint inflammation, and the MRI of the hip is the most sensitive test for diagnosing this condition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The inflamed, swollen joint is usually evident on examination except in the case of a deeply situated joint such as the hip, shoulder, or sacroiliac joint. Cellulitis, bursitis, and acute osteomyelitis, which may produce a similar clinical picture, should be distinguished from septic arthritis by their greater range of motion and less-than-circumferential swelling. A focus of extraarticular infection, such as a boil or pneumonia, should be sought. Peripheral-blood leukocytosis with a left shift and elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level are common."

These complaints are new since she used to always feel \u201chot,\u201d noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to \u201cprotect her bones\u201d and omeprazole for \u201cheartburn.\u201d On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm. Her weight is 136 lb (61.8 kg), an increase of 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the last year. Her thyroid gland is not palpable and her reflexes are delayed. Laboratory findings include a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 24.9 \u03bcIU/mL"

She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula.

He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"
