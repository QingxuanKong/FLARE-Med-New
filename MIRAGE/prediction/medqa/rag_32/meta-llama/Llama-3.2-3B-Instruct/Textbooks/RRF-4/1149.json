At about 2 to 3 years of age, boys develop an awkward gait and an inability to run properly. Some have an antecedent history of mild slowness in attaining motor milestones or poor head control during infancy. Examination shows firm calf hypertrophy and mild to moderate proximal leg weakness with a hyperlordotic, waddling gait. The child typically arises from a lying position on the floor by using his arms to climb up his legs and body (Gower sign). Arm weakness is evident by age 6 years, and most boys are wheelchair dependent by age 12 years. Other manifestations include cardiomyopathy, scoliosis, respiratory decline, and, in some boys, cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. Many boys with Duchenne live into adulthood. Most die in their 20s or early 30s, usually as a result of progressive respiratory decline or cardiac dysfunction."

The height of the patient should remain close to the genetic potential, based on the parental heights, when reinterpreted for bone age (see Chapter 173). Usuallyheight gain is below, although fairly parallel to, the normal percentiles on the growth curve. The prepubertal nadir, or deceleration before their pubertal growth spurt, is prolonged or protracted. A family history of delayed puberty in a parent or sibling is reassuring. Spontaneous puberty usually begins in these patients by the time the bone age reaches 12 years in boys and 11 years in girls. Other causes of delayed puberty must be eliminated before a diagnosis of constitutional delay in puberty is made. Observation and reassurance are appropriate. Adult height normal for the genetic potential is generally attained. In some"

An infant with any of these three conditions should receive a careful examination of the hips. Every newborn requires a screening physical examination forDDH; further evaluation through at least the first 18 months of life is part of the physical examination for toddlers. DDHevolves over time, so the examination may change as the patientages. The examination starts with inspection for asymmetricalthigh and gluteal folds with the hips and knees flexed. A relativeshortening of the femur with asymmetrical skin folds is a positive Galeazzi sign and indicates DDH. Range of motion shouldbe assessed with the pelvis stabilized and the child supine onthe examining table, not in the parent\u2019s lap (Fig. 199-1). Hipabduction should easily reach or exceed 75\u00b0, and hip adductionshould reach 30\u00b0. Limitations may indicate contractures associated with DDH, especially decreased abduction."
