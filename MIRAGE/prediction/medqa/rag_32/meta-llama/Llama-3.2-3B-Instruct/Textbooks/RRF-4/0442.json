    "question": "A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by the police after a fall. The patient smells of alcohol and is slurring his words. You find out that he has recently been fired from his job as a salesperson for months of tardiness and poor performance. The police tell you that his girlfriend, who was there at the time of the fall, mentioned that the patient has been struggling with alcohol for at least a year. Upon physical examination, the patient becomes agitated and starts yelling. He accuses his ex-boss of being a cocaine addict and says he couldn\u2019t keep up sales percentages compared to someone using cocaine. Which of the following psychiatric defense mechanisms is the patient demonstrating?",

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the patient's behavior and words to identify the defense mechanism he is demonstrating. Let's break down the situation: The patient is slurring his words, smells of alcohol, and has been fired from his job due to tardiness and poor performance. He accuses his ex-boss of being a cocaine addict and compares his own performance to someone using cocaine. He also becomes agitated and starts yelling. The key here is to understand the relationship between the patient's words and actions. He is redirecting his anger and frustration towards his ex-boss, who he perceives as being superior, by accusing him of being a cocaine addict. This is a classic example of a defense mechanism known as projection. Projection is a defense mechanism where an individual attributes their own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or impulses to someone else. In this case, the patient is projecting his own feelings of inadequacy and frustration due to his own struggles with alcoholism onto his ex-boss. By doing so, he is able to avoid acknowledging his own flaws and taking responsibility for his actions. The other options do not fit the situation as well: denial is not evident as the patient is not refusing to acknowledge his problems, displacement is not present as the patient is not redirecting his feelings to a more acceptable target, and regression is not seen as the patient's behavior is not returning to an earlier, more childish state.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

This is usually in the form of monetary compensation, which, surprisingly, is sometimes less than that which the patient could earn if he returned to work. Most such patients are actively engaged in litigation when first seen. Another interesting feature is the frequency with which the patient expresses extreme dissatisfaction with the medical care given him; he is often hostile toward the physicians and nurses. Many of these patients have already been subjected to an excessive number of hospitalizations and rather dramatic mishaps have allegedly occurred in carrying out diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The majority of these patients were previously suspected of malingering."

            "content": "her medical record is checkered with instances of dramatic and unexplained illness. This calm attitude toward a turbulent illness and seemingly disabling physical signs is so common that it has been singled out as an important characteristic of hysteria, la belle indifference. Other patients, however, are obviously tense and anxious and report frank anxiety attacks. Emotional reactions are superficial and scenes that are disturbing to others are quickly forgotten. Claims of early life sexual or physical abuse are common and often prove to be true, or sometimes are not valid; when present, they probably play a role in the genesis of some cases (see further on)."

            "content": "Testing for apraxia is carried out in several ways. First, one observes the actions of the patient as he engages in simulated tasks as dressing, washing, shaving, and using eating utensils. Second, the patient is asked to carry out familiar symbolic acts\u2014wave goodbye, salute the flag, shake a fist as though angry, or blow a kiss. If he fails, he is asked to imitate such acts made by the examiner. Finally, he is asked to show how he would hammer a nail, brush his teeth, take a comb out of his pocket and comb his hair, or to execute a more complex act, such as lighting and smoking a cigarette or opening a bottle of soda, pouring some into a glass, and drinking it. These latter actions, involving more complex sequences, are said to be tests of ideational apraxia; the simpler and familiar acts are considered tests of ideomotor apraxia. To perform these tasks in the absence of the tool or utensil is always more demanding because the patient must mentally formulate a plan of action rather"

The examining physician discovers postural hypotension and moderate vitiligo (depigmented areas of skin) and obtains routine blood tests. She finds hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis and suspects Addison\u2019s disease. She performs a standard ACTH 1\u201324 stimulation test, which reveals an insufficient plasma cortisol response compatible with primary adrenal insuf-ficiency. The diagnosis of autoimmune Addison\u2019s disease is made, and the patient must start replacement of the hormones he cannot produce himself. How should this patient be treated? What precautions should he take?"

            "content": "The following three brief scenarios of a patient with hemoptysis demonstrate three distinct patterns: A 46-year-old man presents to his internist with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."

After admission a bronchoscopy was carried out and sputum was aspirated from the left upper lobe bronchus. This was cultured in the laboratory and also viewed under the microscope and tuberculous bacilli (TB) were identified. A 68-year-old man came to his family physician complaining of discomfort when swallowing (dysphagia). The physician examined the patient and noted since his last visit he had lost approximately 18 lb over 6 months. Routine blood tests revealed the patient was anemic and he was referred to the gastroenterology unit. A diagnosis of esophageal cancer was made and the patient underwent a resection, which involved a chest and abdominal incision. After 4 years the patient remains well though still subject to follow-up."
