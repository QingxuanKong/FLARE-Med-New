This pain has been happening every few days for 3 months. She says there is no association of the pain with food or exercise. She is able to climb up to her fourth floor apartment daily without issue. Her only past medical history is migraines for which she takes appropriate medication. Here temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. She has no known family history. The patient is not in pain on presentation and EKG in the office is normal. 24-hour ECG monitoring shows transient ST elevations during the episodes of pain that resolve completely. The mechanism of this patient\u2019s chest pain is most similar to the mechanism behind which of the following?",

The patient reports episodic chest pain described as squeezing and tightness, which occurs every few days for 3 months, without association with food or exercise. She is able to climb stairs without issue, and her EKG and physical examination are normal. The 24-hour ECG monitoring shows transient ST elevations during episodes of pain that resolve completely. These findings suggest that the patient's chest pain is likely related to vasospasm rather than myocardial ischemia or other cardiac causes. The mechanism of vasospasm involves the constriction of blood vessels, which can cause chest pain. Among the options, Raynaud's phenomenon is a condition characterized by vasospasm of the blood vessels in response to cold temperature or stress, leading to episodic chest pain, which is similar to the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the mechanism of this patient's chest pain is most similar to the mechanism behind Raynaud's phenomenon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

When the patient is asked to localize the sensation, he or she typically places a hand over the sternum, sometimes with a clenched fist, to indicate a squeezing, central, substernal discomfort (Levine\u2019s sign). Angina is usually crescendo-decrescendo in nature, typically lasts 2 to 5 min, and can radiate to either shoulder and to both arms (especially the ulnar surfaces of the forearm and hand). It also can arise in or radiate to the back, interscapular region, root of the neck, jaw, teeth, and epigastrium. Angina is rarely localized below the umbilicus or above the mandible. A useful finding in assessing a patient with chest discomfort is the fact that myocardial ischemic discomfort does not radiate to the trapezius muscles; that radiation pattern is more"

Assessment of a patient with chest pain includes a thorough history to determine activity at the onset; the location, radiation, quality, and duration of the pain; what makes the pain better and worse during the time that it is present; and any associated symptoms. A family history and assessment of how much anxiety the symptom is causing are important and often revealing. A careful general physical examination should focus on the chest wall, heart, lungs, and abdomen. A history of chest pain associated with exertion, syncope, or palpitations or acute onset associated with fever suggests a cardiac etiology. Cardiac causes of chest pain are generally ischemic, inflammatory, or arrhythmic in origin."

A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative."

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases. A blood smear shows ring forms of Plasmodium falciparum at 1.5% parasit-emia. What treatment should be started?"

            "content": "Pain is the most common presenting complaint in patients with STEMI. The pain is deep and visceral; adjectives commonly used to 1600 describe it are heavy, squeezing, and crushing, although, occasionally, it is described as stabbing or burning (Chap. 19). It is similar in character to the discomfort of angina pectoris (Chap. 293) but commonly occurs at rest, is usually more severe, and lasts longer. Typically, the pain involves the central portion of the chest and/or the epigastrium, and, on occasion, it radiates to the arms. Less common sites of radiation include the abdomen, back, lower jaw, and neck. The frequent location of the pain beneath the xiphoid and epigastrium and the patients\u2019 denial that they may be suffering a heart attack are chiefly responsible for the common mistaken impression of indigestion. The pain of STEMI may radiate as high as the occipital area but not below the umbilicus. It is often accompanied by weakness, sweating, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, and a sense"

However, because the findings on physical examination may be normal in patients with unstable ischemic heart disease, an unremarkable physical exam is not definitively reassuring."

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."
