He reports that his symptoms started after he lifted heavy weights at the gym. Physical examination shows loss of sensation on the lateral side of the right forearm. Sensation over the thumb is intact. Range of motion of the neck is normal. His symptoms do not worsen with axial compression or distraction of the neck. Further examination of this patient is most likely to show weakness of which of the following actions?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's analyze the given information and the options provided. The patient presents with a 2-day history of tingling sensation in the right forearm after lifting heavy weights at the gym. The physical examination shows loss of sensation on the lateral side of the right forearm, but sensation over the thumb is intact. This suggests a radial nerve involvement since the thumb is innervated by the median nerve, which is not affected. The symptoms do not worsen with axial compression or distraction of the neck, which suggests that the lesion is likely below the level of the neck. The options provided are related to the actions of the muscles innervated by the radial nerve. The radial nerve innervates the extensor muscles of the forearm, which are responsible for wrist extension. Therefore, the most likely action to be weak is wrist extension. This is because the radial nerve is responsible for the motor function of the extensor muscles of the wrist and fingers, and wrist extension is the primary action that would be affected by a radial nerve lesion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Placing the fist in a palm-down position on the table and pressing the middle phalanges onto the table effectively immobilizes the action of the extensor digitorum. The freshman was therefore unable to elevate his middle finger (which was sticking out). It is important to remember that if this same procedure is carried out leaving the index or little finger free to move, they do. This is because these two digits are extended not only by the extensor digitorum muscle but also by the extensor indicis muscle (index finger) and extensor digiti minimi muscle (little finger). A 70-year-old woman came to an orthopedic surgeon with right shoulder pain and failure to initiate abduction of the shoulder. Further examination revealed loss of muscle bulk in the supraspinous fossa. The supraspinatus muscle was damaged."

The pain began after a fall on his outstretched hand approximately 6 months previously. The patient recalled having some minor shoulder tenderness but no other specific symptoms. He was otherwise fit and well. On examination of the shoulder, there was marked wasting of the muscles in the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae. The patient found initiation of abduction difficult and there was a weakness of lateral rotation of the humerus. The wasted muscles were the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The cause of the muscle wasting was disuse. Muscle atrophy (wasting) occurs through a variety of disorders. Disuse atrophy is one of the most common causes. Examples of disuse atrophy include the loss of muscle bulk after fracture immobilization in a plaster cast. The opposite effect can also be demonstrated\u2014when muscles are overused they become bulkier (hypertrophy)."

There is slight wasting and weakness of the hypothenar, interosseous, adductor pollicis, and deep flexor muscles of the fourth and fifth fingers (i.e., the muscles innervated by the lower trunk of the brachial plexus and ulnar nerve). Weakness of the flexor muscles of the forearm may be present in advanced cases. Tendon reflexes are usually preserved. In addition, most patients complain of an intermittent aching of the arm, particularly of the ulnar side, and about half of them complain also of numbness and tingling along the ulnar border of the forearm and hand. A loss of superficial sensation in these areas is variable. It may be possible to reproduce the sensory symptoms by firm pressure just above the clavicle or by traction on the arm. Vascular features are often absent or minimal in patients with the neurologic form of the syndrome."

The symptoms and signs consist of wristdrop; finger extension weakness; thumb abduction weakness; and sensory loss in the dorsal web between the thumb and index finger. Triceps and brachioradialis strength is often normal, and triceps reflex is often intact. Most cases of radial neuropathy are transient compressive (neuropraxic) injuries that recover spontaneously in 6\u20138 weeks. If there has been prolonged compression and severe axonal damage, it may take several months to recover. Treatment consists of cock-up wrist and finger splints, avoiding further compression, and physical therapy to avoid flexion contracture. If there is no improvement in 2\u20133 weeks, an EDx study is recommended to confirm the clinical diagnosis and determine the degree of severity."

In the type described by Hirayama and associates, young men are affected with progressive and asymmetrical amyotrophy of the forearm and hand that has been traced to ligamentous hypertrophy and buckling in the ventral spinal canal. This causes a compression of the cervical spinal cord gray matter, presumably by a chronic ischemic effect as discussed in detail in Chap. 42.

This muscle can be further tested by having the patient press his head forward against resistance or lift his head from the pillow. Weakness of the trapezius can be demonstrated by asking the patient to shrug his shoulders; the affected side will be found to be weaker, and there will often be evident atrophy of the upper part of the trapezius. With the arms at the sides, the shoulder on the affected side droops and the scapula is slightly winged;"

            "content": "A 65-year-old man was admitted to the emergency room with severe central chest pain that radiated to the neck and predominantly to the left arm. He was overweight and a known heavy smoker. On examination he appeared gray and sweaty. His blood pressure was 74/40 mm Hg (normal range 120/80 mm Hg). An electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed and demonstrated anterior myocardial infarction. An urgent echocardiograph demonstrated poor left ventricular function. The cardiac angiogram revealed an occluded vessel (Fig. 3.114A,B). Another approach to evaluating coronary arteries in patients is to perform maximum intensity projection (MIP) CT studies (Fig. 3.115A,B). This patient underwent an emergency coronary artery bypass graft and made an excellent recovery. He has now lost weight, stopped smoking, and exercises regularly."

Look for evidence of wasting of the thenar muscles. Tinel\u2019s sign should be tested over the median nerve from the volar wrist flexion crease to the proximal palm, although this test has significant interexam-iner variability.47 Applying pressure over the carpal tunnel while flexing the wrist has been shown in one series to have the high-est sensitivity when compared to Phalen\u2019s and Tinel\u2019s signs.48 Strength of the thumb in opposition should also be tested.Early treatment of CTS consists of conservative man-agement. The patient is given a splint to keep the wrist at 20\u00b0 extension worn at nighttime. Many patients can have years of symptom relief with this management. As a treatment and diag-nostic modality, corticosteroid"

The full syndrome is characterized by pain at the trapezius ridge and tip of the shoulder, with radiation into the anterior-upper part of the arm, radial forearm, often the thumb, and sometimes the index finger as well. There may also be paresthesia and sensory impairment in the same regions; tenderness in the area above the spine of the scapula and in the supraclavicular and biceps regions; weakness in flexion of the forearm (biceps) and in contraction of the deltoid when sustaining arm abduction; and diminished or absent biceps and supinator reflexes (the triceps reflex is retained or sometimes has the appearance of being slightly exaggerated because of flaccidity of the biceps)."

            "content": "The typical patient with angina is a man >50 years or a woman >60 years of age who complains of episodes of chest discomfort, usually described as heaviness, pressure, squeezing, smothering, or choking and only rarely as frank pain. When the patient is asked to localize the sensation, he or she typically places a hand over the sternum, sometimes with a clenched fist, to indicate a squeezing, central, substernal discomfort (Levine\u2019s sign). Angina is usually crescendo-decrescendo in nature, typically lasts 2 to 5 min, and can radiate to either shoulder and to both arms (especially the ulnar surfaces of the forearm and hand). It also can arise in or radiate to the back, interscapular region, root of the neck, jaw, teeth, and epigastrium. Angina is rarely localized below the umbilicus or above the mandible. A useful finding in assessing a patient with chest discomfort is the fact that myocardial ischemic discomfort does not radiate to the trapezius muscles; that radiation pattern is more"

The Phalen maneuver consists of hyperflexion of the wrist for 30 to 60 s\u2014usually performed by opposing the outer surfaces of the hands with the wrists flexed. The Tinel sign is elicited by lightly tapping the volar aspect of the wrist at the transverse carpal ligament (distal to the first wrist crease). Both of these tests are meant to elicit pain or paresthesias over the digits innervated by the median nerve. The sensitivity of these tests is close to 50 percent, but their specificity is considerably higher. Other tests involving prolonged pressure over the median nerve have been devised, but they are of uncertain value, for example, Durken\u2019s test of the Phalen maneuver combined with digital compression of the nerve."

The pain is along the medial side of the forearm and the sensory loss is in the distribution of the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm and of the ulnar nerve in the hand. The weakness largely involves the intrinsic muscles supplied by the ulnar nerve (see \u201cUlnar Nerve\u201d in Chap. 43). The reflexes may be unaffected but the triceps jerk is often slightly reduced."
