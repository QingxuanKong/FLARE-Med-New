According to Document [5] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison), Clostridium species are anaerobic spore-forming gram-positive rods that are isolated from wounds, abscesses, sites of abdominal infection, and blood. Document [25] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) states that Clostridium species are obligately anaerobic, meaning they require a reduced oxygen environment to grow. Document [5] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) also mentions that most species of Clostridium are motile by means of peritrichous flagella and can form endospores. These characteristics are typical of obligate anaerobes, not facultative anaerobes. Facultative anaerobes, on the other hand, can grow in the presence or absence of oxygen and may not require a reduced oxygen environment to grow. Based on the information provided, it can be concluded that bacteria in the genus Clostridium are not facultative anaerobes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

(In contrast, microaerophilic bacteria can grow in an atmosphere of 10% CO2 in air or under anaerobic or aerobic conditions, although they grow best in the presence of only a small amount of atmospheric oxygen, and facultative bacteria can grow in the presence or absence of air). Most clinically relevant anaerobes, such as Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Fusobacterium nucleatum, are relatively aerotolerant. Although they can survive for sustained periods in the presence of up to 2\u20138% oxygen, they generally do not multiply in this environment. A smaller number of pathogenic anaerobic bacteria (which are also part of the microbiota) die after brief contact with oxygen, even in low concentrations."

One of the most important roles that anaerobes serve as components of the normal colonic microbiota is the promotion of resistance to colonization; the presence of anaerobic bacteria effectively interferes with colonization by potentially pathogenic bacterial species through the depletion of oxygen and nutrients, the production of enzymes and toxic end products, and the modulation of the host\u2019s intestinal innate immune response.

            "content": "When cultures of obviously infected sites or purulent material yield no growth, streptococci only, or a single aerobic species (such as E. coli) and Gram\u2019s staining reveals a mixed flora, the involvement of anaerobes should be suspected; the implication is that the anaerobic microorganisms have failed to grow because of inadequate transport and/ or culture techniques. Failure of an infection to respond to antibiotics that are not active against anaerobes (e.g., aminoglycosides and\u2014in some circumstances\u2014penicillin, cephalosporins, or tetracyclines) suggests an anaerobic etiology."

Metronidazole is selectively absorbed by anaerobic bacteria and sensitive protozoa. Once taken up by anaerobes, it is nonenzymatically reduced by reacting with reduced ferredoxin. This reduction * The authors thank Henry F. Chambers, MD and Daniel H. Deck, PharmD, for their contributions to previous editions of this chapter. results in products that accumulate in and are toxic to anaerobic cells. The metabolites of metronidazole are taken up into bacterial DNA, forming unstable molecules. This action occurs only when metronidazole is partially reduced, and, because this reduction usually happens only in anaerobic cells, it has relatively little effect on human cells or aerobic bacteria."
