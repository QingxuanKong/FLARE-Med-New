    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the provided documents to determine if lysozyme is abundant in human tears. We know that lysozyme is an enzyme that breaks down the cell walls of bacteria and is present in various bodily secretions, including saliva, tears, and mucus. According to document [2], lysozyme is a natural antibiotic in egg white, saliva, tears, and other secretions. Document [3] also mentions that lysozyme is a glycosidase that breaks a specific chemical bond in the peptidoglycan component of the bacterial cell wall. Document [4] states that the tear cationic protein lactoferrin increases the activity of various antimicrobial agents such as lysozyme. Document [12] explicitly states that lysozyme selectively cleaves the \\u00D7-(1,4) linkage between N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) in peptidoglycan, which is a component of the bacterial cell wall. Based on this information, it can be inferred that lysozyme is indeed present in human tears and plays a role in protecting the eye from bacterial infections.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The thin film of tears covering the corneal surface is not homogeneous but a mixture of products secreted by the lacrimal glands, the accessory lacrimal glands, the goblet cells of the conjunctiva, and the tarsal glands of the eyelid. The tear film contains proteins (tear albumins, lactoferrin), enzymes (lysozyme), lipids, metabolites, electrolytes, and drugs, the latter secreted during therapy.

Lysozyme catalyzes the cutting of polysaccharide chains in the cell walls of bacteria. The bacterial cell is under pressure from osmotic forces, and cutting even a small number of these chains causes the cell wall to rupture and the cell to burst. A relatively small and stable protein that can be easily isolated in large quantities, lysozyme was the first enzyme to have its structure worked out in atomic detail by x-ray crystallography (in the mid-1960s)."

IgA in secretions (tears, saliva, nasal secretions, gastrointestinal tract fluid, and human milk) is in the form of secretory IgA (sIgA), a polymer consisting of two IgA monomers, a joining molecule, again called the J chain, and a glycoprotein called the secretory protein. Of the two IgA subclasses, IgA1 is primarily found in serum, whereas IgA2 is more prevalent in secretions. IgA fixes complement via the alternative complement pathway and has potent antiviral activity in humans by prevention of virus binding to respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelial cells."

            "content": "(LPS). Lipopolysaccharide is composed of a lipid, lipid A (turquoise circles), to which is attached a polysaccharide core (small turquoise hexagons). Lysozyme (lower panels) cleaves \u03b2-(1,4) linkages between GlcNAc and MurNAc, creating a defect in the peptidoglycan layer and exposing the underlying cell membrane to other antimicrobial agents. Lysozyme is more effective against Gram-positive bacteria because of the relatively greater accessibility of the peptidoglycan."
