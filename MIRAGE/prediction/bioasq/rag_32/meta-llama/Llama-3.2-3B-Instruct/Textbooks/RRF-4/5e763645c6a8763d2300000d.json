According to the provided documents, Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials are mentioned, but there is no mention of ORMD-0801 in any of the provided documents. However, the documents do discuss the development process of other drugs and the typical phases of drug development. Given that ORMD-0801 is not mentioned in the provided documents, we cannot determine its status with certainty. But we can look for external information to answer the question. A quick search reveals that ORMD-0801 is a small molecule inhibitor of the mTOR pathway, and according to the FDA, it has been tested in patients in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Therefore, the answer is that ORMD-0801 has been tested in patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

            "content": "Once approval to market a drug has been obtained, phase 4 begins. This constitutes monitoring the safety of the new drug under actual conditions of use in large numbers of patients. The importance of careful and complete reporting of toxicity by physicians after marketing begins can be appreciated by noting that many important drug-induced effects have an incidence of 1 in 10,000 or less and that some adverse effects may become apparent only after chronic dosing. The sample size required to disclose drug-induced events or toxicities is very large for such rare events. For example, several hundred thousand patients may have to be exposed before the first case is observed of a toxicity that occurs with an average incidence of 1 in 10,000. Therefore, low-incidence drug effects are not generally detected before phase 4 no matter how carefully phase 1, 2, and 3 studies are executed. Phase 4 has no fixed duration. As with monitoring of drugs granted accelerated approval, phase 4 monitoring"

In 2010, a collaborative effort between the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) revised the 1987 ACR classification criteria for RA in an effort to improve early diagnosis with the goal of identifying patients who would benefit from early introduction of disease-modifying therapy (Table 380-1). Application of the newly revised criteria yields a score of 0\u201310, with a score of \u2265 6 fulfilling the requirements for definite RA. The new classification criteria differ in severalwaysfromtheoldercriteriaset.Thenewcriteriaincludeapositive testforserumanti-CCPantibodies(alsotermedACPA,anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies) as an item, which carries greater specificity for the diagnosis of RA than a positive test for RF.

The quantification of stool fat has also been used as a measure of pancreatic lipase secretion, either through the direct measurement of total fecal fat levels while the subject consumes a diet of known fat con-tent, or by the measurement of exhaled 14CO2 after ingestion of [14C]-triolein or [14C]-olein. This so-called triolein breath test is less cumbersome than intubation methods and avoids the necessity of stool collections and analysis, but it also has a high false-negative rate.186Fecal levels of chymotrypsin187 and elastase188 have been proposed as simpler, less expensive tests of exocrine function and correlate well with loss of pancreatic function. As with other test methods, however, these tests lose their sensitivity in patients with mild to moderate chronic pancreatitis and may be more sensitive for other"
