They are infiltrative and result in significant neurologic impairment because of the disruption of critical nearby structures. Although they may not show typical high-grade features such as necrosis or vascular proliferation, they often behave aggressively. These lesions typically have acquired point mutations in histone H3, the consequence of which is loss of a lysine residue that is the target of post-translational modifications that regulate gene expression, another example of oncogenesis via alteration of the cancer cell \u201cepigenome\u201d. Precisely how this mutation contributes to cellular transformation remains to be determined. http://ebooksmedicine.net Fig. 23.30 Inoligodendroglioma,tumorcellshaveroundnuclei,oftenwithaclearcytoplasmichalo.Bloodvesselsinthebackgroundarethinandcanformaninterlacingpattern."

The childhood tumors of neuroectodermal origin would seem to be particularly attractive as models to explore genetic alterations and indeed, various changes such as the amplification of the MYCN oncogene has been associated with an aggressive clinical course and poor outcome in neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma.

However, its behavior and its appearance on imaging, as well as the property of diffuse infiltration of neoplastic glial cells, involving much of one or both cerebral hemispheres without a discrete tumor mass, establishes it as a useful conceptualization for clinical purposes. Whether this type of \u201cgliomatosis\u201d represents neoplastic transformation of multicentric origin or direct spread from one or more small neoplastic foci is not known. For these and other reasons, the tumor is impossible to classify (or to grade) using the conventional brain tumor schemes.

Other early changes include overexpression of genes that control growth factors or their receptors as noted below. After the tumor develops, progression to a more malignant grade of astrocytoma or to a glioblastoma may be triggered by defects causing overexpression of the epidermal growth factor gene. In fact, it is striking that analysis of the patterns of these defects in some tumors correlates with the staging and aggressive characteristics of these tumors. The events that lead to their accumulation are not clear, as noted below. Also, mutations in the genes that code for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1 and 2) are common in gliomas and oligodendrogliomas and their presence relates to slower tumor progression."

These mutations may occur in IDH1 or IDH2 and lead to increased production of 2-hydroxyglutarate, which interferes with the activity of several enzymes that regulate gene expression (Chapter 6). Mutations in the promoter for telomerase, which contribute to the immortalization of tumor cells (Chapter 6), are seen in glioblastomas and other astrocytic tumors. In tumors with IDH mutations, telomerase mutations are uncommon; instead, these tumors often have loss of function mutations in ATRX, which normally suppresses recombination events that can preserve telomere length, a mechanism called alternative lengthening of telomeres."

Methylation of certain genomic regions is inherited (imprinting), and it is involved in the silencing of one of the two X chromosomes in females (X-inactivation). Alterations in methylation can also be acquired, e.g., in cancer cells. Covalent posttranslational modifications of histones play an important role in altering DNA accessibility and chromatin structure and hence in regulating transcription. Histones can be reversibly modified in their amino-terminal tails, which protrude from the nucleosome core particle, by acetylation of lysine, phosphorylation of serine, methylation of lysine and arginine residues, and sumoylation. Acetylation of histones by histone acetylases (HATs), e.g., leads to unwinding of chromatin and accessibility to transcription factors.

            "content": "Originally, glioblastoma was thought to be derived from and composed of primitive embryonal cells, or, in the late decades of the twentieth century, to arise through anaplasia of maturing astrocytes. However, these views have been called into question because models of malignant transformation of neural stem cells or of glial progenitor cells explain many of the characteristics and behavior of gliomas. The location, cellular and genetic heterogeneity, and manner of growth and spread of these tumors are consistent with an origin in a primitive cell. Sanai and colleagues have summarized the case for stem cell origin, but this notion is not universally accepted and potential deficiencies in this theory are noted by Reid and coworkers. The genetic or epigenetic events that putatively lead to a malignant evolution of these progenitor cells are not known but some aspects are discussed below. Ironically, this is a reversion to the idea of the early last century that posited an embryonal"

We shall return to these phenomena in the final section of Chapter 22, where we discuss stem cells and the ways in which one cell type can be converted into another. Although a great deal remains to be learned about the functions of different chromatin structures, the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes was probably crucial for the evolution of eukaryotes like ourselves. To form a complex multicellular organism, the cells in different lineages must specialize by changing the accessibility and activity of many hundreds of genes. As described in Chapter 21, this process depends on cell memory: each cell holds a record of its past developmental history in the regulatory circuits that control its many genes. That record, it seems, is partly stored in the structure of the chromatin."

            "content": "The most important adverse prognostic factors in patients with high-grade astrocytomas are older age, histologic features of glioblastoma, poor Karnofsky performance status, and unresectable tumor. Patients whose tumor contains an unmethylated MGMT promoter resulting in the presence of the repair enzyme in tumor cells and resistance to temozolomide also have a worse prognosis. Gliomatosis Cerebri Rarely, patients may present with a highly infiltrating, nonenhancing tumor of variable histologic grade involving more than two lobes of the brain. These tumors may be indolent initially, but will eventually behave aggressively and have a poor outcome. Treatment involves RT and temozolomide chemotherapy. Oligodendrogliomas account for approximately 15\u201320% of gliomas. They are classified by the WHO into well-differentiated oligodendrogliomas (grade II) or anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (AOs) (grade III). Tumors with oligodendroglial components have distinctive pathologic"

            "content": "In cancer, the epigenome is characterized by simultaneous losses and gains of DNA methylation in different genomic regions, as well as repressive histone modifications. Hyperand hypomethylation are associated with mutations in genes that control DNA methylation. Hypomethylation is thought to remove normal control mechanisms that prevent expression of repressed DNA regions. It is also associated with genomic instability. Hypermethylation, in contrast, results in the silencing of CpG islands in promoter regions of genes, including tumor-suppressor genes. Epigenetic alterations are considered to be more easily reversible compared to genetic changes, and modification of the epigenome with demethylating agents and histone deacetylases is being explored in clinical trials. Several organisms have been studied extensively as genetic models, including M. musculus (mouse), D. melanogaster (fruit fly),"
