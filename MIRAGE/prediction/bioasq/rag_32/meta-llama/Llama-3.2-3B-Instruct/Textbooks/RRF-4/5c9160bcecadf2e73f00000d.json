Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the shared p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, used in the treatment of various autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and Crohn's disease. It was developed by Raptakrt Pharmaceuticals, which was acquired by Janssen Biotech in 2011. Janssen Biotech is a subsidiary of Johnson \\u2013 Johnson and Johnson.

Mechanism of Action: Ustekinumab is an IL-12 and IL-23 antagonist. It is a fully human IgG monoclonal antibody to the p40 protein subunit, which is part of both IL-12 and IL-23. These two cytokines are important contributors to the chronic inflammation in psoriasis plaques, PsA, and Crohn\u2019s disease. Ustekinumab prevents the binding of the p40 subunit of both IL-12 and IL-23 to the IL-12 receptor b1 found on the surface of CD4 T cells and NK cells.

After molar evacuation, local uterine invasion occurred in 31%, and metastases developed in 8.8% of the 352 high-risk patients. For the 506 low-risk patients, local invasion was found in only 3.4%, and metastases developed in 0.6%. Older patients are at increased risk of developing postmolar GTN. One study reported that persistent tumor developed after a complete molar pregnancy in 37% of women older than 40 years (27), whereas in another study this finding occurred in 60% of women older than 50 years (31). Partial Hydatidiform Mole Persistent tumor, usually nonmetastatic, develops in approximately 2% to 4% of patients with a partial mole, and chemotherapy is required to achieve remission (32). Patients who develop persistent disease have no distinguishing clinical or pathologic characteristics (33)."

            "content": "Other work using mice has shown that the mutations in transcription factors found in AML are not sufficient to cause the disease. Putative collaborating mutations in several other tyrosine kinase genes and in the RAS gene have been detected. Sequencing of the AML genomes also has identified frequent mutations in genes that directly impact the epigenome, suggesting that epigenetic alterations have a central role in AML. For example, about 15% to 20% of AMLs are associated with mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). In such tumors, an \u201concometabolite\u201d synthesized by the mutated IDH protein blocks the function of enzymes that regulate the epigenome and interferes with myeloid cell differentiation (discussed in Chapter 6). Inhibitors of mutant IDH prevent the production of the oncometabolite and often produce remissions in this particular molecular subtype of AML."
