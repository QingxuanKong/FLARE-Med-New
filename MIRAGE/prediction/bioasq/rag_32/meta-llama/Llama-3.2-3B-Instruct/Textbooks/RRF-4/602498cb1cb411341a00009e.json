In patients with locally advanced disease, ADT in combination with external-beam radiation or as an adjuvant therapy (after prostatectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy) also has been shown to improve survival. However, ADT is being increasingly used as primary therapy in men with localized disease and in men encountering biochemical recurrence without clear evidence of survival advantage. Because most men with prostate cancer die of conditions other than their primary malignancy, recognition and management of these adverse effects is paramount."

In the presence of the PARP inhibitor olaparib, single-strand breaks accumulate. When a replication fork encounters a sin-gle-strand break, it converts it to a double-strand break, which in normal cells is then repaired by homologous recombination. In cells defective for homologous recombination, however, inhibition of PARP triggers cell death. Patients who have only one functional copy of the Brca1 gene, which is required for homologous recombination, are at much higher risk for cancer of the breast and ovary. Cancers that arise in these tissues in these patients can be treated successfully with olaparib.

This seeming paradox is related to the wide variation in the natural history of prostate cancer, from aggressive and rapidly fatal to indolent disease of no clinical significance. Indeed, prostate carcinoma commonly is found incidentally at autopsy in men dying of other causes, and many more men die with prostate cancer than of prostate cancer. It is not currently possible to identify the tumors that will be \u201cbad actors\u201d with certainty; thus, while some men are no doubt saved by early detection and treatment of their prostate cancers, it is equally certain that others are being \u201ccured\u201d of clinically inconsequential tumors."

            "content": "Active Surveillance Although prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer affecting men in the United States, patients are being diagnosed earlier and more frequently present with early-stage disease. Active surveillance, described previously as watchful waiting or deferred therapy, is the policy of monitoring the illness at fixed intervals with DREs, PSA measurements, and repeat prostate biopsies as indicated until histopathologic or serologic changes correlative of progression warrant treatment with curative intent. It evolved from studies that evaluated predominantly elderly men with well-differentiated tumors who demonstrated no clinically significant progression for protracted periods, recognition of the contrast between incidence and disease-specific mortality, the high prevalence of autopsy cancers, and an effort to reduce overtreatment. A recent screening study estimated that between 50\u2013100 men with low-risk disease would need to be treated to prevent one prostate"
