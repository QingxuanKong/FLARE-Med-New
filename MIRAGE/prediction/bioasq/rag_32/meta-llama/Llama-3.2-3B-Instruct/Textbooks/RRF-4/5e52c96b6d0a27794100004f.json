Dietary carbohydrate and blood glucose Some carbohydrate-containing foods produce a rapid rise followed by a steep fall in blood glucose concentration, whereas others result in a gradual rise followed by a slow decline (Fig. 27.18). Thus, they differ in their glycemic response (GR). [Note: Fiber blunts the GR.] The glycemic index (GI) ranks carbohydrate-rich foods on a scale of 0\u2013100 based on the GR they cause relative to the GR caused by the same amount (50 g) of carbohydrate eaten in the form of white bread or glucose. A low GI is <55, whereas a high GI is \u226570. Evidence suggests that a low-GI diet improves glycemic control in diabetic individuals. Food with a low GI tends to create a sense of satiety over a longer period of time and may be helpful in limiting caloric intake. [Note: How much a typical serving size of a food raises blood glucose is referred to as the glycemic load (GL). A food (for example, carrots) can have a high GI and a low GL.] C.

Major groups of dietary flavonoids include anthocyanidins in berries; catechins in green tea and chocolate; flavonols (e.g., quercitin) in broccoli, kale, leeks, onions, and the skins of grapes and apples; and isoflavones (e.g., genistein) in legumes. Isoflavones have a low bioavailability and are partially metabolized by the intestinal flora. The dietary intake of flavonoids is estimated at 10\u2013100 mg/d; this figure is almost certainly an underestimate attributable to a lack of information on their concentrations in many foods. Several flavonoids have antioxidant activity and affect cell signaling.

As discussed earlier, adiponectin secretion from adipose tissue is reduced in obese individuals. Adiponectin suppresses cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis. It also counteracts the actions of p53 and p21.

Ghrelin is produced in the stomach and the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. It increases food intake, acting most likely by stimulating the NPY/AgRP neurons in the hypothalamus. Ghrelin levels normally rise before meals and fall 1 to 2 hours afterward, but this drop is attenuated in obese persons. Ghrelin levels are lower in obese individuals as compared to those with normal weight, and they increase with a reduction in obesity. Interestingly, the rise in ghrelin levels is much reduced in individuals in whom gastric bypass surgery is performed for the treatment of obesity, suggesting that the beneficial effects of such surgery may be in part due to a reduced surface of gastric mucosa that is exposed to food."

To achieve weight reduction, the obese patient must decrease energy intake or increase energy expenditure, although decreasing energy intake is thought to contribute more to inducing weight loss. Typically, a plan for weight reduction combines dietary change; increased physical activity; and behavioral modification, which can include nutrition education and meal planning, recording food intake through food diaries, modifying factors that lead to overeating, and relearning cues to satiety. Medications or surgery may be recommended.
