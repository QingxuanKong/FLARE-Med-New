These agents are extremely expensive in the USA ($75,000\u2013$120,000 for one course of treatment), but the manufacturers justify the cost as being less than the alternative (which is often a liver transplant). In fact, these \u201cspecialty drugs\u201d represent one third of the drug spending in the USA. Because the US Congress currently prohibits price negotiations by the largest purchaser of drugs (Medicare), the public has no protection from excessive pricing by manufacturers. Currently, only the Veteran\u2019s Administration and the largest private pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) agencies are able to negotiate prices, and as a result, drug expenses constitute a large and growing burden to patients, Medicare, and private health insurers."

As shown in Figure 18\u201310B, an apoptotic signal results in activation of Bh3-only proteins, which interact with a long hydrophobic groove in anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family proteins, thereby preventing them from blocking apoptosis. Using the crystal structure of the groove, the drug shown in (A), called ABt-737, was designed and synthesized to bind tightly in the groove, as shown for the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family protein, BclXL, in (B). By inhibiting the activity of these proteins, the drug promotes apoptosis in any cell that depends on them for survival. (pDB code: 2YXJ.) how many forms of programmed cell death exist? What are the underlying mechanisms and benefits of each? thousands of caspase substrates have been identified. Which ones are the critical proteins that must be cleaved to trigger the major cell remodeling events underlying apoptosis?"
