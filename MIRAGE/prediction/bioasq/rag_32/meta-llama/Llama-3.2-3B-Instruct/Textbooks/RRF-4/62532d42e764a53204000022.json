    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if resistance training is usually associated with increasing muscle hypertrophy, let's analyze the provided documents. Document [0] states that hypertrophy of the heart can occur in response to exercise, chronic pressure overload, or genetic mutations. However, it also mentions that the cardiac hypertrophy resulting from exercise is typically beneficial, with improved cardiac performance, increased oxygen consumption, and normal relaxation. This suggests that muscle hypertrophy can occur in response to resistance training. Document [8] states that regular maximal-strength exercise, such as weightlifting, induces the synthesis of more myofibrils and hence hypertrophy of the active muscle cells. This further supports the idea that resistance training can lead to muscle hypertrophy. Document [14] defines hypertrophy as an increase in the size of cells resulting in an increase in the size of the organ, and states that hypertrophy occurs when cells have a limited capacity to divide. Since muscle cells have a limited capacity to divide, hypertrophy is the result of an increase in muscle fiber diameter due to the addition of more myofibrils in parallel. Document [19] states that muscle growth involves either lengthening or increasing muscle fiber diameter. Therefore, resistance training, which primarily involves increasing muscle fiber diameter, is usually associated with increasing muscle hypertrophy. Document [21] also mentions that slow motor units atrophy more rapidly than fast motor units during prolonged periods of unloading, which suggests that resistance training can lead to an increase in fast motor units and muscle hypertrophy. Based on the above information, it can be concluded that resistance training is usually associated with increasing muscle hypertrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

For example, the length of a cell decreases when terminal sarcomeres are eliminated, which can occur when a limb is immobilized with the muscle in a shortened position or when improper setting of a fracture causes shortening of the limb segment. Changes in muscle length affect the velocity and extent of shortening but do not influence the amount of force that can be generated by the muscle. The gradual increase in strength and diameter of a muscle during growth is achieved mainly by hypertrophy. Doubling the myofibrillar diameter by adding more sarcomeres in parallel (hypertrophy, for example) may double the amount of force generated but has no effect on the maximal velocity of shortening. Resistance exercise can promote hypertrophy by activation of the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway and simultaneous inhibition of the forkhead box O protein (FoxO)\u2013atrogene pathway, which results in an increase in net protein synthesis ("

The exercising of young animal muscle causes a hypertrophy of high-oxidative type 1 fibers and an increase in the proportion of low-oxidative type 2 fibers; aging muscle lacks this capacity; exercise produces only an increase in the proportion of type 2 fibers (Silbermann et al).

Highly trained athletes have a lower resting heart rate, a greater stroke volume, and lower peripheral resistance than they had before training or after deconditioning. The low resting heart rate is caused by a higher vagal tone and a lower sympathetic tone. During exercise, the maximal heart rate of a trained individual is the same as that in an untrained person, but it is attained at a higher level of exercise. A trained person also exhibits low vascular resistance in the muscles.

Such efforts recruit fast glycolytic motor units, as well as slow oxidative motor units. During these efforts, blood supply to the working muscles may be interrupted as tissue pressures rise above intravascular pressure. The reduced blood flow limits the duration of the contraction. Regular maximal-strength exercise, such as weightlifting, induces the synthesis of more myofibrils and hence hypertrophy of the active muscle cells. The increased stress also induces the growth of tendons and bones. Endurance exercise does not cause fast motor units to become slow, nor does maximal muscular effort produce a shift from slow to fast motor units. Thus any practical exercise regimen, when superimposed on normal daily activities, probably does not alter muscle fiber phenotype."

In these cases, large fibers may be present when at most there are only a few degenerating fibers. The more common feature of pseudohypertrophy is a result of lipocytic replacement of degenerated muscle fibers, but in its earlier stages, the presence of many enlarged fibers may contribute to the enlargement of muscle. Thus a true hypertrophy appears to give way to pseudohypertrophy. In the late stage of the dystrophic process, only a few scattered muscle fibers remain, almost lost in a sea of fat cells.
