    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the relationship between alternative splicing and heart disease. Alternative splicing is a process by which a single gene can produce multiple proteins, and it is known to be involved in various diseases. Document [15] mentions that aberrant splicing variants of the interleukin 7 receptor \u03b1 chain are associated with susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (MS) in multiple different populations, and Document [17] mentions that mutations that affect RNA splicing are responsible for some cases of \u03b2-thalassemia. However, the question asks about heart disease. Document [15] also mentions that myotonic, and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophies; ataxia telangiectasia; neurofibromatosis; some inherited ataxias; and fragile X syndrome, among other disorders, are likely to be associated with subtle variations of splicing. However, there is no direct mention of heart disease. Therefore, we need to look for other connections between alternative splicing and heart disease. Document [20] mentions that splicing plays important roles in the development of cystic fibrosis, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, retinitis pigmentosa, spinal muscular atrophy, myotonic dystrophy, premature aging, and cancer, but it does not mention heart disease. However, Document [5] mentions that extensive tissue-specific alternative splicing occurs in the production of multiple isoforms of the tropomyosin protein, which is an actin filament-binding protein of the cytoskeleton (and of the contractile apparatus in muscle cells). Heart disease is a condition that can affect the heart muscle, which is a muscle cell. Therefore, it is plausible that alternative splicing could be involved in heart disease, particularly if the splicing variants affect the function of the heart muscle. In conclusion, based on the available information, it is not clear whether alternative splicing is directly associated with heart disease. However, given the importance of muscle cells in the heart and the role of alternative splicing in producing muscle-specific proteins, it is possible that alternative splicing could be involved in heart disease. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that alternative splicing may be associated with heart disease, but it is not explicitly stated in the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Alternative splicing refers to the inclusion of different combinations of exons in mature mRNA, resulting in the potential for many different protein products encoded by a single gene. Alternative splicing represents a powerful mechanism for generation of complexity and variation, and this mechanism appears to be highly prevalent in the nervous system, affecting key processes such as neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels. Numerous diseases are already known to result from abnormalities in alternative splicing. Increased inclusion of exon 10\u2013containing transcripts of MAPT can cause frontotemporal dementia. Aberrant splicing also contributes to the pathogenesis of Duchenne\u2019s, myotonic, and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophies; ataxia telangiectasia; neurofibromatosis; some inherited ataxias; and fragile X syndrome, among other disorders.

Earlier in this section we saw that alternative splicing can give rise to different proteins from the same gene and that this is a common strategy to enhance the coding potential of genomes. Some examples of alternative splicing are constitutive; that is, the alternatively spliced mRNAs are produced continuously by cells of an organism. However, in many cases, the cell regulates the splicing patterns so that different forms of the protein are produced at different times and in different tissues (see Figure 6\u201326). In Chapter 7, we return to this issue to discuss some specific examples of regulated RNA splicing."

Instead, the mutation typically creates a new pattern of splicing (Figure 6\u201333). Most commonly, an exon is simply skipped (Figure 6\u201333B). In other cases, the mutation causes a cryptic splice junction to be efficiently used (Figure 6\u201333C). Apparently, the splicing machinery has evolved to pick out the best possible pattern of splice junctions, and if the optimal one is damaged by mutation, it will seek out the next best pattern, and so on. This inherent plasticity in the process of RNA splicing suggests that changes in splicing patterns caused by random mutations have been important in the evolution of genes and organisms.

In addition, changes in chromatin structure are used to alter splicing patterns. There are two ways this can happen. First, because splicing and transcription are coupled, the rate at which RNA polymerase moves along DNA can affect RNA splicing. For example, if polymerase is moving slowly, exon skipping (see Figure 6\u201330A) is minimized: assembly of the initial spliceosome may be complete before an alternative choice of splice site even emerges from the RNA polymerase.

            "content": "Alternative polyadenylation: Some pre-mRNA transcripts have more than one site for cleavage and polyadenylation. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) generates mRNA with different 3\u2032-ends, altering the untranslated region (UTR) or the coding (translated) sequence. [Note: APA is involved in the production of the membrane-bound and secreted forms of immunoglobulin M.] The use of alternative splicing and polyadenylation sites, as well as alternative transcription start sites explains, at least in part, how the ~20,000 to 25,000 genes in the human genome can give rise to well over 100,000 proteins. 3. Messenger RNA editing: Even after mRNA has been fully processed, it may undergo an additional posttranscriptional modification in which a base in the mRNA is altered. This is known as RNA editing. An important example in humans occurs with the transcript for apolipoprotein (apo) B, an essential component of chylomicrons (see p."

How the SR proteins discriminate exon sequences from intron sequences is not understood in detail; however, it is known that some of the SR proteins bind preferentially to specific RNA sequences in exons, termed splicing enhancers."

But it is now clear that many DNA sequences in higher eukaryotic cells can produce a set of distinct (but related) proteins by means of alternative RNA splicing. How, then, is a gene to be defined?"

However, the classical view of a gene includes the gene control region as well, since mutations in it can produce an altered phenotype. Alternative RNA splicing further complicates the definition of a gene\u2014a point we shall return to later."
