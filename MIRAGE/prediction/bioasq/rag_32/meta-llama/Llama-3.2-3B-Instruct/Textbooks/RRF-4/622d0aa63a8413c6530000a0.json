Tousled-like kinases are a family of protein kinases that are involved in the regulation of chromatin remodeling and transcription. ASF1 (Activating Signal for Gene 1) is a histone acetyltransferase that is also involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription. The question asks whether ASF1 is phosphorylated by the Tousled-like kinases. Based on the information provided, there is no direct information about the phosphorylation of ASF1 by the Tousled-like kinases. However, ASF1 is known to interact with the Tousled protein, and Tousled is a kinase that can phosphorylate ASF1. Therefore, it is likely that ASF1 is phosphorylated by the Tousled-like kinases, but this information is not explicitly stated in the provided documents.

By recognizing specific phosphorylated tyrosines, these small interaction domains enable the proteins that contain them to bind to activated RTKs, as well as to many other intracellular signaling proteins that have been transiently phosphorylated on tyrosines (Figure 15\u201346). As discussed previously, many signaling proteins also contain other interaction domains that allow them to interact specifically with other proteins as part of the signaling process. These domains include the SH3 domain, which binds to proline-rich motifs in intracellular proteins (see Figure 15\u201311)."

            "content": "The APC/C and SCF are both large, multisubunit complexes with some related components (see Figure 3\u201371), but they are regulated differently. APC/C activity changes during the cell cycle, primarily as a result of changes in its association with an activating subunit\u2014either Cdc20 in mid-mitosis or Cdh1 from late mitosis through early G1. These subunits help the APC/C recognize its target proteins (Figure 17\u201315A). SCF activity depends on substrate-binding subunits called F-box proteins. Unlike APC/C activity, however, SCF activity is constant during the cell cycle. Ubiquitylation by SCF is controlled instead by changes in the phosphorylation state of its target proteins, as F-box subunits recognize only specifically phosphorylated proteins (Figure 17\u201315B)."
