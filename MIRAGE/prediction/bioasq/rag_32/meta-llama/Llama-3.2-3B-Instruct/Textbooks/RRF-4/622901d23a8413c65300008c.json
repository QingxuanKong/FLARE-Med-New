Some are true neoplasms, either benign or malignant, while others are thought to be hamartomas. Odontogenic tumors are derived from odontogenic epithelium, ectomesenchyme, or both. The two most common and clinically significant tumors are ameloblastoma and odontoma. Ameloblastomas arise from odontogenic epithelium. They are typically cystic, slow-growing and, despite being locally invasive, have an indolent course. The cysts are lined by palisading columnar epithelium that overlies a loose stroma with stellate cells. Odontoma, the most common type of odontogenic tumor, arises from epithelium but shows extensive deposition of enamel and dentin. Odontomas are cured by local excision.

Affected patients generally survive. Of note, however, benign tumors can produce more than localized lumps, and sometimes they produce significant morbidity or are even lethal. Malignant, as applied to a neoplasm, implies that the lesion can invade and destroy adjacent structures and spread to distant sites (metastasize) to cause death. Malignant tumors are collectively referred to as cancers, derived from the Latin word for \u201ccrab\u201d\u2014that is, they adhere to any part that they seize in an obstinate manner, similar to a crab\u2019s behavior. Not all cancers pursue so deadly a course. The most aggressive are also some of the most curable, but the designation malignant constitutes a red flag."

Extremely small cancers have been known to metastasize; conversely, some large and ominous-looking lesions may not. While all malignant tumors can metastasize, some do so very infrequently. For example, basal cell carcinomas of the skin and most primary tumors of the central nervous system are highly locally invasive but rarely metastasize. It is evident then that the properties of local invasion and metastasis are sometimes separable. A special circumstance involves so-called \u201cblood cancers\u201d, the leukemias and lymphomas. These tumors are derived from blood-forming cells that normally have the capacity to enter the bloodstream and travel to distant sites; as a result, with only rare exceptions, leukemias and lymphomas are taken to be disseminated diseases at diagnosis and are always considered to be malignant."

Cancers lack well-defined capsules. There are instances in which a slowly growing malignant tumor deceptively appears to be encased by the stroma of the surrounding host tissue, but microscopic examination reveals tiny crablike feet penetrating the margin and infiltrating adjacent structures. This infiltrative mode of growth makes it necessary to remove a wide margin of surrounding normal tissue when surgical excision of a malignant tumor is attempted. Surgical pathologists carefully examine the margins of resected tumors to ensure that they are devoid of cancer cells (clean margins)."

Some variation in metastasis clearly relates to inherent differences in the behavior of particular tumors; for example, small cell carcinoma of the lung virtually always metastasizes to distant sites, whereas with some tumors, such as basal cell carcinoma, metastasis is the exception rather than the rule. In general, large tumors are more likely to metastasize than small tumors, presumably because (all other things being equal) large tumors will have been present in the patient for longer periods of time, providing additional chances for metastasis to occur. However, tumor size and type cannot adequately explain the behavior of individual cancers, and it is still open to question whether metastasis is merely probabilistic (a matter of chance multiplied by tumor cell number and time) or reflects inherent differences in metastatic"

Recurrence is associated with margin involvement, whereas mortality correlates with size and grade (173). In a series reviewing only high-grade malignant phyllodes tumors, size and excision margins were associated with local recurrence and metastatic spread, and mastectomy may be required to achieve complete surgical excision (174). Malignant phyllodes tumors tend to recur locally and occasionally may metastasize to the lung, although brain, pelvic, and bone metastases also may occur (160\u2013162).

The primary tumor is thought to derive by cell division from a single cell that initially experienced some heritable change. Subsequently, additional changes accumulate in some of the descendants of this cell, allowing them to outgrow, out-divide, and often outlive their neighbors. By the time it is first detected, a typical human cancer will have been developing for many years and will already contain a billion cancer cells or more (Figure 20\u20134). Tumors will usually also contain a variety of other cell types; for example, fibroblasts will be present in the supporting connective tissue associated with a carcinoma, in addition to inflammatory and vascular endothelial cells.

Combination chemotherapy should be reserved for patients with metastatic disease. All such tumors should be analyzed for a mutation in the c-kit receptor. GISTs are unresponsive to conventional chemotherapy; yet \u223c50% of patients experience objective response and prolonged survival when treated with imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) (400\u2013800 mg PO daily), a selective inhibitor of the c-kit tyrosine kinase. Many patients with GIST whose tumors have become refractory to imatinib subsequently benefit from sunitinib (Sutent) or"

            "content": "Multiple primary tumors may be present at initial diagnosis but more often are detected later, at an estimated rate of 3% to 7% per year; patients who survive 5 years after diagnosis of the initial tumor have up to a 35% chance of developing at least one new primary tumor within that interval. The development of these secondary tumors can be particularly devastating for individuals whose initial lesions were small. Therefore, surveillance and early detection of new premalignant lesions are critical for the longterm survival of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. The elevated risk for development of additional primary tumors in these patients has led to the concept of \u201cfield cancerization.\u201d This hypothesis suggests that multiple primary tumors develop independently as a result of years of chronic mucosal exposure to carcinogens such as alcohol or tobacco (described next)."

            "content": "Cancer cells are defined by two heritable properties: (1) they reproduce in defiance of the normal restraints on cell growth and division, and (2) they invade and colonize territories normally reserved for other cells. It is the combination of these properties that makes cancers particularly dangerous. An abnormal cell that grows (increases in mass) and proliferates (divides) out of control will give rise to a tumor, or neoplasm\u2014literally, a new growth. As long as the neoplastic cells have not yet become invasive, however, the tumor is said to be benign. For most types of such neoplasms, removing or destroying the mass locally usually achieves a complete cure. A tumor is considered a true cancer if it is malignant; that is, when its cells have acquired the ability to invade surrounding tissue. Invasiveness is an essential characteristic of cancer cells. It allows them to break loose, enter blood or lymphatic vessels, and form secondary tumors called metastases at other sites in the"

            "content": "A fifth type of melanoma, desmoplastic melanoma, is associated with a fibrotic response, neural invasion, and a greater tendency for local recurrence. Occasionally, melanomas appear clinically to be amelanotic, in which case the diagnosis is established microscopically after biopsy of a new or a changing skin nodule. Melanomas can also arise in the mucosa of the head and neck (nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses and oral cavity), the gastrointestinal tract, the CNS, the female genital tract (vulva, vagina), and the uveal tract of the eye."
