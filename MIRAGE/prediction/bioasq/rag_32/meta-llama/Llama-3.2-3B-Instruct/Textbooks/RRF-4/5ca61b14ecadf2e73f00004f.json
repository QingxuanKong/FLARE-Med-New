During thymic education, T cells that express either the CD4 or the CD8 coreceptor are chosen, and autoreactive cells are effectively eliminated. In short, this education promotes T-cell tolerance, allowing selection and survival only of those T cells that recognize non-self and will not react against self.

SHBG changes in women are an exception to this self-correcting mechanism. When SHBG decreases because of insulin resistance or androgen excess, the unbound testosterone concentration is increased, potentially leading to hirsutism (Chap. 68). The increased unbound testosterone level does not result in an adequate compensatory feedback correction because estrogen, not testosterone, is the primary regulator of the reproductive axis."

In the major (canonical) branch, activation causes increased amounts of \u03b2-catenin to enter the nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of genes controlling cell differentiation and proliferation. Overactivation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway can lead to cancer. (Figure 15\u201360) X-inactivation Inactivation of one copy of the X chromosome in the somatic cells of female mammals.

Steroid hormones have slower, longer term effects that involve chromatin remodeling and changes in gene expression. Increasing evidence indicates that steroid hormones have rapid, nongenomic effects as well, but these pathways are still being elucidated."

The receptor may also bind to other transcription factors to influence the effects of these factors on their responsive genes. Interestingly, although ER\u03b2 has its own separate actions from ER\u03b1, it also acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of ER\u03b1. Thus, while ER\u03b1 has many growth-promoting properties, ER\u03b2 has anti-growth effects. Many phytoestrogens act via the ER\u03b2 protecting cells from the pro-growth effects of ER\u03b1."

The genomic effects of estrogens are mainly due to proteins synthesized by translation of RNA transcribed from a responsive gene. Some of the effects of estrogens are indirect, mediated by the autocrine and paracrine actions of autacoids such as growth factors, lipids, glycolipids, and cytokines produced by the target cells in response to estrogen. Rapid estrogen-induced effects such as granulosa cell Ca2+ uptake and increased uterine blood flow do not require gene activation. These appear to be mediated by nongenomic effects of the classic estrogen receptor-estrogen complex, influencing several intracellular signaling pathways."

            "content": "The effects of the glucocorticoid receptor are not confined to cells of the liver. In other cell types, activation of this transcription regulator by hormone also causes changes in the expression levels of many genes; the genes affected, however, are usually different from those affected in liver cells. As we have seen, each cell type has an individualized set of transcription regulators, and because of combinatorial control, these critically influence the action of the glucocorticoid receptor. Because the receptor is able to assemble with many different sets of celltype-specific transcription regulators, switching it on with hormone produces a different spectrum of effects in each cell type."
