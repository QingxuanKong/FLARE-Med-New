First, it is relatively easy for the experimenter to design the guide RNA: it simply follows standard base pairing convention. Second, the gene to be controlled does not have to be modified; the CRISPR strategy exploits DNA sequences already present in the genome. Third, numerous genes can be controlled simultaneously. Cas9 has to be expressed only once, but many guide RNAs can be expressed in the same cell; this strategy allows the experimenter to turn on or off a whole set of genes at once."

These advances come from a wholly unexpected source: the discovery of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and Cas (or CRISPR-associated genes). These are linked genetic elements that endow prokaryotes with a form of acquired immunity to phages and plasmids. Bacteria use this system to sample the DNA of infecting agents, incorporating it into the host genome as CRISPRs. CRISPRs are transcribed and processed into an RNA sequence that binds and directs the nuclease Cas9 to a sequences (e.g., a phage), leading to its cleavage and the destruction of the phage. Gene editing repurposes this process by using artificial guide RNAs (gRNAs) that bind Cas9 and are complementary to a DNA sequence of interest.

In the first, viral DNA sequences are integrated into special regions of the bacterial genome known as CRISPR (clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeat) loci, named for the peculiar structure that first drew the attention of scientists. In its simplest form, a CRISPR locus consists of several hundred repeats of a host DNA sequence interspersed with a large collection of sequences (typically 25\u201370 nucleotide pairs each) that has been derived from prior exposures to viruses and other foreign DNA. The newest viral sequence is always integrated at the 5\u02b9end of the CRISPR locus, the end that is transcribed first. Each locus, therefore, carries a temporal record of prior infections. Many bacterial and archaeal species carry several large CRISPR loci in their genomes and are thus immune to a wide range of viruses."

Likewise, a nearly complete set of mutants exists for the \u201cmodel\u201d plant Arabidopsis. And the adaptation of the CRISPR system for use in mice means that, in the near future, we can expect to be able to turn on or off\u2014at will\u2014each gene in the mouse genome. Although we are still ignorant about the function of most genes in most organisms, these technologies allow an exploration of gene function on a scale that was unimaginable a decade ago.

            "content": "Prepare cDNA, label FIGURE 101e-7 A microarray experiment. RNA is prepared from cells, reverse transcribed to cDNA, and labeled with fluorescent dyes (typically green for normal cells and red for cancer cells). The fluorescent probes are mixed and hybridized to a cDNA array. Each spot on the array is an oligonucleotide (or cDNA fragment) that represents a different gene. The image is then captured with a fluorescence camera; red spots indicate higher expression in tumor cells compared with reference, while green spots represent the lower expression in tumor cells. Yellow signals indicate equal expression levels in normal and tumor specimens. After clustering analysis of multiple arrays, the results are typically represented graphically using a visualization software, which shows, for each sample, a color-coded representation of gene expression for every gene on the array."

            "content": "The mRNAs are converted to cDNAs that are labeled with a red fluorescent labeled with red labeled with green dye for one sample and a green fluorescent dye for the other. The labeled samples are mixed and then allowed to hybridize to the microarray. Each microscopic spot on the microarray is a 50-nucleotide DNA molecule of defined sequence made by chemical synthesis and spotted on the array. The DNA sequence represented by each spot is different, and the hundreds of thousands of such spots are designed to span the sequence of the genome. The DNA sequence of each spot is kept track of by computer. After incubation, the array is washed and the fluorescence scanned. Only a small proportion of the microarray, representing 676 genes, is shown. Red spots indicate that the gene in sample 1 is expressed at a higher level than the corresponding gene in sample 2, and the green spots indicate the opposite. Yellow spots reveal genes that are expressed at about equal levels in both cell samples."

What is required to enable a cancer cell to metastasize? how can the molecular analysis of an individual tumor be more effectively used to design effective therapies to kill it? Can we identify general features common to all cancer cells\u2014such as their production of misfolded, mutated proteins\u2014that can be used for the targeted destruction of many different types of cancers? Can sensitive and reliable blood tests be devised to detect cancers very early, before they have grown to a size where treatment with a single drug will generally be defeated by the survival of a preexisting resistant variant? how can the observed environmental effects on cancer rates be exploited to reduce avoidable cancers? Can new technologies be devised to reveal exactly how a quiescent micrometastasis converts to a full-blown metastatic tumor?"
