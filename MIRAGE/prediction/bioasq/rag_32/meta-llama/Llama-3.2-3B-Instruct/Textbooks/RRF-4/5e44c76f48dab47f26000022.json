First is the distinction between anticoagulation to prevent the progression of an acute stroke and the prophylactic use of anticoagulation for the prevention of future strokes. Second, the pivotal issue in prevention of further strokes is whether the stroke or TIA is atherothrombotic or cardioembolic. As discussed further on, several studies point conclusively to a role for anticoagulation in stroke due to certain cardioembolic sources, particularly atrial fibrillation, while the indications in acute stroke are less certain."
