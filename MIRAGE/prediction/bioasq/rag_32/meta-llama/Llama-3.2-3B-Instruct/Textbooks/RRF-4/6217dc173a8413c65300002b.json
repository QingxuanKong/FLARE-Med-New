Bacteriophages, also known as phages, are viruses that infect bacteria. According to Document [17], phages dominate the identifiable components of the gut's DNA virome, indicating that they are present in the gut. Additionally, Document [17] mentions that prophages are a manifestation of a temperate viral-bacterial host dynamic, where a phage is integrated into its host bacterium's genome. This suggests that phages can be found within bacteria, including those found in the gut. Furthermore, Document [20] states that bacteria are much larger than viruses and enter host cells by phagocytosis, which is a normal function of phagocytes such as neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. This implies that phages can also be found within these phagocytic cells. Given this information, it is likely that we do find bacteriophages in the gut.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Yet, it is home to a microbiota of hundreds of resident species, including the bacterium H. pylori, which, as we discussed earlier, is the major cause of stomach ulcers and some stomach cancers. The hypothesis that a persistent bacterial infection could cause stomach ulcers was initially met with skepticism. The young Australian doctor who made the initial discovery finally proved the point: he drank a pure culture of H. pylori and developed inflammation of the stomach, which often precedes the development of ulcers. A short course of antibiotics can now effectively cure a patient of recurrent stomach ulcers. Remarkably, H. pylori is able to persist for life as a commensal in most humans. One way in which it survives in the stomach is by producing the enzyme urease,"

El Tor eventually displaced the Classical strains. In 1992, a new strain emerged in which O1 was replaced with another O-antigen variant called O139, which was not recognized by antibodies present in the blood of survivors of previous cholera epidemics. The O139 strain also contains a transposon-like element that encodes antibiotic resistance. As this example makes clear, the rapid evolution of bacterial pathogens can be likened to an arms race which pits the survival of a bacterium against our immune systems and the tools of modern medicine. Similar struggles for survival take place between all pathogens and humans, and understanding these conflicts provides key insights into the evolution of pathogens and greatly informs us how we treat new outbreaks of infectious diseases."

If commensal bacteria do cross the epithelium in small numbers, their lack of virulence factors means they cannot resist uptake and killing by phagocytic cells, and they are rapidly destroyed. In contrast to what happens in other tissues, ingestion of commensal bacteria in the intestine does not lead to inflammation. If macrophages cannot respond to the inhibitory effects of IL-10, intestinal inflammation develops spontaneously. Eosinophils in the healthy intestine assist antigen-specific IgA switching by producing APRIL, IL-6, and TGF-\u03b2 when exposed to commensal microbes (see Section 12-11).

            "content": "The epithelial cells that line internal organs such as the respiratory and digestive tracts also secrete slimy mucus, which sticks to the epithelial surface and makes it difficult for pathogens to adhere. The beating of cilia on the surface of the epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract and the peristaltic action of the intestine also discourage the adherence of pathogens. Moreover, as we discuss in Chapter 23, healthy skin and gut are populated by enormous numbers of harmless (and often helpful) commensal microbes, collectively called the normal flora, which compete for nutrients with pathogens; some also produce antimicrobial peptides that actively inhibit pathogen proliferation. pattern recognition receptors (prrs) recognize conserved Features of pathogens"

            "content": "Although pathogens are understandably a focus of attention, only a relatively small fraction of the microbial species we encounter are pathogens. Much of the biomass of the Earth is made up of microbes, and they produce everything from the oxygen we breathe to the soil nutrients we use to grow food. Even those species of microbes that colonize the human body do not generally cause disease. The collective of microorganisms that reside in or on an organism is called the microbiota. Many of these microbes have a beneficial effect on the health of the organism, assisting its normal development and physiology. In this chapter, we give an overview of the different kinds of pathogens, as well as those microorganisms that colonize our body without causing trouble. We then discuss the cell biology of infection\u2014the molecular interactions between pathogens and their host. In Chapter 24, we consider how our innate and adaptive immune systems collaborate to defend us against pathogens."
