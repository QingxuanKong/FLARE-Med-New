Epigenetic modifications refer to changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence. These modifications can include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin structure changes. The documents describe various examples of epigenetic modifications and their roles in regulating gene expression, as well as their heritability. For instance, epigenetic inheritance is mentioned in Document [0] as a heritable alteration in a cell or organism's phenotype that does not result from changes in the nucleotide sequence of DNA. Document [2] also discusses epigenetic inheritance as a form of inheritance that is superimposed on the genetic inheritance based on DNA. Furthermore, Document [8] explains that certain types of chromatin structure can be inherited, which is a form of epigenetic inheritance. Document [22] mentions that eukaryotic cells can use inherited forms of DNA methylation and inherited states of chromatin condensation as mechanisms for generating cell memory of gene expression patterns. Document [28] describes how epigenetic inheritance plays a central part in the creation of multicellular organisms and how distinctive patterns of gene expression are passed on faithfully from parent cell to daughter cell. Finally, Document [9] presents four distinct mechanisms that can produce an epigenetic form of inheritance in an organism, including mechanisms that act in cis and trans. Based on these examples, it is clear that epigenetic modifications can indeed be heritable.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Their genomes have the same sequence of nucleotides, and, obviously, many features of identical twins\u2014such as their appearance\u2014are strongly determined by the genome sequences they inherit. When their gene expression, histone modification, and DNA methylation patterns are compared, however, many differences are observed. Because these differences are roughly correlated not only with age but also with the time that the twins have spent apart from each other, it has been proposed that some of these differences are heritable from cell to cell and are the result of environmental factors. Although these studies are in early stages, the idea that environmental events can be permanently registered as epigenetic changes in our cells is a fascinating one that presents an important challenge to the next generation of biological scientists."

These modifications include heritable changes such as X-inactivation and imprinting, but they can also result from dynamic posttranslational protein modifications in response to environmental influences such as diet, age, or drugs. The epigenetic modifications result in altered expression of individual genes or chromosomal loci encompassing multiple genes. The term epigenome describes the constellation of covalent modifications of DNA and histones that impact chromatin structure, as well as non-coding transcripts that modulate the transcriptional activity of DNA.

In normal, differentiated cells, the major portion of the genome is not expressed. These regions of the genome are silenced by DNA methylation and histone modifications. On the other hand, cancer cells are characterized by a global DNA hypomethylation and selective promoter-localized hypermethylation. Indeed, it has become evident during the past several years that tumor suppressor genes are sometimes silenced by hypermethylation of promoter sequences, rather than by mutation. In addition, genome-wide hypomethylation has been shown to cause chromosomal instability and can induce tumors in mice. Thus, epigenetic changes may influence carcinogenesis in many ways.

These modifications have many functions, inasmuch as they serve as recognition sites for protein domains that link specific protein complexes to different regions of chromatin.

            "content": "Epigenetic gene inactivation also occurs on selected chromosomal regions of autosomes, a phenomenon referred to as genomic imprinting. Through this mechanism, a small subset of genes is only expressed in a monoallelic fashion. Imprinting is heritable and leads to the preferential expression of one of the parental alleles, which deviates from the usual biallelic expression seen for the majority of genes. Remarkably, imprinting can be limited to a subset of tissues. Imprinting is mediated through DNA methylation of one of the alleles. The epigenetic marks on imprinted genes are maintained throughout life, but during zygote formation, they are activated or inactivated in a sex-specific manner (imprint reset) (Fig. 82-8), which allows a differential expression pattern in the fertilized egg and the subsequent mitotic divisions. Appropriate expression of imprinted genes is important for normal development and cellular functions. Imprinting defects and uniparental disomy, which is the"
