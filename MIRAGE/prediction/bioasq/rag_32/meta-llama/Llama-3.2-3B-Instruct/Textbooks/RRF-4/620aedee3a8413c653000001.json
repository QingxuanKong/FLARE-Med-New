    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's consider the information provided in the documents. AGO2 is a component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that plays a crucial role in RNA interference (RNAi) and microRNA (miRNA) processing. However, there is no direct mention of AGO2's involvement in cytokinesis in the provided documents. Cytokinesis is the process of cell division that occurs after mitosis and is regulated by various proteins and cellular structures, including the contractile ring and actin-myosin filaments. The key regulators of cytokinesis include proteins such as RhoA, Cdc42, and myosin II, as well as structures like the phragmoplast in plant cells. AGO2 is not mentioned in the context of these regulators or structures. Therefore, based on the provided information, it is unlikely that AGO2 is directly related to cytokinesis. However, it is worth noting that AGO2 may play a role in regulating gene expression during cell division, which could indirectly affect cytokinesis. But the direct relationship between AGO2 and cytokinesis is not supported by the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Megakaryocytes, which produce blood platelets, and some hepatocytes and heart muscle cells, for example, become multinucleated in this way. After cytokinesis, most cells enter G1, in which Cdks are mostly inactive. We end this section by discussing how this state is achieved at the end of M phase. The g1 phase Is a stable state of Cdk Inactivity A key regulatory event in late M phase is the inactivation of Cdks, which is driven primarily by APC/C-dependent cyclin destruction. As described earlier, the inactivation of Cdks in late M phase has many functions: it triggers the events of late mitosis, promotes cytokinesis, and enables the synthesis of prereplicative complexes at DNA replication origins. It also provides a mechanism for resetting the Figure 17\u201350 An asymmetric cell division segregating cytoplasmic components to only one daughter cell."

Cytokinesis depends on a ring of actin and myosin filaments that contracts in late mitosis at a site midway between the segregated chromosomes. In animal cells, the positioning of the contractile ring is determined by signals emanating from the microtubules of the anaphase spindle. Dephosphorylation of Cdk targets, which results from Cdk inactivation in anaphase, triggers cytokinesis at the correct time after anaphase. After cytokinesis, the cell enters a stable G1 state of low Cdk activity, where it awaits signals to enter a new cell cycle."

The correct timing and positioning of cytokinesis in animal cells are achieved by mechanisms that depend on the mitotic spindle. During anaphase, the spindle generates signals that initiate furrow formation at a position midway between the spindle poles, thereby ensuring that division occurs between the two sets of separated chromosomes. Because these signals originate in the anaphase spindle, this mechanism also contributes to the correct timing of cytokinesis in late mitosis. Cytokinesis also occurs at the correct time because dephosphorylation of Cdk substrates, which depends on cyclin destruction in metaphase and anaphase, initiates cytokinesis. We now describe these regulatory mechanisms in more detail, with an emphasis on cytokinesis in animal cells."

In such cells, activated receptors cannot be down-regulated by endocytosis and packaging into multivesicular bodies. The still-active receptors therefore mediate prolonged signaling, which can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer. Processes that shape membranes often use similar machinery. Because of strong similarities in their protein sequences, researchers think that ESCRT complexes are evolutionarily related to components that mediate cell-membrane deformation in cytokinesis in archaea. Similarly, the ESCRT machinery that drives the internal budding from the endosome membrane to form intralumenal vesicles is also used in animal cell cytokinesis and virus budding, which are topologically equivalent, as both processes involve budding away from the cytosolic surface of the membrane (Figure 13\u201357)."

It was not even clear whether there was a separate control system, or whether the processes of DNA synthesis, mitosis, and cytokinesis somehow controlled themselves. A major breakthrough came in the late 1980s with the identification of the key proteins of the control system, along with the realization that they are distinct from the proteins that perform the processes of DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and so on. In this section, we first consider the basic principles upon which the cell-cycle control system operates.

One of the most remarkable features of cell-cycle control is that a single protein kinase, M-Cdk, brings about all of the diverse and complex cell rearrangements that occur in the early stages of mitosis. At a minimum, M-Cdk must induce the assembly of the mitotic spindle and ensure that each sister chromatid in a pair is attached to the opposite pole of the spindle. It also triggers chromosome condensation, the large-scale reorganization of the intertwined sister chromatids into compact, rodlike structures. In animal cells, M-Cdk also promotes the breakdown of the nuclear envelope and rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton and the Golgi apparatus. Each of these processes is thought to be initiated when M-Cdk phosphorylates specific proteins involved in the process, although most of these proteins have not yet been identified."

Some cells undergo multiple rounds of nuclear division without intervening cytoplasmic division. In the early Drosophila embryo, for example, the first 13 rounds of nuclear division occur without cytoplasmic division, resulting in the formation of a single large cell containing several thousand nuclei, arranged in a monolayer near the surface. A cell in which multiple nuclei share the same cytoplasm is called a syncytium. This arrangement greatly speeds up early development, as the cells do not have to take the time to go through all the steps of cytokinesis for each division. After these rapid nuclear divisions, membranes are created around each nucleus in one round of coordinated cytokinesis called cellularization. The plasma membrane extends inward and, with the help of an actin\u2013 myosin ring, pinches off to enclose each nucleus (Figure 17\u201351)."

LT-\u03b1 can substitute for CD40 ligand in macrophage activation C. TNFR-I activation is antagonized by activated TH1 cells D. Macrophages are sensitized to IFN-\u03b3 by small amounts of bacterial LPS 11.6 Short Answer: How do M2 macrophages stimulate collagen production in order to promote tissue repair? 11.7 Multiple Choice: Which of the following is not true concerning type 3 responses? A. The primary innate effector cells are neutrophils, which are recruited by CXCL8 and CXCL2 and have an increased output due to G-CSF and GM-CSF B. At homeostasis, TH17 cells are present almost exclusively in the intestinal mucosa C. IL-17 is the central cytokine D. IL-22 is produced to induce antimicrobial peptide production and epithelial cell proliferation and shedding of natural killer cells"

            "content": "Figure 7\u201375 miRNA processing and mechanism of action. the precursor mirnA, through complementarity between one part of its sequence and another, forms a double-stranded structure. this rnA is cropped while still in the nucleus and then exported to the cytosol, where it is further cleaved by the Dicer enzyme to form the mirnA proper. Argonaute, in conjunction with other components of riSC, initially associates with both strands of the mirnA and then cleaves and discards one of them. the other strand guides riSC to specific mrnAs through base-pairing. if the rnA\u2013rnA match is extensive, as is commonly seen in plants, Argonaute cleaves the target mrnA, causing its rapid degradation. in mammals, the mirnA\u2013mrnA match often does not extend beyond a short seven-nucleotide \u201cseed\u201d region near the 5\u02b9 end of the mirnA. this less extensive base-pairing leads to inhibition of translation, mrnA destabilization, and transfer of the mrnA to p-bodies, where it is eventually degraded."

            "content": "What initiates an autoimmune disease such as type 1 diabetes or multiple sclerosis? When a na\u00efve or memory T or B cell is activated by antigen and co-stimulatory signals, how does it decide whether to become an effector cell or memory cell? Are there cells that are pre-committed to becoming either effector or memory cells, for example, or is the decision determined solely by extracellular signals? Why do some of us make Ige antibodies against harmless antigens and thereby develop hay fever and allergic asthma, while most of us do not, and why is the proportion of such allergic individuals increasing? how does a cytotoxic T cell (or NK cell) avoid being killed by the perforin and granzymes that it secretes to kill a target cell?"
