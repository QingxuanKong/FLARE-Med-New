    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether p85\\u03b1 homodimerizes, we need to understand the context in which p85\\u03b1 is mentioned. p85\\u03b1 is a regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, which is a class Ib PI 3-kinase activated by GPCRs. According to Document [0], class Ib PI 3-kinases have a regulatory subunit that binds to the \\u03b2\\u03b7 complex of an activated trimeric G protein. Since p85\\u03b1 is part of the PI 3-kinase complex, it is likely to interact with the \\u03b2\\u03b7 complex. However, there is no information in the provided documents that directly addresses whether p85\\u03b1 homodimerizes. But we can make an educated guess based on the structure and function of PI 3-kinase. PI 3-kinase is typically a heterodimer composed of a catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit. Therefore, it is likely that p85\\u03b1, being a regulatory subunit, forms a heterodimer with the catalytic subunit (usually p110\\u03b1) to form the active PI 3-kinase complex. Hence, the most likely answer is that p85\\u03b1 does homodimerize with the catalytic subunit.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

The heterodimer is depicted in panel a, whereas the ribbon diagram in panel b is of the homodimer. cD8\u03b1 and cD8\u03b2 chains have very similar structures, each having a single domain resembling an immunoglobulin V domain and a stretch of polypeptide chain, believed to be in a relatively extended conformation, that anchors the V-like domain to the cell membrane."

Together these phosphorylations activate ZAP-70 by disrupting the autoinhibited form of inactive ZAP-70, allowing the ZAP-70 kinase domain to adopt the active conformation (Fig. 7.13). ZAP-70 can also be activated by autophosphorylation."

These homodimeric members of the immunoglobulin superfamily are found exclusively on the surfaces of cells, such as dendritic cells, that stimulate naive T-cell proliferation (see Section 9-8). The receptor for B7 molecules on the T cell is CD28, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (see Section 7-21). Ligation of CD28 by B7 molecules is necessary for the optimal clonal expansion of naive T cells; targeted deficiency of B7 molecules or experimental blockade of the binding of B7 molecules to CD28 has been shown to inhibit T-cell responses. 9-16 CD28-dependent co-stimulation of activated T cells induces expression of interleukin-2 and the high-affinity IL-2 receptor."
