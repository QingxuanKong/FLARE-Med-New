The clinical features of this syndrome include congenital heart disease affecting the outflow tracts, abnormalities of the palate, facial dysmorphism, developmental delay, thymic hypoplasia with impaired T cell immunity (Chapter 5), and parathyroid hypoplasia resulting in hypocalcemia (Chapter 20). Previously, these clinical features were believed to represent two different disorders: DiGeorge syndrome and velocardiofacial syndrome. However, it is now known that both are caused by 22q11.2 deletion. Variations in the size and position of the deletion are thought to be responsible for the differing clinical manifestations. When T cell immunodeficiency and hypocalcemia are the dominant features, the patients are said to have DiGeorge syndrome, whereas patients with the so-called velocardiofacial syndrome have mild immunodeficiency"

Patients can survive into adulthood, and milder, incomplete forms occur. Most cases are sporadic, but an autosomal dominant form involving micro-deletions of chromosome 22q11.2 has been described. Smaller deletions in chromosome 22 are seen in incomplete forms of the DiGeorge syndrome, appearing in childhood or adolescence, that are manifest primarily by parathyroid gland failure.

There are several duplication syndromes where the duplicated region of the genome is present as a supernumerary chromosome. Utilization of chromosome microarray analysis has made analysis of the origins of duplicated chromosome material straightforward (Fig. 83e-2). Recurrent syndromes associated with supernumerary chromosomes include the inverted duplication 15 (inv dup 15) syndrome, caused by the presence of a marker chromosome derived from chromosome 15, with two copies of proximal 15q resulting in tetrasomy (four copies) of this region. The inv dup 15 syndrome has a distinct phenotype and is associated with hypotonia, developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and autistic behavior. Another syndrome is the cat eye syndrome, named for the \u201ccat-eyelike\u201d"

            "content": "Regarding the genetic causes of malformations and developmental delay, much has been learned but a full picture of the genetic influences on these conditions remains incomplete. Whole chromosome karyotyping allowed the recognition of conditions such as Down syndrome and its association with triplication of the entire chromosome 21. As more refined techniques became available, such as high-resolution banding, subtle changes such as small deletions in chromosomal architecture became apparent, as occur in Angleman and Prader-Willi syndrome and fragile-X syndrome. What followed, by the use of linkage analysis and other genetic techniques, was the elucidation of single gene mutations that were obligatorily associated with malformations or developmental delays; most of the inherited metabolic disorders of infancy and childhood discussed in Chap. 36 are of this type but also certain gross malformations of the brain such as lissencephaly, discussed further on."

These include hypoplastic let heart and coarctation of the aorta. Cystic hygromas also may be part of a genetic syndrome. One is Noonan yndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder that shares several features with Turner syndrome, including short stature, lymphedema, high-arched palate, and oten pulmonary valve stenosis. Large cystic hygromas are usually associated with hydrops fetalis, rarely resolve, FIGURE 10-22 Cystic hygromas. A.

            "content": "Genetic aspects of Alzheimer disease (Table 38-1) Of some importance has been the aforementioned series of discoveries in patients with inherited forms of Alzheimer disease, of defective genes that code for errant APPs localized to chromosome 21 near the \u03b2-amyloid gene (St. George-Hyslop et al). As mentioned, this also provided an explanation for the Alzheimer changes that characterize the brains of practically all patients with the trisomy 21 defect (Down syndrome) who survive beyond their 20th year; they overproduce amyloid as a result of the triplication of the gene. But gene defects on chromosome 21 are responsible for only a small proportion of familial cases and a minuscule percentage of disease overall. Other kindreds with familial Alzheimer disease have been linked to rare dominant mutations of the presenilin genes on chromosome 14 (presenilin 1; Sherrington et al), accounting in some series for up to 50 percent of familial cases, and on chromosome 1 (presenilin 2), which may"
