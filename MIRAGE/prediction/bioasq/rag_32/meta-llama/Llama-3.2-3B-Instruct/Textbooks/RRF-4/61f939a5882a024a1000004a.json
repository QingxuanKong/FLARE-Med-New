It is usually diagnosed late in the course of chronic liver disease, and a large majority of patients have underlying poor liver function and only limited hepatic reserve. In general, HCC is considered to be a chemotherapy-resistant disease, and palliative chemotherapy is usually not recommended as first-line therapy in patients with unresectable or advanced HCC. Single-agent sorafenib therapy is currently approved for advanced or unresectable HCC, and in patients who have progressed on front-line sorafenib therapy, the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor regorafenib is recommended."

Current hopes focus particularly on the Met pathway inhibitors such as tivantinib and several IGF receptor antagonists. 90Yttrium looks promising and without chemotherapy toxicities. It is particularly attractive because, unlike TACE, it seems safe in the presence of portal vein thrombosis, a pathognomonic feature of HCC aggressiveness. The bottleneck of liver donors for OLTX is at last widening with increasing use of living donors, and criteria for OLTX for larger HCCs are slowly expanding.

HGF is produced by fibroblasts and most mesenchymal cells, as well as endothelium and nonhepatocyte liver cells. It is synthesized as an inactive precursor (pro-HGF) that is proteolytically activated by serine proteases released at sites of injury. The receptor for HGF is MET, which has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. It is frequently overexpressed or mutated in tumors, particularly renal and thyroid papillary carcinomas.

The growth of both primary and metastatic solid tumors requires an intact vasculature; thus the VEGF signaling pathway represents an attractive target for chemotherapy. Several approaches have been taken to inhibit VEGF signaling; they include inhibition of VEGF interactions with its receptor by targeting either the VEGF ligand with antibodies or soluble chimeric decoy receptors, or by direct inhibition of VEGF receptor\u2013associated tyrosine kinase activity by small molecule inhibitors."

However TKI-associated therapeutic responses have gained major clinical relevance and dictate appropriate and careful monitoring of patients to optimize their treatment."

Several novel therapies are being explored, including radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation of liver lesions and use of agents that block the vascular endothelial growth receptor pathway (bevacizumab, sunitinib) or the mammalian target of rapamycin (Chap. 113)."
