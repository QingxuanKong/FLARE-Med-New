Somatic mutations are mutations that occur in non-germline cells, such as somatic cells. These mutations can occur in various parts of the cell, including the nucleus and cytoplasm. However, the question specifically asks about the position of somatic mutations in relation to the nuclear periphery. The nuclear periphery refers to the region of the cell outside the nucleus, including the nuclear envelope and the cytoplasm. Given that somatic mutations can occur in any part of the cell, including the cytoplasm, it is not accurate to say that somatic mutations are positioned towards the nuclear periphery. Instead, somatic mutations can be found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Therefore, the correct answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Alternatively, mutations can occur during embryogenesis or in somatic tissues. Mutations that occur during development lead to mosaicism, a situation in which tissues are composed of cells with different genetic constitutions. If the germline is mosaic, a mutation can be transmitted to some progeny but not others, which sometimes leads to confusion in assessing the pattern of inheritance. Somatic mutations that do not affect cell survival can sometimes be detected because of variable phenotypic effects in tissues (e.g., pigmented lesions in McCune-Albright syndrome).

Thus, both for the perpetuation of a species with a large number of genes (germ-cell stability) and for the prevention of cancer resulting from mutations in somatic cells (somatic-cell stability), multicellular organisms like ourselves depend on the remarkably high fidelity with which their DNA sequences are replicated and maintained."

Before doing so, however, we must first touch on the important concept of driver mutations and passenger mutations. Driver mutations are mutations that alter the function of cancer genes and thereby directly contribute to the development or progression of a given cancer. They are usually acquired, but as mentioned earlier, occasionally inherited. By contrast, passenger mutations are acquired mutations that are neutral in terms of fitness and do not affect cellular behavior; they just come along for the proverbial ride. Because they occur at random, passenger mutations are sprinkled throughout the genome, whereas driver mutations tend to be tightly clustered within cancer genes. It is now appreciated that particularly in cancers caused by carcinogen exposure, such as melanoma and smoking-related lung cancer, passenger mutations greatly outnumber driver mutations."

The basic phenomenon was evident even before modern molecular analyses. For example, the cells of many cancers show grossly abnormal sets of chromosomes, with duplications, deletions, and translocations that are visible at mitosis (Figure 20\u201310). When the cells are maintained in culture, these patterns of chromosomal disruption can often be seen to evolve rapidly and in a seemingly haphazard way. And for many years, pathologists have used an abnormal appearance of the cell nucleus to identify and classify cancer cells in tumor biopsies; in particular, cancer cells can contain an unusually large amount of heterochromatin\u2014a condensed form of interphase chromatin that silences genes (see pp. 194\u2013195).

In this two-dimensional representation of the human genome, the green surface depicts the 22 human autosomes plus the X sex chromosome as being laid out side-by-side in numerical order from left to right, with the DNA sequence of each chromosome running from back to front. The mountains represent the locations of genes mutated with high frequency in different, independent tumors. As indicated, these are suspected driver mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), K-Ras, p53, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PIK3CA), and ubiquitin ligase (FBXW7) proteins. (Adapted from L.D. Wood et al., Science 318:1108\u20131113, 2007.)"

            "content": "In the next section of the chapter, we examine the mutations and molecular mechanisms that underlie these and other properties of cancer cells. Cancer cells, by definition, grow and proliferate in defiance of normal controls (that is, they are neoplastic) and are able to invade surrounding tissues and colonize distant organs (that is, they are malignant). By giving rise to secondary tumors, or metastases, they become difficult to eradicate by surgery or local irradiation. Cancers are thought to originate from a single cell that has experienced an initial mutation, but the progeny of this cell must undergo many further changes, requiring additional mutations and epigenetic events, to become cancerous. Tumor progression usually takes many years and reflects the operation of a Darwinian-like process of evolution, in which somatic cells undergo mutation and epigenetic changes accompanied by natural selection."
