A memory T cell response to viral capsid, present in humans but not 91e-3 in other animal species (which are not natural hosts for the virus), likely led to the loss of expression (Table 91e-2). In response to these findings, a second trial included a short course of prednisolone, to be administered if factor IX levels began to decline. This approach resulted in long-term expression of factor IX, in the range of 2\u20135%, in men with severe hemophilia B. Current efforts are focused on expanding these trials, and extending the approach to hemophilia A."

The introduction of viral inactivation steps in the preparation of plasma-derived products in the mid-1980s greatly reduced the risk of HIV and hepatitis, and the risks were further reduced by the successful production of recombinant FVIII and FIX proteins, both licensed in the 1990s. It is uncommon for hemophilic patients born after 1985 to have contracted either hepatitis or HIV, and for these individuals, life expectancy is approximately 65 years. In fact, since 1998, no evidence of new infections with viral hepatitis or HIV has been reported in patients using blood products.

Moreover, raising circulating factor levels from <1% (levels seen in those severely affected) into the range of 5% greatly improves the phenotype of the disease. Preclinical studies with recombinant AAV vectors infused into skeletal muscle or liver have resulted in long-term (>5 years) expression of factor VIII or factor IX in the hemophilic dog model. Administration to skeletal muscle of an AAV vector expressing factor IX in patients with hemophilia B was safe and resulted in long-term expression as measured on muscle biopsy, but circulating levels never rose to >1% for sustained periods, and a large number of IM injections (>80\u2013100) was required to access a large muscle mass."

Patients with moderate or mild hemophilia A should be tested to determine if they respond to DDAVP before a therapeutic application. DDAVP at doses of 0.3 \u03bcg/kg body weight, over a 20-min period, is expected to raise FVIII levels by twoto threefold over baseline, peaking between 30 and 60 min after infusion. DDAVP does not improve FVIII levels in severe hemophilia A patients, because there are no stores to release. Repeated dosing of DDAVP results in tachyphylaxis because the mechanism is an increase in release rather than de novo synthesis of FVIII and VWF. More than three consecutive doses become ineffective, and if further therapy is indicated, FVIII replacement is required to achieve hemostasis."

Hemophilia A, which accounts for 80% of all hemophilia, results from deficiency of FVIII, whereas deficiency of FIX results in hemophilia B. Each deficiency is characterized by decreased and delayed ability to clot and/or formation of abnormally friable (easily disrupted) clots. This can be manifested, for example, by bleeding into the joints (Fig. 35.10). The extent of the factor deficiency determines the severity of the disease. Current treatment for hemophilia is factor replacement therapy using FVIII or FIX obtained from pooled human blood or from recombinant DNA technology. However, antibodies to the factors can develop. Gene therapy is a goal. Because the genes for both proteins are on the X chromosome, hemophilia is an X-linked disorder.

Inhibitors increase both morbidity and mortality in hemophilia. Because early detection of an inhibitor is critical to a successful correction of the bleeding or to eradication of the antibody, most hemophilia centers perform annual screening for inhibitors. The laboratory test required to confirm the presence of an inhibitor is an aPTT with a mix (with normal plasma). In most hemophilia patients, a 1:1 mix with normal plasma completely corrects the aPTT. In inhibitor patients, the aPTT on a 1:1 mix is abnormally prolonged, because the inhibitor neutralizes the FVIII clotting activity of the normal plasma. The Bethesda assay uses a similar principle and defines the specificity of the inhibitor and its titer. The results are expressed in Bethesda units (BU), in which 1 BU is the amount of antibody that neutralizes 50% of the FVIII or FIX present in normal plasma"

In specific situations such as after surgery, continuous infusion of factor may be desirable because of its safety in achieving sustained factor levels at a lower total cost. Cryoprecipitate is enriched with FVIII protein (each bag contains ~80 IU of FVIII) and was commonly used for the treatment of hemophilia A decades ago; it is still in use in some developing countries, but because of the risk of bloodborne diseases, this product should be avoided in hemophilia patients when factor concentrates are available."
