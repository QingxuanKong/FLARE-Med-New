    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the potential effects of bDMARDs (biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs) on neonatal development. bDMARDs are a type of disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) that are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. They work by targeting specific proteins involved in inflammation and immune response. The main concern with using bDMARDs during pregnancy is the potential impact on fetal development. However, most bDMARDs are considered safe for use during pregnancy, and the available evidence suggests that they do not pose a significant risk to the fetus. According to the provided documents, infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab, which are all class B drugs, have been studied in pregnant women and have not been shown to cause any significant harm to the fetus. In fact, a large prospective study found no increased risk of stillbirths, miscarriages, or spontaneous abortions with these medications. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that the use of bDMARDs during pregnancy does not have a significant impact on neonatal development.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Thus, if given near the time of preterm delivery, these agents theoretically might worsen neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. However, a population-based review of more than 800,000 births from Denmark found no association between exposure to sulfamethoxazole in late pregnancy and neonatal jaundice (Klarskov, 2013). These drugs are no longer commonly used in pregnant women. They are associated with yellowish-brown discoloration of deciduous teeth when used after 25 weeks' gestation. The risk for subsequent dental caries does not appear greater (Billings, 2004; Kutscher, 1966). In contrast, a recent systematic review of doxycycline in pregnancy identified no higher rates of either birth defects or staining of deciduous teeth (Cross, 2016)."

In this regard, a few generalizations can be made. First, consensus supports that pregnancy does not increase the likelihood of an inlammatory bowel disease flare (.1ahadevan, 2015). Indeed, in a 10-year surveillance of women in the European Collaborative on Inflammatory Bowel Disease, the likelihood of a lare during pregnancy was decreased compared with the preconceptional rate (Riis, 2006). Although most women with quiescent disease in early pregnancy do not have relapses, when a lare develops, it may be severe. lso, active disease in early pregnancy increases the likelihood of poor pregnancy outcome, which is discussed subsequently. In general, most usual treatment regimens may be continued during pregnancy. Diagnostic evaluations should be undertaken if needed to direct management, and surgery should be performed if indicated.

By doing so, more than a third of live births in the United States in 2015 would be defined as having a shortened period of gestation (Martin, 2017). One implication is that only 65 percent of births in the United States occurred during the optimal 39 to 41 weeks' gestation. This emphasizes the realization that fetal maturation in humans is a continuum that is completed later in human pregnancy than previously appreciated. As a result, adverse neonatal sequelae from neonatal immaturity with elective delivery before 39 completed weeks are appreciable (Reddy, 2009; Tita, 2009)."

In a large prospective study, no increased risk of stillbirths, miscarriages, or spontaneous abortions was seen with infliximab, adalimumab, or certolizumab, which are all class B drugs. Infliximab and adalimumab are IgG1 antibodies and are actively transported across the placenta in the late second and third trimester. Infants can have serum levels of both infliximab and adalimumab up to 7 months of age, and live vaccines should be avoided during this time. Certolizumab crosses the placenta by passive diffusion, and infant serum and cord blood levels are minimal. The anti-TNF drugs are relatively safe in nursing. Miniscule levels of both infliximab and adalimumab, but not certolizumab, have been reported in breast milk. These levels are of no clinical significance. It is recommended that drugs not be switched during pregnancy unless necessitated by the medical condition of the IBD. Natalizumab is considered as a class C drug because"

In one study of 56,443 singleton pregnancies in Rotterdam, social deprivation was associated with adverse perinatal outcomes that included SGA newborns (Poeran, 2013). That said, a similar linkage was not found in socially deprived women of non-Western origin. The efect of immigration, however, is complex and dependent on the population studied (Howell, 2017; Sanchez-Vaznaugh, 2016)."
