However, based on the information provided, it is clear that BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) plays a crucial role in promoting neuronal growth, differentiation, repair, and survival, as well as supporting synaptic plasticity and memory. BDNF has been linked to improved memory function and cognitive performance. On the other hand, there is no mention of \"BNN27\" in the provided documents. It is possible that \"BNN27\" is not a valid or recognized term in the context of neuroscience or medicine.

            "content": "Neurotrophic factors (Table 444e-3) are secreted proteins that modulate neuronal growth, differentiation, repair, and survival; some have additional functions, including roles in neurotransmission and in the synaptic reorganization involved in learning and memory. The neurotrophin (NT) family contains nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), NT3, and NT4/5. The neurotrophins act at TrK and p75 receptors to promote survival of neurons. BDNF is linked to synaptogenesis. Certain polymorphisms are linked to increased risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), and BDNF is depleted in Huntington\u2019s disease. Because of their survival-promoting and antiapoptotic effects, neurotrophic factors are in theory outstanding candidates for therapy of disorders characterized by premature death of neurons such as occurs in ALS and other degenerative motor neuron disorders. Knockout mice lacking receptors for ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) or BDNF show loss of motor neurons, and"

This frustrating experience, often the source of jokes and humor, is referred to as benign forgetfulness of the elderly. Benign means that it is not so progressive or serious that it impairs reasonably successful and productive daily functioning, although the distinction between benign and more significant memory loss can be difficult to make. At age 85, the average person is able to learn and recall approximately one-half of the items (e.g., words on a list) that he or she could at age 18. A measurable cognitive problem that does not seriously disrupt daily activities is often referred to as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Factors that predict progression from MCI to an AD dementia include a prominent memory deficit, family history of dementia, presence of an apolipoprotein \u03b54 (Apo \u03b54) allele, small hippocampal volumes, an AD-like signature of cortical atrophy, low cerebrospinal fluid A\u03b2, and elevated tau or"

Recent events appear to be stored in short-term memory by ongoing neural activity because short-term memory persists for only minutes. Short-term memory is used, for instance, to remember page numbers in a book after looking them up in the index. Long-term memory can be subdivided into an intermediate form, which can be disrupted, and a long-lasting form, which is difficult to disrupt. Memory loss, or amnesia, can be caused by a loss of memory information per se, or it can result from interference with the mechanism for accessing the information. Long-term memory probably involves structural changes because it can remain intact even after events that disrupt short-term memory."

These changes seem to proceed without relationship to Alzheimer neurofibrillary changes and senile plaques (Kemper). However, more recent morphologic work, summarized by Morrison and Hof, suggests that cerebral cell loss with aging is less pronounced than previously thought. Furthermore, as pointed out by Morrison, the hippocampus may have only minimal cell loss. Moreover, this is partially a result of neurogenesis in this region. Brain shrinkage is accounted for in part by the reduction in size of large neurons, not their disappearance. There is a more substantial reduction in neuronal number in the substantia nigra, locus ceruleus, and basal forebrain nuclei. It"

Brain atrophy occurs with aging after the age of 60 years. Atrophy proceeds at varying rates in different parts of the brain (Fig. 11-14) and is often accompanied by an inflammatory response and microglial activation. Age-associated brain atrophy may contribute to age-related declines in cognitive and motor function. Atrophy may also be a factor in some brain diseases that can occur with aging, such as mild cognitive impairment, in which persons have mild but detectable impairments on tests of cognition but no severe disability in daily activities.
