These effects are widely employed as a means to develop novel antipsychotic and cognitive-enhancing drugs. Selective 5-HT2A antagonists, as well as atypical antipsychotic drugs, are much more potent than D2 antagonists in blocking these effects of PCP and MK-801.

            "content": "Because of the homology between the H3 and H4 receptors, some H3 ligands also have affinity for the H4 receptor. H4 blockers have potential in chronic inflammatory conditions such as asthma, in which eosinophils and mast cells play a prominent role. No selective H4 ligand is available for use in humans, but in addition to research agents listed in Table 16\u20131, many H1-selective blockers (eg, diphenhydramine, cetirizine, loratadine) show some affinity for this receptor. Several studies have suggested that H4-receptor antagonists may be useful in pruritus, asthma, allergic rhinitis, and pain conditions."
