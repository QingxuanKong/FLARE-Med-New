    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the context of ZP-PTH and its development. ZP-PTH is a calcimimetic agent that mimics the action of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and is being developed for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism. Given its mechanism of action and its classification as a calcimimetic agent, we can infer that it is likely to be tested in clinical trials. To determine if ZP-PTH has been tested in a phase II clinical trial, we need to look for information about its development status. According to the provided documents, calcimimetic agents like cinacalcet have been approved for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism and are in clinical trials for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism. This suggests that calcimimetics, including ZP-PTH, are being tested in clinical trials. However, without specific information about ZP-PTH, we can look at the general process of clinical trials for calcimimetics. Phase II trials typically involve testing the efficacy and safety of a drug in a larger group of patients than phase I trials, but smaller than phase III trials. Given the classification of ZP-PTH as a calcimimetic agent and its intended use for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism, it is likely that ZP-PTH has been tested in a phase II clinical trial.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Oral phosphate and bisphosphonates have been tried but cannot be recommended. A substantial proportion of asymptomatic patients with mild disease do not get worse and may be followed without treatment, although a number of such patients do end up requiring surgery. The calcimimetic agent cinacalcet, discussed previously, has been approved for secondary hyperparathyroidism and is in clinical trials for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism. If such drugs prove efficacious and cost effective, medical management of this disease will need to be reconsidered. Primary hyperparathyroidism is often associated with low levels of 25(OH)D, suggesting that mild vitamin D deficiency may be contributing to the elevated PTH levels, although this could also be due to the stimulation by PTH of 1,25(OH)2D production that in turn"

A second mechanism involves the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) which, when stimulated by calcium, reduces PTH production and secretion. The parathyroid gland also contains the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the enzyme, CYP27B1, that produces 1,25(OH)2D, thus enabling circulating or endogenously produced 1,25(OH)2D to suppress PTH production. 1,25(OH)2D also induces the CaSR, making the parathyroid gland more sensitive to suppression by calcium. Biologic activity resides in the amino terminal region of PTH such that synthetic PTH 1-34 (available as teriparatide) is fully active.

Continuous exposure to elevated PTH (as in hyperparathyroidism or long-term infusions in animals) leads to increased osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. However, the intermittent administration of PTH, elevating hormone levels for 1\u20132 h each day, leads to a net stimulation of bone formation rather than bone breakdown.

            "content": "Teriparatide, the recombinant form of PTH 1-34, is approved for treatment of osteoporosis. It is given in a dosage of 20 mcg subcutaneously daily. Teriparatide stimulates new bone formation, but unlike fluoride, this new bone appears structurally normal and is associated with a substantial reduction in the incidence of fractures. The drug is approved for only 2 years of use. Trials examining the sequential use of teriparatide followed by a bisphosphonate after 1 or 2 years are in progress and look promising. Use of the drug with a bisphosphonate has not shown greater efficacy than the bisphosphonate alone, although recent trials with the concomitant use of teriparatide and denosumab show promise. Calcitonin is approved for use in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. It has been shown to increase bone mass and reduce fractures, but only in the spine. It does not appear to be as effective as bisphosphonates or teriparatide."

            "content": "The classical concept of PTH action related to the regulation of serum calcium levels and bone resorption is more complex. For some time now, it has been known that PTH can also stimulate bone formation. In other words, it has an anabolic action (increases bone formation) in contrast to its catabolic action to cause bone resorption. In fact, clinical trials in which PTH hormone was administered to post-menopausal women with osteoporosis have shown significant increases in bone formation and bone mineral density. Increases in the amount of cancellous (trabecular) bone due to PTH treatment were shown in the ilium, vertebral bodies, and the shafts of radial and femoral bones (see Folder 8.2). The possible mechanisms behind this counterintuitive anabolic action of PTH are largely unknown. It is speculated that activation of different PTH-regulated genes might be responsible for each of the hormone\u2019s contrasting effects. Bone can repair itself after injury."
