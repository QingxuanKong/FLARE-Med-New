    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the characteristics of retroviral vectors and adenoviral vectors. Retroviral vectors are derived from retroviruses, which are a type of virus that can integrate into the host cell genome. Adenoviral vectors, on the other hand, are derived from adenoviruses, which are a type of DNA virus that can replicate in a wide range of cell types. The question asks if pRETRO-SUPER is an adenoviral vector. Since the information about pRETRO-SUPER is not provided, we need to consider the general characteristics of retroviral vectors and adenoviral vectors. Retroviral vectors are typically derived from retroviruses, which can integrate into the host cell genome, whereas adenoviral vectors are derived from adenoviruses, which do not integrate into the host cell genome. Therefore, if pRETRO-SUPER is a retroviral vector, it is likely to be derived from a retrovirus and may integrate into the host cell genome. However, without more information about pRETRO-SUPER, we cannot conclude that it is an adenoviral vector. Based on the general characteristics of retroviral vectors, it is more likely that pRETRO-SUPER is a retroviral vector.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Because delivery of naked DNA or RNA to a cell is an inefficient process, most gene transfer is carried out using a vector, or gene delivery vehicle. These vehicles have generally been engineered from viruses by deleting some or all of the viral genome and replacing it with the therapeutic gene of interest under the control of a suitable promoter (Table 91e-1). Gene transfer strategies can thus be described in terms of three essential elements: (1) a vector; (2) a gene to be delivered, sometimes called the transgene; and (3) a physiologically relevant target cell to which the DNA or RNA is delivered. The series of steps in which the vector and donated DNA enter the target cell and express the transgene is referred to as transduction.
