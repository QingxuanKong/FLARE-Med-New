Marimastat is a drug that inhibits matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. Document [0] does not mention marimastat, but Document [22] mentions a chemotherapy agent called topotecan, which is used in the treatment of small-cell lung cancer. However, Document [22] does not mention marimastat. Document [1] mentions that small-cell lung cancer is usually exquisitely sensitive to platinum-based combination regimens, including cisplatin and etoposide, but does not mention marimastat. Document [22] also mentions that topotecan is used as a second-line treatment for small-cell lung cancer, but does not mention marimastat. Document [14] mentions a drug called necitumumab, which is a monoclonal antibody directed against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), but does not mention marimastat. Document [10] mentions that erlotinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets EGFR, but does not mention marimastat. Document [26] mentions that patients with advanced NSCLC should have molecular testing of their tumor, but does not mention marimastat. Based on the information provided, there is no clear evidence to suggest that marimastat is effective for small-cell lung cancer. Therefore, the answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) makes up about 75\u201380% of all cases of lung cancer, and this group includes adenocarcinoma, squamous cell cancer, and large cell cancer, while small cell lung cancer (SCLC) makes up the remaining 20\u201325%. When NSCLC is diagnosed in an advanced stage with metastatic disease, the prognosis is extremely poor, with a median survival of about 8 months. It is clear that prevention (primarily through avoidance of cigarette smoking) and early detection remain the most important means of control. When diagnosed at an early stage, surgical resection results in patient cure. Moreover, recent studies have shown that adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy provides a survival benefit in patients with pathologic stage IB, II, and IIIA disease. However, in most cases, distant metastases have occurred at the time of diagnosis. In certain instances, radiation therapy can be"

Metastases from certain tumor types that are highly chemosensitive, such as germ cell tumors or small-cell lung cancer, may respond to chemotherapeutic regimens chosen according to the underlying malignancy. Increasingly, there are data demonstrating responsiveness of brain metastases to chemotherapy including small molecule\u2013targeted therapy when the lesion possesses the target. This has been best illustrated in patients with lung cancer harboring EGFR mutations that sensitize them to EGFR inhibitors.

As first-line chemotherapy regimens improve, a substantial number of patients will maintain a good performance status and a desire for further therapy when they develop recurrent disease. Currently, several agents are FDA approved for second-line use in NSCLC including docetaxel, pemetrexed, erlotinib (approved for second-line therapy regardless of tumor genotype), and crizotinib (for patients with ALK -mutant lung cancer only).

This classification has been recently replaced by a 2015 World Health Organization classification (a simplified version of which is shown in Table 13.6). The reason for this historic division is that virtually all SCLCs have metastasized by the time of diagnosis. Therefore, they are best treated with systemic chemotherapy, with or without radiation therapy. By contrast, NSCLCs are more likely to be resectable and usually respond poorly to conventional chemotherapy. However, therapies are now available that target specific oncoproteins that are found in a subset of NSCLC, mainly adenocarcinomas but also squamous cell carcinomas.

The peak incidence of lung cancer is in individuals in their fifties and sixties. At diagnosis, more than 50% of patients already have distant metastases, while an additional one-fourth have disease in the regional lymph nodes. The prognosis remains dismal: the 5-year survival rate for all stages of lung cancer combined is about 16%, a figure that has not changed much over the last 35 years; even with disease localized to the lung, the 5-year survival rate is only 45%. The four major histologic types of carcinomas of the lung are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma (a subtype of neuroendocrine carcinoma), and large cell carcinoma ("

The term non\u2013small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) includes many tumor cell types, including large cell, squamous cell, and adenocarcinoma. His-torically, these subtypes were considered to be a uniform group based on limited understanding of the distinct clinical behaviors of the subtypes as well as the fact that there were few treat-ment options available. With increasing understanding of the molecular biology underlying these tumor subtypes, however, the approach to diagnosis and management and the terminology used in describing these tumors are evolving rapidly.Adenocarcinoma The incidence of adenocarcinoma has increased over the last several decades, and it is now the most common lung cancer, accounting for 30% of lung cancers in Table 19-1Difference between invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma and nonmucinous adenocarcinoma in"

            "content": "Patients with advanced NSCLC should have molecular testing of their tumor. Patients whose tumors contain an actionable mutation should then receive a targeted therapy. For example, first-line therapy with erlotinib significantly improves outcomes in advanced NSCLC patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations, which include exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations. Afatinib is a small molecule inhibitor of EGFR, HER2, and HER4, and it is approved for the first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 mutations. Osimertinib is approved for the treatment of metastatic EGFR T790M-mutant NSCLC following progression on or after EGFR TKI therapy. This small molecule is important as it is able to overcome the resistance that arises from the emergence of the T790M gatekeeper mutation either de novo or following previous EGFR TKI therapy. In NSCLC that is ALK-positive, three new small molecules have been developed: crizotinib,"

            "content": "The World Health Organization (WHO) defines lung cancer as tumors arising from the respiratory epithelium (bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli). The WHO classification system divides epithelial lung cancers into four major cell types: small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma; the latter three types are collectively known as non-small-cell carcinomas (NSCLCs) (Fig. 107-1). Small-cell carcinomas consist of small cells with scant cytoplasm, ill-defined cell borders, finely granular nuclear chromatin, absent or inconspicuous nucleoli, and a high mitotic count. SCLC may be distinguished from NSCLC by the presence of neuroendocrine markers including CD56, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), synaptophysin, and chromogranin. In North America, adenocarcinoma is the most common histologic type of lung cancer. Adenocarcinomas possess glandular differentiation or mucin production and may show acinar, papillary, lepidic, or solid features or"
