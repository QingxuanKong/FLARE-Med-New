The RIGHT-2 trial is not mentioned in the documents, but we can infer that the question is likely referring to the RIGHT trial (Right-Right trial), which was a study on prehospital treatment of acute ischemic stroke with transdermal glyceryl trinitrate. From the information provided in Document [19] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison), we know that nitrates in various forms may be used to decrease preload and congestive symptoms. Oral isosorbide dinitrate, topical nitroglycerin ointment, and intravenous nitroglycerin all have the advantage over a diuretic of lowering preload through venodilation without decreasing the total plasma volume. However, we do not find any information about the RIGHT trial specifically. We also do not find any information about the effectiveness of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate in the context of stroke treatment. Therefore, we cannot determine the effectiveness of prehospital transdermal glyceryl trinitrate for stroke based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

A trial in over 8,000 patients failed to demonstrate benefit of low dose supplemental oxygen in the acute setting (Roffe et al). Induced hypothermia limits the size of ischemic stroke, but it is technically difficult to administer and often has serious side effects. In the past, much attention was paid to head and body positioning in the acute phase of stroke but the sitting up position failed to confer an advantage over the supine position in a randomized trial (Anderson et al)."

Early anticoagulation after an acute stroke carries an uncertain risk of hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic infarct.

One currently favored approach, based in part on the WARSS trial, is to simply administer aspirin in all cases of acute stroke. This approach is further endorsed by the WASID trial comparing aspirin (1,300 mg/d) to warfarin for treatment of intracranial arterial stenosis on the basis that warfarin was no better at preventing strokes while aspirin was associated with fewer gastrointestinal hemorrhages and a lower overall death rate.

Blood pressure lowering, a readily observable surrogate endpoint, does not have a tightly coupled relationship with strokes prevented. Consequently, demonstrating therapeutic effectiveness cannot rely simply on observing the outcome of an individual patient but should instead be based on large groups of patients carefully studied and properly analyzed."

Three subsequent trials of IV rtPA did not confirm this benefit, perhaps because of the dose of rtPA used, the timing of its delivery, and small sample size. When data from all randomized IV rtPA trails were combined, however, efficacy was confirmed in the <3-h time window, and efficacy likely extended to 4.5 h and possibly to 6 h. Based on these combined results, the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) III explored the safety and efficacy of rtPA in the 3to 4.5-h time window. Unlike the NINDS study, patients older than 80 years of age and diabetic patients with a previous stroke were excluded. In this 821-patient randomized study, efficacy was again confirmed, although the treatment effect was less robust than in the 0to 3-h time window. In the rtPA group, 52.4% of patients achieved a good outcome at 90 days, compared to 45.2% of the placebo group (odds ratio [OR] 1.34, p = .04). The symptomatic"

INTERACT2 randomized patients with spontaneous ICH within 6 h of onset and a baseline SBP of 150\u2013220 mmHg to two different SBP targets (<140 mmHg and <180 mmHg). In those with the target SBP <140 mmHg, 52% had an outcome of death or major disability at 90 days compared with 55.6% of those with a target SBP <180 mmHg (p = .06). There was a significant shift to improved outcomes in the lower blood pressure arm, whereas both groups had a similar mortality. This study shows that it is not harmful, and may be modestly beneficial, to lower blood pressure in acute ICH. Thus, it is reasonable to target an SBP <140 mmHg initially in this group of patients. In patients who have higher SBP on presentation or who are deeply comatose with possible elevated ICP, it is unclear whether the INTERACT2 results apply. In patients who have ICP monitors in place,"
