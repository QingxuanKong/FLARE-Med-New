    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what lucatumumab is and how it differs from other types of antibodies. According to the provided documents, lucatumumab is not mentioned explicitly. However, we can infer that the question is likely referring to lucatumumab being a typo and actually referring to lucentis, which is a recombinant humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and is used to treat macular degeneration. Another document mentions lucatumumab as a recombinant humanized IgG4 antibody, but this is likely referring to the same molecule as lucentis. Therefore, based on this information, we can conclude that lucatumumab is not a polyclonal antibody, but rather a recombinant humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody. However, since this option is not available, we can only choose the closest correct answer based on the available options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Ofatumumab is approved for patients with CLL who are refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab. Ofatumumab binds to all B cells including B-CLL. It is thought to lyse B-CLL cells in the presence of complement and to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

We start by discussing the use of depleting and nondepleting antibodies to remove lymphocytes nonspecifically. The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab was originally developed to treat B-cell lymphomas, but has also been tried in treating certain autoimmune diseases. By ligating CD20, rituximab (Rituxan, MabThera) transduces a signal that induces lymphocyte apoptosis and depletes B cells for several months. Certain autoimmune diseases are believed to involve autoantibody-mediated pathogenesis. There is evidence for the efficacy of rituximab in some patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, or type II mixed cryoglobulinemia, all of which have autoantibodies as a part of their clinical presentation.
