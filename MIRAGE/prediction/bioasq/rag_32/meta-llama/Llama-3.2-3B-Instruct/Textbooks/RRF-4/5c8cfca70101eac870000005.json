Thus, it is evident that HPV proteins promote many of the hallmarks of cancer. The primacy of HPV infection in the causation of cervical cancer is confirmed by the effectiveness of HPV vaccines in preventing it. However, infection with HPV itself is not sufficient for carcinogenesis, and full-blown transformation requires the acquisition of mutations in host cancer genes, such as RAS. A high proportion of women infected with HPV clear the infection by immunologic mechanisms, but others do not, some because of acquired immune abnormalities, such as those that result from HIV infection. As might be expected, women who are coinfected with high-risk HPV types and HIV are at particularly high risk for developing cervical cancer."
