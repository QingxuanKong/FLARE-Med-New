The provided documents mention various genetic disorders and their associations with different genes, but we need to find a specific mention of FGF2 or FGF13 in relation to encephalopathy.\\n\\nAfter reviewing the documents, we can see that FGF2 is mentioned in the context of disorders such as Apert syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in the FGFR2 gene. However, there is no direct mention of FGF2 or FGF13 being associated with encephalopathy.\\n\\nHowever, we can look for any indirect associations. The documents mention that mutations in the FGFR2 gene, which is also known as FGF2, are associated with various disorders, including craniosynostosis syndromes and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2I (FKRP). While these disorders are not directly related to encephalopathy, they do involve abnormalities in brain development and function.\\n\\nGiven the lack of direct evidence, we can conclude that there is no clear association between variants in FGF2 (also known as FGF13) and encephalopathy based on the provided documents.\\n\\nHowever, it is worth noting that the documents do mention the potential for genetic variants to contribute to complex diseases, including those involving the brain. Therefore, it is possible that variants in FGF2 could be associated with encephalopathy in some cases, but this information is not provided in the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

What is interesting about copy number variation is that they may give rise to several phenotypes of similar disorder, quite unlike conventional mendelian mutations. This indicates that copy number variants, like SNPs, probably are not usually directly causative of a condition but instead modulate other functions that express proteins.
