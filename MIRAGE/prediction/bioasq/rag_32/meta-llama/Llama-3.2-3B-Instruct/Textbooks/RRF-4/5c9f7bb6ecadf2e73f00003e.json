    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the properties of Vedolizumab and its excretion into breast milk. Vedolizumab is a monoclonal antibody with activity directed against the \\u00b44/\\u00b77 integrin, and it is administered intravenously. According to the provided documents, most drugs given to the mother are secreted in breast milk, although the amount ingested by the infant typically is small. The ratio of drug concentration in breast milk relative to serum ranges from ~5% (valproic acid) to 300% (levetiracetam). Vedolizumab is not explicitly mentioned in Document [1] and [2] as being secreted in breast milk. However, since it is a monoclonal antibody, it is likely to be excreted into breast milk. Document [3] mentions that natalizumab, another monoclonal antibody targeting the \\u00b44 subunit, is secreted in breast milk. Given the similarities between natalizumab and vedolizumab, it is reasonable to assume that vedolizumab may also be secreted in breast milk. Furthermore, Document [8] states that vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, and Document [7] mentions that humanized monoclonal antibodies are generally excreted into breast milk. Therefore, based on this information, we can infer that therapeutic levels of vedolizumab can be found in the breast milk of nursing mothers following treatment for Inflammatory bowel disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

            "content": "Vedolizumab is a monoclonal antibody with activity directed specifically against the \u03b14/\u03b27 integrin, thereby blocking interaction of leukocytes with gut vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecules. Because lymphocytes trafficking to the brain are unaffected, the risk of reactivation of JC virus and PML is believed to be extremely low. With the advent of vedolizumab, natalizumab is almost never used for the treatment of IBD. Vedolizumab is increasingly used as a second-line treatment for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s disease who cannot take anti-TNF agents due to side effects, lack of efficacy, or loss of response. After intravenous induction therapy of 300 mg at 0, 2, and 6 weeks, patients with a clinical response are treated with intravenous maintenance therapy every 8 weeks. Vedolizumab appears to have a very low incidence of serious side effects. Neutralizing antibodies may develop in 2\u201310% of patients."

Infliximab and adalimumab are IgG1 antibodies and are actively transported across the placenta in the late second and third trimester. Infants can have serum levels of both infliximab and adalimumab up to 7 months of age, and live vaccines should be avoided during this time. Certolizumab crosses the placenta by passive diffusion, and infant serum and cord blood levels are minimal. The anti-TNF drugs are relatively safe in nursing. Miniscule levels of both infliximab and adalimumab, but not certolizumab, have been reported in breast milk. These levels are of no clinical significance.

Integrins consist of heterodimers that contain two subunits, alpha and beta. Two monoclonal antibodies directed against integrins are available for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease: natalizumab and vedolizumab. Both are administered intravenously. Natalizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody targeted only against the \u03b14 subunit; thus, it blocks several integrins on circulating inflammatory cells and prevents binding to the vascular adhesion molecules and subsequent migration into surrounding tissues, including the bowel and central nervous system.

The ratio of drug concentration in breast milk to that in maternal plasma is the milk-to-plasma drug-concentration ratio. Ideally, to minimize infant exposure, medication selection should favor drugs with a shorter halflife, poorer oral absorption, and lower lipid solubility. If multiple daily drug doses are required, then each is taken by the mother ater the closest feed. Single daily-dosed drugs may be taken just before the longest infant sleep interval-usually at bedtime (Spencer, 2002)."

In this regard, a few generalizations can be made. First, consensus supports that pregnancy does not increase the likelihood of an inlammatory bowel disease flare (.1ahadevan, 2015). Indeed, in a 10-year surveillance of women in the European Collaborative on Inflammatory Bowel Disease, the likelihood of a lare during pregnancy was decreased compared with the preconceptional rate (Riis, 2006). Although most women with quiescent disease in early pregnancy do not have relapses, when a lare develops, it may be severe. lso, active disease in early pregnancy increases the likelihood of poor pregnancy outcome, which is discussed subsequently. In general, most usual treatment regimens may be continued during pregnancy. Diagnostic evaluations should be undertaken if needed to direct management, and surgery should be performed if indicated.

In some cases this may allow time for drugs to be partially cleared from the mother\u2019s blood, and the concentrations in breast milk will be relatively low. Most antibiotics taken by nursing mothers can be detected in breast milk. Tetracycline concentrations in breast milk are approximately 70% of maternal serum concentrations and present a risk of permanent tooth staining in the infant. Isoniazid rapidly reaches equilibrium between breast milk and maternal blood. The concentrations achieved in breast milk are high enough so that signs of pyridoxine deficiency may occur in the infant if the mother is not given pyridoxine supplements."

            "content": "Neutropenia and reduction in platelet counts occur occasionally, and lipids (eg, cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and HDL) should be monitored. GI perforation has been reported when using tocilizumab in patients with diverticulitis and in those using corticosteroids, although it is not clear that this adverse effect is more common than with TNF-\u03b1\u2013blocking agents. Demyelinating disorders including multiple sclerosis are rarely associated with tocilizumab use. Fewer than 1% of the patients taking tocilizumab develop anaphylactic reaction. Anti-tocilizumab antibodies develop in 2% of the patients, and these can be associated with hypersensitivity reactions requiring discontinuation. Cytokines play a central role in the immune response (see Chapter 55) and in RA. Although a wide range of cytokines are expressed in the joints of RA patients, TNF-\u03b1 appears to be particularly important in the inflammatory process."

            "content": "In both UC and CD, an inflammatory pathway thus likely emerges from the genetic predisposition that is associated with inappropriate innate immune and epithelial sensing and reactivity to commensal bacteria that secrete inflammatory mediators together with inadequate regulatory pathways that lead to activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells within the epithelium and lamina propria that altogether secrete excessive quantities of inflammatory cytokines relative to anti-inflammatory cytokines. Some cytokines activate other inflammatory cells (macrophages and B cells), and others act indirectly to recruit other lymphocytes, inflammatory leukocytes, and mononuclear cells from the bloodstream into the gut through interactions between homing receptors on leukocytes (e.g., \u03b14\u03b27 integrin) and addressins on vascular endothelium (e.g., MadCAM1). Consistent with this, neutralization of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or \u03b14\u03b27 integrin demonstrate therapeutic efficacy in IBD. CD4+ T helper (TH) cells that"

Val acyclovir and acyclovir may be used for symptomatic maternal lesions during breastfeeding, as drug concentrations in breast milk are low. One study found the acyclovir concentration to be only 2 percent of that used for therapeutic dosing of the neonate (Sheield, 2002a)."

            "content": "After parturition, the human breast produces colostrum, which is enriched with antimicrobial and antiinflammatory proteins. In the absence of placental progesterone, normal breast milk production occurs within a few days. The lobuloalveolar structures produce milk, which is subsequently modified by the ductal epithelium. Lactogenesis and maintenance of milk production (galactopoiesis) require stimulation by pituitary PRL in the presence of normal levels of other hormones, including insulin, cortisol, and thyroid hormone. Although placental estrogen stimulates PRL secretion during pregnancy, the stimulus for PRL secretion during the nursing period is suckling by the infant ("
