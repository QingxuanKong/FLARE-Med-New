        "A": "yes",
        "B": "no"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the role of SMAD6 in the context of craniosynostosis and FGFR signaling pathways. SMAD6 is an inhibitory Smad that regulates the FGFR signaling pathway by competing with R-Smads for binding sites on the receptor, recruiting a ubiquitin ligase to degrade the receptor, and recruiting a protein phosphatase to dephosphorylate and inactivate the receptor. Craniosynostosis is a condition characterized by premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures, and it has been associated with mutations in genes involved in the FGFR signaling pathway, including FGFR2 and FGFR3. While SMAD6 is involved in the regulation of FGFR signaling, there is no direct evidence to suggest that SMAD6 variants cause craniosynostosis. In fact, SMAD6 is more commonly associated with the regulation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways, which are also involved in bone growth and development. Therefore, the correct answer is not directly related to SMAD6 variants causing craniosynostosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

However, most patients with craniosynostosis appear to have mutations in the related FGFR2 gene. The similarities between the phenotypes produced by mutations in genes for FGF receptors and mutations in structural proteins of cartilage are probably explained by the observation that the activity of FGFs is regulated in part by binding of FGFs to proteins sequestered in the extracellular matrix.

Dysostoses result from defects in the formation of mesenchymal condensations and their differentiation into the cartilage anlage. The most common forms include the complete absence of a bone or a digit (aplasia), extra bones or digits (supernumerary digit), and abnormal fusion of bones (e.g., syndactyly, craniosynostosis). Genetic alterations that affect homeobox genes, cytokines, and cytokine receptors are especially common among the dysostoses. In contrast, dysplasias arise from mutations in genes that control development or remodeling of the entire skeleton. It is important to note that, as for developmental anomalies in other tissues, the term dysplasia implies abnormal growth rather than a premalignant lesion as used in the context of neoplasia (Chapter 6)."

These conditions are characterized by minimal or absent androgenization in utero, but some phallic development can occur during adolescence due to the action of other enzyme isoforms. Individuals with 5\u03b1-reductase type 2 deficiency have normal wolffian structures and usually do not develop breast tissue. At puberty, the increase in testosterone induces muscle mass and other virilizing features despite DHT deficiency. Some individuals change gender from female to male at puberty. Thus, the management of this disorder is challenging. DHT cream can improve prepubertal phallic growth in patients raised as male. Gonadectomy before adolescence and estrogen replacement at puberty can be considered in individuals raised as females who have a female gender identity. Disruption of alternative pathways to fetal DHT"

The disease is caused by a mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene that results in a gain-of-function state. Most cases are sporadic mutations. However, when the disorder appears in families, the inheritance pattern is consistent with an autosomal dominant disorder. The primary defect is abnormal chondrocyte proliferation at the growth plate that causes development of short, but proportionately thick, long bones. Other regions of the long bones may be relatively unaffected. The disorder is manifest by the presence of short limbs (particularly the proximal portions), normal trunk, large head, saddle nose, and an exaggerated lumbar lordosis. Severe spinal deformity may lead to cord compression. The homozygous disorder is more serious than the sporadic form and may cause neonatal death. Pseudoachondroplasia clinically resembles"

A few women from families with mild variants of OI do not develop fractures until after menopause, and their disease may be difficult to distinguish from postmenopausal osteoporosis. Incidence Type I OI has a frequency of about 1 in 15,000\u201320,000 births. Type II OI has a reported incidence of about 1 in 60,000. Only a limited number of patients with the severe forms of OI have been reported, and the combined incidence of the severe forms that are recognizable at birth (types II, III, and IV) may be higher than 1 in 60,000."

The category also includes some individuals with normal stature and body proportions who have features such as ocular changes or cleft palate, which are common in more severe CDs. Many patients develop degenerative joint changes, and mild CD in adults may be difficult to differentiate from primary generalized osteoarthritis. An undefined number of patients have mutations in either the most abundant collagen in cartilage (type II) or the less abundant collagens (types X or XI). Other patients have mutations in genes that code for other components of cartilage or for proteins required for the embryonic development of cartilage, including a common mutation in a gene for a fibroblast growth factor receptor."
