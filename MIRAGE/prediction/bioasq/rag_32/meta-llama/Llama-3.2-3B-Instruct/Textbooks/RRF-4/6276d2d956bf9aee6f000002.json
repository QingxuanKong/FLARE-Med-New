This effect is particularly valuable in diabetes, and these drugs are now recommended in diabetes even in the absence of hypertension. These benefits probably result from improved intra-renal hemodynamics, with decreased glomerular efferent arteriolar resistance and a resulting reduction of intraglomerular capillary pressure. ACE inhibitors have also proved to be extremely useful in the treatment of heart failure and as treatment after myocardial infarction, and there is evidence that ACE inhibitors reduce the incidence of diabetes in patients with high cardiovascular risk (see Chapter 13)."

Overactivity of this system has been implicated in hypertension, heart failure, and other diseases. Drugs that block the formation or actions of ANG II are used extensively in the treatment of these diseases. More recent observations suggest that the system is even more complex than originally envisioned.

            "content": "Angiotensin AT1 receptor blockers such as losartan (see Chapters 11 and 17) appear to have similar beneficial effects. In combination with sacubitril, valsartan is now approved for HFrEF. Angiotensin receptor blockers should be considered in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors because of incessant cough. Aliskiren, a renin inhibitor approved for hypertension, was found to have no definitive benefit in clinical trials for heart failure. Vasodilators are effective in acute heart failure because they provide a reduction in preload (through venodilation), or reduction in afterload (through arteriolar dilation), or both. Some evidence suggests that long-term vasodilation by hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate can also reduce damaging remodeling of the heart."
