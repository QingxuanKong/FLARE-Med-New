MVA85A is a vaccine against tuberculosis, not smallpox. However, the question seems to be related to the concept of attenuated forms of vaccinia, such as modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA). The document mentions that research continues on attenuated forms of vaccinia such as MVA. Given this information, we can infer that MVA is a form of attenuated vaccinia, which is closely related to smallpox. However, it is not the same as smallpox. The key to answering this question is to understand that MVA is not a vaccine against smallpox, but rather a vaccine against tuberculosis. Therefore, the answer is not a straightforward yes or no. However, based on the information provided, we can conclude that MVA does not confer immunity against smallpox. The correct answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The immune system can also be induced to respond to simple nonliving antigens, and experimental immunologists have focused on the responses to these simple antigens in developing our understanding of the immune response. The deliberate induction of an immune response is known as immunization. Experimental immunizations are routinely carried out by injecting the test antigen into the animal or human subject. The route, dose, and form in which antigen is administered can profoundly affect whether a response occurs and the type of response that is produced. The induction of protective immune responses against common microbial pathogens in humans is often called vaccination, although this term originally referred to the induction of immune responses against smallpox by immunizing with the cross-reactive virus, vaccinia."

Because smallpox was eradicated in 1978, it is presumed that their responses represent true immunological memory and are not due to restimulation from time to time by the smallpox virus. One study found strong vaccinia-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell memory responses as long as 75 years after the original immunization, and from the strength of these responses it was estimated that the memory response had an approximate half-life of between 8 and 15 years. Half-life represents the time required for a response to diminish to 50% of its original strength. By contrast with T-cell memory, titers of antivirus antibody remained stable, almost without measurable decline."

Variolation\u2014the inhalation or transfer into superficial skin wounds of material from smallpox pustules\u2014had been practiced since at least the 1400s in the Middle East and China as a form of protection against that disease and was known to Jenner.

            "content": "There is no licensed specific therapy for smallpox, and historic treatments have focused solely on supportive care. Although several antiviral agents, including cidofovir, that are licensed for other diseases have in vitro activity against V. major, they have never been tested in the setting of human disease. For this reason, it is difficult to predict whether or not they would be effective in cases of smallpox and, if effective, whether or not they would be of value in patients with advanced disease. Agents currently being studied as possible antiviral compounds against V.\ufffdmajor include a viral egress inhibitor (tecovirimat, ST-246, or Arestvyr) and a lipid-conjugated form of cidofovir (brincidofovir, CMX001). preparations were made for mass production of 261e-7"

Concern about smallpox has recently increased because of the threat of bioterrorism (Chap. 261e). The lesions of smallpox are larger than those of chickenpox and are all at the same stage of evolution at any given time."

            "content": "In this chapter, we consider the various ways in which the immune system can be manipulated to suppress unwanted immune responses in the form of autoimmunity, allergy, and graft rejection, or to stimulate protective immune responses. Intentional manipulations of the immune system date back over 500 years to the use of variolation as a measure to protect against smallpox. In the late 1800s these measures advanced greatly with the development of numerous vaccines and antisera against other infectious agents. Later progress, against unwanted immune responses, came with the introduction of a number of now-conventional pharmaceutical agents; although these allow only relatively nonspecific control over unwanted immune reactions, they remain an important component of clinical medicine. More recently, these standard therapeutics have been joined by so-called biological therapeutics, or biologics, which are artificially produced versions of natural products, such as hormones, cytokines, and"
