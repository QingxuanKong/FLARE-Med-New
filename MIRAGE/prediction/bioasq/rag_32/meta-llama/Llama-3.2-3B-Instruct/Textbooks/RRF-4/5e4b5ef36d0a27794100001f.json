Antioxidants have slowed the clinical progress of ALS in limited and unconfirmed trials. Masitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been tried in a number of degenerative disorders and is under investigation in ALS. Some of these claims have been confirmed in several followup studies, although again, the benefit has been marginal. Several additional agents are reported to have been effective in genetic models of ALS. Among the long list of agents that have claimed, but ultimately failed, to help ALS are guanidine hydrochloride, injections of cobra venom, gangliosides, interferons, high-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone."

These benefits seem most conspicuous when treatment begins early in the RRMS stage of the illness. Unfortunately, however, already established progressive symptoms do not respond well to treatment with these disease-modifying therapies. Because progressive symptoms are likely to result from accumulated axonal and neuronal loss, many experts now believe that very early treatment with a disease-modifying drug is appropriate for most MS patients. It may also be reasonable to delay initiating treatment in patients with (1) normal neurologic exams, (2) a single attack or a low attack frequency, and (3) a low burden of disease as assessed by brain"

Transdifferentiation of MSCs and ASCs into neural stem cells, and vice versa, has been reported by numerous investigators, and clinical trials of such cells have begun for a number of neurologic diseases. Clinical trials of a conditionally immortalized human cell line and of USCs in stroke are also in progress. Because of the incapacitating nature of neural disorders and the limited endogenous repair capacity of the nervous system, clinical trials of stem cells in neurologic disorders have been particularly numerous, including trials in spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, ALS, acute and chronic stroke, numerous genetic disorders, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and others. In diseases such as ALS, possible benefits are more likely to be due to indirect trophic effects than"

            "content": "The effect of available treatment for any of the motor neuron diseases is modest. A small number of drugs, however, have been developed: riluzole, edaravone, and masitinib. Supportive measures, however, are exceedingly important. In initial office visits, it has been our practice to give the patient some idea of the seriousness of the condition; but in early discussions we avoid the devastating statement that ALS is invariably fatal. Typically, patients and family members will ask explicitly about these matters in subsequent visits; such data as are appropriate to the patient\u2019s circumstances and character can be conveyed at that time, usually with the caveat that any individual may outlive the standard survival statistics."

Despite doubling the length of incubation times in mice inoculated with scrapie prions, all of the mice eventually succumb to illness. Because all of the treated mice develop neurologic dysfunction at the same time, the mutation rate as judged by drug resistance is likely to approach 100%, which is much higher than mutation rates recorded for bacteria and viruses. Mutations in prions seem likely to represent conformational variants that are selected for in mammals where survival becomes limited by the fastest-replicating prions. The results of these studies make it likely that cocktails of drugs that attack a variety of prion conformers will be required for the development of effective therapeutics."
