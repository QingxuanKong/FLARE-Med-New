Tecovirimat, also known as ST-246 or Arestvyr, is a viral egress inhibitor being studied as a possible antiviral compound against smallpox. According to document [0], several antiviral agents, including tecovirimat, have in vitro activity against V. major (the causative agent of smallpox), but their effectiveness in human disease is unknown. However, the document mentions that tecovirimat is being studied as a possible antiviral compound against smallpox, suggesting that there is some evidence to suggest it may be effective. Additionally, document [16] mentions that tecovirimat is a viral egress inhibitor, which could potentially inhibit the spread of the virus. Based on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that tecovirimat may be effective for smallpox, but more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness in human disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

For example, the smallpox virus is a category A agent because of its high transmissibility, case mortality rates of 30% or greater, and the lack of effective therapy. Smallpox readily spreads from person to person, mainly through respiratory secretions and by direct contact with virus in skin lesions. Since routine smallpox vaccination ended in the United States in 1972, immunity has waned, leaving the population highly susceptible.

The current dilemma facing our society regarding assessment of the risk and benefit of smallpox vaccination is that the degree of risk that someone will deliberately and effectively release smallpox into our society is unknown. Given that there are well-described risks associated with vaccination, the degree of risk/benefit for the general population does not favor immunization. As a prudent first step in preparedness for a smallpox attack, however, members of the U.S. armed services received primary or booster immunizations with vaccinia before 1990 and after 2002.

            "content": "In 1980, the WHO recommended that all immunization programs be terminated; that representative samples of variola virus be transferred to two locations, one at the CDC in Atlanta, GA, in the United States and the other at the Institute of Virus Preparations in the Soviet Union; and that all other stocks of smallpox be destroyed. Several years later, it was recommended that these two authorized collections be destroyed. However, these latter recommendations were placed on hold in the wake of increased concerns on the use of variola virus as a biologic weapon and thus the need to maintain an active program of defensive research. Many of these concerns were based on allegations made by former Soviet officials that extensive programs had been in place in that country for the production and weaponization of large quantities of smallpox virus. The dismantling of these programs with the fall of the Soviet Union and the subsequent weakening of security measures led to fears that stocks of"

            "content": "Cidofovir is a phosphonate nucleotide analogue of cytosine. Its major use is in CMV infections, but it is active against a broad range of herpesviruses, including HSV, human herpesvirus (HHV) types 6A and 6B, HHV-8, and certain other DNA viruses such as polyomaviruses, papillomaviruses, adenoviruses, and poxviruses, including variola (smallpox) and vaccinia. Cidofovir does not require initial phosphorylation by virus-induced kinases; the drug is phosphorylated by host cell enzymes to cidofovir diphosphate, which is a competitive inhibitor of viral DNA polymerases and, to a lesser extent, of host cell DNA polymerases. Incorporation of cidofovir diphosphate slows or terminates nascent DNA chain elongation. Cidofovir is active against HSV isolates that are resistant to acyclovir because of absent or altered thymidine kinase and against CMV isolates that are resistant to ganciclovir because of UL97 phosphotransferase mutations. CMV isolates resistant to ganciclovir on the basis of UL54"
