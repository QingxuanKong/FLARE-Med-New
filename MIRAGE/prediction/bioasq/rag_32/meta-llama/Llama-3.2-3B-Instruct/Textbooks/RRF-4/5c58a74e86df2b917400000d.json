These agents competitively and reversibly interact with the active enzyme site to inhibit viral neuraminidase activity at low nanomolar concentrations, resulting in clumping of newly released influenza virions to each other and to the membrane of the infected cell. Early administration is crucial because replication of influenza virus peaks at 24\u201372 hours after the onset of illness. Initiation of a 5-day course of therapy within 48 hours after the onset of illness (75 mg twice daily) modestly decreases the duration of symptoms, as well as duration of viral shedding and viral titer; some studies have also shown a decrease in the incidence of complications. Once-daily prophylaxis (75 mg once daily) is 70\u201390% effective in preventing disease after exposure."

In addition, as with the other neuraminidase inhibitors, an increased risk of hallucinations, delirium, and abnormal behavior in patients with influenza receiving peramivir has been reported."

            "content": "Such an approach might be useful in developing live influenza vaccines. As described in Chapter 13, the influenza virus can reinfect the same host several times, because it undergoes antigenic shift and thus predominantly escapes the original immune response. A weak protection conferred by previous infections with a different subtype of influenza is observed in adults, but not in children, and is called heterosubtypic immunity. The current approach to vaccination against influenza is to use a killed virus vaccine that is reformulated annually on the basis of the prevalent strains of virus. The vaccine is moderately effective, reducing mortality in elderly people and illness in healthy adults. The ideal influenza vaccine would be an attenuated live organism that matched the prevalent virus strain. This could be created by first introducing a series of attenuating mutations into the gene encoding a viral polymerase protein, PB2. The mutated gene segment from the attenuated virus could"
