We are looking for interaction between LRP1 and Urokinase receptor. According to Document [2], Urokinase is a two-chain serine protease derived from cultured fetal kidney cells. It converts plasminogen to plasmin directly by cleaving the Arg560-Val561 bond. Additionally, Document [4] states that the lysine-binding sites of plasminogen (and plasminogen) permit it to bind to fibrin, so that physiologic fibrinolysis is \\u201cfibrin specific\\u2019. Furthermore, Document [4] explains that both plasminogen (through its lysine-binding sites) and tPA possess specific affinity for fibrin and thereby bind selectively to clots. However, there is no direct information about interaction between LRP1 and Urokinase receptor in the provided documents. However, Document [4] does mention that a schematic diagram of the fibrinolytic system is provided in Figure 78-4.

Several events seem to induce NLRP3 signaling: reduced intracellular potassium, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), or the disruption of lysosomes by particulate or crystalline matter. The loss of intracellular potassium through efflux can occur during infection with, for example, intracellular bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus that produce pore-forming toxins. Also, death of nearby cells can release ATP into the extracellular space; this ATP would activate the purinergic receptor P2X7, which itself is a potassium channel, and allow K+ ion efflux. In one model, it is the reduction of intracellular K+ concentration that triggers NLRP3 signaling by causing the dissociation of HSP90 and SGT1. A model proposed for ROS-induced NLRP3 activation involves the intermediate oxidization of sensor proteins"
