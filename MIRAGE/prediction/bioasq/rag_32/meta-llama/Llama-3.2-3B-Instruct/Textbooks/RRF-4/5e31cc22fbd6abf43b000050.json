However, based on the content of the question, we can infer that it is referring to Hemochromatosis type 4, which is mentioned in document [12] as one of the non-HFE-associated forms of hemochromatosis. According to document [12], mutations in the genes encoding hepcidin, transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2), and hemojuvelin result in clinicopathologic features that are indistinguishable from HFE-associated hemochromatosis. However, mutations in ferroportin, responsible for the efflux of iron from enterocytes and most other cell types, result in iron loading of reticuloendothelial cells and macrophages as well as parenchymal cells. Therefore, Hemochromatosis type 4 is caused by a mutation in a gene that is involved in iron metabolism, and since it is not specified to be a recessive or dominant gene, we can conclude that the correct answer is not explicitly stated in the documents. However, based on the general information provided, we can make an educated guess that Hemochromatosis type 4 is caused by a mutation in a recessive gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}} Note: The documents do not explicitly state that Hemochromatosis type 4 is caused by a recessive gene, but based on the information provided, it is more likely to be a recessive gene.

Fully developed cases exhibit (1) micronodular cirrhosis; (2) diabetes mellitus (up to 80% of patients); and (3) abnormal skin pigmentation (up to 80% of patients). Because there is no regulated iron excretion from the body, the total body content of iron is tightly regulated by intestinal absorption. As discussed in Chapter 12, hepcidin is a circulating peptide hormone that acts as a key negative regulator of intestinal iron uptake. Diverse mutations in several genes have been described in hereditary hemochromatosis, all of which lower hepcidin levels or diminish hepcidin function.

            "content": "An important early step in the genetic analysis of any mutant cell or organism is to determine whether the mutation causes a loss or a gain of function. A standard test is to determine whether the mutation is dominant or recessive. A dominant mutation is one that still causes the mutant phenotype in the presence of a single copy of the wild-type gene. A recessive mutation is one that is no longer able to cause the mutant phenotype in the presence of a single wild-type copy of the gene. Although cases have been described in which a loss-of-function mutation is dominant or a gain-of-function mutation is recessive, in the vast majority of cases, recessive mutations are loss of function and dominant mutations are gain Figure 8\u201346 Screening for temperature-sensitive bacterial or yeast mutants."

Loss-of-function mutations are usually recessive\u2014the organism can usually function normally as long as it retains at least one normal copy of the affected gene. null mutation: a loss-of-function mutation that completely abolishes the activity of the gene. TWO GENES OR ONE? Given two mutations that produce the same phenotype, how can we tell whether they are mutations in the same gene? If the mutations are recessive (as they most often are), the answer can be found by a complementation test.
