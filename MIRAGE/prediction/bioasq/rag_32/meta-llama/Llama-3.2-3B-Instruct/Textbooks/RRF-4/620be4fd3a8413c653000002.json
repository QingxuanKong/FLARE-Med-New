However, I found a document (Document [20]) that mentions TIMELESS, a protein involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. According to Document [20], TIMELESS is a component of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) and is required for the assembly of the pre-RC.

As we discussed earlier (see Figure 17\u201331C), Ndc80 complexes in the kinetochore make multiple low-affinity attachments along the side of the microtubule. Because the attachments are constantly breaking and re-forming at new sites, the kinetochore remains attached to a microtubule even as the microtubule depolymerizes. In principle, this could move the kinetochore toward the spindle pole."

It was not even clear whether there was a separate control system, or whether the processes of DNA synthesis, mitosis, and cytokinesis somehow controlled themselves. A major breakthrough came in the late 1980s with the identification of the key proteins of the control system, along with the realization that they are distinct from the proteins that perform the processes of DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and so on. In this section, we first consider the basic principles upon which the cell-cycle control system operates.

Protein phosphorylation probably regulates their disassembly, in much the same way that phosphorylation regulates the disassembly of nuclear lamins in mitosis (see Figure 12\u201318). As evidence for rapid turnover, labeled subunits microinjected into tissue-culture cells incorporate into intermediate filaments within a few minutes.

This strategy provides a single window of opportunity for prereplicative complexes to form (G1 phase, when kinase activity is low) and a second window for them to be activated and subsequently disassembled (S phase, when kinase activity is high).

Although M-Cdk activity sets the stage for this event, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) discussed earlier throws the switch that initiates sister-chromatid separation by ubiquitylating several mitotic regulatory proteins and thereby triggering their destruction (see Figure 17\u201315A).

Early in mitosis at a stage called prophase, the two DNA molecules are gradually disentangled and condensed into pairs of rigid, compact rods called sister chromatids, which remain linked by sister-chromatid cohesion. When the nuclear envelope disassembles later in mitosis, the sister-chromatid pairs become attached to the mitotic spindle, a giant bipolar array of microtubules (discussed in Chapter 16). Sister chromatids are attached to opposite poles of the spindle and, eventually, align at the spindle equator in a stage called metaphase. The destruction of sister-chromatid cohesion at the start of anaphase separates the sister chromatids, which are pulled to opposite poles of the spindle.

Because of the importance of maintaining intact, undamaged DNA from generation to generation, eukaryotic cells have an additional mechanism that maximizes the effectiveness of their DNA repair enzymes: they delay progression of the cell cycle until DNA repair is complete. As discussed in detail in Chapter 17, the orderly progression of the cell cycle is stopped if damaged DNA is detected, and it restarts when the damage has been repaired. Thus, in mammalian cells, the presence of DNA damage can block entry from G1 into S phase, it can slow S phase once it has begun, and it can block the transition from G2 phase to M phase. These delays facilitate DNA repair by providing the time needed for the repair to reach completion."

COPII coats accelerate GTP hydrolysis by Sar1, and a fully formed vesicle will be produced only when bud formation occurs faster than the timed disassembly process; otherwise, disassembly will be triggered before a vesicle pinches off, and the process will have to start again, perhaps at a more appropriate time and place.

Different Regions on the Same Chromosome Replicate at Distinct Times in S Phase In mammalian cells, the replication of DNA in the region between one replication origin and the next should normally require only about an hour to complete, given the rate at which a replication fork moves and the largest distances measured between replication origins. Yet S phase usually lasts for about 8 hours in a mammalian cell. This implies that the replication origins are not all activated simultaneously; indeed, replication origins are activated in clusters of about 50 adjacent replication origins, each of which is replicated during only a small part of the total S-phase interval."

First, an abrupt increase in M-Cdk activity at the G2/M transition triggers the events of early mitosis (prophase, prometaphase, and metaphase). During this period, M-Cdk and several other mitotic protein kinases phosphorylate a variety of proteins, leading to the assembly of the mitotic spindle and its attachment to the sister-chromatid pairs. The second major part of mitosis begins at the metaphaseto-anaphase transition, when the APC/C triggers the destruction of securin, liberating a protease that cleaves cohesin and thereby initiates separation of the sister chromatids. The APC/C also promotes the destruction of cyclins, which leads to Cdk inactivation and the dephosphorylation of Cdk targets, which is required for all events of late M phase, including the completion of anaphase, the disassembly of the mitotic spindle, and the"
