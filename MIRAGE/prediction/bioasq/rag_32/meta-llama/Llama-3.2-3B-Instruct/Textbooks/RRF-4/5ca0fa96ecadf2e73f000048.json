In the same way, patients with some forms of leukemia or lymphoma can be irradiated or chemically treated to destroy their cancerous cells along with the rest of their hematopoietic tissue, and then can be rescued by a transfusion of healthy, noncancerous hematopoietic stem cells. In favorable cases, these can be sorted out from samples of the patient\u2019s own hematopoietic tissue before it is ablated.

Use of cord blood results in slower engraftment and peripheral count recovery than seen with marrow but a lower incidence of GVHD, perhaps reflecting the low number of T cells in cord blood.

The procedure is usually carried out for one of two purposes: (1) to replace an abnormal but nonmalignant lymphohematopoietic system with one from a normal donor or (2) to treat malignancy by allowing the administration of higher doses of myelosuppressive therapy than would otherwise be possible. The use of hematopoietic cell transplantation has been increasing, both because of its efficacy in selected diseases and because of increasing availability of donors.

Although rare, hematopoietic stem cells can be purified to virtual homogeneity based on cell surface markers. Clinically, these stem cells can be used to repopulate marrows depleted after chemotherapy (e.g., for leukemia), or to provide normal precursors to correct various blood cell defects (e.g., sickle cell disease; see Chapter 12)."

The semisolid matrix inhibits migration, so that the progeny of each isolated precursor cell remain together as an easily distinguishable colony.

Such culture systems have provided a way to assay for the factors that support hematopoiesis and hence to purify them and explore their actions.

Moreover, these concepts may not be restricted to normal tissue function but extend to malignancy. Stem cells are rare cells among a heterogeneous population of cell types, and their behavior is assessed mainly in experimental animal models involving reconstitution of hematopoiesis.

            "content": "Peripheral blood stem cells are collected by leukapheresis after the donor has been treated with hematopoietic growth factors or, in the setting of autologous transplantation, sometimes after treatment with a combination of chemotherapy and growth factors. Stem cells for transplantation are infused through a large-bore central venous catheter. Such infusions are usually well tolerated, although occasionally patients develop fever, cough, or shortness of breath. These symptoms typically resolve with slowing of the infusion. When the stem cell product has been cryopreserved using dimethyl sulfoxide, patients more often experience short-lived nausea or vomiting due to the odor and taste of the cryoprotectant."

            "content": "Plasma may also be collected by apheresis. Plasma derivatives such as albumin, intravenous immunoglobulin, antithrombin, and coagulation factor concentrates are prepared from pooled plasma from many donors and are treated to eliminate infectious agents. Whole blood provides both oxygen-carrying capacity and volume expansion. It is the ideal component for patients who have sustained acute hemorrhage of \u226525% total blood volume loss. Whole blood is stored at 4\u00b0C to maintain erythrocyte viability, but platelet dysfunction and degradation of some coagulation factors occurs. In addition, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate levels fall over time, leading to an increase in the oxygen affinity of the hemoglobin and a decreased capacity to deliver oxygen to the tissues, a problem with all red cell storage. Fresh whole blood avoids these problems, but it is typically used only in emergency settings (i.e., military). Whole blood is not readily available, because it is routinely processed into components."

This limits the ability to bank large amounts of blood, particu-larly rarer blood types, for use in times of high demand and blood supply shortage, such as on the battlefield and after mass casualty events. Storage solutions, however, do not fully sup-press the metabolic and physical changes associated with aging RBCs. Newer evidence suggests that cryopreservation of red blood cells may provide a safe alternative means of storage. Cryopreservation uses the beneficial effects of ultra-low tem-peratures to suppress molecular motion and arrest metabolic and biochemical reactions. Frozen (cryopreserved) red blood cells have a shelf life of ten years at -80\u00b0C with improved cel-lular viability and maintenance of ATP and 2,3 DPG concen-trations.85 A trial of stable trauma patients randomized to old (>14 storage days) red blood cells, young (\u226414 storage days) red blood cells, and cryopreserved red blood cells found that cryopreserved red blood cells were"

Small red cells without the central pallor are spherocytes; they can be seen in hereditary spherocytosis, hemolytic anemias of other causes, and clostridial sepsis. Dacrocytes are teardrop-shaped cells that can be seen in hemolytic anemias, severe iron deficiency, thalassemias, myelofibrosis, and myelodysplastic syndromes. Schistocytes are helmet-shaped cells that reflect microangiopathic hemolytic anemia or fragmentation on an artificial heart valve. Echinocytes are spiculated red cells with the spikes evenly spaced; they can represent an artifact of abnormal drying of the blood smear or reflect changes in stored blood. They also can be seen in renal failure and malnutrition and are often reversible. Acanthocytes are spiculated red cells with the spikes irregularly distributed. This process tends to be irreversible and reflects underlying renal disease, abetalipoproteinemia, or"

Although each cell type has potential advantages and disadvantages, there are a number of generic problems in developing any of these cell types into a useful and reliable clinical tool."

However, recent evidence has demonstrated that the age of red cells may play a significant role in the inflammatory response and incidence of multiple organ failure.82 The changes in the red blood cells that occur during storage include reduction of intracellular ADP and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), which alters the oxygen dissociation curve of hemoglobin, resulting in a decrease in oxy-gen transport. Stored RBCs progressively become acidotic with elevated levels of lactate, potassium, and ammonia. Addition-ally, the in vitro hemostatic potential of plasma83 and platelet84 products also decrease with storage.The morphologic and biochemical changes that occur over time in red cells may contribute to worsened outcomes.
