    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the structure and function of mitochondria and their interaction with other cellular components, particularly membrane nanotubes. Mitochondria have two membranes: the outer membrane and the inner membrane. The outer membrane is permeable to small molecules and ions, while the inner membrane is impermeable to most molecules. Mitochondria interact with other cellular components, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and can fuse and divide to maintain their integrity. However, there is no direct information provided in the given documents about mitochondria passing through membrane nanotubes. Therefore, we need to look for any indirect evidence or connections between mitochondria and membrane nanotubes. Upon reviewing the documents, we find that mitochondria interact with the ER, and the ER can have tubules that wrap around parts of the mitochondrial network. This interaction suggests a possible indirect connection between mitochondria and membrane nanotubes. However, it does not provide direct evidence of mitochondria passing through membrane nanotubes. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot conclusively say that mitochondria can pass through membrane nanotubes. The correct answer is not explicitly stated in the documents, and the information provided does not support a clear answer. However, given the options provided, the most conservative answer would be that mitochondria cannot pass through membrane nanotubes, which corresponds to choice B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

NADH transfers these electrons from the sites where the food molecules are degraded to the inner mitochondrial membrane. There, the electrons from the energy-rich NADH are passed from one membrane protein complex to the next, passing to a lower-energy compound at each step, until they reach a final complex in which they combine with molecular oxygen (O2) to produce water.

These processes control the number and shape of mitochondria, which can vary dramatically in different cell types, ranging from multiple spherical or wormlike organelles to a highly branched, net-shaped single organelle called a reticulum. Each depends on its own special set of proteins. The mitochondrial fission machine works by assembling dynamin-related GTPases (discussed in Chapter 13) into helical oligomers that cause local constrictions in tubular mitochondria. GTP hydrolysis then generates the mechanical force that severs the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes in one step (Figure 14\u201363).

Mitochondria are often associated with the microtubular cytoskeleton (Figure 14\u20135), which determines their orientation and distribution in different cell types. Thus, in highly polarized cells such as neurons, mitochondria can move long distances (up to a meter or more in the extended axons of neurons), being propelled along the tracks of the microtubular cytoskeleton. In other cells, mitochondria remain fixed at points of high energy demand; for example, in skeletal or cardiac muscle cells, they pack between myofibrils, and in sperm cells they wrap tightly around the flagellum (Figure 14\u20136)."

            "content": "The mitochondrion performs most cellular oxidations and produces the bulk of the animal cell\u2019s ATP. A mitochondrion has two separate membranes: the outer membrane and the inner membrane. The inner membrane surrounds the innermost space (the matrix) of the mitochondrion and forms the cristae, which project into the matrix. The matrix and the inner membrane cristae are the major working parts of the mitochondrion. The membranes that form cristae account for a major part of the membrane surface area in most cells, and they contain the mitochondrion\u2019s electron-transport chain (the respiratory chain)."

            "content": "Mitochondria possess a complete system for protein synthesis, including the synthesis of their own ribosomes. The remainder of the mitochondrial proteins is encoded by nuclear DNA; new polypeptides are synthesized by free ribosomes in the cytoplasm and then imported into mitochondria with the help of two protein complexes. These include translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM complexes) and translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane (TIM complexes). Translocation of proteins through mitochondrial membranes requires energy and assistance from several specialized chaperone proteins. Mitochondria are present in all cells except red blood cells and terminal keratinocytes."
