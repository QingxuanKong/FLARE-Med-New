In essence, it is a hereditary (usually autosomal recessive) tapetoretinal degeneration or dystrophy (the latter term being preferred by Waardenburg), with onset between 6 and 20 years of age, rarely later, and leading to a loss of central vision. The macular region becomes gray or yellow-brown with pigmentary spots, and the visual fields show central scotomata. Later the periphery of the retina may become dystrophic. The lesion is well visualized by fluorescein angiography, which discloses a virtually pathognomonic \u201cdark choroid\u201d pattern. Activity in the electroretinogram is diminished or abolished. Both recessively inherited Stargardt disease and the closely related cone-rod dystrophy have been linked to mutations of ABCA4 or ELOVL4 the former codes for a transporter protein (termed ABCR) of the photoreceptor."

Irregular black deposits of clumped pigment in the peripheral retina, called bone spicules because of their vague resemblance to the spicules of cancellous bone, give the disease its name (Fig. 39-18).
