        "A": "yes",

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the relationship between apelin and diabetes. Apelin is an adipokine that has been implicated in various physiological processes, including glucose and lipid metabolism. In the context of diabetes, apelin has been shown to have beneficial effects, such as improving insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. However, the question asks whether apelin is usually decreased in diabetes. To answer this, let's review the relevant information. According to Document [3] (Title: Obstentrics_Williams), other hormones implicated in fetal growth have been identified, particularly hormones derived from adipose tissue, including leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, follistatin, resistin, visfatin, vaspin, omentin-I, and chemerin. Document [2] (Title: Obstentrics_Williams) also states that adiponectin, a principal adipokine, enhances insulin sensitivity, blocks hepatic glucose release, and has cardioprotective effects on circulating plasma lipids. Document [1] (Title: Pathology_Robbins) mentions that type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous and multifactorial complex disease that involves interactions of genetics, environmental risk factors, and inflammation. Although it does not directly mention apelin, it highlights the role of adipokines in metabolic processes. Given this context, we can infer that apelin, as an adipokine, is likely to be involved in glucose and lipid metabolism and may be affected in diabetes. However, the question asks whether apelin is usually decreased in diabetes. The available information does not provide a clear indication that apelin is typically decreased in diabetes. In fact, Document [2] (Title: Obstentrics_Williams) suggests that adiponectin, a related adipokine, has beneficial effects on glucose metabolism. Therefore, based on the available information, the correct answer is that apelin is not usually decreased in diabetes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

There is a significant correlation between the presence of retinopathy and the presence of Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules (see Fig. 62e-20). Also, characteristically, patients with advanced diabetic nephropathy have normal to enlarged kidneys, in contrast to other glomerular diseases where kidney size is usually decreased. Using the above epidemiologic and clinical data, and in the absence of other clinical or serologic data suggesting another disease, diabetic nephropathy is usually diagnosed without a renal biopsy. After the onset of proteinuria, renal function inexorably declines, with 50% of patients reaching renal failure over another 5\u201310 years; thus, from the earliest stages of microalbuminuria, it usually takes 10\u201320 years to reach end-stage renal disease.

Unlike type 1 diabetes, however, there is no evidence of an autoimmune basis. The two defects that characterize type 2 diabetes are: (1) a decreased ability of peripheral tissues to respond to insulin (insulin resistance) and (2) beta cell dysfunction that is manifested as inadequate insulin secretion in the face of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia ( Fig. 20.23 ). Insulin resistance predates the development of hyperglycemia and usually is accompanied by compensatory beta cell hyperfunction and hyperinsulinemia in the early stages of the evolution of diabetes."

However, based on the rationale that patients who are insulin deficient are also amylin deficient, an analogue of amylin (pramlintide) was created and found to reduce postprandial glycemic excursions in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients taking insulin. Pramlintide injected just before a meal slows gastric emptying and suppresses glucagon but does not alter insulin levels. Pramlintide is approved for insulin-treated patients with type 1 and type 2 DM. Addition of pramlintide produces a modest reduction in the HbA1c and seems to dampen meal-related glucose excursions.

Intensive insulin treatment (see p. 340) delays the onset and slows the progression of some long-term complications. For example, the incidence of retinopathy decreases as control of blood glucose improves and HbA1c levels decrease (Fig. 25.12). [Note: Data concerning the effect of tight control on CVD in T2D are less clear.] The benefits of tight control of blood glucose outweigh the increased risk of severe hypoglycemia in most patients.

The mechanisms by which chronic hyperglycemia leads to diabetic nephropathy, although incompletely defined, involve the effects of soluble factors (growth factors, angiotensin II, endothelin, advanced glycation end products [AGEs]), hemodynamic alterations in the renal microcirculation (glomerular hyperfiltration or hyperperfusion, increased glomerular capillary pressure), and structural changes in the glomerulus (increased extracellular matrix, basement membrane thickening, mesangial expansion, fibrosis).

For example, chronic hyperglycemia paradoxically impairs islet function (\u201cglucose toxicity\u201d) and leads to a worsening of hyperglycemia.

The International Diabetes Foundation predicts that this number will reach 522 million by 2030, a yearly rate of growth that is higher than that of the world\u2019s adult population. Nearly 50% of people with diabetes are undiagnosed, and 80% live in LMICs. The highest regional prevalence for diabetes occurs in the Middle East and North Africa, where an estimated 12.5% of the adult population has diabetes. Future growth will also largely occur in this region, along with other LMICs in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. There appear to be clear genetic susceptibilities to diabetes mellitus of"

OVERVIEW Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is not one disease but rather is a heterogeneous group of multifactorial, primarily polygenic syndromes characterized by an elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG) caused by a relative or absolute deficiency in insulin. Over 29 million people in the United States (~9% of the population) have diabetes. Of this number, ~8 million are as yet undiagnosed. Diabetes is the leading cause of adult blindness and amputation and a major cause of renal failure, nerve damage, heart attacks, and strokes. Most cases of diabetes mellitus can be separated into two groups (Fig. 25.1), type 1 ([T1D] formerly called insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) and type 2 ([T2D] formerly called non\u2013 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus). The incidence and prevalence of T2D is increasing because of the aging of the U.S. population and the increasing prevalence of obesity and sedentary lifestyles (see p. 349). The increase in children with T2D is particularly disturbing."

In the Framingham Offspring Study\u2019s 8-year follow-up of middle-aged participants, the population-attributable risk for developing type 2 diabetes was 62% among men and 47% among women. Other Associated Conditions In addition to the features specifically associated with the metabolic syndrome, other metabolic alterations accompany insulin resistance. Those alterations include increases in ApoB and ApoCIII, uric acid, prothrombotic factors (fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1), serum viscosity, asymmetric dimethylarginine, homocysteine, white blood cell count, proinflammatory cytokines, C-reactive protein, microalbuminuria, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and/or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, polycystic ovary syndrome, and obstructive sleep apnea."

            "content": "Endocrine function: White adipose tissue, once thought to be a passive reservoir of TAG, is now known to play an active role in body weight regulatory systems. For example, the adipocyte is an endocrine cell that secretes a number of protein regulators (adipokines), such as the hormones leptin and adiponectin. Leptin regulates appetite as well as metabolism (see p. 352). Adiponectin reduces FFA levels in the blood (by increasing FA oxidation in muscles) and has been associated with improved lipid profiles, increased insulin sensitivity resulting in better glycemic control, and reduced inflammation in patients with diabetes. [Note: Adiponectin levels decrease as body weight increases, whereas leptin levels increase.] 2."
