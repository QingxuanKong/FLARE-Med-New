The principal mechanism of radiation-induced cell death is believed to be apoptosis resulting from free-radical\u2013induced breaks in double-stranded DNA. Because radiation has its greatest impact on rapidly proliferating cells, the small-intestinal epithelium is acutely susceptible to radiationinduced injury. Pathological correlates of this acute injury include villus blunting and a dense infiltrate of leukocytes and plasma cells within the crypts. With severe cases, mucosal sloughing, ulceration, and hemorrhage are observed. The inten-sity of injury is related to the dose of radiation administered, with most cases occurring in patients who have received at least 4500 cGy.

It is the most common acquired gastrointestinal emergency of neonates, particularly those who are premature or of low birth weight. Its occurrence is often associated with initiation of oral feeding (Chapter 7). Although pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis is not defined, ischemic injury is thought to contribute. Angiodysplasia, characterized by malformed submucosal and mucosal blood vessels, occurs most often in the cecum or right colon, and usually presents after the sixth decade of life.

            "content": "Radiation, whatever its source (UV rays of sunlight, radiographs, nuclear fission, radionuclides), is an established carcinogen. Unprotected miners of radioactive elements have a 10-fold increased incidence of lung cancers. A follow-up study of survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki disclosed a markedly increased incidence of leukemia after an average latent period of about 7 years, as well as increased mortality rates for thyroid, breast, colon, and lung carcinomas. The nuclear power accident at Chernobyl in the former Soviet Union continues to exact its toll in the form of high cancer incidence in the surrounding areas. More recently, it is feared that radiation release from a nuclear power plant in Japan damaged by a massive earthquake and tsunami will result in significantly increased cancer incidence in the surrounding geographic areas."

            "content": "Molecular linkage analyses of affected families have identified NOD2 (nucleotide oligomerization binding domain 2) as a susceptibility gene in Crohn disease. NOD2 encodes a protein that binds to intracellular bacterial peptidoglycans and subsequently activates NF-\u03baB. Some studies suggest that the disease-associated form of NOD-2 is ineffective at defending against intestinal bacteria. The result is that bacteria are able to enter through the epithelium into the wall of the intestine, where they trigger inflammatory reactions. It should, however, be recognized that disease develops in less than 10% of individuals carrying specific NOD2 polymorphisms, and these polymorphisms are uncommon in African and Asian patients with Crohn disease."
