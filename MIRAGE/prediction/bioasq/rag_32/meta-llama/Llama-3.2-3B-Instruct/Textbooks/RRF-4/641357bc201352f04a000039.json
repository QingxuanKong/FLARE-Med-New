    "predict": "To answer this question, let's break down the information provided from the documents and analyze the characteristics of necroptosis. 1. **Understanding Necroptosis**: Necroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that combines features of both necrosis and apoptosis. It is regulated by specific signaling pathways and is not entirely caspase-independent, unlike classical apoptosis. 2. **Characteristics of Necroptosis**: The key characteristic that distinguishes necroptosis from apoptosis is its relationship with the plasma membrane. Unlike apoptosis, where the plasma membrane remains intact and apoptotic bodies are formed, necroptosis involves the disruption of the cell membrane. 3. **Mechanism of Necroptosis**: The mechanism of necroptosis involves the activation of receptor-interacting protein kinases (RIPKs), leading to the formation of a complex that causes the cell to undergo necrotic-like changes, including membrane disruption. 4. **Cell Membrane Disruption in Necroptosis**: Given that necroptosis involves the activation of RIPKs and the subsequent formation of a complex that leads to cell lysis, it is reasonable to conclude that cells undergoing necroptosis show disruption of their cell membranes. Therefore, based on the information provided, the answer to the question is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Necroptosis involves the activation of RIPKs leading to cell lysis and membrane disruption, which is a hallmark of necrosis. Therefore, cells undergoing necroptosis do show disruption of their cell membranes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

In necrosis (left side), breakdown of the cell membrane results in an influx of water and extracellular ions, causing the organelles to undergo irreversible changes. Lysosomal enzymes are released into the extracellular space, causing damage to neighboring tissue and an intense inflammatory response. In apoptosis (right side), the cell shows characteristic morphologic and biochemical features such as DNA fragmentation, decrease in cell volume, membrane blebbing without loss of membrane integrity, and formation of apoptotic bodies, causing cell breakage.

Necrotic cells swell and burst, spilling their contents over their neighbors and eliciting an inflammatory response (Figure 18\u20131C). In most cases, necrosis is likely to be caused by energy depletion, which leads to metabolic defects and loss of the ionic gradients that normally exist across the cell membrane. One form of necrosis, called necroptosis, is a form of programmed cell death that is triggered by a specific regulatory signal from other cells, although we are only just beginning to understand the underlying mechanisms. Some form of programmed cell death occurs in many organisms, but apoptosis is found primarily in animals. This chapter focuses on the major functions of apoptosis, its mechanism and regulation, and how excessive or insufficient apoptosis can contribute to human disease."

The net result is programmed necrosis (necroptosis). The effect of cell death by necroptosis on the immune response is not yet known. However, it is likely that the \u201cDAMP\u201d sig-nature that occurs in response to necroptotic cell death is an important contributor to the systemic inflammatory response. Evidence to support this concept was provided by investiga-tors who examined the role of necroptosis in murine model of sepsis. They demonstrated that Ripk3\u2212/\u2212 mice were capable of recovering body temperature better, exhibited lower circu-lating DAMP levels, and survived at higher rates than their WT littermates.126 These data suggest that the cellular damage that occurs with programmed necrosis exacerbates the sepsis-associated systemic inflammatory response.PyroptosisPyroptosis is a form of regulated"

Mitochondria are affected by a variety of injurious stimuli and their abnormalities lead to necrosis or apoptosis. This pathway of apoptosis is described in more detail later. ATP, Adenosine triphosphate; ROS, reactive oxygen species. permeability transition pore. The opening of this channel leads to the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and pH changes, further compromising oxidative phosphorylation. \u2022 Mitochondria also contain proteins such as cytochrome c that, when released into the cytoplasm, tell the cell there is internal injury and activate a pathway of apoptosis, as discussed earlier."
