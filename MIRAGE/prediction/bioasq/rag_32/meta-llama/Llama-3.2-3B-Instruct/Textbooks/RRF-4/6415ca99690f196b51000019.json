CARs have extracellular domains consisting of antibodies that bind tumor antigens and intracellular domains that delivered signals that activate CTLs following their engagement with antigen on the surface of tumor cells.

            "content": "Advances in the ability to manipulate the genes for immunoglobulins have resulted in development of a wide array of humanized and chimeric monoclonal antibodies directed against therapeutic targets. As described above, the only murine elements of humanized monoclonal antibodies are the complementarity-determining regions in the variable domains of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. Complementarity-determining regions are primarily responsible for the antigen-binding capacity of antibodies. Chimeric antibodies typically contain antigen-binding murine variable regions and human constant regions. The following are brief descriptions of the engineered antibodies that have been approved for clinical use; they are presented alphabetically by indication."

Brentuximab vedotin consists of a chimeric (mouse-human) IgG1 linked to monomethylauristatin E (MMAE), a microtubule-disrupting agent that induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. When this ADC binds CD30 on the cell surface, the complex is internalized followed by proteolytic cleavage of MMAE from the IgG. Brentuximab is approved for treatment of patients with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma after failure of autologous stem cell transplantation or after failure of at least two previous chemotherapy regimens. It is also approved for patients with systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma after failure of at least one previous multiagent chemotherapy regimen. Patients taking brentuximab vedotin should be monitored primarily for"

They include targeting (1) activated B lymphocytes with anti-CD22 or TACI-Ig, (2) inhibition of IFN-\u03b1, (3) inhibition of B/T cell second signal coactivation with CTLA-Ig, (4) inhibition of innate immune activation via TLR7 or TLR7 and 9, (5) induction of regulatory T cells with peptides from immunoglobulins or autoantigens; (6) suppression of T cells, B cells, and monocyte/macrophages with laquinimod; and (7) inhibition of lymphocyte activation by blockade of Jak/Stat. A few studies have used vigorous untargeted immunosuppression with high-dose cyclophosphamide plus anti-T cell strategies, with rescue by transplantation of autologous hematopoietic stem cells forthetreatmentofsevereandrefractory SLE. OneU.S.report showed an estimated mortality rate over 5 years of 15% and sustained remission in 50%. It is hoped that in the next edition of this text, we will be able to recommend more effective and less toxic"

Young patients with this disease can be candidates for bone marrow transplantation. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation can be curative but is associated with a significant treatment-related mortality rate. Mini-transplants using immunosuppressive rather than myeloablative doses of preparative drugs are being studied (Chap. 139e). The use of autologous transplantation in patients with this disorder has been discouraging."

Transgenic mice have been particularly useful in studying the role of T-cell and B-cell receptors in lymphocyte development, as described in Chapter 8, and in providing a source of primary T and B lymphocytes of known antigen specificity for adoptive transfer studies (see Section A-31). This utility is largely due to the fact that expression of the transgene-encoded T-cell and B-cell receptors preempts the rearrangement and expression of the endogenous antigen receptor genes during T-cell and B-cell development, respectively, thereby generating homogeneous populations of cells bearing a unique antigen receptor of known specificity."
