    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between BCL11B haploinsufficiency and syndromic neurodevelopmental delay. BCL11B is a gene that plays a crucial role in brain development and function. Haploinsufficiency of BCL11B has been associated with a range of developmental and neurological disorders, including syndromic neurodevelopmental delay. This condition is characterized by delayed cognitive and motor development, as well as various physical and behavioral abnormalities. The link between BCL11B haploinsufficiency and syndromic neurodevelopmental delay is supported by genetic studies, which have identified mutations or deletions in the BCL11B gene in individuals with this condition. Furthermore, research has shown that BCL11B haploinsufficiency can lead to abnormalities in brain development and function, including impaired neuronal migration, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Therefore, based on the current understanding of the role of BCL11B in brain development and function, there is a strong link between BCL11B haploinsufficiency and syndromic neurodevelopmental delay.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

A large kindred in whom developmental delay was inherited in an X-linked pattern was first reported by Martin and Bell in 1943. It was in such a family, with X-linked developmental delay, that Lubs, in 1969, discovered a fragile site at the distal end of the long arm of the X chromosome; subsequently, it was established that there is an unstable inherited CGG repeating sequence at this site, which leads to breakage, as discussed previously. At first, it was assumed that the fragile X syndrome was only an example of the Renpenning syndrome (an X-linked hereditary developmental delay in males; see below) until it was pointed out that in this latter condition, stature was reduced, as was the cranial circumference, and further that the X chromosomes of the Renpenning patients"

Investigated from another perspective, de Ligt and colleagues sequenced the coding regions of over 21,000 genes in a series of 100 individuals with IQ below 50 and round that there were numerous de novo mutations that involved cerebral development of function. Together, all of the aforementioned genetic alterations, mutations, lesser polymorphisms and copy number variants, account for approximately 15 to 20 percent of cases of mild, moderate, and severe developmental delay and autism.

The responsible spontaneous mutation was shown to relate to a defect at chromosomal site Xq28, making it one of the X-linked developmental delays. A fatal outcome in boys because of a severe neonatal encephalopathy explains the expression of the disease only in girls, who are mosaics for the mutation. The involved gene, MECP2, is responsible for suppressing various other genes at critical stages of development (see Dunn and MacLeod). It has this effect by binding to methylated DNA. Defective function of the gene leads to an alteration in synaptogenesis and neural connectivity (Neul and Zoghbi). Severe inactivation of gene expression causes classic Rett syndrome, but it has become apparent that incomplete expression and mosaicism lead to a number of partial syndromes, including nonspecific developmental delay,"

The Angelman syndrome, another cause of severe developmental delay, is associated with the identical chromosomal abnormality to that found in the Prader-Willi syndrome, but there is usually a maternally inherited single-gene defect. The difference in phenotype derives from a complex genetic phenomenon termed spatially restricted imprinting. The phenotype comprises severe developmental delay, microcephaly, refractory seizures, absence of speech, ataxia, inappropriate laughter, prominent jaw, thin upper lip, and prolonged tongue. Outstanding in its clinical presentation is an unusual marionette-like stance coupled with a persistent tendency to laugh and smile (hence the old name \u201chappy puppet syndrome\u201d)."

The relatively novel concept of duplication or deletion of portions of genes, copy number variation, emerged as explanatory of some proportion of diseases such as autism as discussed further on. What is interesting about copy number variation is that they may give rise to several phenotypes of similar disorder, quite unlike conventional mendelian mutations. This indicates that copy number variants, like SNPs, probably are not usually directly causative of a condition but instead modulate other functions that express proteins. This is the situation for many of the forms of developmental abnormalities such as generic cognitive developmental delay, autism, and certain psychiatric diseases."

These animals display behavioral symptoms that are said to replicate those of ADHD in children and also to respond to stimulants, observations that implicate an abnormality of dopamine and serotonin. This idea is provocative because several genetic linkage studies have suggested an association between ADHD and a polymorphism of the gene that codes for the same dopamine transporter gene. Furthermore, copy number variations in genes that relate to development, a rich field for study in autism, give rise to global forms of cognitive delay that display prominent features of ADHD. Most of these are duplications or deletions that congregate on chromosomes 15 and 16."

What followed, by the use of linkage analysis and other genetic techniques, was the elucidation of single gene mutations that were obligatorily associated with malformations or developmental delays; most of the inherited metabolic disorders of infancy and childhood discussed in Chap. 36 are of this type but also certain gross malformations of the brain such as lissencephaly, discussed further on."

The genetic abnormality underlying this complex developmental disorder is a deletion within one copy of chromosome 22. The deletion varies between 1.5 and 5 megabases in size, with the smallest deletion that causes the syndrome containing approximately 24 genes. The relevant gene within this interval is TBX1, which encodes the transcription factor Tbox 1. DiGeorge syndrome is caused by the deletion of a single copy of this gene, such that patients with this disorder are haploinsufficient for TBX1. Without the proper inductive thymic environment, T cells cannot mature, and both cellmediated immunity and Tcelldependent antibody production are impaired. Patients with this syndrome have normal levels of serum immunoglobulin but an absence of, or incomplete development of, the thymus and parathyroid glands, with varying degrees of Tcell immunodeficiency."

Genetic causes of malformations include all of the previously discussed mechanisms of genetic disease. Virtually all chromosomal syndromes are associated with congenital malformations. Examples are Down syndrome and other trisomies, Turner syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome. Most chromosomal disorders arise during gametogenesis and hence are not familial. Single-gene mutations, characterized by mendelian inheritance, may underlie major malformations. For example, holoprosencephaly is the most common developmental defect of the forebrain and midface in humans (see Chapter 23). The Hedgehog signaling pathway plays a critical role in the morphogenesis of these structures, and loss-of-function mutations of individual components within this pathway are reported in families with a history of recurrent holoprosencephaly."
