    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the available information about ocrelizumab and its effects on primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). According to the provided documents, ocrelizumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CD20 lymphocytes, and it has been shown to be effective in reducing relapses and the accumulation of MRI lesions in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). However, the available information about its effectiveness in PPMS is limited. A preplanned secondary analysis of a trial of ocrelizumab in PPMS showed that treatment appeared to modestly slow disability progression in patients with Gd-enhancing lesions at entry, but this is not a conclusive evidence of its effectiveness in PPMS. Furthermore, the documents do not provide any information about the efficacy of ocrelizumab in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot conclude that ocrelizumab is effective for PPMS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

A phase 2/3 trial of the monoclonal antibody rituximab (anti-CD20) in PPMS was 2672 also negative, but in a preplanned secondary analysis, treatment appeared to modestly slow disability progression in patients with Gd-enhancing lesions at entry; the results of a follow-up trial with a fully humanized monoclonal anti-CD20 therapy (ocrelizumab) will soon be available. Azathioprine (2\u20133 mg/kg per day) has been used primarily in SPMS. Meta-analysis of published trials suggests that azathioprine is marginally effective at lowering relapse rates, although a benefit on disability progression has not been demonstrated."

A similar, fully humanized anti-CD20 drug, ocrelizumab, has been introduced and has similar effects to rituximab (Kappos et al, 2011). In addition to its indication for relapsing remitting MS, it has tentatively been shown to have some effect on primary progressive MS. Appropriate use in patients should be balanced by consideration of its risks, which include opportunistic infection as well as malignancy."

However, immediately after its infusion, most multiple sclerosis patients suffered a frightening, although fortunately brief, flare-up of their illness, illustrating another potential complication of antibody therapy. Alemtuzumab was acting as intended, killing cells by complementand Fc-dependent mechanisms. However, it also stimulated the release of cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, and IL-6, which transiently block nerve conduction in nerve fibers previously affected by demyelination. This caused the transient but dramatic exacerbation of symptoms. Nevertheless, alemtuzumab may be useful at early stages of the disease, when the inflammatory response is maximal, but this has yet to be determined."

Natalizumab is a humanized IgG antibody against an a4 integrin that inhibits leukocyte migration into tissues and has been approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis in the United States. Both it and anti-CD20 (rituximab) have been associated with the onset of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\u2014a serious and usually fatal CNS infection caused by JC polyomavirus. Efalizumab, a humanized IgG monoclonal antibody previously approved for treatment of plaque psoriasis, has now been taken off the market due to reactivation of JC virus leading to fatal PML.

However, blockade of \u03b14:\u03b21 integrin is not specific and, like anti-TNF therapy, could lead to reduced defense against infection. Rarely patients treated with natalizumab have developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic infection caused by the JC virus. This led to the temporary withdrawal of natalizumab from the market in 2005, but in June 2006 it was again allowed to be prescribed for multiple sclerosis and for Crohn\u2019s disease."

It prevents lymphocytes from binding to endothelial cells, thereby preventing lymphocytes from penetrating the BBB and entering the CNS. Natalizumab is highly effective in reducing the attack rate and significantly improves all measures of disease severity in MS (both clinical and MRI). Moreover, it is well-tolerated, and the dosing schedule of monthly intravenous infusions makes it very convenient for patients. However, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a life-threatening condition resulting from infection by the John Cunningham (JC) virus, has occurred in approximately 0.3% of patients treated with natalizumab. The incidence of PML is very low in the first year of treatment but then rises by the second year to reach a level of about 2 cases per 1000 patients per year. Nevertheless, the"

These injectable drugs, which are still used in some cases, modestly alter the natural history relapsing-remitting MS. IFN-\u03b2-1b, a nonglycosylated bacterial cell product with an amino acid sequence identical to that of natural IFN-\u03b2, was the first of these agents to be tested (Arnason). Several trials showed that the subcutaneous injection of this agent every second day for up to 5 years decreases the frequency and severity of relapses by almost one-third and also the number of new or enlarging lesions (\u201clesion burden\u201d) in serial MRIs. A large-scale trial (European Study Group, PRISMS Study Group) extended the observations with IFN-\u03b2-1b to patients with the secondarily progressive type of MS; progression of the disease was delayed for 9 to 12 months in a study period of 2 to 3 years.
