As the primary predictor of long-term complications of DM, the HbA1c should mirror, to a certain extent, the short-term measurements of SMBG. These two measurements are complementary in that recent intercurrent illnesses may impact the SMBG measurements but not the HbA1c. Likewise, postprandial and nocturnal hyperglycemia may not be detected by the SMBG of fasting and preprandial capillary plasma glucose but will be reflected in the HbA1c. In standardized assays, the HbA1c approximates the following mean plasma glucose values: an HbA1c of 6% = 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL), 7% = 8.6 mmol/L (154 mg/dL), 8% = 10.2 mmol/L (183 mg/dL), 9% = 11.8 mmol/L (212 mg/dL), 10% = 13.4 mmol/L (240 mg/dL), 11% = 14.9 mmol/L (269 mg/dL), and 12% = 16.5 mmol/L (298 mg/dL).

More frequent testing (every 3 months) is warranted when glycemic control is inadequate or when therapy has changed. Laboratory standards for the HbA1c test have been established and should be correlated to the reference assay of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). Clinical conditions such hemoglobinopathies, anemias, reticulocytosis, transfusions, and uremia may interfere with the HbA1c result. The degree of glycation of other proteins, such as albumin, can be used as an alternative indicator of glycemic control when the HbA1c is inaccurate.

These benefits need to be weighed against the increased prevalence of hypoglycemia. Certainly, the level of glucose control (i.e., the HbA1c level) should be evaluated for each patient. Multicenter trials have demonstrated that individuals with recently diagnosed T1DM or T2DM can have better glycemic control with less hypoglycemia. In addition, there is still long-term benefit in reducing HbA1c values from higher to lower, albeit still above recommended levels.

            "content": "The American Diabetes Association criteria for acceptable control include an HbA1c of less than 7% (53 mmol/mol) and pre-meal glucose levels of 90\u2013130 mg/dL (5\u20137.2 mmol/L) and less than 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) one hour and 150 mg/dL (8.3 mmol/L) two hours after meals. While the HbA1c target is appropriate for individuals treated with lifestyle interventions and euglycemic therapy, it may need to be modified for individuals treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues due to their increased risk of hypoglycemia. Less stringent blood glucose control also is appropriate for children as well as patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, and significant microvascular and macrovascular disease. For the elderly frail patient an HbA1c greater than 8% may be appropriate. Treatment must be individualized on the basis of the type of diabetes and specific needs of each patient. A.

The current criteria for the diagnosis of DM emphasize the HbA1c or the FPG as the most reliable and convenient tests for identifying DM in asymptomatic individuals (however, some individuals may meet criteria for one test but not the other). OGTT, although still a valid means for diagnosing DM, is not often used in routine clinical care."

            "content": "Individuals with T1D must rely on exogenous insulin delivered subcutaneously (subq) either by periodic injection or by continuous pump-assisted infusion to control the hyperglycemia and ketonemia. Two types of therapeutic injection regimens are currently used, standard and intensive. [Note: Pump delivery is also considered intensive therapy.] 1. Standard versus intensive treatment: Standard treatment is typically two to three daily injections of recombinant human insulin. Mean blood glucose levels obtained are typically 225\u2013275 mg/dl, with a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level (see p. 33) of 8%\u20139% of the total hemoglobin (blue arrow in Fig. 25.4). [Note: The rate of formation of HbA1c is proportional to the average blood glucose concentration over the previous 3 months. Thus, HbA1c provides a measure of how well treatment has normalized blood glucose over that time in a patient with diabetes.] In contrast to standard therapy, intensive treatment seeks to more closely normalize blood"

            "content": "The DCCT phase demonstrated that improvement of glycemic control reduced nonproliferative and proliferative retinopathy (47% reduction), microalbuminuria (39% reduction), clinical nephropathy (54% reduction), and neuropathy (60% reduction). Improved glycemic control also slowed the progression of early diabetic complications. During the DCCT phase, weight gain (4.6 kg) and severe hypoglycemia (requiring assistance of another person to treat) were more common in the intensive therapy group. The benefits of an improvement in glycemic control occurred over the entire range of HbA1c values (Fig. 419-1), indicating that at any HbA1c level, an improvement in glycemic control is beneficial. The results of the DCCT predicted that individuals in the intensive diabetes management group would gain 7.7 additional years of vision, 5.8 additional years free from end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and 5.6 years free from lower extremity amputations. If all complications of DM were combined, individuals"

            "content": "In general, the ADA suggests that the goal is to achieve an HbA1c as close to normal as possible without significant hypoglycemia. In most individuals, the target HbA1c should be <7% (Table 418-2) with a more stringent target for some patients. For instance, the HbA1c goal in a young adult with type 1 DM may be 6.5%. A higher HbA1c goal may be appropriate for the very young or old or in individuals with limited life span or comorbid conditions. For example, an appropriate HbA1c goal in elderly individuals with multiple, chronic illnesses and impaired activities of daily living might be 8.0 or 8.5%. A major consideration is the frequency and severity of hypoglycemia, because this becomes more common with a more stringent HbA1c goal."
