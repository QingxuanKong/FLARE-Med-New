            "content": "Although cell membranes can contain hundreds of different lipid species, the plasma membrane in animal cells contains three major classes\u2014phospholipids, cholesterol, and glycolipids. Because of their different backbone structure, phospholipids fall into two subclasses\u2014phosphoglycerides and sphingolipids. The lipid compositions of the inner and outer monolayers are different, reflecting the different functions of the two faces of a cell membrane. Different mixtures of lipids are found in the membranes of cells of different types, as well as in the various membranes of a single eukaryotic cell. Inositol phospholipids are a minor class of phospholipids, which in the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane lipid bilayer play an important part in cell signaling: in response to extracellular signals, specific lipid kinases phosphorylate the head groups of these lipids to form docking sites for cytosolic signaling proteins, whereas specific phospholipases cleave certain inositol"

Which of the three 20-amino-acid sequences listed below is the most likely candidate for such a transmembrane segment? Explain the reasons for your choice. (See back of book for one-letter amino acid code; FAMILY VW is a convenient mnemonic for hydrophobic amino acids.) 10\u20136 If a lipid raft is typically 70 nm in diameter and each lipid molecule has a diameter of 0.5 nm, about how many lipid molecules would there be in a lipid raft composed entirely of lipid? At a ratio of 50 lipid molecules per protein molecule (50% protein by mass), how many proteins would be in a typical raft? (Neglect the loss of lipid from the raft that would be required to accommodate the protein.) 10\u20138 You are studying the binding of proteins to the cytoplasmic face of cultured neuroblastoma cells and have found a method that gives a good yield of"

Assuming that the normal Src is all bound to the plasma membrane and that the mutant Src is distributed throughout the cytoplasm, calculate their relative concentrations in the neighborhood of the plasma membrane. For the purposes of this calculation, assume that the cell is a sphere with a radius (r) of 10 \u03bcm and that the mutant Src is distributed throughout the cell, whereas the normal Src is confined to a 4-nm-thick layer immediately beneath the membrane. [For this problem, assume that the membrane has no thickness. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r3.] b. The target (X) for phosphorylation by Src resides in the membrane. Explain why the mutant Src does not cause cell proliferation."
