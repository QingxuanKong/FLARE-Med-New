SRRM4 is a member of the SR protein family, which plays a crucial role in regulating splicing patterns by binding to specific RNA sequences and recruiting spliceosomal components to the appropriate splice sites. SRRM4 has been implicated in the regulation of various alternative splicing events, including those involved in neuronal development and function. Specifically, SRRM4 has been shown to regulate the inclusion of neuronal-specific microexons in TAF1 mRNA, which is essential for the production of a functional protein. The inclusion of these microexons is critical for the development and function of neurons, and dysregulation of SRRM4 can lead to abnormalities in neuronal development and function. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it is likely that SRRM4 regulates neuronal-specific microexon splicing of TAF1 mRNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Earlier in this section we saw that alternative splicing can give rise to different proteins from the same gene and that this is a common strategy to enhance the coding potential of genomes. Some examples of alternative splicing are constitutive; that is, the alternatively spliced mRNAs are produced continuously by cells of an organism. However, in many cases, the cell regulates the splicing patterns so that different forms of the protein are produced at different times and in different tissues (see Figure 6\u201326). In Chapter 7, we return to this issue to discuss some specific examples of regulated RNA splicing."

However, as we have seen, the assembly of splicing components on pre-mRNA is co-transcriptional; thus, splicing must occur at many locations along chromosomes. Although a typical mammalian cell may be expressing on the order of 15,000 genes, transcription and RNA splicing takes place in only several thousand sites in the nucleus. These sites are highly dynamic and probably result from the association of transcription and splicing components to create small factories, the name given to specific aggregates containing a high local concentration of selected components that create biochemical assembly lines (Figure 6\u201347).

Variations in splicing and polyadenylation can affect gene expression. In addition, messenger stability also affects gene expression. 1. Alternative splicing: Tissue-specific protein isoforms can be made from the same pre-mRNA through alternative splicing, which can involve exon skipping (loss), intron retention, and use of alternative splice-donor or -acceptor sites (Fig. 33.12).

The fidelity mechanisms built into the spliceosome to suppress errors, however, are supplemented by two additional strategies that further increase the accuracy of splicing. The first is a simple consequence of splicing being coupled to transcription.

This type of RNA\u2013RNA rearrangement (in which the formation of one RNA\u2013RNA interaction requires the disruption of another) occurs several times during splicing and allows the spliceosomes to check and recheck the splicing signals, thereby increasing the overall accuracy of splicing. Second, the rearrangements that take place in the spliceosome create the active sites for the two transesterification reactions. These two active sites are created, one after the other, and only after the splicing signals on the pre-mRNA have been checked several times. This orderly progression ensures that splicing"

After the mRNA has been exported to the cytosol, this export receptor dissociates from the mRNA and is re-imported into the nucleus, where it can be used again. The final check indicated here, called nonsense-mediated decay, will be described later in the chapter. out in small clusters on five different chromosomes (see Figure 4\u201311), while cells of the frog Xenopus contain about 600 rRNA gene copies per haploid genome in a single cluster on one chromosome (Figure 6\u201339)."

Poly-A polymerase does not require a template. AAUAAA = polyadenylation signal. Eukaryotes RNA polymerase I makes rRNA, the most common (rampant) type; present only in nucleolus. RNA polymerase II makes mRNA (massive), microRNA (miRNA), and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). RNA polymerase III makes 5S rRNA, tRNA (tiny). No proofreading function, but can initiate chains. RNA polymerase II opens DNA at promoter site. I, II, and III are numbered in the same order that their products are used in protein synthesis: rRNA, mRNA, then tRNA."

Because this produces multiple variations of the mRNA and, therefore, of its protein product (Fig. 31.19), it is a mechanism for producing a large, diverse set of proteins from a limited set of genes. For example, the mRNA for tropomyosin (TM), an actin filament\u2013binding protein of the cytoskeleton (and of the contractile apparatus in muscle cells), undergoes extensive tissue-specific alternative splicing with production of multiple isoforms of the TM protein.

            "content": "A strategy called \u201cexon definition\u201d also helps cells choose the appropriate splice sites. Exon size tends to be much more uniform than intron size, averaging about 150 nucleotide pairs across a wide variety of eukaryotic organisms (Figure 6\u201331). Through exon definition, the splicing machinery can seek out the relatively homogeneously sized exon sequences. As RNA synthesis proceeds, a group of additional components (most notably SR proteins, so-named because they con help to mark off each 3\u02b9and 5\u02b9 splice site, starting at the 5\u02b9 end of the RNA (Figure 6\u201332). These proteins, in turn, recruit U1 snRNA, which marks the downstream exon boundary, and U2 snRNA, which specifies the upstream one. By specifically marking the exons in this way and thereby taking advantage of the relatively uni form size of exons, the cell increases the accuracy with which it deposits the initial splicing components on the nascent RNA and thereby avoids \u201cnear miss\u201d splice sites. How the SR proteins discriminate"
