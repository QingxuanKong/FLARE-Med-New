One of the key documents (Document [12]) mentions that adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, and golimumab are antibodies that bind and neutralize the biological activity of TNF-\\\\u00b1, but it does not mention golimumab being tested for diabetes. However, another document (Document [9]) discusses the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and mentions that adalimumab and golimumab are approved for this condition but are less effective than intravenous infliximab. There is also a document (Document [16]) that discusses the remission rate of adalimumab in patients who initially responded to and then failed infliximab, but it does not mention golimumab. A thorough search of the documents does not reveal any information about golimumab being tested for diabetes. Therefore, the answer to the question is that golimumab was not tested for diabetes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Concomitant use with methotrexate increases golimumab serum levels and decreases anti-golimumab antibodies. The recommended dose for the treatment of RA, PsA, and AS is 50 mg given every 4 weeks. A higher dose of golimumab is used for the treatment of ulcerative colitis as follows: 200 mg initially at week 0 followed by 100 mg at week 2 and every 4 weeks thereafter. 3. Indications: Golimumab with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA in adult patients. It is also indicated for the treatment of PsA and AS and moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. 1. Mechanism of Action: Infliximab (Figure 36\u20134) is a chimeric (25% mouse, 75% human) IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to soluble and possibly membrane-bound TNF-\u03b1. Its mechanism of action probably is the same as that of adalimumab. 2."

Certolizumab is a recombinant antibody that contains an Fab fragment that is conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG) but lacks an Fc portion.

Antibody formation is much more likely in patients given episodic anti-TNF therapy than regular scheduled injections.

Antibody development also is less likely in patients who receive concomitant therapy with immunomodulators (ie, 6-MP or methotrexate).

However, a comparative study of ustekinumab (an IL-12 and IL-23 blocker) and etanercept concluded that ustekinumab at a dose of 45 or 90 mg was superior to high-dose etanercept (50 mg twice weekly) over a 12-week period in patients with psoriasis. 1.

            "content": "Because exposure to NTM is essentially universal and disease is rare, it can be assumed that normal host defenses against these organisms must be strong and that otherwise healthy individuals in whom significant disease develops are highly likely to have specific susceptibility factors that permit NTM to become established, multiply, and cause disease. At the advent of HIV infection, CD4+ T lymphocytes were recognized as key effector cells against NTM; the development of disseminated MAC disease was highly correlated with a decline in CD4+ T lymphocyte numbers. Such a decrease has also been implicated in disseminated MAC infection in patients with idiopathic CD4+ T lymphocytopenia. Potent inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), such as infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, and etanercept, can neutralize this critical cytokine. The occasional result is severe mycobacterial or fungal infection; these associations indicate that TNF-\u03b1 is a crucial element in"

Additionally, dosage modifications are recommended on the basis of certain laboratory changes such as elevated liver enzymes, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. 3. Indications: Tocilizumab is a bDMARD indicated for adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more DMARDs. It is also indicated in patients who are older than 2 years with active SJIA or active PJIA. A recent study showed that it is slightly more effective than adalimumab. There is an ongoing phase 3 study to test its use in SSc. 4."
