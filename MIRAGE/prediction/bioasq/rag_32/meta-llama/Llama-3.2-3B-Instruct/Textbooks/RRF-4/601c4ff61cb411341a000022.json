It mentions that focused radiation, including proton beam therapy, is used for the treatment of certain types of tumors. Although it does not specifically mention craniopharyngioma, it does mention that proton beam therapy is used for lesions abutting the medulla or the spinal cord, and it is not recommended for lesions abutting the medulla or the spinal cord. Since craniopharyngioma is not abutting the medulla or the spinal cord, it is theoretically possible that proton beam therapy could be used for its treatment.\\n\\nHowever, we cannot make a definitive conclusion based on the provided documents.

In this manner, the dose of radiation being applied to normal tissues can be minimized. It is most commonly used for the treatment of brain and spinal tumors. Protons are a charged particle that can be also used in external beam radiation therapy. Proton therapy employs a beam of protons as a means of delivering radiation to a tumor. In con-trast to photons, which deposit energy continuously during their passage through tissue, protons deposit a large amount of their energy near the end of their path (known as the Bragg peak) and release less energy along the way. Thus, proton therapy could theoretically reduce the exposure of normal tissue to radiation, allowing the delivery of higher doses of radiation to a tumor. It is thought that chemotherapy given concurrently with radiation improves survival rates. Chemotherapy before"

Proton beam therapy uses accel-erated protons, which dissipate energy upon impact and do not cause additional exiting damage.

Focused megavoltage irradiation is achieved by precise MRI localization, using a high-voltage linear accelerator and accurate isocentric rotational arcing. A major determinant of accurate irradiation is reproduction of the patient\u2019s head position during multiple visits and maintenance of absolute head immobility. A total of <50 Gy (5000 rad) is given as 180-cGy (180-rad) fractions divided over about 6 weeks. Stereotactic radiosurgery delivers a large single high-energy dose from a cobalt-60 source (gamma knife), linear accelerator, or cyclotron. Long-term effects of gamma-knife surgery are unclear but appear to be similar to those encountered with conventional radiation. Proton beam therapy is available in some centers and provides concentrated radiation doses within a localized region."

A single brief exposure was all that was necessary. An endocrine deficit will follow in most instances and must be corrected by hormone replacement therapy. Several equivalent methods (Gamma Knife, Cyberknife) are more accessible and have become widely used. The advantage of these radiotherapeutic methods is that tumor recurrence is rare. A disadvantage is that the radiation effect is obtained only after several months. Estrada and colleagues have also reported that external beam-radiation therapy may be employed after unsuccessful transsphenoidal surgery for Cushing disease. After approximately 3.5 years following radiation, 83 percent of their patients showed no signs of tumor growth. There are a few reports, however, of a decline in memory ability after radiation treatment of all types."

Teletherapy with x-ray or gamma-ray photons is the most commonly used form of radiation therapy. Particulate forms of radiation are also used in certain circumstances, such as the use of proton beams.

The gamma knife delivers 201 focused beams of gamma radiation from cobalt sources through a specially designed colander-like helmet. Gamma knife units are used only for intracranial disease and cost up to $5 million; thus, they are most appropriate in high patient\u2013volume centers. There is ongoing debate in the literature 9Brunicardi_Ch42_p1827-p1878.indd 187101/03/19 7:17 PM 1872SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONSPART IIregarding the two technologies.99-101 Both continue to evolve, allowing more precise and complex isodose conformation to complex lesions. Most lesions can be treated equally well with either technology. Lesions abutting the medulla or the spinal cord should not be treated with SRS because these structures do not tolerate the radiation dose delivered to structures within mil-limeters of the target.

If neurologic deterioration is not reversed with medical therapy, ventriculotomy to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or craniotomy to remove tumors or hematomas may be necessary."

If 17\u03b1-hydroxylase deficiency is confirmed, treatment is instituted with corticosteroid replacement and estrogen. Progestogen should be added to protect the endometrium from hyperplasia. If possible, therapeutic measures are aimed at correcting the primary cause of amenorrhea: 1. Craniopharyngiomas may be resected with a transsphenoidal approach or during craniotomy, depending on the size of the tumor. Some studies show improved prognosis with radiation therapy used in combination with limited tumor removal (38,53). 2. Germinomas are highly radiosensitive, and surgery is rarely indicated (54). 3. Prolactinomas and hyperprolactinemia often may respond to dopamine agonists (bromocriptine or cabergoline) (55). 4."

The cumulative risk of developing a secondary tumor after conventional radiation is 1.3% after 10 years and 1.9% after 20 years."

            "content": "Cranial Irradiation Cranial irradiation may result in long-term hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction, especially in children and adolescents, as they are more susceptible to damage after whole-brain or head and neck therapeutic irradiation. The development of hormonal abnormalities correlates strongly with irradiation dosage and the time interval after completion of radiotherapy. Up to two-thirds of patients ultimately develop hormone insufficiency after a median dose of 50 Gy (5000 rad) directed at the skull base. The development of hypopituitarism occurs over 5\u201315 years and usually reflects hypothalamic damage rather than primary destruction of pituitary cells. Although the pattern of hormone loss is variable, GH deficiency is most common, followed by gonadotropin and ACTH deficiency. When deficiency of one or more hormones is documented, the possibility of diminished reserve of other hormones is likely. Accordingly, anterior pituitary function should be continually evaluated over"

Either treatment may be supplemented by endocrine therapy (for carcinoma of breast and prostate), and of antineoplastic drugs (for certain lymphomas and myelomas. Pain relief is sometimes difficult to attain and requires narcotics. Gilbert and associates presented evidence that patients who receive high-dose corticosteroids (16 to 60 mg of dexamethasone) and fractionated radiation (500 cGy on each of the first 3 days and then spaced radiation up to 3,000 cGy) do as well as those who have surgical decompression. However, a comparison of five different radiation programs by Nieder and colleagues suggested there is little difference between them. An often cited review of the radiotherapy options was given by Gerszten and colleagues in 2009 but the techniques change so rapidly that it is difficult to determine and compare outcomes. The issue of radiosensitivity of any particular tumor has become a relative one as"
