They are protein therapeutics designed mostly to target cytokines and cell-surface molecules. The TNF inhibitors were the first biologicals approved for the treatment of RA. Anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, was approved shortly thereafter; however, its benefits have proved to be relatively modest compared with the other biologicals and is rarely used for the treatment of RA with the availability of other more effective agents. Abatacept, rituximab, and tocilizumab are the newest members of this class."

Mechanism of Action: Tocilizumab, a newer biologic humanized antibody, binds to soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors, and inhibits the IL-6-mediated signaling via these receptors. IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by different cell types including T cells, B cells, monocytes, fibroblasts, and synovial and endothelial cells. IL-6 is involved in a variety of physiologic processes such as T-cell activation, hepatic acute-phase protein synthesis, and stimulation of the inflammatory processes involved in diseases such as RA and systemic sclerosis (SSc). In a phase 4 superiority study, tocilizumab monotherapy was superior to adalimumab monotherapy for reduction of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis in patients with incomplete response to MTX. 2."

Additionally, dosage modifications are recommended on the basis of certain laboratory changes such as elevated liver enzymes, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. 3. Indications: Tocilizumab is a bDMARD indicated for adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more DMARDs. It is also indicated in patients who are older than 2 years with active SJIA or active PJIA. A recent study showed that it is slightly more effective than adalimumab. There is an ongoing phase 3 study to test its use in SSc. 4."

IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of RA, with detrimental effects on both joint inflammation and damage. IL-6 binding to its receptor activates intracellular signaling pathways that affect the acute-phase response, cytokine production, and osteoclast activation. Clinical trials attest to the clinical efficacy of tocilizumab therapy for RA, both as monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate and other DMARDs. Tocilizumab has been associated with an increased risk of infection, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia; however, the hematologic abnormalities appear to be reversible upon stopping the drug. In addition, this agent has been shown to increase LDL cholesterol; however, it is not known as yet if this effect on lipid levels increases the risk for development of atherosclerotic disease."

Demyelinating disorders including multiple sclerosis are rarely associated with tocilizumab use. Fewer than 1% of the patients taking tocilizumab develop anaphylactic reaction. Anti-tocilizumab antibodies develop in 2% of the patients, and these can be associated with hypersensitivity reactions requiring discontinuation. Cytokines play a central role in the immune response (see Chapter 55) and in RA. Although a wide range of cytokines are expressed in the joints of RA patients, TNF-\u03b1 appears to be particularly important in the inflammatory process."

Tolerance to self antigens is an essential feature of the immune system; when tolerance is lost, the immune system can destroy self tissues, as happens in autoimmune disease. tolerant Describes the state of immunological tolerance, in which the individual does not respond to a particular antigen. tolerogenic Describes an antigen or type of antigen exposure that induces tolerance. Toll Receptor protein in Drosophila that activates the transcription factor NF\u03baB, leading to the production of antimicrobial peptides."

            "content": "Antibodies to the antibody (ATA) may develop with all four agents. These antibodies may attenuate or eliminate the clinical response and increase the likelihood of developing acute or delayed infusion or injection reactions. Antibody formation is much more likely in patients given episodic anti-TNF therapy than regular scheduled injections. In patients on chronic maintenance therapy, the prevalence of ATA with infliximab is 10%, with certolizumab 8%, and with adalimumab or golimumab 3%. Antibody development also is less likely in patients who receive concomitant therapy with immunomodulators (ie, 6-MP or methotrexate). Concomitant treatment with anti-TNF agents and immunomodulators may increase the risk of lymphoma."

Patients who respond may be treated with chronic maintenance therapy, as follows: infliximab 5 mg/kg intravenous infusion every 8 weeks; adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks; certolizumab 400 mg subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks. With chronic, regularly scheduled therapy, clinical response is maintained in more than 60% of patients and disease remission in 40%. However, one-third of patients eventually lose response despite higher doses or more frequent injections. Loss of response in many patients may be due to the development of antibodies to the TNF antibody or to other mechanisms."

            "content": "Cytokines and Cytokine Inhibitors Several TNF inhibitors are used as biological therapies in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; these include monoclonal antibodies, TNF-R Fc fusion proteins, and Fab fragments. Use of anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody therapies such as adalimumab, infliximab, and golimumab has resulted in clinical improvement in patients with these diseases and has opened the way for targeting TNF-\u03b1 to treat other severe forms of autoimmune and/or inflammatory disease. Blockage of TNF-\u03b1 has been effective in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn\u2019s disease, and ankylosing spondylitis. Other cytokine inhibitors are recombinant soluble TNF-\u03b1 receptor (R) fused to human Ig and anakinra (soluble IL-1 receptor antagonist, or IL-1ra). The treatment of autoinflammatory syndromes (Table 372e-6) with recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist can prevent symptoms in these syndromes, because the overproduction of IL-1\u03b2 is a hallmark of these diseases."
