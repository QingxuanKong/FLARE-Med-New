After reviewing the documents, I found that Dexmecamylamine is not mentioned in any of the provided texts. However, we can make an educated guess by looking at the context of the documents. The documents primarily discuss the use of various antidepressants, such as MAO inhibitors, tricyclic compounds, serotonergic drugs, and lithium, as well as other classes of medications like psychostimulants and atypical antidepressants. Dexmecamylamine is actually a drug that was used as an antihypertensive agent, not as an antidepressant. It is a sympathomimetic agent that is not listed in the provided documents as a treatment for depression. Therefore, based on the information provided, it is unlikely that Dexmecamylamine is effective for depression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

            "content": "The use of medications for depression is now so widespread that all physicians should be familiar with them. It must be acknowledged, however, that the magnitude of the effect on depression of these medications has been dominated by a few clinical trials. Meta-analyses of several large studies on the therapeutic effects of antidepressants suggest that clinical improvement attributable to the drugs themselves occurs in approximately 50 percent of patients; remarkably, an additional improvement in up to 25 percent is attributable to a placebo effect or, more likely, to the natural course of the disease. The remainder fails to improve in a timely manner or relapse while on medication. The incremental value of certain forms of psychotherapies is discussed further on."

            "content": "Because many depressed patients are responsive to one of the tricyclic drugs, MAO inhibitors, or serotonin agonists but not to all of them, the clinician is greatly aided by information regarding which of these drugs has been helpful in past episodes. As mentioned, response to antidepressant drugs is not expected for several weeks. Treatment, if successful, should be continued for 6 to 9 months and generally combined with some type of psychotherapy. The premature discontinuation of medications is a major source of relapse. The dosage of medication may then be reduced slowly over a period of weeks. Rapid reduction may result in withdrawal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, malaise, and muscular pains). If depressive symptoms recur upon withdrawal, the effective dose should be gradually reinstituted. Mann (2005) provides a thorough review of the medical treatment of depression; the side effects of each are given in tabular form and adapted for Table 48-3."

For example, patients with bipolar depression may not benefit much from antidepressants even when added to mood stabilizers. In fact, the antidepressants are sometimes associated with switches into mania or more rapid cycling. There has also been some debate about the overall efficacy of antidepressants in unipolar depression, with some meta-analyses showing large effects and others showing more modest effects. Although this debate is not likely to be settled immediately, there is little debate that antidepressants have important benefits for most patients."

However, most of the neurochemical theories of depression suffer from the weakness that they have been the result of backward reasoning from the effects of antidepressants on various neurotransmitters to the putative mechanisms of the disease. Following the observations that the tricyclic antidepressants and the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors exerted their effect by increasing norepinephrine and serotonin at central adrenergic receptor sites in the limbic system and hypothalamus and that depression-provoking drugs (such as reserpine) deplete biogenic amines at these sites, it was proposed that naturally occurring depressions might be associated with a deficiency of these substances. Furthermore, depressed patients and their first-degree relatives, as well as healthy individuals, develop a depressed mood after dietary"

However, many enzymes other than monoamine oxidase are inhibited by MAO inhibitors, and the latter drugs have numerous actions unrelated to enzyme inhibition. Furthermore, many agents with antidepressant effects like those of the MAO inhibitors do not inhibit MAO. Therefore, one cannot assume that the therapeutic effect of these drugs has a direct relation to MAO inhibition in the brain."

Soon after the first successes with MAO inhibitors, another class of tricyclic compounds appeared. The mode of action of these agents is not fully understood, but there is evidence that they block the reuptake of amine neurotransmitters, both norepinephrine and serotonin. Blocking this amine pump mechanism (called the presynaptic plasma transporter), which ordinarily terminates synaptic transmission, permits the persistence of neurotransmitter substances in the synaptic cleft and does no more than support the hypothesis that endogenous depression is associated with a deficiency of noradrenergic or serotonergic transmission."

The suicide rate in the over-65 age group (twice the national average) supports this view. Unfor tunately, the apathy, flat affect, and social withdrawal of major depression may be mistaken for senile dementia. Clinical evidence suggests that the elderly are as responsive to antidepressants (of all types) as younger patients but are more likely to experience adverse effects.

For these reasons, serotonin and its neuronal pathways are also currently implicated in the genesis of depression. However, the reader should be reminded that only 2 decades ago it was widely held that depletion of norepinephrine fulfilled this role. It is also not yet clear which neurochemical alterations are primary and which modulate other systems. For example, reports suggest that substance P plays an important role in the causation of depression (Kramer et al) and that blockade of substance P receptors has antidepressant effects.
