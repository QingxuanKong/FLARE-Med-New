            "content": "14-2 Although many types of antigens can cause allergic sensitization, proteases are common sensitizing agents. Most airborne allergens are relatively small, highly soluble proteins that are carried on dry particles such as pollen grains or mite feces (Fig. 14.4). On contact with the mucus-covered epithelia of the eyes, nose, or airways, the soluble allergen is eluted from the particle and diffuses into the mucosa, where it can be picked up by dendritic cells and provoke sensitization (see Fig. 14.2). At mucosal surfaces, allergens are typically presented to the immune system at low concentrations. It has been estimated that the maximum exposure of a person to the common pollen allergens in ragweed (Ambrosia species) does not exceed 1 \u03bcg per year. It is thought that low-dose sensitization favors formation of a strong TH2 response. Consequently, these minute doses of allergen can provoke irritating and even life-threatening TH2-driven IgE antibody responses in atopic individuals."

Often, experimental allergen challenge is followed by a late response when there is airway edema and an acute inflammatory response with increased eosinophils and neutrophils that are not very reversible with bronchodilators. The most common allergens to trigger asthma are Dermatophagoides species, and environmental exposure leads to low-grade chronic symptoms that are perennial. Other perennial allergens are derived from cats and other domestic pets, as well as cockroaches. Other allergens, including grass pollen, ragweed, tree pollen, and fungal spores, are seasonal. Pollens usually cause allergic rhinitis rather than asthma, but in thunderstorms, the pollen grains are disrupted and the particles that may be released can trigger severe asthma exacerbations (thunderstorm asthma)."

Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing technologies, capable of producing billions of sequence reads in a single run, has revealed chromatin modifications (\u201cepigenetic marks\u201d) relevant to stem cell properties.

A study in Mexico City on the effects of atmospheric ozone levels on atopic children with allergic asthma also found that the children carrying the null allele of GSTM1 were more susceptible than noncarriers to airway hyperreactivity when exposed to given levels of ozone. Underscoring the potential for reactive oxygen species such as ozone and superoxide to contribute to asthma exacerbation, studies using mice indicate that airway myeloid cells that produce high levels of super-oxide worsen antigen-induced airway hyperreactivity.

As Darwin showed, we can readily interpret such close family resemblances in terms of evolution from common ancestors, and we can find the remains of many of these ancestors preserved in the fossil record. In this way, it has been possible to begin to draw a family tree of living organisms, showing the various lines of descent, as well as branch points in the history, where the ancestors of one group of species became different from those of another."

In other plants, the chloroplast precursors from the pollen grains enter the zygote, making chloroplast inheritance biparental. In such plants, defective chloroplasts are a cause of variegation: a mixture of normal and defective chloroplasts in a zygote may sort out by mitotic segregation during plant growth and development, thereby producing alternating green and white patches in leaves. Leaf cells in the green patches contain normal chloroplasts, while those in the white patches contain defective chloroplasts (Figure 14\u201368)."

The initial studies that led to the classification of the living world into the three domains of bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes were based chiefly on analysis of one of the rRNA components of the ribosome. Because the translation of RNA into protein is fundamental to all living cells, this component of the ribosome has been very well conserved since early in the history of life on Earth (Figure 1\u201318). Natural selection has generally favored those prokaryotic cells that can reproduce the fastest by taking up raw materials from their environment and replicating themselves most efficiently, at the maximal rate permitted by the available food supplies. Small size implies a large ratio of surface area to volume, thereby helping to maximize the uptake of nutrients across the plasma membrane and boosting a cell\u2019s reproductive rate."

In these organisms, the egg cell contributes much more cytoplasm to the zygote than does the male gamete (sperm in animals, pollen in plants). For example, a typical human oocyte contains about 100,000 copies of maternal mitochondrial DNA, whereas a sperm cell contains only a few. In addition, an active process ensures that the sperm mitochondria do not compete with those in the egg. As sperm mature, the DNA is degraded in their mitochondria. Sperm mitochondria are also specifically recognized then eliminated from the fertilized egg cell by autophagy in very much the same way that damaged mitochondria are removed (by ubiquitylation followed by delivery to lysosomes, as discussed in Chapter 13). Because of these two processes, the mitochondrial inheritance in both animals and plants is uniparental. More precisely, the mitochondrial DNA passes from one generation to the next by maternal inheritance."

            "content": "Humans often harvest substances stored in plant vacuoles\u2014from rubber to opium to the flavoring of garlic. Many stored products have a metabolic function. Proteins, for example, can be preserved for years in the vacuoles of the storage cells of many seeds, such as those of peas and beans. When the seeds germinate, these proteins are hydrolyzed, and the resulting amino acids provide a food supply for the developing embryo. Anthocyanin pigments stored in vacuoles color the petals of many flowers so as to attract pollinating insects, while noxious molecules released from vacuoles when a plant is eaten or damaged provide a defense against predators. Multiple pathways deliver Materials to lysosomes Lysosomes are meeting places where several streams of intracellular traffic converge. A route that leads outward from the ER via the Golgi apparatus delivers most of the lysosome\u2019s digestive enzymes, while at least four paths from different sources feed substances into lysosomes for digestion."

Symptoms in the late summer or autumn are commonly caused by weed pollen, such as that of ragweed, or the spores of fungi such as Alternaria. Ubiquitous allergens such as Fel d 1 in cat dander, Der p 1 in the feces of house dust mites, and Bla g 1 in cockroach can be a cause of year-round, or perennial, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis."

            "content": "Why is the mutation rate so much higher in mitochondria than in the nucleus (and chloroplasts)? Could this high rate have been useful to the cell? What mechanisms and pathways have been used during evolution to transfer genes from the mitochondrion to the nucleus? how many seconds would it take the heart to consume an amount of ATP equal to its steady-state levels? (Complete oxidation of one molecule of glucose to CO2 yields 30 ATP, 26 of which are derived by oxidative phosphorylation using the 12 pairs of electrons captured in the electron carriers NADH and FADH2.) 14\u20136 Both H+ and Ca2+ are ions that move through the cytosol. Why is the movement of H+ ions so much faster than that of Ca2+ ions? How do you suppose the speed of these two ions would be affected by freezing the solution? Would you expect them to move faster or slower? Explain your answer."

Somechildren experience perennial symptoms with seasonal exacerbations. Seasonal allergic rhinitis is caused by airborne pollens,which have seasonal patterns. Typically trees pollinate in thespring, grasses in late spring to summer, and weeds in the summer and fall. The pollen, microscopic in size, can travel airbornehundreds of miles and be inhaled easily into the respiratory tract.Perennial allergic rhinitis is primarily caused by indoor allergens, such as house dust mites, animal dander, mold, and cockroaches. Episodic rhinitis occurs with intermittent exposure toallergens, such as visiting a friend\u2019s home where a pet dwells."
