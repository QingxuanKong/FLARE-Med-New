According to Document [10], iron deficiency anemia is a common complication of CKD, especially in patients with end-stage renal disease. Document [20] also mentions that iron deficiency is a common cause of anemia in patients with CKD. Additionally, Document [25] states that iron deficiency is one of the most prevalent forms of malnutrition globally, and CKD is a common cause of iron deficiency. Furthermore, Document [28] notes that patients with CKD often die with iron deficiency anemia, suggesting that it is a common complication of the disease. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it appears that iron deficiency anemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Adamson Anemias associated with normocytic and normochromic red cells and an inappropriately low reticulocyte response (reticulocyte index <2\u20132.5) are hypoproliferative anemias. This category includes early iron deficiency (before hypochromic microcytic red cells develop), acute and chronic inflammation (including many malignancies), renal disease, hypometabolic states such as protein malnutrition and endocrine deficiencies, and anemias from marrow damage. Marrow damage states are discussed in Chap. 130. Hypoproliferative anemias are the most common anemias, and in the clinic, iron deficiency anemia is the most common of these followed by the anemia of inflammation. The anemia of inflammation, similar to iron deficiency, is related in part to abnormal iron metabolism. The anemias associated with renal disease, inflammation, cancer, and hypometabolic states are characterized by a suboptimal erythro poietin response to the anemia."

This manifests as a hypochromic, microcytic anemia in which the erythrocyte mean cell volume (MCV) and the mean cell hemoglobin concentration are low (Table 33\u20132). Iron deficiency is commonly seen in populations with increased iron requirements. These include infants, especially premature infants; children during rapid growth periods; pregnant and lactating women; and patients with chronic kidney disease who lose erythrocytes at a relatively high rate during hemodialysis and also form them at a high rate as a result of treatment with the erythrocyte growth factor erythropoietin (see below). Inadequate iron absorption also can cause iron deficiency. This is seen after gastrectomy and in patients with severe small bowel disease that results in generalized malabsorption.

The key laboratory tests in distinguishing between the various forms of hypoproliferative anemia include the serum iron and iron-binding capacity, evaluation of renal and thyroid function, a marrow biopsy or aspirate to detect marrow damage or infiltrative disease, and serum ferritin to assess iron stores.

With chronic inflammation, renal disease, or hypometabolism, endogenous EPO production is inadequate for the degree of anemia observed. For the anemia of chronic inflammation, the erythroid marrow also responds inadequately to stimulation, due in part to defective iron reutilization. As a result of the lack of adequate EPO stimulation, an examination of the peripheral blood smear will disclose only an occasional polychromatophilic (\u201cshift\u201d) reticulocyte. In cases of iron deficiency or marrow damage, appropriate elevations in endogenous EPO levels are typically found, and shift reticulocytes will be present on the blood smear."

The foremost issue for the latter patient is the precise identification of the cause of the iron deficiency. For the majority of cases of iron deficiency (pregnant women, growing children and adolescents, patients with infrequent episodes of bleeding, and those with inadequate dietary intake of iron), oral iron therapy will suffice. For patients with unusual blood loss or malabsorption, specific diagnostic tests and appropriate therapy take priority. Once the diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia and its cause is made, there are three major therapeutic approaches."

The most common sources of bleeding are the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., peptic ulcers, colon cancer, hemorrhoids) and the female genital tract (e.g., menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, endometrial cancer). In the developing world, low intake and poor bioavailability because of predominantly vegetarian diets are the most common causes of iron deficiency. In the United States, low dietary intake is an infrequent culprit but is sometimes culpable in infants fed exclusively milk, in the impoverished, in the elderly, and in teenagers subsisting predominantly on junk food.

Often referred to as the anemia of chronic disease, anemia associated with chronic inflammation is the most common form of anemia in hospitalized patients. It superficially resembles the anemia of iron deficiency but arises instead from the suppression of erythropoiesis by systemic inflammation. It occurs in a variety of disorders associated with sustained inflammation: \u2022 Chronic microbial infections, such as osteomyelitis, bacterial endocarditis, and lung abscess http://ebooksmedicine.net Chronic immune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and regional enteritis Neoplasms, such as Hodgkin lymphoma and carcinomas of the lung and breast"

Infants fed cow\u2019s milk when younger than 1 year of age, toddlers fed large volumes of cow\u2019s milk, and menstruating teenage girls who are not receiving supplemental iron are at high risk for iron deficiency. Dietary iron deficiency anemia is most common in bottle-fed toddlers who are receiving large volumes of cow\u2019s milk and eat minimal amounts of food high in iron content. (See Chapters 28 and 31.) Iron deficiency anemia also may be found in children with chronic inflammatory diseases, even without chronic blood loss."

In the presence of chronic kidney Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases disease or chronic inflammation, EPO levels are typically lower than expected for the degree of anemia. As individuals age, the level of EPO needed to sustain normal hemoglobin levels appears to increase."

            "content": "laboratory investigations and diagnosis The most consistent blood finding is anemia, which may range from mild to moderate to very severe. The anemia is usually normomacrocytic, with unremarkable red cell morphology. If the MCV is high, it is usually largely accounted for by reticulocytosis, which may be quite marked (up to 20%, or up to 400,000/\u03bcL). The anemia may become microcytic if the patient is allowed to become iron deficient as a result of chronic urinary blood loss through hemoglobinuria. Unconjugated bilirubin is mildly or moderately elevated; LDH is typically markedly elevated (values in the thousands are common); and haptoglobin is usually undetectable. All of these findings make the diagnosis of hemolytic anemia compelling. Hemoglobinuria may be overt in a random urine sample; if it is not, it may be helpful to obtain serial urine samples, because hemoglobinuria can vary dramatically from day to day and even from hour to hour. The bone marrow is usually cellular, with"
