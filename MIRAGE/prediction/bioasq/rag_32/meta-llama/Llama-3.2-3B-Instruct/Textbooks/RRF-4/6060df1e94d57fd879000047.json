The human genome consists of approximately 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs, and most of this is thought to be functionally unimportant. The regions that code for amino acid sequences of proteins (exons) are typically found in short segments (average size about 145 nucleotide pairs) and are interspersed with noncoding DNA (introns). The noncoding regions can be further divided into various functional classes, including regulatory RNAs, mobile genetic elements, and other noncoding segments. The human genome also contains many thousands of genes that encode RNA molecules that do not produce proteins but have other important functions. The size of a gene is also notable, with the average gene size being about 27,000 nucleotide pairs, and most of the remaining sequence in a gene consists of long stretches of noncoding DNA. The majority of human genes thus consist of a long string of alternating exons and introns, with most of the gene consisting of introns. Considering these points, it is clear that there is no clear upper limit on the functional fraction of the human genome, as it can be estimated that only about 2% of the genome is crucial information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Thus, if we assume that our common ancestor had a genome of human size (about 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs), mice would have lost a total of about 45% of that genome from accumulated deletions during the past 80 million years, while humans would have lost about 25%. However, substantial sequence gains from many small chromosome duplications and from the multiplication of transposons have compensated for these deletions. As a result, our genome size is thought to be practically unchanged from that of the last common ancestor of humans and mice, while the mouse genome is smaller by only about 0.3 billion nucleotides."

Over long periods of time, this would result in a major \u201ccleansing\u201d from this fish genome of those DNA sequences whose loss could be tolerated.

In general, the sequences of individual genes are much more tightly conserved than is overall genome structure.

            "content": "What precisely do we mean when we speak of the human genome? Whose genome? On average, any two people taken at random differ in about one or two in every 1000 nucleotide pairs in their DNA sequence. The genome of the human species is, properly speaking, a very complex thing, embracing the entire pool of variant genes found in the human population. Knowledge of this variation is helping us to understand, for example, why some people are prone to one disease, others to another; why some respond well to a drug, others badly. It is also providing clues to our history\u2014the population movements and minglings of our ancestors, the infections they suffered, the diets they ate. All these things have left traces in the variant forms of genes that survive today in the human communities that populate the globe. To understand cells and organisms Will Require mathematics, computers, and Quantitative Information"

            "content": "About 90% of the two genomes can be aligned in this way. Note that while there is an identical order of the matched index sequences (red marks), there has been a net loss of DNA in the mouse lineage that is interspersed throughout the entire region. This type of net loss is typical for all such regions, and it accounts for the fact that the mouse genome contains 14% less DNA than does the human genome. (Adapted from mouse genome Sequencing Consortium, Nature 420:520\u2013562, 2002. with permission from macmillan Publishers ltd.) 10,000 nucleotide pairs of the mammalian genome. An extreme example is the puffer fish, Fugu rubripes (Figure 4\u201370), which has a tiny genome for a vertebrate (0.4 billion nucleotide pairs compared to 1 billion or more for many other fish). The small size of the Fugu genome is largely due to the small size of its introns. Specifically, Fugu introns, as well as other noncoding segments of the Fugu genome, lack the repetitive DNA that makes up a large portion of the"

            "content": "Research in the last decade has surprised biologists with the discovery that, in addition to 21,000 protein-coding genes, the human genome contains many thousands of genes that encode RNA molecules that do not produce proteins, but instead have a variety of other important functions. What is thus far known about these molecules will be presented in Chapters 6 and 7. Last, but not least, the nucleotide sequence of the human genome has revealed that the archive of information needed to produce a human seems to be in an alarming state of chaos. As one commentator described our genome, \u201cIn some ways it may resemble your garage/bedroom/refrigerator/life: highly individualistic, but unkempt; little evidence of organization; much accumulated clutter (referred to by the uninitiated as \u2018junk\u2019); virtually nothing ever discarded; and the few patently valuable items indiscriminately, apparently carelessly, scattered throughout.\u201d We shall discuss how this is thought to have come about in the final"

            "content": "A second notable feature of the human genome is the large average gene size\u2014about 27,000 nucleotide pairs. As discussed above, a typical gene carries in its linear sequence of nucleotides the information for the linear sequence of the amino acids of a protein. Only about 1300 nucleotide pairs are required to encode a protein of average size (about 430 amino acids in humans). Most of the remaining sequence in a gene consists of long stretches of noncoding DNA that interrupt the relatively short segments of DNA that code for protein. As will be discussed in detail in Chapter 6, the coding sequences are called exons; the intervening (noncoding) sequences in genes are called introns (see Figure 4\u201315 and Table 4\u20131). The majority of human genes thus consist of a long string of alternating exons and introns, with most of the gene consisting of introns. In contrast, the majority of genes from organisms with concise genomes lack introns. This accounts for the much smaller size of their genes"
