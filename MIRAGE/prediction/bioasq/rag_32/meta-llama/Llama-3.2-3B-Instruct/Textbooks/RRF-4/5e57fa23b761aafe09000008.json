Patients who received doxorubicin while still growing may have impaired development of the heart, which leads to clinical heart failure by the time the patient reaches the early twenties. Late after adult exposure, patients may develop the gradual onset of symptoms or an acute onset precipitated by a reversible second insult, such as influenza or atrial fibrillation. Doxorubicin cardiotoxicity leads to a relatively nondilated ventricle, perhaps due to the accompanying fibrosis.
