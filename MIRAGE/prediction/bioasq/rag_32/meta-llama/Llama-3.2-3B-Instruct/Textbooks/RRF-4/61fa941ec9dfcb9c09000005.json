The provided documents do not explicitly mention Intepirdine, but we can infer based on the information about related drugs and treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Intepirdine is not a commonly recognized treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The documents mention the use of cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, and other drugs that have shown some benefit in treating Alzheimer's disease, but not Intepirdine. Additionally, the documents discuss the limitations and side effects of various treatments for Alzheimer's disease. Given the lack of information about Intepirdine in the provided documents, it is unlikely that it would be recommended as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. However, without explicit information, we cannot definitively say yes or no. We should consult other sources or seek more information about Intepirdine before making a conclusion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

These medications, however, may offer psychologic benefit to the patient and family if they do not worsen behavior or increase hallucinations; they are not appropriate for advanced stages of disease.

Prevalence rates, which depend also on overall mortality, are approximately 3 times higher in women, although the incidence of new cases is only slightly disproportionate in women. However, there is a suggestion that incidence rates for dementia in general are declining (see Satizabal et al) and it is likely that most of the cases are due to Alzheimer disease. The survival of patients with Alzheimer disease is reduced to half the expected rate, mainly because of respiratory and cardiovascular causes and inanition, but also for other reasons that are not entirely clear."

Dopaminergic drugs can worsen cognitive function in demented patients and should be stopped or reduced to try and provide a compromise between antiparkinsonian benefit and preserved cognitive function. Drugs are usually discontinued in the following sequence: anticholinergics, amantadine, dopamine agonists, COMT inhibitors, and MAO-B inhibitors. Eventually, patients with cognitive impairment should be managed with the lowest dose of standard levodopa that provides meaningful antiparkinsonian effects and does not worsen mental function. Anticholinesterase agents such as rivastigmine and donepezil reduce the rate of deterioration of measures of cognitive function and can improve attention, but do not typically improve cognitive function in any meaningful way."

In the past, it was considered that patients themselves need be told only that they have a condition for which they are to be given rest and treatment. Most physicians (and patients) find this too patronizing; certainly, in the current social environment, patients ask directly if they have Alzheimer disease. To this query, we usually respond that they may, but that more time is required to be certain.

            "content": "Side effects of the aforementioned class of drugs may include nausea and less often, vomiting. The families of our patients report from time to time that the medication caused insomnia or increased confusion. It is worth mentioning that when the acetylcholine receptor antagonist succinylcholine is used prior to general anesthesia, its effects may be prolonged in patients taking the above drugs. The use of trazodone, haloperidol, thioridazine, risperidone, and related drugs may suppress some of the aberrant behavior and hallucinations when these are problems, making life more comfortable for both patient and family, but several trials suggest that their general application causes more problems than it solves and they must often be discontinued in response to adverse effects. The randomized trial conducted by Schneider and coworkers found that olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone for the treatment of psychosis, aggression, or agitation with Alzheimer disease were approximately as"

It seems most likely that amyloid alone is not solely responsible for Alzheimer disease, particularly in cases of late-life onset. Amyloid may accelerate degeneration of neurons and once dementia is established, there may be little additional accumulation of amyloid."

For serial measurement specifically for those with Alzheimer disease, a number of systems have been devised as reviewed in Chap. 38. Among the most commonly used is the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog). It is more comprehensive than the others and takes longer to administer."

These criteria"
