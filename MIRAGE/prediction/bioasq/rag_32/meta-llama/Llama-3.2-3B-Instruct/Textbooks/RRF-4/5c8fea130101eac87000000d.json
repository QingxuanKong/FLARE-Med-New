Aberrant expression of miRNAs in cancer has been attributed to several mechanisms, such as chromosomal rearrangements, genomic copy number change, epigenetic modifications, defects in miRNA biogenesis pathway, and regulation by transcriptional factors. Somatic mutations of miRNAs have been identified in many cancers, but the exact functional consequences of these changes on cancer development remain to be determined.

In view of their important functions in control of cell growth, differentiation, and survival, it is not surprising that accumulating evidence indicates that miRNAs also can contribute to carcinogenesis. Specifically, if the target of a miRNA is a tumor suppressor gene, then overactivity of the miRNA can reduce the tumor suppressor protein. Such miRNAs are sometimes referred to as oncomIRs.

Each tissue has a distinctive repertoire of microRNA expression, and this pattern is altered in specific ways in cancers. However, specific correlations between microRNA expression and tumor biology and clinical behavior are just now emerging. Therapies targeting microRNAs are not currently at hand but represent a novel area of treatment development. lncRNAs are longer than 200 nucleotides and compose the largest group of noncoding RNAs. Some of them have been shown to play important roles in gene regulation. The potential for altering these RNAs for therapeutic benefit is an area of active investigation,"

            "content": "of these target sites are selected for siRNA design. The antisense siRNA strand is the reverse complement of the target sequence. The sense strand of the siRNA is the same sequence as the target mRNA sequence. A deoxythymidine dimer is rou-tinely incorporated at the 3\u2032 end of the sense strand siRNA, although it is unknown whether this noncomplementary dinu-cleotide is important for the activity of siRNAs.There are two ways to introduce siRNA to knock down gene expression in human cells:1. RNA transfection: siRNA can be made chemically or using an in vitro transcription method. Like DNA oligos, chemically synthesized siRNA oligos can be commercially ordered. However, synthetic siRNA is expensive, and sev-eral siRNAs may have to be tried before a particular gene is successfully silenced. In vitro transcription provides a more economic approach. Both short and long RNA can be synthesized using bacteriophage RNA polymerase T7, T3, or SP6. In the case of long dsRNAs, RNase such as"

            "content": "Each time RISC cleaves a new RNA molecule, the RISC is released; thus, as we saw for miRNAs, a single RNA molecule can act catalytically to destroy many complementary RNAs. Some organisms employ an additional mechanism that amplifies the RNAi response even further. In these organisms, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases use siRNAs as primers to produce additional copies of double-strand RNAs which are then cleaved into siRNAs. This amplification ensures that, once initiated, RNA interference can continue even after all the initiating double-stranded RNA has been degraded or diluted out. For example, it permits progeny cells to continue carrying out the specific RNA interference that was provoked in the parent cells."
