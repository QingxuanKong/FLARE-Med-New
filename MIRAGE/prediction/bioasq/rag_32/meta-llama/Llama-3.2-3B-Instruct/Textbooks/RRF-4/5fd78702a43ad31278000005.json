According to Document [0], 5A-reductase deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent form of testosterone. This deficiency can lead to undervirilization of males and ambiguous genitalia at birth.\\n\\nHowever, in Document [11], it is mentioned that individuals with 5A-reductase type 2 deficiency have normal wolffian structures and usually do not develop breast tissue. At puberty, the increase in testosterone induces muscle mass and other virilizing features despite DHT deficiency. Some individuals change gender from female to male at puberty.\\n\\nThis indicates that 5A-reductase type 2 deficiency does not necessarily lead to hermaphroditism, which is a condition where both male and female gonadal tissues are present.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the answer to the question is that steroid 5A-reductase deficiency does not lead to hermaphroditism.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

Patients with 5-reductase deficiency differ from patients with androgen insensitivity because they do not develop breasts at puberty (Fig. 30.2). These patients have low gonadotropin levels as a result of testosterone levels that are sufficient to suppress breast development and allow normal feedback mechanisms to remain intact.

In some cases, 46,Y disorders of sexual diferentiation stem from abnormalities in: (1) testosterone biosynthesis, (2) LH receptor function, (3) AMH function, or (4) androgen receptor action. First, the sex steroid biosynthesis pathway can sufer enzymatic defects that block testosterone production. Depending on the timing and degree of blockade, undervirilized males or phenotypic females may result. In contrast to these central enzymatic defects, peripheral defects may be causative. Namely, abnormal 5-. reductase type 2 enzyme action leads to impaired conversion of testosterone to DHT and thus to undervirilization."

It was believed that sexof-rearing may be changed before 2 years of age without psychologically damaging the child, but experience with individuals with 5\u03b1-reductase deficiency suggests that gender changes may be made after 2 years of age in certain instances (103). In any case, surgery for genital ambiguity to make the external genitalia (and development) as compatible with the sex-of-rearing of the child is warranted but was not always successful.

The clinical spectrum of 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency ranges from the classic salt wasting, hypogonadism, and ambiguous genitalia in males and females, to nonclassic hyperandrogenic symptoms in children and young women (193).

Two isozymes of 5\u03b1-reductase exist: type 1, which predominates in the skin, and type 2, or acidic 5\u03b1-reductase, which is found in the liver, prostate, seminal vesicles, and genital skin. The type 2 isozyme has a 20-fold higher affinity for testosterone than type 1. Both type 1 and 2 deficiencies in males result in ambiguous genitalia, and both isozymes may play a role in androgen effects on hair growth. Dihydrotestosterone is more potent than testosterone, primarily because of its higher affinity and slower dissociation from the androgen receptor. Although DHT is the key intracellular mediator of most androgen effects, measurements of circulating levels are not clinically useful. The relative androgenicity of androgens is as follows: DHEAS = 5."

            "content": "Treatment of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia The treatment of CAH involves providing replacement doses of the deficient steroid hormones. Hydrocortisone (10 to 20 mg/m2 body surface area) or its equivalent is given daily in divided doses to suppress the elevated levels of pituitary corticotropin present and thus suppress the elevated androgen levels. With such treatment, signs of androgen excess should regress. In children, growth velocity, bone age, and hormone levels should be monitored carefully because both overreplacement and underreplacement can result in premature closure of the epiphyses and short stature. Data now indicate that early diagnosis and compliance with therapy lead to adult height within 1 standard deviation of the anticipated target height in girls with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (86)."

Men with mild to moderate LUTS can be treated effectively using \u03b1-adrenergic antagonists, phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors, steroid 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors, or anticholinergic agents alone or in combination. Selective \u03b1-adrenergic antagonists are typically the first line of therapy. In men with probable benign prostate obstruction with gland enlargement and LUTS, therapy using a steroid 5a-reductase inhibitor, such as finasteride or dutasteride, for 1 or more years improves urinary symptoms and flow rate and reduces prostatic volume. Long-term treatment with 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors can reduce progression to acute urinary retention and need for prostate surgery. Combined administration of a steroid 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor and \u03b11-adrenergic blocker can rapidly improve urinary symptoms and reduce the relative risk of acute urinary retention and surgery. PDE5 inhibitors, when administered chronically alone or in combination"

Amenorrhea is the result of accelerated atresia of the follicles. The fibrotic ovaries are called streak ovaries. In addition to gonadal failure, there are associated stigmata with Turner syndrome that include short stature, webbed neck, shield chest, cubitus valgus (increased carrying angle of the arms), low hair line, high arched palate, multiple pigmented nevi, and short fourth metacarpals (4). X inactivation is a process that inactivates most of the genes on one X chromosome. Of the genes on the X chromosome, 20% escape X inactivation, and it is believed that loss of the second copy of these genes in a 45,X patient causes the stigmata associated with Turner syndrome (5)."

Other enzyme defi-ciencies include 3\u03b2-hydroxydehydrogenase and 17-hydroxylase deficiency. Congenital adrenal lipoid hyperplasia is the most severe form of CAH, which is caused by cholesterol desmolase deficiency. It leads to the disruption of all steroid biosynthetic pathways, thus resulting in a fatal salt-wasting syndrome in phe-notypic female patients.Diagnostic Tests The particular enzyme deficiency can be diagnosed by karyotype analysis and measurement of plasma and urinary steroids. The most common enzyme defi-ciency, absence of 21-hydroxylase, leads to increased plasma 17-hydroxyprogesterone and progesterone levels because these compounds cannot be converted to 11-deoxycortisol and 11-DOC, respectively. 11\u03b2-Hydroxylase deficiency is the next most"

Males with pseudohermaphroditism are genetic males with feminized external genitalia, most commonly manifesting as hypospadias (urethral opening on the ventral surface of the penis) or incomplete fusion of the urogenital or labioscrotal folds. Females with pseudohermaphroditism are genetic females with virilized external genitalia, including clitoral hypertrophy and some degree of fusion of the urogenital or labioscrotal folds. Both types of pseudohermaphroditism are caused either by abnormal levels of sex hormones or abnormalities in the sex hormone receptors. Another major category of genital tract abnormalities involves various types of uterovaginal malformations, which occur in 0.16% of women (Fig. 5.13) (26). These malformations are believed to result from one or more of the following situations: 1."
