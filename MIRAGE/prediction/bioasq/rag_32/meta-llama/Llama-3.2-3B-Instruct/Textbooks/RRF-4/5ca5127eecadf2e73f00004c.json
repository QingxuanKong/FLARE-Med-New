    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the provided documents to see if there are any changes in the collagen matrix of human articular cartilage with disease. We know that osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that affects the articular cartilage. According to Document [7] (Title: Pathology_Robbins), the lesions of OA stem from degeneration of the articular cartilage and its disordered repair. This implies that the collagen matrix of articular cartilage is affected by OA. In addition, Document [12] (Title: Histology_Ross) states that collagen fibers are degraded either by proteolytic or phagocytic pathways, and Document [26] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) mentions that matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) act primarily in the breakdown of cartilage matrix. These documents suggest that the collagen matrix of human articular cartilage is changing with disease, specifically with osteoarthritis. Furthermore, Document [8] (Title: Histology_Ross) describes the early changes of OA, which include disruption of the superficial layer of the articular cartilage, and Document [10] (Title: Histology_Ross) mentions that the composition of the matrix changes with age, leading to reduced intercellular water content and increased vulnerability of cartilage. These changes also indicate alterations in the collagen matrix. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the collagen matrix of human articular cartilage is changing with disease, particularly with osteoarthritis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

It provides a low-friction surface, participates in lubricating synovial joints, and distributes applied forces to the underlying bone.

An exception is articular cartilage, which, in many individuals, breaks down with age (Folder 7.1).

In normal cartilage, type 2 collagen is woven tightly, constraining the aggrecan molecules in the interstices between collagen strands, forcing these highly negatively charged molecules into close proximity with one another. The aggrecan molecule, through electrostatic repulsion of its negative charges, gives cartilage its compressive stiffness.

Throughout life, cartilage undergoes continuous internal remodeling as the cells replace matrix molecules lost through degradation.

Cartilage matrix material can be detected best by observing the larger group of chondrocytes at the left of this figure and then observing this same area in figure above. Note the light homogeneous area around the cell nest in the lower-power view. This is the region of cartilage matrix. At the greater magnification of this figure, it is possible to see that some of the collagen fibers are incorporated in the matrix, where they appear as wispy bundles."

            "content": "Hyaline cartilage matrix is highly hydrated to provide resilience and diffusion of small metabolites. Like other connective tissue matrices, cartilage matrix is highly hydrated. From 60% to 80% of the net weight of hyaline cartilage is intercellular water (see Fig. 7.2). Much of this water is bound tightly to the aggrecan\u2013 hyaluronan aggregates, imparting resilience to the cartilage. Some of the water is bound loosely enough, however, to allow diffusion of small metabolites to and from the chondrocytes."

            "content": "to loading, the net effect of cytokine stimulation may be matrix synthesis, but ultimately, the combination of effects on chondrocytes triggers matrix degradation. Enzymes in the matrix are held in check by activation inhibitors, including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP). Growth factors are also part of this complex network, with BMP-2 and transforming growth factor \u03b2 playing prominent roles in stimulating the development of osteophytes. Whereas healthy articular cartilage is avascular in part due to angiogenesis inhibitors present in cartilage, disease is characterized by the invasion of blood vessels into cartilage from underlying bone and proliferation of vessels within synovium. This is influenced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) synthesis in the cartilage and bone. With these blood vessels come nerves that may bring nociceptive innervation."
