The high frequency of oncogenic mutations in the RASRAF-MEK-ERK pathway, which delivers proliferation and survival signals from the cell surface to the cytoplasm and nucleus, has led to the development of inhibitors to BRAF and MEK. Two BRAF inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, have been approved for the treatment of stage IV patients whose melanomas harbor a mutation at position 600 in the gene for BRAF. The oral BRAF inhibitors cause 499 tumor regression in approximately 50% of patients, and overall survival is improved compared to treatment with chemotherapy.

Epidemiologic studies indicate that indoor tanning is a risk factor for melanoma, which may contribute to the increasing incidence of melanoma formation. Furthermore, epidemiologic studies suggest that life in a sunny climate from birth or early childhood may increase the risk of melanoma development.

            "content": "The majority of patients still die from their melanoma, despite improvements in therapy. Therefore, enrollment in a clinical trial is always an important consideration, even for previously untreated patients. Most patients with stage IV disease will eventually progress despite advances in therapy, and many, because of disease burden, poor performance status, or concomitant illness, will be unsuitable for therapy. Therefore, a major focus of care should be the timely integration of palliative care and hospice. Skin examination and surveillance at least once a year are recommended for all patients with melanoma. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for patients with stage IA\u2013IIA"

The most common life-threatening dermatologic disease; incidence has been increasing throughout the world. Risk factors include short, intense bursts of sun exposure (especially in childhood and with intermittent exposure) and the presence of congenital melanocytic nevi, an \u2191 number of nevi, or dysplastic nevi. Immunosuppression also \u2191 risk. Some patients inherit a predisposition to melanoma with the familial atypical mole and melanoma (FAM-M) syndrome. There are several subtypes (see Table 2.2-4). Malignant melanomas usually begin in the epidermal basal layer, where melanocytes are normally found. The first growth phase is horizontal-intraepidermal, presenting with a lesion that is \ufb02at but increasing in diameter (typical of lentigo maligna or melanoma in situ). Later, there is a vertical growth phase with dermal invasion."
