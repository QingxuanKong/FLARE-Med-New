The Philadelphia chromosome is a cytogenetic abnormality that is characteristic of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It is described as a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. According to Document [0] (Title: Pathology_Robbins), this translocation results in the fusion of portions of the BCR gene on chromosome 22 and the ABL gene on chromosome 9, creating a novel tyrosine kinase with potent transforming activity. This indicates that the Philadelphia chromosome is not a fusion between parts of chromosomes 1 and 9, but rather between chromosomes 9 and 22. Therefore, the correct answer is not A. Additionally, Document [23] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) explicitly states that the Philadelphia chromosome is generated by a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, which further supports this conclusion. So, the answer is not A. The Philadelphia chromosome is not a fusion between parts of chromosomes 1 and 9, but rather a specific translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

First line treatment is imatinib, which blocks tyrosine kinase activity. C. Splenomegaly is common. Enlarging spleen suggests progression to accelerated phase of disease; transformation to acute leukemia usually follows shortly thereafter. 1. Can transform to AML (2/3 of cases) or ALL (1/3 of cases) since mutation is in a pluripotent stem cell. D. CML is distinguished from a leukemoid reaction (reactive neutrophilic leukocytosis) by 1. Negative leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) stain (granulocytes in a leukemoid reaction are LAP positive) 2. Increased basophils (absent with leukemoid reaction) 3. III. POLYCYTHEMIA VERA (PV)"

            "content": "Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) arises from a chromosomally abnormal hematopoietic stem cell in which a balanced translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9:22), is observed in 90\u201395% of cases. This translocation results in constitutive expression of the Bcr-Abl fusion oncoprotein with a molecular weight of 210 kDa. The clinical symptoms and course are related to the white blood cell count and its rate of increase. Most patients with white cell counts greater than 50,000/\u03bcL should be treated. The goals of treatment are to reduce the granulocytes to normal levels, to raise the hemoglobin concentration to normal, and to relieve disease-related symptoms. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is considered as standard first-line therapy in previously untreated patients with chronic phase CML. Nearly all patients treated with imatinib exhibit a complete hematologic response, and up to 40\u201350% of patients show a complete cytogenetic response. As described previously,"

To obtain an image of all of the chromo-somes, a mixture of different probes is used to produce dif-ferent colors in each chromosome. Karyotypes labeled by this method allow cytogeneticists to perform a comprehen-sive analysis of changes in the number of chromosomes and chromosomal abnormalities such as additions or dele-tions. The paired chromosomes are numbered in the kary-otype, and the male sex is indicated by the presence of chromosomes X and Y (see Fig. F3.1.1a). The white box inset in Figure F3.1.1a shows the XX chromosome pair as it appears in the female. Sometimes, part of a chromosome will break off and at-tach to another chromosome. When this happens, it is re-ferred to as a translocation. Note that the red box inset in Figure F3.1.1a shows a translocation between chromo-some 8 and 14 (t8;14). It is clearly visible on this color image that"

Imatinib is an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase domain of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein and prevents phosphorylation of the kinase substrate by ATP. It is indicated for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by the t(9:22) Philadelphia chromosomal translocation. This translocation results in the Bcr-Abl fusion protein, the causative agent in CML, and is present in up to 95% of patients with this disease. This agent also inhibits other receptor tyrosine kinases for platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and c-kit."
