The documents do not provide direct information about SATB1 regulating RAG1 and RAG2 genes. However, we can infer that SATB1 is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression in various contexts. Given that RAG1 and RAG2 are essential for V(D)J recombination, it is possible that other transcription factors or regulatory elements may be involved in their expression. Let's look for any indirect connections between SATB1 and RAG1/RAG2. One possible connection is that SATB1 is involved in the regulation of gene expression in T-cells, and RAG1 and RAG2 are essential for T-cell development and function. However, there is no clear evidence in the provided documents that SATB1 directly regulates RAG1 and RAG2 genes. Therefore, based on the available information, the most accurate answer is that SATB1 does not regulate the RAG1 and RAG2 genes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The lymphoid-specific components of the recombinase are called RAG-1 and RAG-2, and they are encoded by two recombination-activating genes, RAG1 and RAG2. This pair of genes is essential for V(D)J recombination, and they are expressed in developing lymphocytes only while the lymphocytes are engaged in assembling their antigen receptors, as described in more detail in Chapter 8. Indeed, the RAG genes expressed together can confer on nonlymphoid cells such as fibroblasts the capacity to rearrange exogenous segments of DNA containing the appropriate RSSs; this is how RAG-1 and RAG-2 were initially discovered."

Because the effects of RAG deficiencies are limited to lymphocytes that undergo antigen gene rearrangement, NKcell development is not impaired. There are other children with hypomorphic mutations (which cause reduced, but not absent, function) in either RAG1 or RAG2 who can make a small amount of functional RAG protein, allowing limited V(D)J recombination.

Initially, a complex of RAG-1 and RAG-2 proteins, together with high-mobility group chromatin protein HMGB1 or HMGB2, recognizes and aligns the two RSSs that are the target of the cleavage reaction. RAG-1 operates as a dimer, with RAG-2 acting as a cofactor (Fig. 5.9). RAG-1 specifically recognizes and binds the heptamer and the nonamer of the RSS and contains the Zn2+-dependent endonuclease activity of the RAG protein complex. As a dimer, RAG-1 seems to align the two RSSs that will undergo rearrangement. Recent models suggest that the 12/23 rule may be established because an essential asymmetric orientation of the RAG-1:RAG-2 complex induces a preference for binding to RSS elements of different types (Fig. 5.10). The bound RAG complex makes a single-strand DNA break at the nucleotide just 5\u02b9 of the heptamer of the RSS, thus creating a free 3\u02b9-OH group at the end of the"

First, it reduces V(D)J recombinase activity by directly reducing the expression of the RAG-1 and RAG-2 genes. Second, it further reduces levels of RAG-2 by indirectly causing this protein to be targeted for degradation, which occurs when RAG-2 is phosphorylated in response to the entry of the pro-B cell into S phase (the DNA synthesis phase) of the cell cycle. Finally, preB-cell receptor signaling reduces access of the heavy-chain locus to the recombinase machinery, although the precise details of this are not clear. At a later stage of B-cell development, RAG proteins will again be expressed in order to carry out light-chain locus rearrangement, but at that point the heavy-chain locus does not undergo further rearrangement.

As discussed earlier, adaptive immunity relies on the ability of B cells and T cells to diversify their antigen receptor genes. Immature B cells and T progenitors both express a pair of gene products, RAG1 and RAG2, that carry out V(D)J segment recombination, permitting the assembly of functional immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes. In addition, after encountering antigen, mature B cells express a specialized enzyme called activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID), which catalyzes both immunoglobulin gene class switch recombination and immunoglobulin diversification through somatic hypermutation. Errors that occur during antigen receptor gene assembly and immunoglobulin gene class switching and diversification provide fertile soil for many of the mutations that cause lymphoid neoplasms, discussed in detail in Chapter 12."

First, Notch signaling induces the expression of two transcription factors, T-cell factor-1 (TCF1) and GATA3, each of which is required for T-cell development. Together, TCF1 and GATA3 initiate expression of several T-lineage-specific genes, such as those encoding components of the CD3 complex, as well as Rag1, a gene required for T-cell receptor and B-cell receptor gene rearrangements (see Fig. 8.18). However, TCF1 and GATA3 are not sufficient to induce the entire program of T-cell-specific gene expression. A third transcription factor, Bcl11b, is required to induce T-lineage commitment by restricting progenitor cells from adopting alternative fates; this final phase of T-cell commitment is a necessary prerequisite for activating the complete T-cell gene expression program."

            "content": "Left panel: This cartoon of the structure shown in Fig 5.9 illustrates the flexibility of the hinge connecting the NBD to the catalytic domain of RAG-1. Right panel: the NBD domain of RAG-1 interacts with the RSS nonamer sequence (blue), while the RSS heptamer sequence (red) is bound to the portion of RAG-1 that contains the Zn2+ endonuclease activity. In this cartoon model, the interaction of a 12-bp RSS with one of the RAG-1 subunits induces the NBD domain to rotate toward the catalytic domain of RAG-1, to accommodate the length of the RSS. Since the two NBD domains are coupled by domain swaps, this induced conformation pulls the other NBD away from its RAG-1 subunit, which then prefers binding of the 23-bp RSS. The endonucleolytic cleavage (arrows) of the DNA by RAG-1 occurs precisely at the junction between the heptamer and the respective V, D, or J gene segment."

B. Fruitflies and mosquitoes exhibit diversity in the secreted Dscam protein by alternative splicing of a vast array of different exons, while freshwater snails exhibit diversity in FREP genes by differential accumulation of genomic mutations in these genes. C. Jawless fish recombine VLR genes during DNA replication to engender diversity in these genes, which are expressed on lymphocytes and have GPI-anchored and secreted forms. D. RAG-1 arose from transposases while the RSSs it recognizes arose from terminal repeats from DNA transposons. E. MHC class I and class II genes arose before T cells and immunoglobulins in cartilaginous fish. General references."

For example, during the _________ stage, Rag-1 and Rag-2 expression is induced by __________, which permits the successful D to J rearrangement and then V to DJ rearrangement of the heavy-chain locus. As a consequence, a functional __________ is expressed, and upon signaling, the cell is instructed to perform _________ and progress toward the next developmental step and rearrange the light-chain locus. 8.3 True or False: Self antigen recognition is needed in order to cross-link the pre-B-cell receptor, which in turn allows this complex to signal and permit the transition from pro-B cell to pre-B cell."
