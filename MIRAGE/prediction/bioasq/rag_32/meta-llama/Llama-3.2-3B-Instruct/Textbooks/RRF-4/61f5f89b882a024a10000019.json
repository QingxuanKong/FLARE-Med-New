However, none of the provided documents mention Ozanimod specifically. The documents do, however, discuss other medications and treatments for Ulcerative Colitis, such as aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologics. We can infer that Ozanimod is not mentioned in the documents, but we can also note that the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis involves a range of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Given the lack of information about Ozanimod, we cannot definitively say whether it is effective for Ulcerative Colitis or not. However, based on the general information provided in the documents, we can conclude that Ozanimod is not mentioned as a treatment for Ulcerative Colitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Although ulcer-ative colitis and Crohn\u2019s colitis share many pathologic and clinical similarities, these conditions can be differentiated in 85% of patients. Ulcerative colitis is a mucosal process in which the colonic mucosa and submucosa are infiltrated with inflammatory cells. The mucosa may be atrophic, and crypt abscesses are common. Endoscopically, the mucosa is fre-quently friable and may possess multiple inflammatory pseu-dopolyps. In long-standing ulcerative colitis, the colon may be foreshortened and the"

The oral controlled-release budesonide (9 mg/d) formulations described above are used in the treatment of mild to moderate Crohn\u2019s disease involving the ileum and proximal colon (Entocort) and ulcerative colitis (Uceris). They are slightly less effective than prednisolone in achieving clinical remission but have significantly less adverse systemic effects. Corticosteroids are not useful for maintaining disease remission. Other medications such as aminosalicylates or immunosuppressive agents should be used for this purpose. Oral controlled-release budesonide formulations are metabolized extensively in the liver by CYP3A4.

The effectiveness of 5-ASA therapy depends in part on achieving high drug concentration at the site of active disease. Thus, 5-ASA suppositories or enemas are useful in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s disease confined to the rectum (proctitis) or distal colon (proctosigmoiditis). In patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s colitis that extends to the proximal colon, both the azo compounds and mesalamine formulations are useful.

Ulcerative coli-tis incidence peaks during the third decade of life and again in the seventh decade of life. The incidence of Crohn\u2019s disease is slightly lower, 1 to 5 people per 100,000. Crohn\u2019s disease also affects Northern European and Caucasian populations dispro-portionately. Crohn\u2019s disease has a similar bimodal incidence, with most cases occurring between ages 15 to 30 years and ages 60 to 70 years.38 In 15% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, differentiation between ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s colitis is impossible; these patients are classified as having indeterminate colitis.Etiology. Inflammatory bowel disease is a multifactorial con-dition that includes environmental, genetic, and immune causal elements; the variation in disease distributions and severity, as well as the differential responses to medical therapy, reflect a complex pathophysiology that is not"

            "content": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic condition resulting from complex interactions between intestinal microbiota and host immunity in genetically predisposed individuals resulting an inappropriate mucosal immune activation. IBD encompasses two entities, Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. The distinction between ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease is based, in large part, on the distribution of affected sites and the morphologic expression of disease at those sites ( Fig. 15.26 Table 15.5 ). Ulcerative colitis is limited to the colon and rectum and extends only into the mucosa and submucosa. By contrast, Crohn disease, also referred to as regional enteritis (because of frequent ileal involvement), may involve any area of the gastrointestinal tract and is frequently transmural."

Corti-costeroid enemas provide effective local therapy for proctitis and proctosigmoiditis and have fewer side effects than systemic corticosteroids.Immunomodulating Agents Azathioprine and 6-mercatopu-rine (6-MP) are antimetabolite drugs that interfere with nucleic acid synthesis and thus decrease proliferation of inflammatory cells. These agents are useful for treating ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease in patients who have failed salicylate therapy or who are dependent on, or refractory to, corticosteroids. It is important to note, however, that the onset of action of these drugs takes 6 to 12 weeks, and concomitant use of corticoste-roids almost always is required.Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive agent that inter-feres with T-lymphocyte function.

In most clinical trials, the frequency of drug adverse events is similar to that in patients treated with placebo. For unclear reasons, olsalazine may stimulate a secretory diarrhea\u2014which should not be confused with active IBD\u2014in 10% of patients. Rare hypersensitivity reactions may occur with all aminosalicylates but are much less common than with sulfasalazine. Careful studies have documented subtle changes indicative of renal tubular damage in patients receiving high doses of aminosalicylates. Rare cases of interstitial nephritis are reported, particularly in association with high doses of mesalamine formulations; this may be attributable to the higher serum 5-ASA levels attained with these drugs. Sulfasalazine and other aminosalicylates rarely cause worsening of colitis, which may be misinterpreted as refractory colitis."

While mucosal biopsy is often diagnostic in the chronic phase of ulcerative colitis, biopsy in the acute phase will often reveal only nonspecific inflammation. Evaluation with colonoscopy or barium enema during an acute flare is contraindicated because of the risk of perforation.Barium enema has been used to diagnose chronic ulcer-ative colitis and to determine the extent of disease. However, this modality is less sensitive than colonoscopy and may not detect early disease. In long-standing ulcerative colitis, the colon is foreshortened and lacks haustral markings (\u201clead pipe\u201d colon). Because the inflammation in ulcerative colitis is purely mucosal, strictures are highly uncommon. Any stricture diag-nosed in a patient with ulcerative colitis must be presumed to be malignant until proven otherwise.Indications for Surgery. Indications for surgery in ulcer-ative colitis may be emergent or elective. Emergency surgery is"

Thus, complaints may include lower-right-sided cramping abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, lowgrade fever, and obstructive symptoms. The disease is chronic with exacerbations and remissions, and importantly, it cannot be cured medically or surgically. Approximately a third of patients require surgery within the first year ater diagnosis, and thereater, 5 percent per year. Reactive arthritis is common, and the gastrointestinal cancer risk, although not as great as. with ulcerative colitis, is increased substantially. FIGURE 54-2 Causes of colitis.

In general, mild to moderate flares may be treated in the outpatient setting. More severe signs and symptoms mandate hospitaliza-tion. Pancolitis generally requires more aggressive therapy than limited disease. Because ulcerative proctitis and proctosigmoid-itis are limited to the distal large intestine, topical therapy with salicylate and/or corticosteroid suppositories and enemas can be extremely effective. Systemic therapy is rarely required in these patients.Salicylates Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), 5-acetyl salicylic acid (5-ASA), and related compounds are first-line agents in the medical treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory bowel dis-ease. These compounds decrease inflammation by inhibition of cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase in the gut mucosa. They require direct contact with affected"
