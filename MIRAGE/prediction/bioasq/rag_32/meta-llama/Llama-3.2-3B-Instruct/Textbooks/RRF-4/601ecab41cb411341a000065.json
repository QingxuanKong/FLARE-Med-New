This would allow practitioners to further classify patients as being at higher or lower risk within clinical subgroups and to identify patients who may benefit most from adjuvant therapy.

These changes not only have been shown to provide biologic insights into leukemogenic mechanisms, but also independent prognostic information.

After surgical resection, the 5-year survival rate for early gastric cancer can exceed 90%, even if lymph node metastases are present.

This is changing slowly with individualized therapies. For example, patients whose tumors over-express the epidermal growth factor receptor HER2 benefit from agents that inhibit HER2 signaling.
