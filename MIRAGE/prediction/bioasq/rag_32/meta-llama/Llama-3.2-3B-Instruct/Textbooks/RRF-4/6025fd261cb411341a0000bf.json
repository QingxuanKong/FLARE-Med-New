    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the information provided in the documents. According to Document [9], isradipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker used to lower blood pressure. It is mentioned that verapamil, diltiazem, and other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (such as isradipine) are equally effective in lowering blood pressure. However, there is no specific information about its effectiveness for Parkinson's disease. We need to look for any mention of its use in treating Parkinson's disease. In Document [20], it is stated that Parkinsonism is characterized by a combination of rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor, and postural instability, and that the disease is incurable and generally progressive. However, it does not mention the use of isradipine as a treatment for Parkinson's disease. In Document [26], it is mentioned that dopamine agonists, such as pramipexole, are effective in treating Parkinson's disease, but there is no mention of isradipine. In Document [28], it is stated that dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine, are used to treat Parkinson's disease, but it does not mention isradipine. Based on the information provided, there is no clear evidence to suggest that isradipine is effective for Parkinson's disease. In fact, the only relevant document that mentions calcium channel blockers is Document [9], which states that they are used to lower blood pressure, not to treat Parkinson's disease. Therefore, the most likely answer is that isradipine is not effective for Parkinson's disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

As discussed earlier, several sites are implicated in the familial forms of Parkinson disease, some related to the gene that codes for synuclein, the main component of the Lewy body. Although there is no current treatment that clearly halts or reverses the neuronal degeneration underlying Parkinson disease, methods are now available that afford considerable relief from symptoms. Treatment can be medical or surgical, although reliance is placed mainly on drugs, particularly on l-dopa (Table 38-4). The following sections are necessarily detailed so as to give the clinician a full comprehension of the use and side effects and interactions of these drugs."

Confusion and outright psychosis (hallucinations and delusions) are seen in advanced cases of Parkinson disease when high doses of l-dopa are required and the disease has been present for many years. This may first be treated by reducing the dose of the drug. If this is not tolerated, the atypical neuroleptics olanzapine, clozapine, risperidone, or quetiapine may be given in low doses. The side effects of these drugs include sleepiness, orthostatic hypotension, and sialorrhea. As noted above, clozapine has been said to provide an additional benefit of suppressing dyskinesias in advanced Parkinson disease, but its hematologic risks have led to limited use.

Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of the main drugs used in the treatment of Parkinson disease are understandable in the context of neurotransmitter function. To correct the basic dopamine deficiency from a loss of nigral cells that underlies Parkinson disease, attempts were at first made to administer dopamine directly. However, dopamine as such cannot cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and therefore has no therapeutic effect. But its immediate precursor, L-dopa, does cross the blood\u2013barrier and is effective in decreasing the symptoms of Parkinson disease as well as of the above-described MPTP-induced parkinsonism. This effect is enhanced by the addition of an inhibitor of dopadecarboxylase, an important enzyme in the catabolism of dopamine. The addition of an enzyme"

They have found a place both as the initial treatment, replacing l-dopa in this role, and in modulating the effects of l-dopa later in the illness. However, dopamine agonists are less potent than l-dopa in managing the main features of Parkinson disease and, in higher doses and in older individuals, they produce undesirable motor and cognitive side effects (see further on). They are favored because they are associated with fewer dyskinetic motor complications, or at least, delay the need for l-dopa and its dyskinetic effects. Bromocriptine and lisuride are synthetic ergot derivatives whose action in Parkinson disease is explained by their direct stimulating effect on dopamine (D2) receptors located on striate neurons.

Parkinsonian tremor is often associated with an additional tremor of faster frequency; the latter is of essential type and responds better to beta-blocking drugs than to anti-Parkinson medications. Stereotactic lesions or electrical stimulation in the basal ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus diminishes or abolishes tremor contralaterally; other stimulation sites such as the internal segment of the globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus are also effective but possibly to a lesser degree.

Moreover, the benefits of levodopa therapy often diminish as the disease advances, and serious adverse effects may complicate longterm levodopa treatment. Nevertheless, dopaminergic therapy at a relatively early stage may be most effective in alleviating motor symptoms of parkinsonism and may also favorably affect the mortality rate due to the disease. Therefore, several strategies have evolved for optimizing dopaminergic therapy, as summarized in Figure 28\u20135. Symptomatic treatment of mild parkinsonism is probably best avoided until there is some degree of disability or functional limitation or until symptoms begin to impact the patient\u2019s lifestyle or cause significant social impairment."

In addition to their antianginal (see Chapter 12) and antiarrhythmic effects (see Chapter 14), calcium channel blockers also reduce peripheral resistance and blood pressure. The mechanism of action in hypertension (and, in part, in angina) is inhibition of calcium influx into arterial smooth muscle cells. Verapamil, diltiazem, and the dihydropyridine family (amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nisoldipine, and nitrendipine [withdrawn in the USA]) are all equally effective in lowering blood pressure, and many formulations are currently approved for this use in the USA.

As discussed in Chapter 28, parkinsonian tremor and rigidity seem to result from a relative excess of cholinergic activity because of a deficiency of dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia-striatum system. The combination of an antimuscarinic agent with a dopamine precursor drug (levodopa) can sometimes provide more effective therapy than either drug alone.

The drug has an interesting history that includes many early trials that failed to persuade neurologists of its effectiveness; Barbeau\u2019s paper on this historical subject may be consulted by the interested reader. Most patients tolerate the drug initially, experiencing few serious adverse effects and showing various degrees of improvement, sometimes dramatic, especially in hypokinesia and tremor after several days or sooner.

An alternative but complementary approach has been to restore the normal balance of cholinergic and dopaminergic influences on the basal ganglia with antimuscarinic drugs. The pathophysiologic basis for these therapies is that in idiopathic parkinsonism, there is a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra that normally inhibit the output of GABAergic cells in the corpus striatum (Figure 28\u20132). Drugs that induce parkinsonian syndromes either are dopamine receptor antagonists (eg, antipsychotic agents; see Chapter 29) or lead to the destruction of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons (eg, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine [MPTP]; see below).

It too has been widely used for parkinsonism but is no longer available in the United States because its use has been associated with the development of valvular heart disease. It is nevertheless still used in some countries."

Various other neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine, are also depleted in the brain in parkinsonism, but these deficiencies are of uncertain clinical relevance."

            "content": "Rasagiline, another monoamine oxidase B inhibitor, is more potent than selegiline in preventing MPTP-induced parkinsonism and is being used for early treatment in patients with mild symptoms. The standard dosage is 1 mg/d. Rasagiline is also used as adjunctive therapy at a dosage of 0.5 or 1 mg/d to prolong the effects of carbidopa-levodopa in patients with advanced disease and response fluctuations. A large double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-start study (the ADAGIO trial) to evaluate whether it had neuroprotective benefit (ie, slowed the disease course) yielded unclear results: a daily dose of 1 mg met all the end points of the study and did seem to slow disease progression, but a 2-mg dose failed to do so. These findings are difficult to explain and the decision to use rasagiline for neuroprotective purposes therefore remains an individual one."
