    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the available information step by step.\\n\\nFirst, we need to understand what multipotent adult progenitor cells are. These cells have the ability to differentiate into multiple cell types, which makes them potentially useful for repairing damaged tissues.\\n\\nNext, we need to look at the context of stroke treatment. Stroke is a condition where the blood supply to the brain is interrupted, leading to tissue damage.\\n\\nNow, let's examine the potential of multipotent adult progenitor cells in treating stroke.\\n\\nDocument [3] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) suggests that studies of cardiac stem and progenitor cells suggest that progressive lineage restriction results in the gradual and stepwise determination of mature cell fates within the heart. This implies that multipotent cells may have the potential to repair damaged heart tissue, which is similar to the concept of using multipotent adult progenitor cells for stroke treatment.\\n\\nDocument [22] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) also mentions that multipotent vascular stem cells resident in vessel walls may give rise to the smooth-muscle cells that accumulate in injured or atheromatous arteries. This suggests that multipotent cells may be involved in vascular repair, which is relevant to stroke treatment.\\n\\nDocument [28] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) discusses three different therapeutic concepts for cell replacement, including the direct administration of stem cells. This implies that multipotent adult progenitor cells may be effective for treating stroke.\\n\\nHowever, it's also important to consider the limitations and challenges of using multipotent adult progenitor cells for stroke treatment.\\n\\nDocument [30] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) highlights the need for rigorous validation and criteria to establish tissue stem cell plasticity. This suggests that the effectiveness of multipotent adult progenitor cells for stroke treatment needs to be further studied and validated.\\n\\nIn conclusion, based on the available information, it appears that multipotent adult progenitor cells may have the potential to be effective for the treatment of stroke, but more research and validation are needed to confirm their effectiveness.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is A. yes, multipotent adult progenitor cells may be effective for treatment of stroke, but with the need for further research and validation.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Human ES or iPS cells can be induced to generate cells with the properties of neural stem cells, and these cells in turn give rise to neurons, oligodendroglia, and astrocytes. Reasonably large numbers of these cells can be transplanted into the rodent brain with formation of appropriate cell types and no tumor formation. Multipotent stem cells present in the adult brain also can be easily amplified in number and used to generate all the major neural cell types, but the need for invasive procedures to obtain autologous cells is a major limitation.

These concepts have been challenged by the finding that neural progenitor or stem cells exist in the adult CNS that are capable of differentiation, migration over long distances, and extensive axonal arborization and synapse formation with appropriate targets. These capabilities also indicate that the repertoire of factors required for growth, survival, differentiation, and migration of these cells exists in the mature nervous system. In rodents, neural stem cells, defined as progenitor cells capable of differentiating into mature cells of neural or glial lineage, have been experimentally propagated from fetal CNS and neuroectodermal tissues and also from adult germinal matrix and ependyma regions. Human fetal CNS tissue is also capable of differentiation into cells with neuronal, astrocyte, and oligodendrocyte morphology when cultured in the presence of growth factors."

In the adult, hematopoietic stem cells are found mainly in bone marrow, and they depend on signals from the marrow stromal (connective-tissue) cells to maintain their stem-cell character. The stem cells are few and far between, and they normally divide infrequently to produce more stem cells (self-renewal) and various committed progenitor cells (transit amplifying cells), each able to give rise to only one or a few types of blood cells. The committed progenitor cells divide extensively under the influence of various protein signal molecules (colony-stimulating factors, or CSFs) and then terminally differentiate into mature blood cells, which usually die after several days or weeks."

Alternatively, stem cells may be injected systemically since they have the capacity to home in on damaged tissues by following gradients of cytokines and chemokines released by the diseased organ. A second approach involves transplantation of differentiated cells derived from stem cells. For example, pancreatic islet cells can be generated from stem cells before transplantation into diabetic patients, 90e-1 and cardiomyocytes can be generated to treat ischemic heart disease.

            "content": "While anticoagulation is established as a treatment for primary and secondary prevention of embolic strokes with atrial fibrillation, the situation with other strokes, including those presumed to be embolic strokes, is not clear (called \u201cembolic stroke of uncertain source\u201d). For example, a trial conducted by Hart and colleagues (2018) showed that rivaroxaban was not more effective than aspirin for the prevention of a second stroke after a stroke that was presumed to be embolic, but not due to atrial fibrillation or extracranial vascular disease."
