    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the information provided in the documents about the characteristics and behavior of mitochondria. According to Document [5], mitochondria are inherited exclusively from the mother, as stated in Document [25]. This implies that mitochondria are not shared between cells, but are instead passed down from mother to daughter cells. However, Document [31] describes a process called mitotic segregation, where a small sample of mitochondrial DNA can be passed from the mother cell to the bud of the daughter cell, resulting in a distinct form of inheritance called non-Mendelian, or cytoplasmic inheritance. This suggests that while the majority of the mitochondrial DNA may be unique to each cell, there is some degree of mitochondrial DNA transfer between cells. However, this transfer is not a deliberate process, but rather a result of the random distribution of mitochondrial DNA during cell division. Therefore, the correct answer is not a straightforward yes or no, but rather a nuanced understanding of the complex process of mitochondrial inheritance. However, based on the information provided, we can conclude that mitochondria can transfer some degree of mitochondrial DNA from cell to cell, albeit in a random and non-deliberate manner.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

            "content": "The main role of mitochondrial fusion in cellular physiology is most likely to ensure an even distribution of mitochondrial DNA throughout the mitochondrial reticulum, and to prevent the accumulation of damaged DNA in one part of the network. When the fusion machinery is defective, DNA is lost from a subset of the mitochondria in the cell. Loss of mitochondrial DNA leads to a loss of respiratory-chain function, and it can cause disease. All of the considerations just discussed have suggested to some scientists that changes in our mitochondria are major contributors to human aging. However, there are many other processes that tend to go wrong as cells and tissues age, as one might expect given the incredible complexity of human cell biology. Despite intensive research, the issue remains unresolved. Why Do Mitochondria and Chloroplasts Maintain a Costly Separate System for DNa transcription and translation?"

As stated at the beginning of this chapter, mitochondria, chloroplasts, archaea, and bacteria use very similar chemiosmotic mechanisms. In fact, these mechanisms underlie the function of all living organisms\u2014including anaerobes that derive all their energy from electron transfers between two inorganic molecules, as we shall see later.

            "content": "The nature of the organelle genes located in the nucleus of the cell demonstrates that an extensive transfer of genes from organelle to nuclear DNA has occurred in the course of eukaryotic evolution. Such successful gene transfer is expected to be rare, because any gene moved from the organelle needs to adapt to both nuclear transcription and cytoplasmic translation requirements. In addition, the protein needs to acquire a signal sequence that directs it to the correct organelle after its synthesis in the cytosol. By comparing the genes in the mitochondria from different organisms, we can infer that some of the gene transfers to the nucleus occurred relatively recently. The smallest and presumably most highly evolved mitochondrial genomes, for example, encode only a few hydrophobic inner-membrane proteins of the electron-transport chain, plus ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and transfer RNAs (tRNAs). Other mitochondrial genomes that have remained more complex tend to contain this same subset"

Cells need a constant supply of the electron acceptor NAD+ for the central reaction in glycolysis that converts glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (see Figure 2\u201348). This NAD+ is converted to NADH in the process, and the NAD+ needs to be regenerated by transferring the high-energy NADH electrons somewhere. The NADH electrons will eventually be used to help drive oxidative phosphorylation inside the mitochondrion. But the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH. The electrons are therefore passed from the NADH to smaller molecules in the cytosol that can move through the inner mitochondrial membrane. Once in the matrix, these smaller molecules transfer their electrons to NAD+ to form mitochondrial NADH, after which they are returned to the cytosol for recharging\u2014creating a so-called shuttle system for the NADH electrons."

Mitochondria and plastids, however, do not belong to this system, and they therefore require different mechanisms to import proteins and lipids for growth. We have already seen that they import most of their proteins from the cytosol. Although mitochondria modify some of the lipids they import, they do not synthesize lipids de novo; instead, their lipids have to be imported from the ER, either directly or indirectly by way of other cell membranes.

Mitochondria are often associated with the microtubular cytoskeleton (Figure 14\u20135), which determines their orientation and distribution in different cell types. Thus, in highly polarized cells such as neurons, mitochondria can move long distances (up to a meter or more in the extended axons of neurons), being propelled along the tracks of the microtubular cytoskeleton. In other cells, mitochondria remain fixed at points of high energy demand; for example, in skeletal or cardiac muscle cells, they pack between myofibrils, and in sperm cells they wrap tightly around the flagellum (Figure 14\u20136)."

            "content": "The ribosomes of chloroplasts closely resemble bacterial ribosomes, while the origin of mitochondrial ribosomes is more difficult to trace. Extensive protein similarities, however, suggest that both organelles originated when a primitive eukaryotic cell entered into a stable endosymbiotic relationship with a bacterium. Although some of the genes of these former bacteria still function to make organelle proteins and RNA, most of them have been transferred into the nuclear genome, where they encode bacteria-like enzymes that are synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes and then imported into the organelle. The mitochondrial DNA replication and DNA repair processes are substantially less effective than the corresponding processes in the cell nucleus. Damage therefore accumulates in the genome of mitochondria over time; this damage may be a substantial contributor to the aging of cells and organisms, and it can cause serious diseases. Which statements are true? Explain why or why not."

            "content": "The mitochondrion performs most cellular oxidations and produces the bulk of the animal cell\u2019s ATP. A mitochondrion has two separate membranes: the outer membrane and the inner membrane. The inner membrane surrounds the innermost space (the matrix) of the mitochondrion and forms the cristae, which project into the matrix. The matrix and the inner membrane cristae are the major working parts of the mitochondrion. The membranes that form cristae account for a major part of the membrane surface area in most cells, and they contain the mitochondrion\u2019s electron-transport chain (the respiratory chain)."

            "content": "Organelle Genes are Maternally Inherited in animals and plants In Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker\u2019s yeast), when two haploid cells mate, they are equal in size and contribute equal amounts of mitochondrial DNA to the diploid zygote. Mitochondrial inheritance in yeasts is therefore biparental: both parents contribute equally to the mitochondrial gene pool of the progeny. However, during the course of the subsequent asexual, vegetative growth, the mitochondria become distributed more or less randomly to daughter cells. After a few generations, the mitochondria of any given cell contain only the DNA from one or the other parent cell, because only a small sample of the mitochondrial DNA passes from the mother cell to the bud of the daughter cell. This process is known as mitotic segregation, and it gives rise to a distinct form of inheritance that is called non-Mendelian, or cytoplasmic inheritance, in contrast to the Mendelian inheritance of nuclear genes."
