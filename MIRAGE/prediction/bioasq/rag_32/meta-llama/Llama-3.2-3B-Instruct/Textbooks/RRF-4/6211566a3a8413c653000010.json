    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the question: Step 1: Review the relevant documents to find information about CPX-351. Step 2: After reviewing the documents, we find that CPX-351 is a drug that has been approved by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Step 3: The relevant documents do not provide detailed information about the approval process, but they do mention that CPX-351 is a CD33-targeting antibody-drug conjugate that has been shown to be effective in treating AML. Step 4: Based on the information available, it appears that CPX-351 has been approved by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of AML. Step 5: Therefore, the correct answer is A. yes. Here's the output in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The relevant documents indicate that CPX-351 has been approved by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The application contains, often in hundreds of volumes, full reports of all preclinical and clinical data pertaining to the drug under review. The number of subjects studied in support of the new drug application has been increasing and currently averages more than 5000 patients for new drugs of novel structure (new molecular entities). The duration of the FDA review leading to approval (or denial) of the new drug application may vary from months to years. If problems arise, eg, unexpected but possibly serious toxicities, additional studies may be required and the approval process may extend to several additional years."

The sample size required to disclose drug-induced events or toxicities is very large for such rare events. For example, several hundred thousand patients may have to be exposed before the first case is observed of a toxicity that occurs with an average incidence of 1 in 10,000. Therefore, low-incidence drug effects are not generally detected before phase 4 no matter how carefully phase 1, 2, and 3 studies are executed. Phase 4 has no fixed duration.
