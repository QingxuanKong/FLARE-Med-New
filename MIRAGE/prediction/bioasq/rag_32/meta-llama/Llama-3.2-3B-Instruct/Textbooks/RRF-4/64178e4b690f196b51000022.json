Golodirsen is an antisense oligonucleotide that targets the CTG pre-mRNA expansion in the dystrophin gene, which is a common mutation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The question of whether golodirsen is effective for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy requires evaluating the available clinical trial data and research findings. As of my knowledge cutoff, golodirsen has shown promising results in clinical trials, with a significant increase in dystrophin levels and improved muscle function in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, the long-term efficacy and safety of golodirsen are still being evaluated. Therefore, the answer to whether golodirsen is effective for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy depends on the latest clinical trial data and expert opinions.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Some patients cannot tolerate glucocorticoid therapy; weight gain and increased risk of fractures in particular represent a significant deterrent for some boys. As in other recessively inherited dystrophies presumed to arise from loss of function of a critical muscle gene, there is optimism that Duchenne disease may benefit from novel therapies that either replace the defective gene or missing protein or implement downstream corrections (e.g., skipping mutated exons or reading through mutations that introduce stop codons). This less severe form of X-linked recessive muscular dystrophy results from allelic defects of the same gene responsible for Duchenne dystrophy. Becker muscular dystrophy is ~10 times less frequent than Duchenne."

One is the injection of human myoblasts, stem cells, or satellite cells that contain a full complement of dystrophin and other structural elements into the muscles of patients with muscular dystrophy. The preclinical aspects of this strategy have been summarized by Blau and are being slowly implemented in patients. There is an analogous effort to use the technology of viral-mediated gene delivery to allow gene and protein replacement in the recessively inherited dystrophies. The difficulties of injecting every dystrophic muscle are obvious."

Treatment of the Muscular Dystrophies There has, until recently, been no specific treatment for any of the muscular dystrophies. The physician is forced to stand by and witness the unrelenting progression of weakness and wasting. The various vitamins, amino acids, testosterone, and drugs, such as penicillamine, recommended in the past, have all proved to be ineffective. The administration of prednisone appears to slightly retard the tempo of progression of Duchenne dystrophy for a period of up to 3 years (Fenichel et al). The optimal dose is 0.75 mg/kg given daily, but it must often be reduced because of intolerable side effects (weight gain, behavioral and gastrointestinal disorders)."

Genetic testing reveals deletions or duplications of the dystrophin gene in 65% of patients with Becker dystrophy, approximately the same percentage as in Duchenne dystrophy. In both Becker and Duchenne dystrophies, the size of the DNA deletion does not predict clinical severity; however, in ~95% of patients with Becker dystrophy, the DNA deletion does not alter the translational reading frame of messenger RNA.

            "content": "Laboratory Features Serum CK levels are invariably elevated to between 20 and 100 times normal. The levels are abnormal at birth but decline late in the disease because of inactivity and loss of muscle mass. EMG demonstrates features typical of myopathy. The muscle biopsy shows muscle fibers of varying size as well as small groups of necrotic and regenerating fibers. Connective tissue and fat replace lost muscle fibers. A definitive diagnosis of Duchenne dystrophy can be established on the basis of dystrophin deficiency in a biopsy of muscle tissue or mutation analysis on peripheral blood leukocytes, as discussed below."

            "content": "The differentiation of dystrophic diseases of muscle from those secondary to neuronal degeneration was an achievement of neurologists of the second half of the nineteenth century. Isolated cases of muscular dystrophy had been described earlier, but no distinction was made between neuropathic and myopathic disease. In 1855, Duchenne described the progressive muscular atrophy of childhood that now bears his name. However, it was not until the second edition of his monograph in 1861 that the \u201chypertrophic paraplegia of infancy\u201d was recognized as a distinct syndrome. By 1868, he was able to write a comprehensive description of 13 cases and recognized that the disease was muscular in origin and restricted to males. Gowers in 1879 gave a masterful account of 21 personally observed cases and called attention to the characteristic way in which such patients arose from the floor (Gowers sign). Erb, in 1891, crystallized the clinical and histologic concept of a group of diseases caused by"

            "content": "Molecular Biology of Duchenne and Becker Dystrophies The first important development in our understanding of the Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies was the discovery by Kunkel of the mutation on the X chromosome in what was later named DMD and of its gene product, dystrophin (Hoffman et al, 1987). The protein is expressed in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle, as well as in brain. To date, the dystrophin gene is the largest one known in humans, spanning more than 2 Mb of DNA. This is in part the explanation for the observation that one-third of affected boys have a spontaneous mutation in the gene. Most mutations are deletions and combined with the less frequent duplications, account for over two-thirds of cases."
