    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the relevant documents to find information about pembrolizumab's effectiveness against Ewing's sarcoma. Pembrolizumab is a checkpoint inhibitor that targets the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. According to document [30], pembrolizumab has been shown to be effective in previously treated melanoma patients, giving a nearly 30% response rate. However, we need to find information about its effectiveness against Ewing's sarcoma. According to document [26], there is a randomized controlled trial evaluating pembrolizumab in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor after failure of imatinib, but there is no specific information about Ewing's sarcoma. However, document [31] mentions that ongoing clinical trials are evaluating checkpoint blockade using antibodies to PD-L1 in treatment of Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which is related to Ewing\u2019s sarcoma. Despite this, we cannot conclude that pembrolizumab is effective against Ewing's sarcoma based on the available information. We need to look for more specific information about Ewing's sarcoma. Document [26] mentions that pazopanib, an inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and c-kit, is effective in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma, including Ewing\u2019s sarcoma. However, it does not mention pembrolizumab. Document [31] does not provide information about pembrolizumab's effectiveness against Ewing\u2019s sarcoma. After reviewing the documents, we can conclude that there is no specific information about pembrolizumab's effectiveness against Ewing\u2019s sarcoma. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that pembrolizumab is effective against Ewing\u2019s sarcoma. However, considering the ongoing clinical trials evaluating checkpoint blockade using antibodies to PD-L1 in treatment of Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which is related to Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, we can say that pembrolizumab may have potential effectiveness against Ewing\u2019s sarcoma in the future.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Agents effective against osteosarcoma are doxorubicin, cisplatin, high-dose methotrexate, ifosfamide, and etoposide. The treatment for Ewing sarcoma is similar to that for osteosarcoma; preoperative chemotherapy is given, followed by local control measures, and then further chemotherapy. In contrast to osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma is radiation sensitive. Chemotherapy includes vincristine, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin."

This mass is composed of sheets of monotonous, small, round, blue cells and can be confused with lymphoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, and small-cell carcinoma. The presence of p30/32, the product of the mic-2 gene (which maps to the pseudoautosomal region of the X and Y chromosomes), is a cell-surface marker for Ewing\u2019s sarcoma (and other members of the Ewing\u2019s family of tumors, sometimes called PNETs). Most PNETs arise in soft tissues; they include peripheral neuroepithelioma, Askin\u2019s tumor (chest wall), and esthesioneuroblastoma. Glycogen-filled cytoplasm detected by staining with"

A new onset of pain, signs of inflammation, and progressive increase in the size of the mass suggest malignancy. The histologic classification is complex, but most tumors fall within the classic category. Like other bone sarcomas, high-grade chondrosarcomas spread to the lungs. Most chondrosarcomas are resistant to chemotherapy, and surgical resection of primary or recurrent tumors, including pulmonary metastases, is the mainstay of therapy. This rule does not hold for two histologic variants. Dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma has a high-grade osteosarcoma or a malignant fibrous histiocytoma component that responds to chemotherapy. Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, a rare variant composed of a small-cell element, also is responsive to systemic chemotherapy and is treated like Ewing\u2019s sarcoma."

PD-L1 is expressed on a wide variety of human tumors; in renal cell carcinoma, PD-L1 expression is associated with a poor prognosis. In mice, transfection of the gene encoding PD-L1 into tumor cells increased their growth in vivo and reduced their susceptibility to lysis by cytotoxic T cells. These effects were reversed by an antibody against PD-L1. In humans, the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab has been shown to be effective in previously treated melanoma patients, giving a nearly 30% response rate. It is FDA-approved for use following treatment with ipilimumab, or in patients with a BRAF mutation after treatment with ipilimumab and a B-raf inhibitor. Another anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumab, is also approved for treatment of metastatic melanoma and is being considered for use in treatment of Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating checkpoint blockade using antibodies to PD-L1"
