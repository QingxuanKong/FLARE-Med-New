    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if salivary cortisol can be used to evaluate pain in neonates, we need to consider the relationship between cortisol levels and pain in this age group. Cortisol is a hormone released in response to stress, including pain. In adults and children, salivary cortisol levels can be used to assess stress and pain. However, in neonates, the situation is different due to their immature endocrine system and the fact that cortisol levels can fluctuate greatly during the first few weeks of life. In the provided documents, there is limited information about using salivary cortisol to evaluate pain in neonates specifically. However, we can infer that cortisol is involved in pain response and that measuring cortisol levels can be used to assess pain in other age groups. In Document [22], it is mentioned that elevated midnight serum or salivary cortisol levels can be suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, which is a condition characterized by excessive cortisol levels. However, this is not directly related to evaluating pain in neonates. In Document [10], it is stated that ACTH and free cortisol levels rise equally during pregnancy, but there is no mention of using salivary cortisol to evaluate pain in neonates. In Document [11], Cushing's syndrome in children is discussed, and it is mentioned that biochemical features include elevated cortisol and ACTH levels. However, this is not relevant to evaluating pain in neonates. In Document [23], the Metyrapone stimulation test and ACTH stimulation test are discussed as diagnostic tools for adrenal insufficiency. These tests are not related to evaluating pain in neonates. In Document [26], it is mentioned that the timing of surfactant production in the lungs depends on fetal cortisol levels. However, this is not related to evaluating pain in neonates. In Document [27], it is mentioned that infant crying can be a sign of pain, but there is no information about using salivary cortisol to evaluate pain in neonates. In Document [28], it is mentioned that confirmation of GH or cortisol deficiency requires detection of low serum GH and cortisol concentrations during an episode of hypoglycemia. However, this is not related to evaluating pain in neonates. In Document [29], there is no information about using salivary cortisol to evaluate pain in neonates. In Document [30], it is mentioned that guidelines for care of neonates with hypoglycemia include administering intravenous fluids and opioids for severe pain. However, there is no information about using salivary cortisol to evaluate pain in neonates. Based on the provided information, it appears that salivary cortisol may not be a reliable method for evaluating pain in neonates. The immature endocrine system and fluctuating cortisol levels make it difficult to use salivary cortisol as a diagnostic tool for pain in this age group. Therefore, the answer is: \\\"answer_choice\\\": \\\"B\\\"}",

Cortisol protects the body against the self-injurious effects of unbridled inflammatory and immune responses. Cortisol also partitions energy to cope with stress by inhibiting reproductive function. As stated later, cortisol has several other effects on bone, skin, connective tissue, the GI tract, and the developing fetus that are independent of its stress-related functions.

This stimulates cortisol secretion that contributes to decreased peripheral uptake of glucose and amino acids, enhances lipolysis, and increases gluconeogenesis. Increased pancreatic secretion of glucagon during stress accelerates hepatic gluconeogenesis and further elevates blood glucose concentration. These hormonal actions act synergistically to increase blood glucose for both selective tissue metabolism and the maintenance of blood volume. Many critically ill patients have recently been shown to exhibit low plasma cortisol levels and an impaired response to ACTH stimulation, which is linked to a decrease in survival. The importance of the cortisol response to stress is illustrated by the profound circulatory collapse that occurs in patients with adrenocortical insufficiency (Chap. 406)."

People who are deficient in corticosteroids tend to be depressed, apathetic, and irritable. Effects of Cortisol During Fetal Development Cortisol is required for normal development of the CNS, retina, skin, GI tract, and lungs. The best studied system is the lungs, in which cortisol induces differentiation and maturation of type II alveolar cells.

Some suggest that greater free cortisol levels in pregnancy result from a \"resetting\" of the maternal feedback mechanism to higher thresholds (Nolten, 1981). his might result from tissue reractoriness to cortisol. Others assert that these incongruities stem from an antagonistic action of progesterone on mineralocorticoids (Keller-Wood, 2001). Thus, in response to elevated progesterone levels during pregnancy, an elevated free cortisol is needed to maintain homeostasis. Other theories include possible roles for higher free cortisol in preparation for the stress of pregnancy, delivery, and lactation. This pattern might also influence postpartum behavior and parenting roles (Conde, 2014)."

However, extensive overlap of ACTH levels in these two disorders precludes using ACTH measurements to make the distinction. Preferably, dynamic testing based on differential sensitivity to glucocorticoid feedback or ACTH stimulation in response to CRH or cortisol reduction is used to distinguish ectopic from pituitary sources of excess ACTH (Table 403-8).

            "content": "The intensity of infant crying varies, with descriptionsranging from fussing to screaming. An intense infant cry(pitch and loudness) is more likely to elicit concern or evenalarm from parents and caregivers than an infant who fretsmore quietly. Pain cries of newborns are remarkably loud:80 dB at a distance of 30.5 cm from the infant\u2019s mouth. Although pain cries have a higher frequency than hungercries, when not attended to for a protracted period, hungercries become acoustically similar to pain cries. Fortunatelymost infant crying is of a lesser intensity, consistent withfussing. Hours of fussing per day Figure 11-1 Distribution of total crying time among 80 infants studied from 2 to 12 weeks of age. Data derived from daily crying diaries recorded by mothers.

            "content": "Confirmation of GH or cortisol deficiency as the cause of hypoglycemia requires the detection of low serum GH and cortisol concentrations during an episode of hypoglycemia or after other stimulatory testing. In contrast to hyperinsulinism, serum and urine ketones are positive at the time of hypoglycemia and FFAs are elevated. Treatment involves supplementation of the deficient hormones in physiologic doses. Sufficient energy stores in the form of glycogen, adipose tissue, and muscle are necessary to respond appropriately to hypoglycemia. Deficiencies in these stores are a common cause of hypoglycemia in neonates who are small for gestational age or premature (see Chapter 60). Beyond the early neonatal period, energy stores are usually sufficient to meet the metabolic requirements except in malnourished children."

            "content": "Guidelines for care of these women have been appropriately stressed by Rees and colleagues (2003). !vIarti-Carvajal and coworkers (2009) performed a Cochrane review and reported that no randomized trials have evaluated treatment during pregnancy. At minimum, intravenous luids are given, and opioids are administered promptly for severe pain. Oxygen via nasal cannula may decrease the intensity of sickling at the capillary level. We have found that red cell transfusions after the onset of severe pain do not dramatically improve pain intensity and may not shorten its duration. Conversely, as discussed later, prophylactic transfusions almost always prevent further vasoocclusive episodes and pain crises. Recent reports suggest benefits from epidural analgesia (Verstraete, 2012; Winder, 2011). Long term, afected women can become habituated to narcotics. his problem is highlighted by the increased rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome, which is a constellation of withdrawal symptoms (Shirel,"
