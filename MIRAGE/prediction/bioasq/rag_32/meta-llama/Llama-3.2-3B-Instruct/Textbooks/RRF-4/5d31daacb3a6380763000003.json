The KRAB-ZNF family is a group of transcription factors that play a crucial role in gene repression. They are characterized by the presence of a KRAB domain, which is a zinc finger domain that binds to the KRAB motif in histone deacetylases (HDACs), and a zinc finger domain that recognizes and binds to specific DNA sequences. The KRAB-ZNF proteins typically work as transcriptional repressors, and their binding to histone deacetylases can lead to the repression of gene expression. Therefore, the members of the KRAB-ZNF gene family are promoting gene repression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The complex includes proteins of the LEF1/TCF family bound to a co-repressor protein of the Groucho family (see Figure 15\u201360A). In response to a Wnt signal, \u03b2-catenin enters the nucleus and binds to the LEF1/TCF proteins, displacing Groucho. The \u03b2-catenin now functions as a coactivator, inducing the transcription of the Wnt target genes (see Figure 15\u201360B). Thus, as in the case of Notch signaling, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling triggers a switch from transcriptional repression to transcriptional activation."

Xist RNA spreads from the XIC over the entire chromosome and directs gene silencing.

However, eukaryotic genes are rarely organized along the genome according to function, and this strategy is not generally applicable for shutting off a set of genes that work together. Instead, most eukaryotic repressors work on a geneby-gene basis. Unlike bacterial repressors, eukaryotic repressors do not directly compete with the RNA polymerase for access to the DNA; rather, they use a variety of other mechanisms, some of which are illustrated in Figure 7\u201323.

Consequently, hormone deficiency has a profound effect on gene expression because it causes gene repression as well as loss of hormone-induced stimulation. This concept has been corroborated by the finding that targeted deletion of the TR genes in mice has a less pronounced phenotypic effect than hormone deficiency."

If a repressor protein R binds to the regulatory region of gene X and represses its transcription, then the fraction of gene binding sites occupied by the repressor is specified by the same equation we used earlier for the transcription activator (Figure 8\u201375A).
