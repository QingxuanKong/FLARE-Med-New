These conditions show pronounced cellular infiltration in the adventitia, thickened inti-mal fibrosis, and organized thrombus. These disease processes may clinically mimic atherosclerosis, and most are treated by corticosteroid therapy or chemotherapeutic agents. Even so, it is important to recognize distinguishing characteristics of each disease in order to establish the course of treatment and long-term prognosis.

Numerous analogs are now available that offer extensive choices of potencies, concentrations, and vehicles. The therapeutic effectiveness of topical corticosteroids is based primarily on their anti-inflammatory activity. Definitive explanations of the effects of corticosteroids on endogenous mediators of inflammation await further experimental clarification. The antimitotic effects of corticosteroids on human epidermis may account for an additional mechanism of action in psoriasis and other dermatologic diseases associated with increased cell turnover.

It is also used for the prevention of kidney transplant rejection in combination with other immune suppressants. Controlled trials show efficacy in PA, reactive arthritis, polymyositis, SLE, maintenance of remission in vasculitis, and Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease. Azathioprine is also used in scleroderma; however, in one study, it was found to be less effective than cyclophosphamide in controlling the progression of scleroderma lung disease. Another registry study indicated possible usefulness in scleroderma lung disease. Thus it is not clear what place, if any, azathioprine has for treating scleroderma. 4. Adverse Effects: Azathioprine\u2019s toxicity includes bone marrow suppression, GI disturbances, and some increase in infection risk. As noted in Chapter 55, lymphomas may be increased with azathioprine use. Rarely, fever, rash, and hepatotoxicity signal acute allergic reactions. 1."

Additional extrarenal features include fever, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, and arthralgia. The presence of such symptoms as well as elevated creatinine, sterile pyuria, mild proteinuria, features of Fanconi\u2019s syndrome, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate should raise suspicion for this disorder. Serologies suggestive of the more common autoimmune diseases are usually negative, and TINU is often a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes of uveitis and renal disease, such as Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, sarcoidosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, have been considered. Clinical symptoms are typically self-limited in children, but are more apt to follow a relapsing course in adults. The renal and ocular manifestations generally respond well to oral glucocorticoids, although maintenance therapy with agents such as methotrexate,"

The availability of specific IL-1-targeting agents has revealed a pathologic role of IL-1-mediated inflammation in a growing list of diseases. Anakinra, a recombinant form of the naturally occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), blocks the activity of both IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. Anakinra is extremely effective in the treatment of many autoinflammatory syndromes, such as familial Mediterranean fever, cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, tumor necrosis factor receptor\u2013associated periodic syndrome, hyper-IgD syndrome, and Schnitzler\u2019s syndrome. There is a growing list of other chronic inflammatory disorders in which the reduction of IL-1 activity can be highly effective. A therapeutic trial with anakinra can be considered in patients whose FUO has not been diagnosed after later-stage diagnostic tests. Although most chronic inflammatory conditions without a known basis can be controlled"
