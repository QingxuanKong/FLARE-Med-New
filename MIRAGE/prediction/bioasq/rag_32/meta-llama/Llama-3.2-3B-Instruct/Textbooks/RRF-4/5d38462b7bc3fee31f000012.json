According to the provided documents, metformin has been shown to have anti-atherosclerotic effects.

Metformin decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis and increases insulin sensitivity. Metformin has other actions including inhibition of mTOR and mitochondrial complex I and activation of the transcription factor SKN-1/Nrf2. Metformin increases lifespan in different mouse strains including female mouse strains predisposed to high incidence of mammary tumors. At a biochemical level, metformin supplementation is associated with reduced oxidative damage and inflammation and mimics some of the gene expression changes seen with caloric restriction."

Almost all reported cases have involved patients with associated risk factors that should have contraindicated its use (kidney, liver, or cardiorespiratory insufficiency; alcoholism). Acute kidney failure can occur rarely in certain patients receiving radiocontrast agents. Metformin therapy should therefore be temporarily halted on the day of radiocontrast administration and restarted a day or two later after confirmation that renal function has not deteriorated. Renal function should be checked at least annually in patients on metformin therapy, and lower doses should be used in the elderly who may have limited renal reserve and in those with eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min per 1.73 m2."

These data are still preliminary, and the speculative mechanism of action is a decrease in insulin (which also functions as a growth factor) levels as well as direct cellular effects mediated by AMPK.

            "content": "Metformin reaches fetal serum concentrations similar to maternal levels. However, in one study of 751 women with gestational diabetes who were randomly assigned to metformin or insulin treatment, short-term perinatal adverse events did not difer between groups (Rowan, 2008). Outcomes included neonatal hypoglycemia, respiratory distress syndrome, photo therapy, birth trauma, 5-minute Apgar score .7, and preterm birth. Overall growth of ofspring at age 2 years also did not difer (Rowan, 2011). Nevertheless, the fat distribution in chil dren exposed to metformin showed a tendency toward a more favorable pattern. From a smaller randomized metformin trial, at 18 months, ofspring exposed to metformin were slightly heavier, but markers of early motor or language development did not difer compared with those in ofspring exposed to insulin (Ijas, 2015)."

            "content": "U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in children. A rare side effect of metformin is lactic acidosis, occurring mainly in patients with compromised renal function. The most common side effect is gastrointestinal upset. If ketonuria or ketoacidosis occurs, insulin treatment is necessary to first achieve adequate glycemic control but may be discontinued within weeks with continuation of oral medications. Insulin therapy may be required if adequate glycemic control is not achieved with lifestyle modifications and metformin."
