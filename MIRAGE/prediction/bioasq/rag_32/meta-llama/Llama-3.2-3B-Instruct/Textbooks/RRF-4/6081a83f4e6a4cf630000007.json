FKBP52 is a protein that interacts with heat shock proteins (HSPs) and is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. Given its role in interacting with HSPs and its involvement in cellular processes, we can infer that FKBP52 is likely to be involved in protein folding or related processes.

Molecular chaperones specifically recognize incorrect, off-pathway configurations by their exposure of hydrophobic surfaces, which in correctly folded proteins are typically buried in the interior. The binding of these exposed hydrophobic surfaces to each other is what causes off-pathway conformations to irreversibly aggregate. We saw in Chapter 3 that in some cases of inherited human diseases, aggregates do form and can cause severe symptoms and even death. Chaperones prevent this from happening in normal proteins by binding to the exposed hydrophobic surfaces using hydrophobic surfaces of their own. As we shall see shortly, there are several types of chaperones; once bound to an incorrectly folded protein, they ultimately release it in a way that gives the protein another chance to fold correctly.

Like other chaperones (discussed in Chapter 13), BiP recognizes incorrectly folded proteins, as well as protein subunits that have not yet assembled into their final oligomeric complexes. It does so by binding to exposed amino acid sequences that would normally be buried in the interior of correctly folded or assembled polypeptide chains. An example of a BiP-binding site is a stretch of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids that would normally be buried in a \u03b2 sheet with its hydrophobic side oriented towards the hydrophobic core of the folded protein. The bound BiP both prevents the protein from aggregating and helps keep it in the ER (and thus out of the Golgi apparatus and later parts of the secretory pathway).

This reflects the operation of a feedback system that responds to an increase in misfolded proteins (such as those produced by elevated temperatures) by boosting the synthesis of the chaperones that help these proteins refold. There are several major families of molecular chaperones, including the hsp60 and hsp70 proteins. Different members of these families function in different organelles. Thus, as discussed in Chapter 12, mitochondria contain their own hsp60 and hsp70 molecules that are distinct from those that function in the cytosol; and a special hsp70 (called BIP) helps to fold proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum."

One particularly puzzling observation has been that some proteins require N-linked glycosylation for proper folding in the ER, yet the precise location of the oligosaccharides attached to the protein\u2019s surface does not seem to matter. A clue to the role of glycosylation in protein folding came from studies of two ER chaperone proteins, which are called calnexin and calreticulin because they require Ca2+ for their activities. These chaperones are carbohydrate-binding proteins, or lectins, which bind to oligosaccharides on incompletely folded proteins and retain them in the ER. Like other chaperones, they prevent incompletely folded proteins from irreversibly aggregating. Both calnexin and calreticulin also promote the association of incompletely folded proteins with another ER chaperone, which binds to cysteines that have not yet formed disulfide bonds."

This change in shape is often crucial to the function of the protein, as we see later. Although a protein chain can fold into its correct conformation without outside help, in a living cell special proteins called molecular chaperones often assist in protein folding. Molecular chaperones bind to partly folded polypeptide chains and help them progress along the most energetically favorable folding pathway. In the crowded conditions of the cytoplasm, chaperones are required to prevent the temporarily exposed hydrophobic regions in newly synthesized protein chains from associating with each other to form protein aggregates (see p. 355). However, the final three-dimensional shape of the protein is still specified by its amino acid sequence: chaperones simply make reaching the folded state more reliable."

            "content": "FIGURE 2.22 \u2022 Three autophagic pathways for degradation of cytoplasmic constituents. In macroautophagy, a portion of the cytoplasm or an entire organelle is surrounded by an intracellular membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum to form a double-membraned autophagosome vacuole. After fusion with a lysosome, the inner membrane and the contents of the vacuole are degraded. In microautophagy, cytoplasmic proteins are internalized into lysosomes by invagination of the lysosomal membrane. Chaperone-mediated autophagy to lysosomes is the most selective process for degradation of specifc cytoplasmic proteins. It requires assistance of proteins called chaperones. The chaperone protein\u2014that is, hsc73\u2014binds to the protein and helps transport it into the lysosomal lumen, where it is fnally degraded."
