This agent is thought to exert its main cytotoxic effects through inhibition of the 26S proteosome, resulting in downregulation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway, which is thought to be a major signaling pathway for this disease. Of note, inhibition of NF-\u03baB has also been shown to restore chemosensitivity. One potential advantage of bortezomib is that it can be administered by the intravenous or subcutaneous route. Carfilzomib is an epoxyketone 26S proteosome inhibitor that is approved for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies, including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent. This agent is important as it is able to overcome resistance to bortezomib, and preclinical and clinical studies suggest that it has broad-spectrum activity in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.

Lenalidomide was approved by the FDA when trials showed its effectiveness in the treatment of the myelodysplastic syndrome with the chromosome 5q31 deletion.

The median survival is 4 to 7 years. Although cures have yet to be achieved, new therapies offer hope. Myeloma cells are sensitive to inhibitors of the proteasome, a cellular organelle that degrades unwanted and misfolded proteins. As discussed in Chapter 2, misfolded proteins activate apoptotic pathways, and myeloma cells are prone to the accumulation of misfolded, unpaired immunoglobulin chains. Proteasome inhibitors likely induce myeloma cell death by exacerbating this inherent tendency.

Elucidation of the mechanisms that regulate this \u201corgan-like\u201d behavior of tumors may provide additional clues to cancer control and treatment."

Alternating two regimens, HyperC-VAD with rituximab added (R-HyperC-VAD) and rituximab plus high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine, can achieve complete responses in >80% of patients and an 8-year survival of 56%, comparable to regimens using high-dose therapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Bendamustine plus rituximab has been found to induce complete responses in about 31% of patients, but the responses are generally not long lasting. Bortezomib and temsirolimus are single agents that induce transient partial responses in a minority of patients and are being added to primary combinations."
