The original vaccine organism was a strain of Mycobacterium bovis attenuated by subculture every 3 weeks for 13 years. The preferred route of administration is intradermal injection with a syringe and needle because this is the only method that permits accurate measurement of an individual dose. The official recommendation of the World Health Organization is a single dose administered during infancy. This vaccine is not routinely used in the United States. Some studies show bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin to provide 80% to 90% protection from tuberculosis, and other studies show no protective efficacy at all. Many infants who receive bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine never have a positive TST reaction.

The evidence to date has shown high and sustained efficacy against disease caused by those HPV types represented in the vaccines (HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18 in the Merck vaccine and HPV-16 and -18 in the GlaxoSmithKline vaccine). However, no therapeutic effect against active infection or disease has been found for either vaccine."

            "content": "The major public health measure for prevention of influenza is vaccination. Both inactivated (killed) and live attenuated vaccines are available and are generated from isolates of influenza A and B viruses that circulated in the previous influenza seasons and are anticipated to circulate in the upcoming season. For inactivated vaccines, 50\u201380% protection against influenza is expected if the vaccine virus and the currently circulating viruses are closely related. Available inactivated vaccines have been highly purified and are associated with few reactions. Up to 5% of individuals experience low-grade fever and mild systemic symptoms 8\u201324 h after vaccination, and up to one-third develop mild redness or tenderness at the vaccination site. Although the 1976 swine influenza vaccine appears to have been associated with an increased frequency of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, influenza vaccines administered since 1976 generally have not been. Possible exceptions were noted during the 1992\u20131993"

All children should be assessed for risk oftuberculosis at health maintenance visits, especially after 1 yearof age. The high-risk groups, as defined by the CDC, are listedin Table 9-3. In general the standardized purified protein derivative intradermal test is used with evaluation by a health care provider 48 to 72 hours after injection. The size of induration, notthe color of any mark, denotes a positive test. For most patients, Does the child spend any time in a building built before 1960 (e.g., home, school, barn) that has cracked or peeling paint? Is there a brother, sister, housemate, playmate, or community member being followed or treated (or even rumored to be) for lead poisoning?"

Less expensive vaccines derived from neural tissues are still used in a diminishing number of developing countries; however, these vaccines are associated with serious neuroparalytic complications, including postinfectious encephalomyelitis and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. The use of these vaccines should be discontinued as soon as possible, and progress has been made in this regard. Worldwide, >10 million individuals receive postexposure rabies vaccine each year. If human RIG is unavailable, purified equine RIG can be used in the same manner at a dose of 40 IU/kg. Before the administration of equine RIG, hypersensitivity should be assessed by intradermal testing with a 1:10 dilution. The incidence of anaphylactic reactions and serum sickness has been low with recent equine RIG products."
