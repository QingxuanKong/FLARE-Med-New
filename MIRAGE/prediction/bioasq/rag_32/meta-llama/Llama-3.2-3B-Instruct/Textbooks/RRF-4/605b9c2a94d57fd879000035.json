Amblyopia is defined as a pathologic alteration of the visual system characterized by a reduction in visual acuity in one or both eyes with no clinically apparent organic abnormality that completely accounts for the visual loss. It can be caused by a distortion of the normal clearly formed retinal image, abnormal binocular interaction between the eyes, or a combination of both mechanisms. The documents also mention that amblyopia can result from strabismus, anisometropia, or media opacities. Additionally, amblyopia can be caused by a developmental deficiency in the occipital cortex that gives rise to amblyopia, as well as nutritional deficiency. Therefore, it is clear that amblyopia can indeed affect the eye.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

A number of terms are commonly used to describe visual loss. Amaurosis is a general term that refers to partial or complete loss of sight. Amblyopia refers to any monocular deficit in vision that occurs in the presence of normal ocular structures. A major cause of amblyopia is the suppression by the brain of vision from one eye during early childhood caused by either strabismus, anisometropia (a significant difference in refractive error), or by media opacities. Nyctalopia is a term for poor twilight or night vision and is associated with extreme myopia, cataracts, vitamin A deficiency, retinitis pigmentosa, and, often, color blindness. There are also a number of positive visual symptoms that are named based on their characteristics, phosphenes, migrainous scintillations, visual illusions, and hallucinations. Irritation,"

If the eye movements are full and the ocular misalignment is equal in all directions of gaze (concomitant deviation), the diagnosis is strabismus. In this condition, which affects about 1% of the population, fusion is disrupted in infancy or early childhood. To avoid diplopia, vision is suppressed from the nonfixating eye. In some children, this leads to impaired vision (amblyopia, or \u201clazy\u201d eye) in the deviated eye."

It is a disorder, as in the quip by van Noorden and Campos, \u201cin which the patient sees nothing and the doctor sees nothing,\u201d meaning that the pupillary response and fundus are observed to be normal despite the visual deficit. The degradation of vision and disuse of the fovea may be the result of a number of processes, including misaligned ocular axes (strabismus), reduced monocular inputs (deprivation, from ptosis or cataract), or unequal refractive errors (anisometropia; discussed in Chap. 13). The period of risk is during the first 7 years but is greatest in the earlier part of this epoch, and the visual loss may still be rectifiable beyond the time."

Fortunately, the patient\u2019s statement can be checked by the measurement of visual acuity, which is an essential part of the ocular examination. Inspection of the refractive media and the optic fundi, the testing of pupillary reflexes, color vision, and the plotting of visual fields complete this part of the examination. Examination of the eye movements is also essential, particularly if amblyopia predicated on an early life strabismus is suspected, as discussed in Chap. 13."

The correction of refractive errors, cataract, and other correctible ocular problems are attended to first.

Other techniques of management and a summary of clinical trials of each can be found in the review by Holmes and Clarke.

If a patient achieves this level of stereoacuity, one is assured that the eyes are aligned orthotropically and that vision is intact in each eye.

After a time, however, the child eliminates the diplopia by suppressing the image from one eye. After another variable period, the suppression becomes permanent, and the individual retains diminished visual acuity in that eye, the result of prolonged disuse (amblyopia ex anopsia), as described in the last portion of Chap. 12. Nonparalytic strabismus may create misleading ocular findings in the neurologic examination. Sometimes a slight phoric misalignment of the eyes is first noticed after a head injury or a febrile infection, or it may be exposed by any other neurologic disorder or drug intoxication that impairs fusional mechanisms (vergence)."

The early deprivation of vision in one eye causes a failure of development of the geniculate and cortical receptive fields of that eye. Moreover, in this circumstance the cortical receptive fields of the seeing eye become abnormally large and usurps the monocular dominance columns of the blind eye (Hubel and Wiesel). In children with a congenital cataract, if the opacity is removed after a critical period of development, the eye will remain amblyopic. A severe strabismus in early life, especially an esotropia, will have the same effect (amblyopia ex anopsia)."

Amblyopia is a pathologic alteration of the visual system characterized by a reduction in visual acuity in one or both eyes with no clinically apparent organic abnormality that completely accounts for the visual loss. Amblyopia is due to a distortion of the normal clearly formed retinal image (from congenital cataracts or severe refractive errors); abnormal binocular interaction between the eyes as one eye competitively inhibits the other (strabismus); or a combination of both mechanisms.

In middle age, usually beginning in the fifth decade, a progressive loss of accommodation (presbyopia) is almost invariable (at this age, half or more of the amplitude of accommodative power is lost and must be replaced by plus lenses).

To compensate for presbyopia an emmetropic patient must use reading glasses. A patient already wearing glasses for distance correction usually switches to bifocals. The only exception is a myopic patient, who may achieve clear vision at near simply by removing glasses containing the distance prescription. Refractive errors usually develop slowly and remain stable after adolescence, except in unusual circumstances. For example, the acute onset of diabetes mellitus can produce sudden myopia because of lens edema induced by hyperglycemia. Testing vision through a pinhole aperture is a useful way to screen quickly for refractive error. If visual acuity is better through a pinhole than it is with the unaided eye, the patient needs refraction to obtain best corrected visual acuity."
