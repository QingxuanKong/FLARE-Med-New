However, celecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor that has been studied for its potential in various conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and certain types of cancer.

The documents mention riluzole as a treatment for ALS, which has been shown to prolong survival, but not necessarily slow disease progression.

Antioxidants have slowed the clinical progress of ALS in limited and unconfirmed trials. Masitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been tried in a number of degenerative disorders and is under investigation in ALS. Some of these claims have been confirmed in several followup studies, although again, the benefit has been marginal. Several additional agents are reported to have been effective in genetic models of ALS. Among the long list of agents that have claimed, but ultimately failed, to help ALS are guanidine hydrochloride, injections of cobra venom, gangliosides, interferons, high-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone."

Pregabalin is a newer analog of gabapentin that may also prove useful in relieving painful disorders that involve a muscle spasm component. Progabide and glycine have also been found in preliminary studies to reduce spasticity. Progabide is a GABAA and GABAB agonist and has active metabolites, including GABA itself. Glycine is another inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter (see Chapter 21) that appears to possess pharmacologic activity when given orally and readily passes the blood-brain barrier. Idrocilamide and riluzole are newer drugs for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that appear to have spasm-reducing effects, possibly through inhibition of glutamatergic transmission in the CNS."

The mechanism of this effect is not known with certainty; riluzole may reduce excitotoxicity by diminishing glutamate release. Riluzole is generally well tolerated; nausea, dizziness, weight loss, and elevated liver enzymes occur occasionally. Pathophysiologic studies of mutant SOD1\u2013related ALS in mice have disclosed diverse targets for therapy; consequently, multiple therapies are presently in clinical trials for ALS including experimental trials of small molecules, mesenchymal stem cells, and immunosuppression.

Many other examples could be cited (e.g., Friedreich ataxia, Parkinson disease) in which discrete neuronal systems disintegrate, leaving others unscathed. Thus, these degenerative diseases had in the past been called system atrophies.
