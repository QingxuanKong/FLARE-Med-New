Recent controlled trials support the efficacy of monotherapy with second-generation antipsychotics in the acute phase (up to 4 weeks) of mania. In addition, several second-generation antipsychotics are approved in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. They appear more effective in preventing mania than in preventing depression. As mania subsides, the antipsychotic drug may be withdrawn, although maintenance treatment with atypical anti-psychotic agents has become more common. Nonmanic excited states may also be managed by antipsychotics, often in combination with benzodiazepines."

With the approval of valproate, aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone for this indication, a smaller percentage of bipolar patients now receive lithium. This trend is reinforced by the slow onset of action of lithium, which has often been supplemented with concurrent use of antipsychotic drugs or potent benzodiazepines in severely manic patients. The overall success rate for achieving remission from the manic phase of bipolar disorder can be as high as 80% but lower among patients who require hospitalization. A similar situation applies to maintenance treatment, which is about 60% effective overall but less in severely ill patients. These considerations have led to increased use of combined treatment in severe cases. After mania is controlled, the antipsychotic drug may be stopped and benzodiazepines and lithium continued as"

However, the pharmacokinetic interactions of carbamazepine and its tendency to induce the metabolism of CYP3A4 substrates make it a more difficult drug to use with other standard treatments for bipolar disorder. The mode of action of carbamazepine is unclear, and oxcarbazepine is not effective. Carbamazepine may be used to treat acute mania and also for prophylactic therapy. Adverse effects (discussed in Chapter 24) are generally no greater and sometimes less than those associated with lithium. Carbamazepine may be used alone or, in refractory patients, in combination with lithium or, rarely, valproate."

Depression in bipolar patients is phenomenologically similar to that of major depression, with the key features being depressed mood, diurnal variation, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and sometimes, psychotic symptoms.

(Gabapentin is not effective, leaving the mechanism of antimanic action of valproate unclear.) Overall, valproic acid shows efficacy equivalent to that of lithium during the early weeks of treatment. It is significant that valproic acid has been effective in some patients who have failed to respond to lithium. For example, mixed states and rapid cycling forms of bipolar disorder may be more responsive to valproate than to lithium. Moreover, its side-effect profile is such that one can rapidly increase the dosage over a few days to produce blood levels in the apparent therapeutic range, with nausea being the only limiting factor in some patients. The starting dosage is 750 mg/d, increasing rapidly to the 1500\u20132000 mg range with a recommended maximum dosage of 60 mg/kg/d."

Lithium is also among the better-studied agents used to augment standard antidepressant response in acute major depression in those patients who have had inadequate response to monotherapy. For this application, concentrations of lithium at the lower end of the recommended range for bipolar disorder appear to be adequate. Schizoaffective disorder, another condition with an affective component characterized by a mixture of schizophrenic symptoms and depression or excitement, is treated with antipsychotic drugs alone or combined with lithium. Various antidepressants are added if depression is present. Lithium alone is rarely successful in treating schizophrenia, but adding it to an antipsychotic may salvage an otherwise treatment-resistant patient. Carbamazepine may work equally well when added to an antipsychotic drug."

Although many drugs are combined with antidepressants in the adjunctive treatment of major depression, antipsychotic agents are the only class of agents that have been formally evaluated for FDA approval for this purpose.

Certain of the newer antipsychotic drugs, discussed in the next chapter, have overtaken lithium for the treatment of bipolar disease, with little evidence that they are superior. During an acute manic attack, hospitalization may be required to protect the manic patient from impulsive and aggressive behavior that might cause personal and interpersonal difficulty or jeopardize a career. Haloperidol (Haldol), or one of the newer antipsychosis agents discussed in Chap. 49\u2014or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT, see further on) if these drugs are ineffective\u2014can be used to control the mania until lithium carbonate becomes effective, usually a matter of 4 or 5 days. The usual dosage of lithium is 1,200 to 2,400 mg daily in divided oral doses, which produces a desired serum level of 0.9 to 1.4 mEq/L. The serum"
