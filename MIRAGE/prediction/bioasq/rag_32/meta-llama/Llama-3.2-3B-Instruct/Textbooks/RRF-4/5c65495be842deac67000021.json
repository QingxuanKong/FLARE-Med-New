Because leukemic cells arise from progenitors whose proliferation and differentiation are normally regulated by hematopoietic growth factors, including GM-CSF and G-CSF, there was concern that myeloid growth factors could stimulate leukemic cell growth and increase the rate of relapse. The results of randomized clinical trials suggest that both G-CSF and GM-CSF are safe following induction and consolidation treatment of myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemia. There has been no evidence that these growth factors reduce the rate of remission or increase relapse rate. On the contrary, the growth factors accelerate neutrophil recovery and reduce infection rates and days of hospitalization. Both G-CSF and GM-CSF have FDA approval for treatment of patients with AML.

These patients show a response at first and then relapse because the cancer cells develop a resistance to imatinib. This resistance is usually associated with secondary mutations in the part of the Bcr-Abl gene that encodes the kinase domain, disrupting the ability of imatinib to bind to Bcr-Abl kinase. Second-generation inhibitors that function effectively against a whole range of imatinib-resistant mutants have now been developed. By combining one or more of these new inhibitors with imatinib as the initial therapy (see below), it seems that CML\u2014at least in the chronic (early) stage\u2014may be on its way to becoming a curable disease."
