The magnitude of the survival extension is modest in patients with metastatic disease. Similarly, the use of bevacizumab (Avastin) has improved the response rate and response duration to paclitaxel. Objective responses in previously treated patients may also be seen with gemcitabine, vinca alkaloids, capecitabine, vinorelbine, and oral etoposide, as well as a new class of agents, epothilones.

These drugs work by targeting bcr-abland c-kit (imatinib) and HER2 and BRAF, respectively. For example, a phase 3 randomized trial demonstrated that, compared with dacarbazine, standard of care chemotherapy option for patients with metastatic melanoma with a V600E BRAF mutation, the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib led to significantly higher response rates (48% vs. 5%).147 At 6 months, overall survival was 84% (95% CI, 78\u201389) in the vemurafenib group and 64% (95% CI, 56\u201373) in the dacarba-zine group. The hazard ratio for tumor progression in the vemu-rafenib group was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.20\u20130.33; P<0.001). The estimated median progression-free survival was 5.3 months in the vemurafenib"

            "content": "The possible roles of specific tumor markers in predicting which patients will respond to chemotherapy regimens were investigated. The most thoroughly researched of these markers is HER-2/neu. In an NSABP study, patients with HER-2/neu overexpression who were not treated with anthracycline-based regimens fared worse (87). Another study showed that the addition of trastuzumab (Herceptin), an antibody directed against the HER-2/neu receptor, significantly increased the response rate to therapy over standard chemotherapy alone in the presence of metastatic disease (88). Reports from trials investigating the adjuvant use of trastuzumab for women with early-stage Her-2/neu breast cancers show significant improvements in disease-free survival for women receiving trastuzumab; trastuzumab is used as systemic adjuvant therapy for patients with Her-2/neu positive breast cancer, and the standard length of treatment is one full year (89\u201391)."

Premenopausal women also received the GNRH ago-nist, goserelin.
