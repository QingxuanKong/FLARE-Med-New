This suggests that mutations in KCNT2 can cause epilepsy.\\n\\nHowever, document [25] lists KCNT2 as a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit, and mutations in this gene can cause a 20\u201340% reduction of potassium currents, which may lead to impaired repolarization.

This condition is not explicitly stated to be epilepsy, but it is related to KCNT2 mutations.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclude that mutations in KCNT2 only cause phenotypes with epilepsy.\\n\\nHowever, it is clear that KCNT2 mutations are associated with a condition that can cause epilepsy, and it is possible that KCNT2 mutations can cause other phenotypes as well.\\n\\nSo, the answer is not a simple yes or no, but rather a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between KCNT2 mutations and epilepsy.\\n\\nGiven the options provided, the closest answer would be B. no, as it is possible that KCNT2 mutations can cause phenotypes other than epilepsy.\\n\\nHowever, it is worth noting that the question asks if mutations in KCNT2 only cause phenotypes with epilepsy, which is not explicitly stated in the documents.

Although most of the mutations identified to date cause rare forms of epilepsy, their discovery has led to extremely important conceptual advances. For example, it appears that many of the inherited, idiopathic epilepsies (i.e., the relatively \u201cpure\u201d forms of epilepsy in which seizures are the phenotypic abnormality and brain structure and function are otherwise normal) are due to mutations affecting ion channel function. These syndromes are therefore part of the larger group of channelopathies causing paroxysmal disorders such as cardiac arrhythmias, episodic ataxia, periodic weakness, and familial hemiplegic migraine. In contrast, gene mutations observed in symptomatic epilepsies (i.e., disorders in which other neurologic abnormalities such as cognitive impairment coexist with seizures) are proving to be associated"

Two forms of progressive myoclonic epilepsy, Unverricht-Lundborg disease and Lafora body disease, are the result, respectively, of mutations in genes encoding cystatin B and tyrosine phosphatase. To these inherited forms of epilepsy may be added diseases such as tuberous sclerosis and ceroid lipofuscinosis (Chap. 36), which have a strong proclivity to cause seizures and genetically determined heterotopias such as FLN1 (this and other developmental aberrations are discussed in Chap. 37)."

Most of the increased mortality is due to the underlying etiology of epilepsy (e.g., tumors or strokes in older adults). However, a significant number of patients die from accidents, status epilepticus, and a syndrome known as sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), which usually affects young people with convulsive seizures and tends to occur at night. The cause of SUDEP is unknown; it may result from brainstem-mediated effects of seizures on pulmonary, cardiac, and arousal functions. Recent studies suggest that, in some cases, a genetic mutation may be the cause of both epilepsy and a cardiac conduction defect that gives rise to sudden death."

Mutations in genes that encode voltage-gated Na+ channels in skeletal muscle cells, for example, can cause myotonia, a condition in which there is a delay in muscle relaxation after voluntary contraction, causing painful muscle spasms. In some cases, this occurs because the abnormal channels fail to inactivate normally; as a result, Na+ entry persists after an action potential finishes and repeatedly reinitiates membrane depolarization and muscle contraction. Similarly, mutations that affect Na+ or K+ channels in the brain can cause epilepsy, in which excessive synchronized firing of large groups of neurons causes epileptic seizures (convulsions, or fits)."

Each of these has been challenged but is supported by considerable data and together they serve as a reasonable model, as noted below. Understanding of the initial discharges and their spread has been advanced by the identification of several rare forms of familial epilepsy that are the result of mutations in sodium, potassium, acetylcholine receptor, or GABA channels on neurons.
