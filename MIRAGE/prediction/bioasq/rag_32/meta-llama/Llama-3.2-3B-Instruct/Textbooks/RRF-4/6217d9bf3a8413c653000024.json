IFN-\u03b3 is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the immune response, particularly in the activation of T cells and the induction of other immune responses. However, the relationship between IFN-\u03b3 and IDO expression is complex and context-dependent. Some studies suggest that IFN-\u03b3 can actually suppress IDO expression, whereas others suggest that it may not have a direct effect on IDO expression. Nevertheless, based on the available evidence, it appears that IFN-\u03b3 does not induce the expression of IDO. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

For example, some tumors express programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), a B7 family member and ligand for the inhibitory receptor PD-1 expressed by activated T cells (see Section 7-24). Furthermore, tumors can produce enzymes that act to suppress local immune responses. The enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) catabolizes tryptophan, an essential amino acid, in order to produce the immunosuppressive metabolite kynurenine. IDO seems to function in maintaining a balance between immune responses and tolerance during infections, but can be induced during the equilibrium phase of tumor development. Finally, tumor cells can produce materials such as collagen that create a physical barrier to interaction with cells of the immune system (see Fig. 16.14, last panel).

Studies in mice have shown that the inhibition of IDO leads to loss of allogeneic, but not syngeneic, fetuses, and that this effect is mediated by lymphocytes (236). Further support lies in studies demonstrating that hamsters fed diets high in tryptophan have increased rates of fetal wastage (237). Extending this theory to humans requires further investigation.

In allergic tissue reactions, for example, those that lead to chronic asthma, mast-cell degranulation, and TH2 activation cause eosinophils to accumulate in large numbers and to become activated. Among other things, eosinophils secrete TH2-type cytokines and in vitro can promote the apoptosis of TH1 cells by their expression of IDO and consequent production of kynurenine, which acts on the TH1 cells. Their apparent promotion of TH2cell expansion may thus be partly due to a relative reduction in TH1-cell numbers. The continued presence of eosinophils is characteristic of chronic allergic inflammation, and eosinophils are thought to be major contributors"

Once the adaptive immune system develops, a single type of response is capable of eliminating any type of pathogen. 11.2 Multiple Choice: Which statement is incorrect? A. IL-12 and IL-18 production by macrophages and dendritic cells induces IFN-\u03b3 secretion by ILC1 to induce heightened killing of intracellular pathogens. B. ILC3s are activated by thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which activates STAT5 and induces IL-17 production. C. Molecular patterns common to helminths activate IL-33 and IL-25 production, which in turn activates ILC2s to induce mucus production by goblet cells and mucosal smooth muscle contraction. D. ILC3-derived IL-22 acts on epithelial cells to induce production of antimicrobial peptides and promotes an enhanced barrier integrity."
