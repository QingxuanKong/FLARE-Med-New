Document [2] and [3] provide information on the routine vaccination schedule for rotavirus, which includes two or three doses of rotavirus vaccine administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. This indicates that rotavirus vaccines do exist and are part of routine immunization schedules. Additionally, Document [8] lists the available rotavirus vaccines, including RV-1 (Rotarix) and RV-5 (RotaTeq), which further confirms the existence of rotavirus vaccines. Furthermore, Document [12] mentions that a rotavirus vaccine has been widely used in the United States since 2006, leading to a significant decline in rotavirus hospitalizations and emergency department visits. Lastly, Document [18] describes the characteristics of rotavirus and its transmission, which is relevant to understanding the development and administration of rotavirus vaccines. Based on this analysis, it is clear that rotavirus vaccines do exist and are used in various settings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
