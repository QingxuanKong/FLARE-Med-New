As with other bDMARDs, there is a slight increase in the risk of infection including serious infections. Cases of depression and suicide have been reported in patients receiving belimumab, although these patients may have had neurologic SLE, thus confounding the causal relationship. Infusion reactions including anaphylaxis are among the other adverse effects. A very small percentage of patients develop antibodies toward belimumab; their clinical significance is not clear. In a 1998 survey, approximately half of North American rheumatologists treated moderately aggressive RA with combination therapy, and the use of drug combinations is probably much higher now.

Cyclophosphamide is effective for the worst forms of lupus nephritis, with significant improvements in outcome and decreased rates of progression to renal failure. CNS lupus responds to cyclophosphamide. For patients who are not able to tolerate the tapering of corticosteroids, the use of steroid-sparing agents, such as azathioprine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil, may be indicated. Patients with SLE should be counseled to wear sun block and avoid sun exposure because exposure to the sun precipitates flares of the disease. Because of this prohibition,patients benefit from calcium and vitamin D supplementation to reduce the risk of osteoporosis that may result from prolonged corticosteroid use. Early treatment of hyperlipidemiato decrease long-term cardiovascular complications is alsoindicated."

Thirty to 50% of patients will have clinical manifestations of renal disease at the time of diagnosis, and 60% of adults and 80% of children develop renal abnormalities at some point in the course of their disease.

In situ immune complex formation following glomerular binding of nuclear antigens, particularly necrotic nucleosomes, also plays a role in renal injury.

            "content": "Nephritis is usually the most serious manifestation of SLE, particularly because nephritis and infection are the leading causes of mortality in the first decade of disease. Because nephritis is asymptomatic in most lupus patients, urinalysis should be ordered in any person suspected of having SLE. The classification of lupus nephritis is primarily histologic (see \u201cPathology,\u201d above, and Table 378-2). Renal biopsy is recommended for every SLE patient with any clinical evidence of nephritis; results are used to plan current andnear-futuretherapies.Patients withdangerous proliferative forms of glomerular damage (ISN III and IV) usually have microscopic hematuria and proteinuria (>500 mg per 24 h); approximately one-half develop nephrotic syndrome, and most develop hypertension. If diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (DPGN) is inadequately treated, virtually all patients develop ESRD within 2 years of diagnosis. Therefore, aggressive"

            "content": "The effectiveness of immunosuppressive drugs in autoimmune disorders varies widely. Nonetheless, with immunosuppressive therapy, remissions can be obtained in many instances of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, and temporal arteritis. Improvement is also often seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, acute glomerulonephritis, acquired factor VIII inhibitors (antibodies), rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory myopathy, scleroderma, and certain other autoimmune states. Immunosuppressive therapy is utilized in chronic severe asthma, where cyclosporine is often effective and sirolimus is another alternative (see Chapter 20). Omalizumab (anti-IgE antibody) has been approved for the treatment of severe asthma (see previous section). Tacrolimus is currently under clinical investigation for the management of autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and of multiple sclerosis, where IFN-\u03b2 has a definitive role."
