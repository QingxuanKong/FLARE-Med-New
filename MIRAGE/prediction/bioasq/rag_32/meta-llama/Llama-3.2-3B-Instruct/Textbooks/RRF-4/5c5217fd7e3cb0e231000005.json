Current absence of symptoms would not preclude a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, if the restricted interests and repetitive behaviors were present in the past.

Suicide is a fatal complication of MDD and surpasses motor vehicle accidents as a cause of death in adolescents. It has high prevalence among high school students with 20% having contemplated suicide and 8% having attempted each year.

Seizures often start around the onset of puberty. Higher IQ and better language skills are related to improved prognosis. Good communication by the age of 6 years and average nonverbal cognitive skills predict the likelihood of living independently or in a less structured group living situation. The earliest studies of autism suggested a relatively poor prognosis, with only a small number of individuals (1% to 2%) being able to function independently as adults. Recent research reveals major gains, but not a cure, with early diagnosis and treatment. Schizophrenia generally presents in adolescence or early adulthood. The same diagnostic criteria are applied as in adults but must be interpreted in terms of the developmental stage of the child (Table 20-3)."

Adolescents who experiment in one area of risk-taking often have contemplated or tried multiple other risk-taking behaviors. When all of the risk-taking information has been gathered, the physician should choose one or two health care issues to discuss, making it clear that the information is confidential and that he or she is there to help the adolescent in a partnership way. Although the focus in adolescent care is on psychosocial issues, a general examination also needs to be performed (Table 68-1).

            "content": "Some individuals come for first diagnosis in adulthood, perhaps prompted by the diagno- sis of autism in a child in the family or a breakdown of relations at work or home. Obtaining de- tailed developmental history in such cases may be difficult, and it is important to consider self- reported difficulties. Where clinical observation suggests criteria are currently met, autism spectrum disorder may be diagnosed, provided there is no evidence of good social and com- munication skills in childhood. For example, the report (by parents or another relative) that the cation skills throughout childhood would rule out a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder; however, the absence of developmental information in itself should not do so. Manifestations of the social and communication impairments and restricted/ repeti- tive behaviors that define autism spectrum disorder are clear in the developmental period."

Two of the most common co-occurring conditions with oppositional defiant disorder are attention\u2014deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder (see the section \u201dComorbidity\u201d for this disorder). Oppositional defiant disorder has been associated with increased risk for suicide attempts, even after comorbid disorders are controlled for."

Specifically, young children with either condition can manifest dampened expression of positive emotions, cognitive and language delays, and impairments in social reciprocity."
