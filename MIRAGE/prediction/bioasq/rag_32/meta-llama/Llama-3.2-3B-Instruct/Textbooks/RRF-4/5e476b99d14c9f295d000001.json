    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to evaluate the available information about golimumab and its use in treating sarcoidosis. Golimumab is a fully human IgG1 antibody against TNF-\u03b1 and is approved for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as psoriatic arthritis. According to document [26], golimumab has also been used in the treatment of sarcoidosis, particularly in patients with systemic symptoms or extensive skin lesions. In a study, prompt and dramatic resolution of both arthritis and skin lesions was observed in large, randomized controlled trials of etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab, including those with long-standing disease resistant to previous therapy. This suggests that golimumab may be effective in treating sarcoidosis. However, the available information does not provide explicit data on the efficacy of golimumab specifically for sarcoidosis. Therefore, we can infer that golimumab may be effective for sarcoidosis, but more specific studies are needed to confirm its efficacy and optimal dosing regimen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Although most patients receive glucocorticoids as their initial systemic therapy, toxicity associated with prolonged therapy often leads to steroid-sparing alternatives. The antimalarial drugs such as hydroxychloroquine are more effective for skin than pulmonary disease. Minocycline may also be useful for cutaneous sarcoidosis."

It can be used as monotherapy, although over 70% of patients taking etanercept are also using methotrexate. Etanercept decreases the rate of formation of new erosions relative to methotrexate alone. It is also being used in other rheumatic syndromes such as scleroderma, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis), giant cell arteritis, Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, uveitis, and sarcoidosis. However, a comparative study of ustekinumab (an IL-12 and IL-23 blocker) and etanercept concluded that ustekinumab at a dose of 45 or 90 mg was superior to high-dose etanercept (50 mg twice weekly) over a 12-week period in patients with psoriasis. 1.

The differential response rate could be explained by differences in mechanism of action because etanercept is a TF receptor antagonist and infliximab is a monoclonal antibody against TF. In contrast to etanercept, infliximab also binds to TF on the surface of some cells that release TF, which leads to cell lysis. This effect has been documented in Crohn disease. Adalimumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-TF antibody that also appears effective for sarcoidosis when dosed at higher strengths, as recommended for the treatment of Crohn disease.

Thus, the deci sion to treat is based on symptoms, physical indings, chest radiograph, and pulmonary function tests.

            "content": "Ideally, coordinated therapy is directed at both the skin and joints in PsA. As described above for AS, use of the anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents has revolutionized the treatment of PsA. Prompt and dramatic resolution of both arthritis and skin lesions has been observed in large, randomized controlled trials of etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab. Many of the responding patients had long-standing disease that was resistant to all previous therapy, as well as extensive skin disease. The clinical response is often more dramatic than in RA, and delay of disease progression has been demonstrated radiographically. The potential additive effect of methotrexate to anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents in PsA remains uncertain. As noted above, anti-TNF therapy, paradoxically, has been reported to trigger exacerbation or de novo appearance of psoriasis, typically the palmoplantar pustular variety. In some cases, the therapy can nevertheless be continued."

            "content": "Immunosuppressive treatment for sarcoidosis is initiated with high-dose glucocorticoids, which are often more effective for arrhythmias than for the heart failure. Patients with sarcoid lesions that persist or recur during tapering of corticosteroids are considered candidates for other immunosuppressive therapies, frequently with agents also used for cardiac transplantation. Pacemakers and implantable defibrillators are generally indicated to prevent life-threatening heart block or ventricular tachycardia, respectively. Because the inflammation often resolves into extensive fibrosis that impairs cardiac function and provides pathways for reentrant arrhythmias, the prognosis for improvement is best when the granulomata are not extensive and the ejection fraction is not severely reduced."

Symptomatic uveitis, constitutional symptoms, and pulmonary symptoms are treated with prednisone, 1 mg/kg orally per day."
