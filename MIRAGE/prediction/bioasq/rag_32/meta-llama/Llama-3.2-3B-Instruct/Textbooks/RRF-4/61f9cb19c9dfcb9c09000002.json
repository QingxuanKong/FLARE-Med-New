    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the relationship between ADAMTS18 and cancer. ADAMTS18 is a metalloprotease that is involved in the cleavage of von Willebrand factor (VWF). Deficiencies in ADAMTS18 have been associated with Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) and other microangiopathic hemolytic anemias. However, there is no clear evidence to suggest a direct association between ADAMTS18 deficiency and cancer. While ADAMTS13, another metalloprotease involved in VWF cleavage, has been implicated in some cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, there is no direct evidence linking ADAMTS18 to cancer. Therefore, based on the available information, the correct answer is that ADAMTS18 deficiency is not associated with cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

VWF is normally secreted as ultra-large multimers, which are then cleaved by ADAMTS13. The persistence of ultra-large VWF molecules is thought to contribute to pathogenic platelet adhesion and aggregation (Fig. 140-4). This defect alone, however, is not sufficient to result in TTP because individuals with a congenital absence of ADAMTS13 develop TTP only episodically. Additional provocative factors have not been defined. The level of ADAMTS13 activity, as well as antibodies, can now be detected by laboratory assays.

In the era of molecular medicine, there is increasing recognition of the contribution of hereditary factors to many common diseases. Often, the epidemiology of common diseases such as hypertension is characterized by a minority of families that have mutations in recognized genes, whereas the genetic basis of the same disease phenotype in the larger population is unclear. The search for the genetic factors that contribute to many common diseases remains a topic of intense research interest. It is now clear that essentially all tumors have genetic abnormalities. Although there is an inherited predisposition in some families, most of these genetic changes are acquired.

            "content": "Fig. 15.39C The availability of endoscopic screening combined with the recognition that most carcinomas arise within adenomas presents a unique opportunity for cancer prevention. Unfortunately, colorectal cancers develop insidiously and may therefore go undetected for long periods. Cecal and other right-sided colon cancers most often are called to clinical attention by the appearance of fatigue and weakness due to iron-deficiency anemia.Thus, it is a clinical maxim that the underlying cause of iron-deficiency anemia in an older male or postmenopausal female is gastrointestinal cancer until proven otherwise. Left-sided colorectal adenocarcinomas may produce occult bleeding, changes in bowel habits, or cramping left lower-quadrant discomfort. Although poorly differentiated and mucinous histologic patterns are associated with poor prognosis, the two most important prognostic factors are depth of invasion and the MLH1, MSH2 (MSH6, PMS1, PMS2)"

            "content": "Roughly 100 syndromes of familial cancer have been reported, although many are rare. The majority are inherited as autosomal dominant traits, although some of those associated with DNA repair abnormalities (xeroderma pigmentosum, Fanconi\u2019s anemia, ataxia telangiectasia) are autosomal recessive. Table 101e-3 shows a number of cancer predisposition syndromes and the responsible genes. The current paradigm states that the genes mutated in familial syndromes can also be targets for somatic mutations in sporadic (noninherited) tumors. The study of cancer syndromes has thus provided invaluable insights into the mechanisms of progression for many tumor types. This section examines the case of inherited colon cancer in detail, but A1 Loss of normal chr 13 A3 B1 B3 Markers:"

            "content": "Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP, Moschcowitz Syndrome) and Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome These are serious diseases of the small blood vessels combined with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia characterized by widespread occlusions of arterioles and capillaries involving practically all organs of the body, including the brain. It was described by Adams and colleagues (1948) and named thrombocytic acroangiothrombosis. Fibrin components have been identified by immunofluorescent techniques; some investigators have demonstrated disseminated intravascular platelet aggregation rather than fibrin thrombi. Sporadic TTP is caused by an acquired circulating IgG inhibitor of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease (termed \u201ca disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 [ADAMTS13]\u201d). A rarer familial form (The Upshaw-Shulman syndrome) is caused by an inherited deficiency of ADAMTS13."

Adamson Anemias associated with normocytic and normochromic red cells and an inappropriately low reticulocyte response (reticulocyte index <2\u20132.5) are hypoproliferative anemias. This category includes early iron deficiency (before hypochromic microcytic red cells develop), acute and chronic inflammation (including many malignancies), renal disease, hypometabolic states such as protein malnutrition and endocrine deficiencies, and anemias from marrow damage. Marrow damage states are discussed in Chap. 130. Hypoproliferative anemias are the most common anemias, and in the clinic, iron deficiency anemia is the most common of these followed by the anemia of inflammation. The anemia of inflammation, similar to iron deficiency, is related in part to abnormal iron metabolism. The anemias associated with renal disease, inflammation, cancer, and hypometabolic states are characterized by a suboptimal erythro poietin response to the anemia."
