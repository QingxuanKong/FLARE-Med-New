            "content": "patients had a significantly higher incidence of toxicities. The second trial, conducted in Europe, compared cisplatin/gemcitabine with or without bevacizumab in patients with recurrent or advanced nonsquamous NSCLC and reported a significant improvement in progression-free survival but no improvement in overall survival for bevacizumab-treated patients. A randomized phase III trial compared carboplatin/pemetrexed and bevacizumab to carboplatin/paclitaxel and bevacizumab as first-line therapy in patients with recurrent or advanced nonsquamous NSCLC and reported no significant difference in progression-free survival or overall survival between treatment groups. Therefore, currently carboplatin/paclitaxel and bevacizumab or carboplatin/pemetrexed and bevacizumab are appropriate regimens for first-line treatment for stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC patients. Of note, there are many small-molecule inhibitors of VEGFR; however, these VEGFR TKIs have not proven to be effective in the treatment of"

Side effects are usually limited to an acneiform rash and diarrhea (for the TKIs). The addition of cetuximab to standard combination chemotherapy with cisplatin or carboplatin and 5-FU was shown to result in a significant increase in median survival. Drugs targeting specific mutations are under investigation, but no such strategy has yet been shown to be feasible in head and neck cancer."

By avoiding the need for whole gland radia-tion or removal, these focal ablative therapies aim to balance the long-term impact on quality of life with survival. Laser, high-focused ultrasound, cryotherapy, and photodynamic ablations have showed similar results in early studies.Urethral CancerUrethral carcinoma (UC) is a rare disease, the true incidence of which is unknown. It accounts for less than 1% of genito-urinary cancers.143,144 It is a disease of the older adult. Risk fac-tors include chronic inflammation from sexually transmitted diseases (human papillomavirus 16 and 18 in squamous cell carcinoma),145 chronic urethral stricture, and indwelling cath-eterization. Furthermore, urethral diverticulum and recurrent urinary tract infections increase the risk for women.The majority of patients present with irritative and obstructive voiding"

A novel antibody conjugate (ADC) that links trastuzumab to a cytotoxic agent has been approved for management of HER2-positive breast cancer. The magnitude of the survival extension is modest in patients with metastatic disease. Similarly, the use of bevacizumab (Avastin) has improved the response rate and response duration to paclitaxel. Objective responses in previously treated patients may also be seen with gemcitabine, vinca alkaloids, capecitabine, vinorelbine, and oral etoposide, as well as a new class of agents, epothilones. There are few comparative trials of one agent versus another in metastatic disease. It is a sad fact that choices are often influenced by aggressive marketing of new very expensive agents that have not been shown to be superior to other generic agents. Platinum-based agents"
