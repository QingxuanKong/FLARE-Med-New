However, its behavior and its appearance on imaging, as well as the property of diffuse infiltration of neoplastic glial cells, involving much of one or both cerebral hemispheres without a discrete tumor mass, establishes it as a useful conceptualization for clinical purposes. Whether this type of \u201cgliomatosis\u201d represents neoplastic transformation of multicentric origin or direct spread from one or more small neoplastic foci is not known. For these and other reasons, the tumor is impossible to classify (or to grade) using the conventional brain tumor schemes. The genetic and molecular alterations found in high-grade gliomas, as described earlier, are seen in some cases of gliomatosis cerebri as well."

A series of 16 patients treated by Pollack and colleagues emphasizes that the focal and exophytic brainstem tumors are almost all low-grade astrocytomas; these tumors, in contrast to the more diffuse type, usually respond well to partial resection and permit long-term survival because they recur only slowly and do not undergo malignant transformation. Gangliocytomas or mixed astrogangliocytomas are rare imitators of nodular glioma in the brainstem.

            "content": "Management of cord compression includes glucocorticoids to reduce cord edema, local radiotherapy (initiated as early as possible) to the symptomatic lesion, and specific therapy for the underlying tumor type. Glucocorticoids (dexamethasone, up to 40 mg daily) can be administered before an imaging study if there is clinical suspicion of cord compression and the medication is continued at a lower dose until definitive treatment with radiotherapy (generally 3000 cGy administered in 15 daily fractions) and/or surgical decompression is completed. In one randomized controlled trial, initial management with surgery followed by radiotherapy was more effective than radiotherapy alone for patients with a single area of spinal cord compression by extradural tumor; however, patients with recurrent cord compression, brain metastases, radiosensitive tumors, or severe motor symptoms of >48 h in duration were excluded from this study. Radiotherapy alone may be effective even for some typically"
