    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between radiation therapy and the development of radiation-induced osteosarcoma. According to Document [10] (Title: Surgery_Schwartz), radiation-induced sarcomas can occur after radiation therapy for carcinoma of the breast and cervix, and the three criteria for diagnosis of radiation-induced sarcoma include histology different from the original lesion, sarcoma develops in the irradiated field, and a 3-5 year latent period between radiation and sarcoma development. Document [28] (Title: Surgery_Schwartz) also mentions that the risk of developing a sarcoma increased with radiation dose, and the median time between radiation therapy and diagnosis of sarcoma was 10 years. Additionally, Document [11] (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson) states that a review of 44 patients with radiation-associated sarcomas identified that radiation-associated sarcomas occurred most commonly in patients treated for breast cancer and lymphoma. Furthermore, Document [12] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) notes that osteosarcomas are radioresistant; radiation therapy has no role in the routine management of osteosarcoma. However, Document [11] (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson) also mentions that radiation-induced changes in the skin or mucosa can be similar to those of cancer, which suggests that radiation therapy may increase the risk of developing sarcomas, including osteosarcoma. Based on these findings, it is reasonable to conclude that radiotherapy can cause radiation-induced osteosarcoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Bone is among the most radio-resistant organs, with radiation effects being manifested mainly in children through premature fusion of the epiphyseal growth plate. By contrast, the male testis, female ovary, and bone marrow are the most sensitive organs. Any bone marrow in a radiation field will be eradicated by therapeutic irradiation.

The rate of delivery significantly modifies the biologic effect. Although the effect of radiant energy is cumulative, delivery in divided doses may allow cells to repair some of the damage in the intervals. Thus, fractional doses of radiant energy have a cumulative effect only to the extent that repair during the intervals is incomplete. Radiotherapy of tumors exploits the capability of normal cells to repair themselves and to recover more rapidly than tumor cells. Field size. The size of the field exposed to radiation has a great influence on its consequences. The body can sustain relatively high doses of radiation when they are delivered to small, carefully shielded fields, whereas smaller doses delivered to larger fields may be lethal."

A common consequence of cancer radiotherapy is the development of fibrosis in the irradiated field ( Fig. 8.15 ). Fibrosis may occur weeks or months after irradiation, leading to the replacement of dead parenchymal cells by connective tissue and the formation of scars and adhesions (see Chapter 3). As already mentioned, ionizing radiation causes vascular damage and consequent tissue ischemia. Vascular damage, the killing of tissue stem cells by ionizing radiation, and the release of cytokines and chemokines that promote an inflammatory reaction all contribute to fibroblast activation and the development of radiation-induced fibrosis."

It presents with pain and may be associated with a palpable mass. Because the pain and swelling often are initially thought to be related to trauma, radio-graphs of the affected region frequently are obtained, which usually reveal a lytic lesion, often associated with calcification in the soft tissue surrounding the lesion. While 75% to 80% of patients with osteosarcoma have apparently localized disease at diagnosis, the majority of patients are believed to have micrometastatic disease as well.

Tissue hypoxia, such as may exist in the center of rapidly growing, poorly vascularized tumors, may thus reduce the extent of damage and the effectiveness of radiotherapy directed against tumors. Vascular damage. Damage to endothelial cells, which are moderately sensitive to radiation, may cause narrowing or occlusion of blood vessels, leading to impaired healing, fibrosis, and chronic ischemic atrophy. These changes may appear months or years after exposure. Despite the low sensitivity of brain cells to radiation, vascular damage after irradiation can lead to late manifestations of radiation injury in this tissue. The most important cellular target of ionizing radiation is DNA ("

The presence of osteoidand immunohistochemical analysis confirms the diagnosisof osteosarcoma. The extent of the primary tumor shouldbe delineated carefully with magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) before starting chemotherapy. Osteosarcoma tends tometastasize to the lung, most commonly, and rarely to otherbones. Metastatic evaluation includes a chest CT scan and a bone scan. The diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma is established with immunohistochemical analysis and cytogenetic and molecular diagnostic studies of the biopsy material. Ewing sarcoma is characterized by a specific chromosomal translocation, t(11;22), which is seen in 95% of tumors. MRI of the primary lesion should be performed to delineate extent of the lesion and any associated soft tissue mass. Metastatic evaluation involves a bone scan, chest CT scan, and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy."
