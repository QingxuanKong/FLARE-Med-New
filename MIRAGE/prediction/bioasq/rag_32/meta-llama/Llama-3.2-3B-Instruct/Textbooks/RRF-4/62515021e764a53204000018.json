There is general agreement that the drug must be bioactivated with the release of nitric oxide. Unlike nitroprusside and some other direct nitric oxide donors, nitroglycerin activation requires enzymatic action. Nitroglycerin can be denitrated by glutathione S-transferase in smooth muscle and other cells. A mitochondrial enzyme, aldehyde dehydrogenase isoform 2 (ALDH2) and possibly isoform 3 (ALDH3), appears to be key in the activation and release of nitric oxide from nitroglycerin and pentaerythritol tetranitrate. Different enzymes may be involved in the denitration of isosorbide dinitrate and mononitrate. Free nitrite ion is released, which is then converted to nitric oxide (see Chapter 19). Nitric oxide (probably complexed with cysteine) combines with the heme group of soluble guanylyl cyclase, activating that enzyme and causing an increase in cGMP. As shown in Figure 12\u20132,"

(C) This shows the symbol for cytochrome c reductase used throughout this chapter. (PDB code: 1EZV.) redox loop mechanism used is called the Q cycle because while one of the electrons received from each QH2 molecule istransferred from ubiquinone through the complex to the carrier protein cytochrome c, the other electron is recycled back into the quinone pool. Through the mechanism illustrated in Figure 14\u201323, the Q cycle increases the total amount of redox energy that can be stored in the electrochemical proton gradient. As a result, two protons are pumped across the crista membrane for every electron that is transferred from NADH dehydrogenase to cytochrome c."
