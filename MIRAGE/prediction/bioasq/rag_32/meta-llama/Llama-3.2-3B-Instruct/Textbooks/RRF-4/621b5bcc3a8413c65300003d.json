The matrix also has an important impact on cell signaling. Cells communicate with each other by secreting signal molecules that diffuse through the extracellular fluid to influence other cells (discussed in Chapter 15). En route to their targets, the signal molecules encounter the tightly woven meshwork of the extracellular matrix, which contains a high density of negative charges and protein-interaction domains that can interact with the signal molecules, thereby altering their function in a variety of ways."

Rapid matrix degradation is required in processes such as tissue repair, and even in the seemingly static extracellular matrix of adult animals there is a slow, continuous turnover, with matrix macromolecules being degraded and resynthesized. This allows bone, for example, to be remodeled so as to adapt to changes in the stresses on it. From the point of view of individual cells, the ability to cut through matrix is crucial in two ways: it enables them to divide while embedded in matrix, and it enables them to travel through it. Cells in connective tissues generally need to be able to stretch out in order to divide. If a cell lacks the enzymes needed to degrade the surrounding matrix, it is strongly inhibited from dividing, as well as being hindered from migrating."

If the fluid fails to cause a handkerchief to stiffen on drying, a spinal fluid leak is suspected. The most specific and sensitive test for CSF otorrhea and rhinorrhea may be the finding of \u03b22-transferrin (tau), in fluid collected in a polypropylene tube, a substance not found in fluids other than CSF."
