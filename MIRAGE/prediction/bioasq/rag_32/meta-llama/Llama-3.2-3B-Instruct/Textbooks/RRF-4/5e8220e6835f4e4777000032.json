From Document [0], we know that uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (URO decarboxylase) catalyzes the sequential removal of the four carboxyl groups from the acetic acid side chains of URO gen III to form coproporphyrinogen (COPRO gen) III. This compound then enters the mitochondrion via a specific transporter, ABCB6. From Document [1], we know that coproporphyrinogen III enters the mitochondrion, and two propionate side chains are decarboxylated by coproporphyrinogen III oxidase to vinyl groups generating protoporphyrinogen IX. This suggests that protoporphyrinogen oxidase, the enzyme responsible for converting protoporphyrinogen IX to protoporphyrin IX, is indeed localized to the mitochondrion. From Document [1], we can see that COPRO oxidase, the sixth enzyme, catalyzes the decarboxylation of two of the four propionic acid groups to form the two vinyl groups of protoporphyrinogen (PROTO gen) IX, a decarboxylate porphyrinogen, which is a clear indication that protoporphyrinogen oxidase is localized to the mitochondrion.

It accepts electrons from NADH and passes them through a flavin mononucleotide and eight iron\u2013sulfur clusters to the lipid-soluble electron carrier ubiquinone. The reduced ubiquinol then transfers its electrons to cytochrome c reductase. 2. The cytochrome c reductase (also called the cytochrome b-c1 complex) is a large membrane protein assembly that functions as a dimer. Each monomer contains three cytochrome hemes and an iron\u2013sulfur cluster. The complex accepts electrons from ubiquinol and passes them on to the small, soluble protein cytochrome c, which is located in the crista space and carries electrons one at a time to cytochrome c oxidase. 3."

Correct answer = E. The disease is associated with a deficiency in uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase (UROD), but clinical expression of the enzyme deficiency is influenced by hepatic injury caused by environmental (for example, ethanol) and infectious (for example, hepatitis B virus) agents. Exposure to sunlight can also be a precipitating factor. Clinical onset is typically during the fourth or fifth decade of life. Porphyrin accumulation leads to cutaneous symptoms and urine that is red to brown. Treatment of the patient\u2019s seizure disorder with phenytoin caused increased synthesis of \u03b4aminolevulinic acid synthase and, therefore, of uroporphyrinogen, the substrate of the deficient UROD. The laboratory and clinical findings are inconsistent with other porphyrias."

In general, individuals with an enzyme defect prior to the synthesis of the tetrapyrroles manifest abdominal and neuropsychiatric signs, whereas those with enzyme defects leading to the accumulation of tetrapyrrole intermediates show photosensitivity (that is, their skin itches and burns [pruritus] when exposed to sunlight). [Note: Photosensitivity is a result of the oxidation of colorless porphyrinogens to colored porphyrins, which are photosensitizing molecules thought to participate in the formation of superoxide radicals from oxygen. These radicals can oxidatively damage membranes and cause the release of destructive enzymes from lysosomes.] a. Chronic hepatic porphyria: Porphyria cutanea tarda, the most common porphyria, is a chronic disease of the liver. The disease is associated with severe deficiency of UROD, but clinical expression of the deficiency is influenced by various factors, such as"
