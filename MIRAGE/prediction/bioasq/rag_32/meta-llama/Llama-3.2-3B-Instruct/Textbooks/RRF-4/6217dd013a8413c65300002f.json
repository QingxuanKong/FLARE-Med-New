This \u201cinside-out\u201d integrin-activation process generally depends on intracellular regulatory signals that stimulate the ability of talin and other proteins to interact with the \u03b2 chain of the integrin. Talin competes with the integrin \u03b1 chain for its binding site on the tail of the \u03b2 chain. Thus, when talin binds to the \u03b2 chain, it blocks the intracellular \u03b1\u2013\u03b2linkage, allowing the two legs of the integrin molecule to spring apart. The regulation of \u201cinside-out\u201d integrin activation is particularly well understood in platelets, where an extracellular signal protein called thrombin binds to a specific G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) on the cell surface and thereby activates an intracellular signaling pathway that leads to integrin activation (Figure 19\u201358).

In some cases, activation occurs by an \u201coutside-in\u201d mechanism: the binding of an external matrix protein, such as the RGD sequence of fibronectin, can drive some integrins to switch from the low-affinity inactive state to the high-affinity active state. As a result, binding sites for talin and other cytoplasmic adaptor proteins are exposed on the tail of the \u03b2 chain. The binding of these adaptor proteins then leads to attachment of actin filaments to the intracellular end of the integrin molecule (see Figure 19\u201355). In this way, when the integrin catches hold of its ligand outside the cell, the cell reacts by tying the integrin molecule to the cytoskeleton, so that force can be applied at the point of cell attachment."

Most integrins connect to actin filaments, while those at hemidesmosomes bind to intermediate filaments. Integrin molecules are heterodimers, and the binding of extracellular matrix ligands or intracellular activator proteins such as talin results in a dramatic conformational switch from an inactive to an active state. This creates an allosteric coupling between binding to matrix outside the cell and binding to the cytoskeleton inside it, allowing the integrin to convey signals in both directions across the plasma membrane.

            "content": "cD4 and cD8 co-receptors on T cells Bind to Invariant parts of Mhc proteins The affinity of TCRs for peptide\u2013MHC complexes on an APC is usually too low by itself to mediate a functional interaction between the two cells. T cells normally require accessory receptors to help stabilize the interaction by increasing the overall strength of the cell\u2013cell adhesion. Unlike TCRs or MHC proteins, the accessory receptors are invariant and do not bind to foreign peptides. Once bound to the surface of a dendritic cell, for example, a T cell increases the strength of the binding by activating an integrin adhesion protein (discussed in Chapter 19), which then binds more strongly to an Ig-like protein on the surface of the dendritic cell. This increased adhesion enables the T cell to remain bound long enough to become activated."
