Chlorotoxin is a protein found in the venom of the newt, not a peptide. It is a small, secreted protein that acts as a neurotoxin, disrupting the normal functioning of neurons. Since chlorotoxin is a protein, not an amino acid or a polypeptide, it does not qualify as a peptide.

A vast number of variations are possible with even a small number of amino acids in peptides, and peptides make up only one of a broad array of toxic compounds. For example, the predatory marine snail genus Conus includes over 3000 different species. Each species kills or paralyzes its prey with a venom that contains 50\u2013200 different peptides or proteins. Furthermore, there is little duplication of peptides among Conus species. Other animals with useful toxins include snakes, frogs, spiders, bees, wasps, and scorpions. Plant spe-cies with toxic (or therapeutic) substances are referred to in several other chapters of this book. Since many toxins act on ion channels, they provide a wealth of chemical tools for studying the function of these channels. In fact, much of our current understanding of the properties of ion channels comes from studies utilizing only a small percentage of the highly potent and selective toxins that are"

Therefore, all amino acid sequences are read from the N-to the C-terminal end. For example, in Figure 2.2A, the order of the amino acids in the dipeptide is valine, alanine. Linkage of \u226550 amino acids through peptide bonds results in an unbranched chain called a polypeptide, or protein. Each component amino acid is called a residue because it is the portion of the amino acid remaining after the atoms of water are lost in the formation of the peptide bond. When a peptide is named, all amino acid residues have their suffixes (-ine, -an, -ic, or -ate) changed to -yl, with the exception of the C-terminal amino acid. For example, a tripeptide composed of an N-terminal valine, a glycine, and a C-terminal leucine is called valylglycylleucine. 2."

Different types of toxins induce cell injury by two general mechanism: Direct-acting toxins. Some toxins act directly by combining with a critical molecular component or cellular organelle. For example, in mercuric chloride poisoning (as may occur from ingestion of contaminated seafood) (Chapter 8), mercury binds to the sulfhydryl groups of various cell membraneproteins, causinginhibition ofATP-dependent transport and increased membrane permeability. Many anti-neoplastic chemotherapeutic agents also induce cell damage by direct cytotoxic effects. Also included in this class are toxins made by microorganisms (described in Chapter 9). These often cause damage by targeting host cell molecules that are needed for essential functions, such as protein synthesis and ion transport."
