Verubecestat, an inhibitor of beta-site amyloid pre cursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE1), reduces the production of amyloid \u03b2. This drug showed safety in an early clinical trial, and longer-term phase 3 trials for efficacy are under way. Another effort suggests that the accumulation of filamentous tangles of tau protein is a critical component of neuronal damage in Alzheimer\u2019s and several other neurodegenerative conditions.

The finding of a reduced number and enlargement of synapses in affected cortex early in the disease by DeKosky and Scheff and others could be interpreted as either the first sign of neuronal death or the result of the neuronal loss. Amyloid deposition would then be a later, secondary phenomenon. One hypothesis is that Alzheimer disease is a disorder of synaptic failure, as summarized by Querfurth and LaFerla. They summarize some of the subcellular derangements that may connect amyloid or tau deposition to neuronal cell loss; these include abnormal calcium regulation, inflammation, insulin signaling, cholesterol metabolism and aberrant cell-cycle reentry. These are complex and uncertain connections but they are among the most promising findings in this field of research."

            "content": "The major degenerative dementias include AD, DLB, FTD and related disorders, HD, and prion diseases, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). These disorders are all associated with the abnormal aggregation of a specific protein: A\u03b242 and tau in AD; \u03b1-synuclein in DLB; tau, TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), or fused in sarcoma (FUS) in FTD; huntingtin in HD; and misfolded prion protein (PrPsc) in CJD (Table 35-2). APPROACH TO THE PATIENT: Three major issues should be kept at the forefront: (1) What is the best fit for a clinical diagnosis? (2) What component of the dementia syndrome is treatable or reversible? (3) Can the physician help to alleviate the burden on caregivers? A broad overview of the approach to dementia is shown in Table 35-3. The major degenerative dementias can usually be distinguished by the initial symptoms; neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric, and neurologic findings; and neuroimaging features (Table 35-4)."

            "content": "The effect of the currently used cholinergic precursors and agonists and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, is modest. With regard to the latter group of drugs, several large trials have demonstrated a slight prolongation of the patient\u2019s ability to sustain an independent life, but such evidence generally requires that the medications be taken for 6 to 12 months. For example, a meta-analysis of the drugs collectively demonstrated a mean improvement of 2 to 3 points on the 70-point Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale and a slight delay in progression. Despite some trials that have failed to demonstrate benefit (c.f., AD 2000 Collaborative Group), the balance of evidence probably favors the use of these medications in practice, but only in mildly or moderately affected patients."

            "content": "using ginkgo found no slowing of progression to dementia in the treated group. Vaccination against A\u03b242 has proved highly efficacious in mouse models of AD, helping clear brain amyloid and preventing further amyloid accumulation. In human trials, this approach led to life-threatening complications, including meningoencephalitis, in a minority of patients. Another experimental approach to AD treatment has been the use of \u03b2 and \u03b3 secretase inhibitors that diminish the production of A\u03b242, but the first two placebo-controlled trials of \u03b3 secretase inhibitors, tarenflurbil and semagacestat, were negative, and semagacestat may have accelerated cognitive decline compared to placebo. Passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies against A\u03b242 has been tried in mild to moderate AD. These studies were negative, leading some to suggest that the patients treated were too advanced to respond to amyloid-lowering therapies. Therefore, new trials have started in asymptomatic individuals with mild"
