They include (1) the emergence of methotrexate as the disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) of first choice for the treatment of early RA; (2) the development of novel highly efficacious biologicals that can be used alone or in combination with methotrexate; and (3) the proven superiority of combination DMARD regimens over methotrexate alone. The medications used for the treatment of RA may be divided into broad categories: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); glucocorticoids, such as prednisone and methylprednisolone; conventional DMARDs; and biologic DMARDs (Table 380-2). Although disease for some patients with RA is managed adequately with a single DMARD, such as methotrexate, the situation in most cases demands the use of a combination DMARD regimen that may vary in its components over the treatment course depending on fluctuations in disease activity and emergence of"

Failure to achieve adequate improvement with methotrexate therapy calls for a change in DMARD therapy, usually transition to an effective combination regimen. Effective combinations include: methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine (oral triple therapy); methotrexate and leflunomide; and methotrexate plus a biological. The combination of methotrexate and an anti-TNF agent, for example, has been shown in randomized, controlled trials to be superior to methotrexate alone not only for reducing signs and symptoms of disease, but also for retarding the progression of structural joint damage. Predicting which patients will ultimately show radiologic joint damage is imprecise at best, although some factors such as an elevated serum level of acute-phase reactants, high burden of joint inflammation, and the presence of erosive disease are associated with increased"

The conventional DMARDs include hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, and leflunomide; they exhibit a delayed onset of action of approximately 6\u201312 weeks. Methotrexate is the DMARD of choice for the treatment of RA and is the anchor drug for most combination therapies. It was approved for the treatment of RA in 1986 and remains the benchmark for the efficacy and safety of new disease-modifying therapies. At the dosages used for the treatment of RA, methotrexate has been shown to stimulate adenosine release from cells, producing an anti-inflammatory effect. The clinical efficacy of leflunomide, an inhibitor of pyrimidine synthesis, appears similar to that of methotrexate; it has been shown in well-designed trials to be effective for the treatment of RA as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate and other DMARDs."

Folate supplementation reduces the risk of these events without impairing the anti-inflammatory action.

Although there are data indicating that low-dose corticosteroids have disease-modifying properties, particularly in the early phase of RA, their toxicity makes them less favored than other medications, when it is possible to use the others. However, the glucocorticoids continue to have a significant role in the long-term treatment of arthritis. Another important group of agents are characterized as disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including biologics (a subset of the DMARDs). They decrease inflammation, improve symptoms, and slow the bone damage associated with RA. They affect more basic inflammatory mechanisms than do glucocorticoids or the NSAIDs.

AICAR, which accumulates intracellularly, competitively inhibits AMP deaminase, leading to an accumulation of AMP. The AMP is released and converted extracellularly to adenosine, which is a potent inhibitor of inflammation. As a result, the inflammatory functions of neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes are suppressed. Methotrexate has secondary effects on polymorphonuclear chemotaxis. There is some effect on dihydrofolate reductase and this affects lymphocyte and macrophage function, but this is not its principal mechanism of action. Methotrexate has direct inhibitory effects on proliferation and stimulates apoptosis in immune-inflammatory cells. Additionally, it inhibits proinflammatory cytokines linked to rheumatoid"

They do make a distinction between patients with early RA (<6 months of disease duration) and patients with established RA. These guidelines highlight the need to switch or add DMARD therapy after 3 months of worsening or persistent moderate/high disease activity. If disease still persists after 3 months of intense DMARD therapy, addition of a biologic agent is warranted. Treatment with a biologic agent or aggressive combination DMARD therapy was also recommended as initial therapy in certain patients with high disease activity and poor prognosis. However, it has not been clearly established that this more intensive initial approach is superior to starting with methotrexate alone and, in the absence of an inadequate therapeutic response, moving rapidly to combination therapy."

            "content": "2. Pharmacokinetics: Leflunomide is completely absorbed from the gut and has a mean plasma half-life of 19 days. Its active metabolite, A77-1726, has approximately the same half-life and is subject to enterohepatic recirculation. Cholestyramine can enhance leflunomide excretion and increases total clearance by approximately 50%. 3. Indications: Leflunomide is as effective as methotrexate in RA, including inhibition of bony damage. In one study, combined treatment with methotrexate and leflunomide resulted in a 46.2% ACR20 response compared with 19.5% in patients receiving methotrexate alone. 4."

            "content": "Other cytotoxic agents, including methotrexate, vincristine, and cytarabine (see Chapter 54), also have immunosuppressive properties. Methotrexate has been used extensively in rheumatoid arthritis (see Chapter 36) and in the treatment of GVH disease. Although the other agents can be used for immunosuppression, their use has not been as widespread as the purine antagonists, and their indications for immunosuppression are less certain. The use of methotrexate (which can be given orally) appears reasonable in patients with idiosyncratic reactions to purine antagonists. The antibiotic dactinomycin has also been used with some success at the time of impending renal transplant rejection. Vincristine appears to be quite useful in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura refractory to prednisone. The related vinca alkaloid vinblastine has been shown to prevent mast cell degranulation in vitro by binding to microtubule units within the cell and to prevent release of histamine and other vasoactive"

Studies suggest that conventional DMARDs and biologic agents are equally effective and safe in younger and older patients. Due to comorbidities, many elderly patients have an increased risk of infection. Aging alsoleadstoagradualdeclineinrenalfunctionthatmayraisetherisk for side effects from NSAIDs and some DMARDS, such as methotrexate. Renal function must be taken into consideration before prescribing methotrexate, which is mostly cleared by the kidneys. To reduce the risks of side effects, methotrexate doses may need to be adjusted downward for the drop in renal function that usually comes with the seventh and eighth decades of life. Methotrexate is usually not prescribed for patients with a serum creatinine greater Jonathan R. Carapetis than 2 mg/dL."

            "content": "Ideally, coordinated therapy is directed at both the skin and joints in PsA. As described above for AS, use of the anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents has revolutionized the treatment of PsA. Prompt and dramatic resolution of both arthritis and skin lesions has been observed in large, randomized controlled trials of etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab. Many of the responding patients had long-standing disease that was resistant to all previous therapy, as well as extensive skin disease. The clinical response is often more dramatic than in RA, and delay of disease progression has been demonstrated radiographically. The potential additive effect of methotrexate to anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents in PsA remains uncertain. As noted above, anti-TNF therapy, paradoxically, has been reported to trigger exacerbation or de novo appearance of psoriasis, typically the palmoplantar pustular variety. In some cases, the therapy can nevertheless be continued."
