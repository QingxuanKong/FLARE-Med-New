    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the information provided in the documents about the effect of grapefruit juice on CYP enzymes. Grapefruit juice is known to inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme, but the question asks about CYP1A2. While there is no direct information in the provided documents about the specific effect of grapefruit juice on CYP1A2, we can make an educated inference based on the general information about grapefruit juice's effect on CYP3A4 and other related CYP enzymes. It is likely that grapefruit juice may also inhibit CYP1A2, given its broad inhibitory effects on CYP3A4 and other related enzymes. However, the information is not explicitly stated in the documents. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided information is not explicitly supported and should be treated with caution. However, given the general knowledge about grapefruit juice's inhibitory effects on CYP enzymes, the most likely answer would be that grapefruit juice inhibits CYP1A2, but this is not confirmed by the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

An individual who has recently been prescribed a drug (atorvastatin) to lower cholesterol levels is advised to limit consumption of grapefruit juice, because high intake of the juice reportedly results in an increased level of the drug in the blood, increasing the risk of side effects. Atorvastatin is a substrate for the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4, and grapefruit juice inhibits the enzyme. Which statement concerning CYP enzymes is most likely correct? They: A. accept electrons from reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. B. catalyze the hydroxylation of hydrophobic molecules. C. differ from nitric oxide synthase in that they contain heme.

Irreversible inhibitors bind to enzymes through covalent bonds. Lead, for example, forms covalent bonds with the sulfhydryl side chain of cysteine in proteins. Ferrochelatase, an enzyme involved in heme synthesis (see p. 279), is irreversibly inhibited by lead.

            "content": "B. Noncompetitive inhibition This type of inhibition is recognized by its characteristic effect on Vmax (Fig. 5.14). Noncompetitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor and substrate bind at different sites on the enzyme. The noncompetitive inhibitor can bind either free enzyme or the enzyme\u2013substrate complex, thereby preventing the reaction from occurring (Fig. 5.15). 1. Effect on Vmax: Noncompetitive inhibition cannot be overcome by increasing the concentration of substrate. Therefore, noncompetitive inhibitors decrease the apparent Vmax of the reaction. 2. Effect on Km: Noncompetitive inhibitors do not interfere with the binding of substrate to enzyme. Therefore, the enzyme shows the same Km in the presence or absence of the noncompetitive inhibitor, that is, Km is unchanged. 3."

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): [P] Fluoxetine and paroxetine inhibit CYP2D6 and decrease metabolism of antidepressants metabolized by this enzyme (eg, desipramine). Citalopram, sertraline, and fluvoxamine are only weak inhibitors of CYP2D6, but fluvoxamine inhibits CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 and thus can inhibit the metabolism of antidepressants metabolized by these enzymes. Sympathomimetics: [P] Increased pressor response to norepinephrine, epinephrine, and phenylephrine. Terbinafine: [P] Decreased antidepressant metabolism. Antivirals: [P] Decreased metabolism of amprenavir, atazanavir, boceprevir, daclatasvir, darunavir, delavirdine, etravirine, fosamprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, maraviroc, nelfinavir, rilpivirine, ritonavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir."

They mediate allergic response. Their synthesis is inhibited by cortisol and not by aspirin. glycosphingolipids, and eicosanoids. PLA2 = phospholipase A2; = sulfate ion; NSAID = nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Choose the ONE best answer. 7.1. Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a severe reaction to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) characterized by bronchoconstriction 30 minutes to several hours after ingestion. Which of the following statements best explains the symptoms seen in patients with AERD? NSAID: A. inhibit the activity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein, resulting in thickened mucus that block airways. B. inhibit cyclooxygenase but not lipoxygenase, resulting in the flow of arachidonic acid to leukotriene synthesis."

            "content": "P450 enzymes may also be induced by substrate stabilization, eg, decreased degradation, as is the case with troleandomycinor clotrimazole-mediated induction of CYP3A enzymes, the ethanol-mediated induction of CYP2E1, and the isosafrole-mediated induction of CYP1A2. Certain drug substrates inhibit cytochrome P450 enzyme activity (Table 4\u20132). Imidazole-containing drugs such as cimetidine and ketoconazole bind tightly to the P450 heme iron and effectively reduce the metabolism of endogenous substrates (eg, testosterone) or other co-administered drugs through competitive inhibition. Macrolide antibiotics such as troleandomycin, erythromycin, and erythromycin derivatives are metabolized, apparently by CYP3A, to metabolites that complex the cytochrome P450 heme iron and render it catalytically inactive. Another compound that acts through this mechanism is the inhibitor proadifen (SKF-525-A, used in research), which binds tightly to the heme iron and TABLE 4\u20131 Phase I reactions."
