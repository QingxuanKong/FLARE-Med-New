Propranolol and penbutolol are quite lipophilic and readily cross the blood-brain barrier (Table 10\u20132). Most \u03b2 antagonists have half-lives in the range of 3\u201310 hours. A major exception is esmolol, which is rapidly hydrolyzed and has a half-life of approximately 10 minutes. Propranolol and metoprolol are extensively metabolized in the liver, with little unchanged drug appearing in the urine. The CYP2D6 genotype is a major determinant of interindividual differences in metoprolol plasma clearance (see Chapters 4 and 5). Poor metabolizers exhibit threefold to tenfold higher plasma concentrations after administration of metoprolol than extensive metabolizers. Atenolol, celiprolol, and pindolol are less completely metabolized. Nadolol is excreted unchanged in the urine and has the longest half-life of any available \u03b2 antagonist (up to 24 hours).

Combination of a known CYP2D6 inhibitor and a TCA in a patient who is a slow metabolizer may result in markedly increased effects. Such an interaction has been implicated, though rarely, in cases of TCA toxicity.

In the case of drugs with beta-blocking properties metabolized by CYP2D6, greater signs of beta blockade (e.g., bronchospasm, bradycardia) are seen in PM subjects than in EMs. This can be seen not only with orally administered beta blockers such as metoprolol and carvedilol, but also with ophthalmic timolol and with the sodium channel\u2013blocking antiarrhythmic propafenone, a CYP2D6 substrate with beta-blocking properties. Ultra-rapid metabolizers may require very high dosages of tricyclic antidepressants to achieve a therapeutic effect and, with codeine, may display transient euphoria and nausea due to very rapid generation of morphine.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): [P] Fluoxetine and paroxetine inhibit CYP2D6 and decrease metabolism of antidepressants metabolized by this enzyme (eg, desipramine). Citalopram, sertraline, and fluvoxamine are only weak inhibitors of CYP2D6, but fluvoxamine inhibits CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 and thus can inhibit the metabolism of antidepressants metabolized by these enzymes.

Since ANG II increases TGF-\u03b2 levels, it was reasoned that blockade of the reninangiotensin system might be beneficial in Marfan\u2019s syndrome. Clinical studies indicate that the ARB losartan may be as effective as atenolol, the standard treatment for this syndrome."

            "content": "Gene arrays combined with immunoblotting analyses of microsomal preparations, as well as the use of relatively selective functional markers and selective P450 inhibitors, have identified numerous P450 isoforms (CYP: 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, 3A5, 4A11, and 7) in the human liver. Of these, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 appear to be the most important forms, accounting for approximately 15%, 4%, 1%, 20%, 5%, 10%, and 30%, respectively, of the total human liver P450 content. Together, they are responsible for catalyzing the bulk of the hepatic drug and xenobiotic metabolism (Table 4\u20132, Figure 4\u20134)."

Neurally mediated syncope (neurocardiogenic or vasodepressor syncope), identified largely by the clinical circumstances and by tilt-table testing, may be prevented by the use of \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agents. Our colleagues in cardiology have recently favored acebutolol 400 mg daily, in part because of its partial \u03b1-adrenergic activity, which raises baseline blood pressure, but atenolol 50 mg may be as effective. The anticholinergic agent disopyramide has also been used (Milstein et al). Several other drugs (e.g., ephedrine, metoclopramide, dihydroergotamine) have been variably successful in individual patients, but their utility as standard medications remains to be established; the \u03b2-blocking agents are generally preferred."

            "content": "This is mainly due to lack of absorption from the gut. Other drugs are either too hydrophilic (eg, atenolol) or too lipophilic (eg, acyclovir) to be absorbed easily, and their low bioavailability is also due to incomplete absorption. If too hydrophilic, the drug cannot cross the lipid cell membrane; if too lipophilic, the drug is not soluble enough to cross the water layer adjacent to the cell. Drugs may not be absorbed because of a reverse transporter associated with P-glycoprotein. This process actively pumps drug out of gut wall cells back into the gut lumen. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein and gut wall metabolism, eg, by grapefruit juice, may be associated with substantially increased drug absorption. B. First-Pass Elimination"
