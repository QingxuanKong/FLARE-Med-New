The documents mention other TKIs like erlotinib, gefitinib, crizotinib, and sunitinib, but not capmatinib.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the available information, we cannot conclude that capmatinib is effective for glioblastoma. The correct answer is not explicitly stated in the provided documents, and we cannot make a definitive conclusion about its effectiveness.\\n\\nHowever, since the question requires a choice from the options A (yes) or B (no), and given the lack of information about capmatinib in the provided documents, the most appropriate answer would be B (no), indicating that capmatinib is not mentioned or shown to be effective for glioblastoma in the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Other early changes include overexpression of genes that control growth factors or their receptors as noted below. After the tumor develops, progression to a more malignant grade of astrocytoma or to a glioblastoma may be triggered by defects causing overexpression of the epidermal growth factor gene. In fact, it is striking that analysis of the patterns of these defects in some tumors correlates with the staging and aggressive characteristics of these tumors.

Like the other IMiDs, it has myriad mechanisms of actions including antiangiogenic activity, inhibition of TNF-\u03b1, and stimulation of apoptosis and cytotoxic T-cell activity. Most clinical trials of pomalidomide have targeted patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, for which the FDA approved the drug in 2013. Both lenalidomide and pomalidomide have side effect profiles similar to that of thalidomide."

            "content": "It had been considered for several decades that the addition of chemotherapeutic nitrosourea agents such as carmustine (BCNU) or lomustine (CCNU) increases survival slightly. Cisplatin and carboplatin have provided similar small marginal improvements in survival beyond that obtained by debulking and radiation therapy. Several randomized trials, however, have failed to show substantial benefit of chemotherapy but the Glioma Meta-analysis Trialists (GMT) Group had concluded in 2002 that there was a clear but quite small benefit of chemotherapy."

Fasting cycles are as effective as chemotherapy against certain tumors in mice. In combination with chemotherapy, fasting protected mice against the negative side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs, while it enhanced their efficacy against tumors. Combining fasting and chemotherapy rendered 20\u201360% of mice cancer-free when inoculated with highly aggressive tumors like glioblastoma or pancreatic tumors, which have 100% mortality even with chemotherapy. This approach has been attempted in people with some indication that toxicities of chemotherapy are reduced. Pharmacologic Interventions to Delay Aging and Increase Lifespan"
