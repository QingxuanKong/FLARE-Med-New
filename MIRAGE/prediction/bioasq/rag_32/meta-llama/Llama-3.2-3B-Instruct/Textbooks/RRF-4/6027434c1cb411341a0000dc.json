Gabapentin plus amitriptyline was more efficacious than amitriptyline alone (139). Local anesthetics are sodium channel blockers and they downgrade nerve firing. Ilioinguinal iliohypogastric, pudendal, nerve blocks and trigger point injections can be easily learned by the gynecologist and used liberally where appropriate to down-regulate neural signaling (11). Women with depression should be treated with an appropriate therapeutic dose of antidepressant medication. Psychiatry can be consulted in this setting."

CPP is an inclusive, general term that encompasses many more specific causes, ranging from reproductive, gastrointestinal, and urinary tract etiologies to myofascial pain and nerve entrapment syndromes. Chronic pelvic pain affects 12% to 20% of women in the United States. The differential diagnosis of CPP is outlined in Table 16.3. Nongynecologic causes of pain, such as irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, abdominal wall or pelvic \ufb02oor myofascial syndrome, or neuropathy, are frequently overlooked but common causes of chronic pelvic pain. This can in part explain why 60% to 80% of patients undergoing laparoscopy for chronic pelvic pain have no intraperitoneal pathology (2)."

The patient should be instructed to complete a daily pain ratings form after her first office visit. This form provides the clinician and patient with important information for pain management. Pain level (0\u201310), vaginal bleeding, and events that trigger pain such as stress, foods, and certain physical activities are recorded. The pain ratings can encourage the patient\u2019s sense of control and decrease feelings of helplessness. Daily recording improves self-efficacy and compliance, allows for diagnosis of atypical cyclic pain (luteal as opposed to menstrual), and helps the patient to recognize the connection between pain and stressors. The ratings should be reviewed at follow-up visits."

Capsaicin is a nonnarcotic that promotes release of substance P, a neurotransmitter for pain and heat, which initially results in a burning sensation, but eventually leads to substance P depletion and a reduction in pain. It is available in both topical and injectable preparations. Ketamine blocks centrally located N-methyld-aspartate pain receptors, and at low subanesthetic doses can reduce central sensitization caused by surgery and prevent opioid-induced hyperalgesia. At higher doses, ketamine is associated with hallucinations, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Gabapentin and pregabalin are nonnarcotics that prevent the release of excitatory neurotransmitters that relay pain signals. They reduce opioid requirements and are effective antihyperalgesic agents (64)."

The shared thoracolumbar and sacral innervations of the pelvic structures and the up-regulation processing of neural input in the central nervous system account for the multiplicity of somatic and psychological symptoms experienced by women with chronic pelvic pain. A thorough history and physical examination are important for successful management of both chronic and acute pain. The ancillary laboratory and diagnostic procedures performed to assess acute, life-threatening processes differ from those focused on chronic pain conditions. Chronic pelvic pain requires a multidisciplinary approach for both diagnosis and management."

Sustained pressure with adequate force to a trigger point for a specified period can inactivate the irritable nerve (129). NSAIDs, gabapentin, pregabalin, low-dose TCAs, and benzodiazepines may be useful in patients requiring pharmacologic interventions. Injection of the trigger point with 3 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine provides relief that usually outlasts the duration of the anesthetic action. After four to five biweekly injections, the procedure should be abandoned if long-lasting relief is not obtained.

A low dose of a tricyclic antidepressant, various anticonvulsants, or selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are often effective, especially if combined with cognitive behavioral therapy. These pharmacologic agents lower the threshold for nerve firing and can help reduce reliance on narcotic pain medication, increasing activity and relieving the impact the pain has on the women\u2019s overall lifestyle (11). Only one small, randomized controlled trial looked at the effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on pelvic pain, and failed to show a significant difference in pain or functional ability in a short follow-up period (138)."

Trigger points are possibly initiated by pathogenic autonomic re\ufb02ex of visceral or muscular origin and are painful on compression (124\u2013126). The referred pain of the trigger point occurs in a dermatomal distribution and may be caused by nerves from the muscle or deeper structures sharing a common second-order neuron in the spinal cord. The patient can experience weakness and restriction in range of motion of the affected muscle. Physical therapy is a mainstay (127).

            "content": "On the first visit, a thorough pain history should be performed, taking into consideration the nature of each pain symptom: location, radiation, severity, aggravating and alleviating factors; effect of menstrual cycle, stress, work, exercise, intercourse, and orgasm; the context in which pain arose; and the social and occupational toll of the pain (Table 16.4). A visual or verbal analog pain scale to record pain severity 0 through 10 and stating \u201cno pain\u201d and \u201cworst possible pain\u201d is important in assessing the severity of pain and comparing the changes in severity over subsequent visits. The evaluation should include a comprehensive questionnaire that addresses depression, anxiety, emotional, physical and sexual trauma, quality of life, and criteria to assist with the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome and interstitial cystitis or bladder pain syndrome. The International Pelvic Pain Society published a comprehensive pain assessment tool in order to facilitate the history and"

Shooting, stabbing pain also responds to some degree to anticonvulsant drugs but only modest effects can be expected. Gabapentin may give reasonable results, perhaps in part because high doses are tolerated (Gorson et al, 1999). Topical creams with capsaicin, lidocaine or other substances, or compounds with several of these (including ketorolac, gabapentin, ketamine) have been found helpful by a few patients but do not have support in randomized trials. Nerve blocks and epidural injections have been helpful in very few patients. In the proximal asymmetrical, truncal, or ophthalmoplegic neuropathies, the severe pain usually lasts for only a short period and requires the judicious use of analgesics, as outlined in Chap. 7. The course in"
