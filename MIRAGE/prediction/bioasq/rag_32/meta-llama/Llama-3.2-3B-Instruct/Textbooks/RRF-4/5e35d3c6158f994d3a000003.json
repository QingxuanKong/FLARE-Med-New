In most cases, mutations affecting both TP53 alleles are acquired in somatic cells.

These mainly involve loss of p53, the key component of early steps in the intrinsic pathway, and increased expression of anti-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family. Loss of TP53 function. As already discussed, TP53 is commonly mutated in cancers at diagnosis, and the frequency of TP53 mutations is even higher in tumors that relapse after therapy. In addition to mutation of TP53, other lesions in cancers impair p53 function indirectly, most notably amplification of MDM2, which encodes an inhibitor of p53. Loss of p53 function prevents the upregulation of PUMA, a pro-apoptotic BH3-only member of the BCL2 family that is a direct target of p53. As a result, cells survive levels of DNA damage and cell stress that otherwise would result in their death."

Then p53 stops cell cycle progression by activating CDK inhibitors such as p21 and/or initiating the apoptosis pathway. Not surprisingly given its critical role in controlling cell cycle progression, mutations in the gene for p53 on chromosome 17p are found in more than 50% of human cancers. Most commonly these mutations are acquired in the malignant tissue in one allele and the second allele is deleted, leaving the cell unprotected from DNA-damaging agents or oncogenes. Some environmental exposures produce signature mutations in p53; for example, aflatoxin exposure leads to mutation of arginine to serine at codon 249 and leads to hepatocellular carcinoma.

Tumor cells, unlike normal cells, are capable of limitless replication. As discussed previously in the context of cellular aging (Chapter 2), most normal human cells have a capacity of at most 70 doublings. Thereafter, the cells lose the ability to divide and enter replicative senescence. This phenomenon has been ascribed to progressive shortening of telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. Markedly eroded telomeres are recognized by the DNA repair machinery as double-stranded DNA breaks, leading to cell cycle arrest and senescence, mediated by TP53 and RB. In cells in which TP53 or RB mutations are disabled by mutations, the nonhomologous end-joining pathway is activated in a last-ditch effort to save the cell, joining the shortened ends of two chromosomes."

By blocking the kinase activity of these Cdk complexes, the p21 protein prevents the cell from progressing through S phase and replicating its DNA.

Because p53 binds to DNA as a tetramer, a single mutant subunit within a tetrameric complex can be enough to block its function. Thus, mutations in p53 can have a dominant negative effect, causing loss of p53 function even when the cell also contains a wild-type version of the gene.

            "content": "A-Raf, B-Raf (BRAF), and C-Raf. Mutations in BRAF also have been implicated in aberrant MAPK pathway activation and tumorigenesis. Of the various identified BRAF mutations, T1799A (V600E amino acid substitution) is the most common and occurs frequently in thyroid cancers. Interestingly, BRAF mutations occur in papillary and anaplastic tumors (aver-age prevalence of 44% and 22%, respectively),23 but not in fol-licular thyroid cancers, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of these malignancies. Studies also show that BRAF mutations are associated with more aggressive clinicopathologic features, including larger tumor size, invasion, and lymphadenopathy, and may have a role as prognostic markers.The p53 gene is a tumor suppressor gene encoding a transcriptional regulator, which causes cell cycle arrest allow-ing repair of damaged DNA, thus helping to maintain genomic integrity. Mutations of p53 are rare in PTCs but common in undifferentiated thyroid cancers and thyroid cancer cell"

            "content": "The oncogenic potential of HPV can be related to products of two early viral genes, E6 and E7 ( Fig. 6.33 ), each of which has several activities that are pro-oncogenic. Oncogenic activities of E6. The E6 protein binds to and mediates the degradation of p53, and also stimulates the expression of TERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, which you will recall contributes to the immortalization of cells. E6 from high-risk HPV types has a higher affinity for p53 than E6 from low-risk HPV types, a property that is likely to contribute to oncogenesis."
