Recently, however, this perception has changed based on preliminary results of studies using monoclonal antibodies that activate antitumor immunity through blockade of immune checkpoints. For example, ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody directed at cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), was studied in combination with paclitaxel plus carboplatin in patients with both SCLC and NSCLC. There appeared to be a small but not statistically significant advantage to the combination when ipilimumab was instituted after several cycles of chemotherapy. A randomized phase III trial in SCLC is under way to validate these data. Antibodies to the T cell programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1), nivolumab and pembrolizumab, have been shown to produce responses in lung cancer, renal cell cancer, and melanoma.

These driver mutations occur in genes encoding signaling proteins that, when aberrant, drive initiation and maintenance of tumor cells. Importantly, driver mutations can serve as Achilles\u2019 heels for tumors, if their gene products can be targeted therapeutically with small-molecule inhibitors. For example, EGFR mutations have been detected in 10\u201315% of North American patients diagnosed with NSCLC. EGFR mutations are associated with younger age, light (<10 pack-year) and nonsmokers, and adenocarcinoma histology.

Recent studies have shown superior clinical activity when cisplatin and gemcitabine are combined with the anti-EGFR antibody necitumumab when compared to the cisplatin-gemcitabine combination in the first-line treatment of metastatic disease. In 2015, the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab was approved to treat metastatic squamous cell NSCLC whose cancer has progressed during or after standard platinum-based chemotherapy.

At present, response and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors are unpredictable, and new biomarkers are needed to better tailor therapies for individual patients. This will entail the development of new diagnostic tests to gauge both the host immune response and the likely means of immune evasion in individual cancers. There is reason to believe that immune checkpoint inhibitors may be more effective if given before the patient receives chemotherapy (which is immunosuppressive) or in combination with certain targeted therapies directed against tumor cells, and many well-designed clinical trials will need to be conducted before these questions are answered. Currently available immunotherapies are effective in some cancers but not others. Thus, there is a need for development of safe adaptive therapies that are"

            "content": "16-18 Enhancing the immune response to tumors by vaccination holds promise for cancer prevention and therapy. In addition to CAR T cells and monoclonal antibody-based therapies, there are two other major approaches to cancer immunotherapy. Cancer vaccines are based on the idea that tumors are intrinsically poorly immunogenic, and the vaccine should act to supply the immunogenicity. A second approach, called checkpoint blockade, which we will discuss in the next section, is based on the idea that the immune system has been primed but is held in check by tolerance mechanisms, which can be blocked by therapeutic interventions."
