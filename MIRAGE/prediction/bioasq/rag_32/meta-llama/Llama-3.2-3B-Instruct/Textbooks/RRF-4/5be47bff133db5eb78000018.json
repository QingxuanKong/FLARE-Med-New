Document [10] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) mentions that exposure to environmental microbial reservoirs can continue to influence community structure, including in infants. Document [14] (Title: Immunology_Janeway) also discusses the importance of early-life exposure to certain microbes in preventing allergic disease and asthma. Furthermore, Document [11] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) states that different microbial communities are associated with different ethnicities, diets, and environments, and that early environmental exposures can shape the microbiota. Document [22] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) shows that infants have relatively undifferentiated microbial communities in the mouth, skin, and gut at birth, and that these communities resemble the mother's vaginal microbiota for vaginally delivered babies. Given these points, it is reasonable to infer that pets can influence the infant microbiome, especially in the early stages of life. In fact, Document [10] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) suggests that growing up from birth on a farm with domestic animals or in a household where cats or dogs are kept as pets appears to protect against developing asthma. This implies that exposure to certain microbial communities, such as those found in pets, can have a positive effect on the infant microbiome and potentially on overall health. Therefore, the answer is likely affirmative.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Complicating this task are the results from the Human Microbiome Project suggesting a high level of variability among individuals in the components of the microbiome, although many individuals appear to maintain a fairly conserved microbiome throughout their lives. In the context of infectious diseases, clear changes and disruptions of the indigenous microbiome have a strong and often fundamental impact on the progression of infection. Such alterations can be associated with the effects of antibiotic and immunosuppressive drug use on the normal flora, with environmental changes, and with the impact of microbial virulence factors"

Recent advances have defined the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome, which is largely unculturable, using molecular approaches. One common trend is the association of reduced microbial diversity in disease. The gut microbiome is also exquisitely sensitive to diet, which may partly explain the association between food allergy and other diet-induced diseases and altered composition of the microbiome.
