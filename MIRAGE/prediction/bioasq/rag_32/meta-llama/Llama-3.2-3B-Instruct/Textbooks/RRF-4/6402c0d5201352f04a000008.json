In retrospective studies, D-penicillamine stabilized and improved skin induration, prevented new internal organ involvement, and improved survival. However, a randomized controlled clinical trial in early active SSc found no difference in the extent of skin involvement between patients treated with standard-dose (750 mg/d) or very low-dose (125 mg every other day) D-penicillamine. Recent clinical trials show benefit of pirfenidone and of nintedanib in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, with significant slowing of the loss of lung function.

The estimated 8-year event-free survival rate is 81%, and the overall survival rate is 85%. Among patients continuing on imatinib, the annual rate of transformation to accelerated-blastic phase in years 4\u20138 is <1%. In two randomized studies, one comparing nilotinib 300 mg twice daily or 400 mg twice daily with imatinib (ENEST-nd) and the other comparing dasatinib 100 mg daily with imatinib (DASISION), the second-generation TKIs were associated with better outcomes in early surrogate endpoints, including higher rates of complete cytogenetic responses (85\u201387% vs 77\u201382%), major molecular responses (65\u201376% vs 46\u201363%), and undetectable BCR-ABL1 transcripts"

While these agents have clinical activity as monotherapies, clinical studies suggest that the most promising clinical activity is seen when they are used in combination with a BRAF inhibitor."

These agents pro-duce durable shrinkage of advanced disease in 20% to 40% of patients, and combination strategies that employ checkpoint inhibitors with cytokines, vaccines, cellular therapies, and other targeted agents are under active investigation.GENE THERAPYGene therapy is being pursued as a possible approach to modify-ing the genetic program of cancer cells as well as treating meta-bolic diseases. The field of cancer gene therapy uses a variety of strategies, ranging from replacement of mutated or deleted tumor-suppressor genes to enhancement of immune responses to cancer cells.159 Indeed, in preclinical models,"
