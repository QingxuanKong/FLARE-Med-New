More than a dozen individual randomized trials of adjuvant chemotherapy have failed to demonstrate improvement in disease-free or overall survival for patients with soft tissue sarcoma. How-ever, several limitations of these individual trials may explain the lack of observed improvement. First, the chemotherapy regimens used were suboptimal, consisting of single-agent therapy (most commonly with doxorubicin) and insufficiently intensive dosing schedules. Second, the patient groups were not large enough to reveal clinically significant differences in survival rates.

A wide variety of DNA alterations have been observed in sarcomas that result in mutated genes encoding proteins ranging from transcription fac-tors to tyrosine kinases to cytokines. The challenge in identify-ing therapeutic targets in sarcoma is to identify those that are specifically important to cellular function. The ideal therapeutic target has been described as a single molecule that is critical for pathogenesis, is expressed and active, is involved in a single pathway amenable to blockade (i.e.,"

Chest CT should be performed to evaluate for lung metastasis at presentation and before any radi-cal treatment. CT is also the preferred imaging technique for evaluating retroperitoneal sarcomas (Fig. 36-2).31 Current CT Brunicardi_Ch36_p1567-p1598.indd 157001/03/19 6:38 PM 1571SOFT TISSUE SARCOMASCHAPTER 36techniques can provide a detailed image of the abdomen and pelvis and can delineate adjacent organs and vascular struc-tures.

When histologic assessment of an extremity sarcoma reveals a myxoid liposarcoma, CT of the abdomen and pelvis should be done because this subtype is known to"

As described previously, this drug is generally well tolerated and is associated with relatively minor adverse effects. Initially, dasatinib and nilotinib were approved for patients who were intolerant or resistant to imatinib; each shows clinical activity, and both are now also indicated as first-line treatment of chronic phase CML. In addition to these tyrosine kinase inhibitors, other treatment options include IFN-\u03b1, busulfan, other oral alkylating agents, and hydroxyurea."

Translocations result in in-frame gene fusion, which in turn results in fused products encoding oncoproteins that function as transcriptional activators or repressors.23,24 The best characterized gene fusions are in Ewing\u2019s sarcoma (EWS-FLI1), clear cell sarcoma (EWS-ATF1), myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (TLS-CHOP), alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (PAX3-FHKR), desmoplastic small round cell tumor (EWS-WT1), and synovial sarcoma (SS18-SSX).

On the basis of the initial results in a single patient with metastatic GIST, the EORTC Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group initiated a phase 1 study to test the safety and efficacy of imatinib.208 In that study, 53% of patients with GISTs had confirmed partial responses; investiga-tors concluded that imatinib is safe and effective against this disease.208 A multicenter, international trial of imatinib for GIST was begun in July 2000 at four treatment centers: Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Oregon Health"

A small minority of soft tissue neoplasms are associated with germline mutations in tumor suppressor genes (neurofibromatosis 1, Gardner syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Osler-Weber Rendu syndrome). A few tumors can be linked to known environmental exposures such as radiation, burns, or toxins. Unlike tumors such as colorectal carcinomas that usually arise from recognized precursor lesions, the origin of sarcomas is unknown. The best guess is that the tumors arise from pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells, which acquire somatic \u201cdriver\u201d mutations. Despite heterogeneous mechanisms of tumorigenesis among sarcomas, some generalizations can be made based on their genomic complexity:"
