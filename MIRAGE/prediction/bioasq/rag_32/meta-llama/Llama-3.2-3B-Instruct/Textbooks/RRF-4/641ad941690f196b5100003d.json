LOQ stands for Limit of Quantitation, which is the lowest amount of a substance that can be detected with a certain level of confidence, usually 99.97%. LOD is not a commonly used term in the context of pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics, but based on the context of the provided documents, it is likely that it refers to Log of Odds, which is a measure of the ratio of the probability that a disease and marker loci are linked rather than unlinked. In linkage analysis, a lod score of +3 is generally accepted as supporting linkage, while a score of -2 is consistent with the absence of linkage. Given these definitions, LOQ and LOD are not the same. LOQ is a measure of detection capability, while LOD is a measure of linkage in genetic analysis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

It is important, however, to account for the fact that cells often show considerable individuality in their responses. Consider a situation in which a single mother cell divides into two daughter cells of equal volume. If the mother cell has only one molecule of a given protein, then only one daughter will inherit it. The daughters, though genetically identical, are already different. This variability is most pronounced for molecules that are present in small numbers. Nevertheless, even when there are many copies of a particular protein (or RNA), it is very unlikely that both daughter cells will end up with exactly the same number of molecules."

            "content": "At first glance, one would no more expect the worm, the flea, the eagle, and the giant squid all to be generated by the same developmental mechanisms than one would suppose that the same methods were used to make a shoe and an airplane. Remarkably, however, research in the past 30 years has revealed that much of the basic machinery of development is essentially the same in all animals\u2014not just in all vertebrates, but in all the major phyla of invertebrates too. Recognizably similar, evolutionarily related molecules define the specialized animal cell types, mark the differences between body regions, and help create the animal body pattern. Homologous proteins are often functionally interchangeable between very different species. Thus, a human protein produced artificially in a fly, for example, can perform the same function as the fly\u2019s own version of that protein (Figure 21\u20132). Thanks to an underlying unity of mechanisms, developmental biologists have been making great strides toward"

            "content": "Two presumably noninfectious forms of intestinal inlammation are ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease. Diferentiation between these is important because treatment difers. That said, they both share common features, and sometimes are indistinguishable if Crohn disease involves the colon. he salient clinical and laboratory features shown in Table 54-5 permit a reasonably confident diagnostic diferentiation in most cases. he etiopathogenesis is enigmatic in both, but a genetic predisposition is suspected. Inlammation is thought to result from dysregulated mucosal immune function in response to commensal microbiota, with or without an autoimmune component (Friedman, 2015). TABLE 54-5. Some Shared and Diferentiating Characteristics of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Hereditary More than 100 disease-associated genetic loci-a third shared; Jewish predominance; familial in 5-10% of cases; Turner syndrome; immune dysregulation"

            "content": "In the end, observations of cancer occurring in chimney sweeps, studies of x-rays, and the overwhelming data demonstrating cigarette smoke as a causative agent in lung cancer, together with Ames\u2019s work on chemical mutagenesis, provided convincing evidence that cancer originated through changes in DNA. Although the viral theory of cancer did not prove to be generally accurate (with the exception of human papillomaviruses, which can cause cervical and other cancers in human), the study of retroviruses led to the discovery of the first human oncogenes in the late 1970s. Soon after, the study of families with genetic predisposition to cancer was instrumental in the discovery of tumor-suppressor genes. The field that studies the type of mutations, as well as the consequence of these mutations in tumor cells, is now known as cancer genetics. Nearly all cancers originate from a single cell; this clonal origin is a critical discriminating feature between neoplasia and hyperplasia."
