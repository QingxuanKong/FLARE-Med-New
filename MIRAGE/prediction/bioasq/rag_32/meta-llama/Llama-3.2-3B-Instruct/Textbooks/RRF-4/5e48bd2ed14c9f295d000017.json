These benefits seem most conspicuous when treatment begins early in the RRMS stage of the illness. Unfortunately, however, already established progressive symptoms do not respond well to treatment with these disease-modifying therapies. Because progressive symptoms are likely to result from accumulated axonal and neuronal loss, many experts now believe that very early treatment with a disease-modifying drug is appropriate for most MS patients.

            "content": "A series of trials using a small molecule inhibitors of the enzyme \u03b3-secretase (Doody et al, 2013), or of an inhibitor of \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein\u2013cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1, see Egan et al), or of a monoclonal antibody directed at soluble forms of amyloid (solanezumab; see Doody et al, 2014) have failed to demonstrate clear benefit in even early stages of Alzheimer disease. The presumption is being explored that amyloid is deposited well before the onset of clinical symptoms and such agents might be useful if started in the presymptomatic stages of disease but there have also been several failed trials at this stage of disease. This is one goal of studies in dominantly inherited forms of the disease, in which presymptomatic patients can be treated."

            "content": "Monoclonal antibodies One approach to treatment has been the use of monoclonal antibodies to various components of the inflammatory response. Natalizumab is directed against alpha-integrin in order to block lymphocyte and monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and their migration through the vessel wall. It has been used in rheumatoid arthritis and fistulizing Crohn disease. In a study that ran for 6 months, Miller and colleagues (2003) were able to demonstrate a reduction in the number of relapses and a slowing of the accumulation of MRI lesions. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 942 patients with relapsing\u2013remitting MS (Polman et al, 2006; the AFFIRM study) showed a 68 percent reduction in relapses, an 80 percent reduction in new or enlarging T2 cerebral lesions and a 96 percent reduction in gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI after a year. This represents a twofold improvement in efficacy compared to what has been reported with interferon and glatiramer acetate. There was"
