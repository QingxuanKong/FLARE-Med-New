Grapefruit juice is known to inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme, which is a cytochrome P450 enzyme. The documents mention that grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A4, especially at the enterocyte level. This means that grapefruit juice can increase the levels of drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4, leading to potential drug-drug interactions. Therefore, it is likely that grapefruit juice inhibits the CYP3A4 enzyme.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

An individual who has recently been prescribed a drug (atorvastatin) to lower cholesterol levels is advised to limit consumption of grapefruit juice, because high intake of the juice reportedly results in an increased level of the drug in the blood, increasing the risk of side effects. Atorvastatin is a substrate for the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4, and grapefruit juice inhibits the enzyme. Which statement concerning CYP enzymes is most likely correct? They: A. accept electrons from reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. B. catalyze the hydroxylation of hydrophobic molecules. C. differ from nitric oxide synthase in that they contain heme.

The result is prolongation and a change in shape of the action potential, and these changes lead to arrhythmias. Both terfenadine and astemizole were withdrawn from the US market in recognition of these problems. Where still available, terfenadine and astemizole should be considered to be contraindicated in patients taking ketoconazole, itraconazole, or macrolides and in patients with liver disease.

Co-administration of artemether/lumefantrine, atazanavir, dolutegravir, elvitegravir/cobicistat, fosamprenavir, ketoconazole, and rifampin should be avoided. Rilpivirine, a diarylpyrimidine, must be administered with a meal (preferably high fat or >400 kcal). Its oral bioavailability is dependent on an acid gastric environment for optimal absorption; thus antacids and H2-receptor antagonists should be separated in time and proton pump inhibitors are contraindicated. The drug is highly protein bound and the terminal elimination half-life is 50 hours. Rilpivirine is one of the NNRTI agents recommended for use in pregnancy (Table 49\u20135). Rilpivirine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, and drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 may thus TABLE 49\u20135 The use of antiretroviral agents in pregnancy."
