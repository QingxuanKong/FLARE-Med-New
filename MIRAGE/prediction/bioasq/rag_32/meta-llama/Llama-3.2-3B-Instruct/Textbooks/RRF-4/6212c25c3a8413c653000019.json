Commonly, these are associated with an increase in one or more of the formed elements (red cells, platelets, and/or granulocytes) in the peripheral blood. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), terminal differentiation occurs but in a disordered and ineffective fashion, leading to the appearance of dysplastic marrow precursors and peripheral blood cytopenias. Although these three categories provide a useful starting point, the divisions between the myeloid neoplasms sometimes blur. Both MDS and myeloproliferative neoplasms often transform to AML, and some neoplasms have features of both myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Because all myeloid neoplasms arise from early multipotent progenitors, the close relationship among these disorders is not surprising."

No single characteristic feature of marrow morphology distinguishes MDS, but the following are commonly observed: dyserythropoietic changes (especially nuclear abnormalities) and ringed sideroblasts in the erythroid lineage; hypogranulation and hyposegmentation in granulocytic precursors, with an increase in myeloblasts; and megakaryocytes showing reduced numbers of or disorganized aGood, normal, \u2013Y, del(5q), del (20q); poor, complex (\u22653 abnormalities) or chromosome 7 abnormalities; intermediate, all other abnormalities. bCytopenias defined as hemoglobin <100 g/L, platelet count <100,000/\u03bcL, and absolute neutrophil count <1500/\u03bcL."

            "content": "Important new insights have come from deep sequencing of MDS genomes, which has identified a number of recurrently mutated genes. These genes can be lumped into three major functional categories, as follows: Epigenetic factors. Frequent mutations are seen involving many of the same epigenetic factors that are mutated in AML, including factors that regulate DNA methylation and histone modifications; thus, like AML, dysregulation of the epigenome appears to be important in the genesis of MDS. RNA splicing factors. A subset of tumors has mutations involving the RNA splicing machinery that are proposed to drive transformation by altering RNA processing, They are commonly associated with ring sideroblasts, a classic form of dysplasia that is seen in a subset of MDS. Transcription factors. These mutations affect transcription factors that are required for normal myelopoiesis and may contribute to the deranged differentiation that characterizes MDS."

            "content": "Note: The Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) was developed to determine if the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk factors identified as important for survival at the time of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) diagnosis could also be used for risk stratification following their acquisition during the course of the disease. One point is assigned to each risk factor for IPSS scoring. For DIPSS, the same is true, but age >65 years, anemia, blood blasts, and constitutional symptoms are assigned 2 points each. The DIPSS Plus scoring system represents recognition that the addition of unfavorable karyotype, thrombocytopenia, and transfusion dependence improved the DIPSS risk stratification system for which additional points are assigned (Table 131-5). More recent studies suggest that mutational analysis of the ASXL1, EZH2, SRSF2, and IDH1/2 genes further improves risk stratification for survival and leukemic transformation (Leukemia 27:1861, 2013)."

Even \u201clow-risk\u201d MDS has significant morbidity and mortality. Most patients die as a result of complications of pancytopenia and not due to leukemic transformation; perhaps one-third will succumb to other diseases unrelated to their MDS. Precipitous worsening of pancytopenia, acquisition of new chromosomal abnormalities on serial cytogenetic determination, increase in the number of blasts, and marrow fibrosis are all poor prognostic indicators. The outlook in therapy-related MDS, regardless of type, is extremely poor, and most patients will progress within a few months to refractory AML."
