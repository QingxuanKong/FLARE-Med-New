    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the relevant information provided in the documents. According to Document [11], radiosurgery is used to decrease the size of the lesion, albeit with a substantial delay. This approach is utilized most often with AVMs of 3 cm or smaller located in an area of the brain in which resection would be likely to produce a serious neurologic disability. Additionally, Document [13] states that focused radiation, which controls the growth of many of the smaller tumors, is a viable alternative to surgery. Furthermore, Document [22] mentions that radiosurgery uses extremely accurate image-guidance and patient positioning to deliver a high dose of radiation to a small tumor with well-defined margins, minimizing the dose to normal tissues. This suggests that radiosurgery can be an effective treatment option for radiation-induced meningiomas, as they are often smaller and can be precisely targeted. Therefore, the answer is affirmative.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Larger, symptomatic lesions should be resected. If complete resection is achieved, the patient is cured. Incompletely resected tumors tend to recur, although the rate of recurrence can be very slow with grade I tumors. Tumors that cannot be resected, or can only be partially removed, may benefit from treatment with external-beam RT or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). These treatments may also be helpful in patients whose tumor has recurred after surgery. Hormonal therapy and chemotherapy are currently unproven. Rarer tumors that resemble meningiomas include hemangiopericytomas and solitary fibrous tumors. These are treated with surgery and RT but have a higher propensity to recur locally or metastasize systemically."

In many centers, a fraction of this is delivered as a \u201cboost\u201d through focused or stereotactic radiation, particularly if the tumor is small enough to encompass in these fields. Brachytherapy (implantation of iodine-125 or iridium-193 beads or needles) and high-dose focused radiation (stereotactic radiosurgery) have so far not significantly altered survival times but continue to be studied. They have gone through periods of popularity but are currently used only sparsely, partly because they cause local radiation necrosis."

The technique of stereotactic radiosurgery has been adopted using photon radiation sources, such as a linear accelerator, gamma radiation (Karlsson et al) and other modes of focused x-ray radiation as accepted alternatives to operative treatment of small lesions or those situated in deep regions, including the brainstem, the thalamus, or in \u201celoquent\u201d areas of the cortex.

In a large series of patients treated with radiosurgery, facial motor and sensory functions were preserved in 75 percent of cases and, after 28 months of observation, no new neurologic deficits were detected (Kondziolka et al). This approach is favored in older patients with few symptoms but is being adopted increasingly for others. The rates of hearing loss and facial numbness and weakness are comparable or lower than with surgery, but the follow-up period in most series is less than 5 years (Flickinger et al). Focused radiation with the Gamma Knife or proton beam also appears to be preferable to surgery in cases of recurrent tumor.

Unfortunately, approximately 15 percent of GH-secreting tumors and prolactinomas will recur at 1 year. For this reason, incomplete removal or recurrence of the tumor (or tumors that are unresponsive to hormonal therapy) should be followed by radiation therapy. Alternative primary treatment for intrasellar tumors is forms of stereotactic radiosurgery, provided that vision is not being threatened and there is no other urgent need for surgery. These forms of radiation can be focused precisely on the tumor and will destroy it.

Primary benign and malignant tumors arise from the various elements of the CNS, including neurons, glia, and meninges. Tumors metas-tasize to the CNS from many primary sources. Presenta-tion varies widely depending on relevant neuroanatomy. Prognosis depends on histology and anatomy. Modern brain tumor centers use team approaches to CNS tumors, as patients may require a combination of surgery (including newer, more minimally invasive approaches), radiation therapy, chemother-apy, SRS, and research protocol enrollment for studies assessing the efficacy of newer approaches such as immunotherapy. Tumors affecting the peripheral nervous system are discussed in the \u201cPeripheral Nerve\u201d section.Intracranial TumorsIntracranial"

            "content": "Meningioma Central nervous system (CNS) tumors, including ependymomas, schwannomas, and meningiomas, have been reported in MEN 1 patients (Table 408-1). Meningiomas are found in <10% of patients with other clinical manifestations of MEN 1 (e.g., primary hyperparathyroidism) for >15 years. The majority of meningiomas are not associated with symptoms, and 60% do not enlarge. The treatment of MEN 1\u2013associated meningiomas is similar to that in non\u2013MEN 1 patients. Lipomas Subcutaneous lipomas occur in >33% of patients with MEN 1 (Table 408-1) and are frequently multiple. In addition, visceral, pleural, or retroperitoneal lipomas may occur in patients with MEN 1. Management is conservative. However, when surgically removed for cosmetic reasons, they typically do not recur."

Bilateral acoustic neuromas are pathognomonic for neurofibro-matosis type 2 (NF2), a syndrome resulting from mutation of chromosome 22. NF2 patients have an increased incidence of spinal and cranial meningiomas and gliomas.Vestibular schwannomas may be treated with microsur-gical resection or SRS (Gamma Knife radiosurgery or linear accelerator technology). The main complication with treatment is damage to the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII), which runs through the internal auditory canal with the vestibulocochlear nerve. Risk of facial nerve dysfunction increases with increasing tumor diameter. SRS is preferred for tumors <3 cm, and micro-surgical resection for those >3 cm (SRS can be supplemented for any residual tumor following resection).Pituitary Adenoma. Pituitary adenomas arise from the anterior pituitary gland (adenohypophysis). Tumors <1 cm diameter are considered microadenomas; larger tumors are macroadenomas. Figure"

            "content": "Injury to the CNS from radiation is appropriately discussed here, since it occurs mainly in relation to therapy for brain tumors. Three syndromes of radiation damage have been delineated: acute, early delayed, and late delayed, although these syndromes often blend into one another. The acute reaction may begin during the latter part of a series of fractionated treatments or soon thereafter. There may be a seizure, a transitory worsening of the tumor symptoms, or signs of increased intracranial pressure. Although the condition has been attributed to brain edema, this is not always visible on MRI and its basis is unknown. The symptoms subside in days to weeks. Corticosteroids are usually administered, but with the exception of cases with demonstrable edema, their effect is uncertain. A novel syndrome of migraine-like headache and focal neurologic deficits, usually developing many years after cranial radiation, is described in more detail below."

Third, the presence of a state of immunosuppression such as AIDS or cancer chemotherapy, special inherited disorders such as neurofibromatosis, and exposure to radiation each predispose to the development of tumors of the nervous system. Fourth, the growth rates and invasiveness of tumors vary; some, like glioblastoma, are highly malignant, invasive, and rapidly progressive and others, like meningioma, are most often benign, slowly progressive, and compressive. These different qualities have substantial clinical implications, frequently providing the explanation of slowly or rapidly evolving clinical states as well as potential surgical cure and prognosis."
