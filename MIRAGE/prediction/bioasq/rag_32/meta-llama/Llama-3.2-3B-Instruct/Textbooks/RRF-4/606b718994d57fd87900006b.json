Tacrolimus is available as 0.03% and 0.1% ointments, and pimecrolimus is available as a 1% cream. Both are indicated for short-term and intermittent longterm therapy for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. Tacrolimus 0.03% ointment and pimecrolimus 1% cream are approved for use in children older than 2 years of age, although all strengths are approved for adult use. Recommended dosing of both agents is twice-daily application to affected skin until clearing is noted. Neither medication should be used with occlusive dressings.

There is often disfigurement, lack of sleep from pruritus resulting in irritability and fatigue, and limitations on participation in sports. Significant time, as well as financial strain, is involved in caring for a child with atopic dermatitis. Thus, management should address these potential issues and provide adequate anticipatory guidance. Atopic dermatitis frequently remits during childhood and is much less common after puberty. The condition is generally most severe and widespread in infancy and early childhood. Relapse of disease in adults can occur and commonly manifests as face or hand dermatitis. Frequently, adults have generalized dry skin and are aware that their skin is sensitive to many over-the-counter preparations. Patients with atopic dermatitis can also develop asthma and allergic rhinitis. Asthma is more commonly associated with more severe skin disease."

Typically, light therapy is administered two to three times weekly until improvement is seen, and then is tapered or discontinued once the acute flare has resolved. More frequent use of light therapy in children is hindered by requirements for frequent office visits, ability to cooperate with standing in a light box while wearing protective goggles, and risk of long-term skin damage, including the potential for skin cancer development with excessive UV light exposure. Systemic cyclosporine (up to 5 mg/kg/day) can be effective therapy for atopic dermatitis in severe cases.

Omalizumab also appears to act in chronic allergic asthma to reduce IgE-mediated antigen trapping and presentation by dendritic cells, thus preventing the activation of new allergen-specific TH2 cells. Altogether, these actions lead to suppression of the late-phase response to allergen challenge (see Section 14-9). The antibody is administered by subcutaneous injections once every 2 to 4 weeks. This treatment has been shown to be highly effective for patients with chronic urticaria and also appears to be effective in individuals with severe chronic asthma. Of special interest is that in studies of children with moderate to severe asthma who were treated for 4 years with omalizumab, most remained symptom free without any anti-asthma treatment, suggesting that the anti-IgE therapy modified the natural history of the disease."
