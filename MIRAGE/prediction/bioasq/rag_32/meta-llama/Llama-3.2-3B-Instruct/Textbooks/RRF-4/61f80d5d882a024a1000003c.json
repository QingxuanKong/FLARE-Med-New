MEF2C is a transcription factor that plays a role in various cellular processes, including development and differentiation. According to Document [4] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison), mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in synaptic function and early transcriptional regulation, such as MEF2C, have a clear relationship to activity-dependent neural responses that can affect the development of neural systems underlying cognition and social behaviors. This suggests that changes in MEF2C may not only be limited to coding regions but also affect non-coding regions. Furthermore, Document [15] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) discusses the importance of regulatory regions in development, indicating that non-coding regions can play a crucial role in regulating gene expression. Considering this information, it is unlikely that only changes in coding regions of MEF2C cause developmental disorders. Instead, changes in both coding and non-coding regions may contribute to the development of these disorders.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The relatively novel concept of duplication or deletion of portions of genes, copy number variation, emerged as explanatory of some proportion of diseases such as autism as discussed further on. What is interesting about copy number variation is that they may give rise to several phenotypes of similar disorder, quite unlike conventional mendelian mutations. This indicates that copy number variants, like SNPs, probably are not usually directly causative of a condition but instead modulate other functions that express proteins. This is the situation for many of the forms of developmental abnormalities such as generic cognitive developmental delay, autism, and certain psychiatric diseases."

While a unifying explanation for these disparate disorders has yet to be defined, they probably have subcellular and synaptic changes in common as summarized by Mefford, Batshaw, Hoffman in their review that is recommended to the reader.

For instance, many identified mutations are in genes that encode proteins involved in synaptic function and early transcriptional regulation (Table 465e-1) and have a clear relationship to activity-dependent neural responses that can affect the development of neural systems underlying cognition and social behaviors. Mutations in these genes may be detrimental by altering the balance of excitatory versus inhibitory synaptic signaling in local and extended circuits and by altering mechanisms that control brain growth. Some mutations affect genes (e.g., PTEN, TSC1, and TSC2) that negatively regulate signaling from several types of extracellular stimuli, including those transduced by receptor tyrosine kinases.

This idea is provocative because several genetic linkage studies have suggested an association between ADHD and a polymorphism of the gene that codes for the same dopamine transporter gene. Furthermore, copy number variations in genes that relate to development, a rich field for study in autism, give rise to global forms of cognitive delay that display prominent features of ADHD.
