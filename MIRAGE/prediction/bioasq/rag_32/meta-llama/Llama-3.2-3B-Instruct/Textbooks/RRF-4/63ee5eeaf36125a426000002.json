    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the information provided in the documents and understand the role of the Artemis gene in the immune system. The Artemis gene is involved in the repair of double-strand breaks in DNA and is also necessary for V(D)J recombination, a process that occurs during the development of immune cells. Mutations in the Artemis gene can lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) due to the inability of lymphocytes to undergo V(D)J recombination and repair DNA double-strand breaks. Therefore, we can conclude that mutation of the Artemis gene does cause severe combined immunodeficiency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

They are said to suffer from severe combined immune deficiency (SCID). The original scid mutation was discovered some time before the components of the recombination pathway were identified and was subsequently identified as a mutation in DNA-PKcs. In humans, mutations in RAG1 or RAG2 that result in partial V(D)J recombinase activity are responsible for an inherited disorder called Omenn syndrome, which is characterized by an absence of circulating B cells and an infiltration of skin by activated oligoclonal T lymphocytes. Mice deficient in components of ubiquitous DNA repair pathways, such as DNA-PKcs, Ku, or Artemis, are defective in double-strand break repair in general and are therefore also hypersensitive to ionizing radiation (which produces"

Before the advent of antibiotics, most individuals with inherited immune defects died in infancy or early childhood because of their susceptibility to particular classes of pathogens. Such cases were not easily identified, because many normal infants also died of infection. Most of the gene defects that cause inherited immunodeficiencies are recessive, and many are caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome. As males have only one X chromosome, all males who inherit an X chromosome carrying a defective gene will be affected by the disease. In contrast, female carriers with one defective X chromosome are usually healthy. Gene knockout techniques in mice (see Appendix I, Section A35) have created many immunodeficient states that are adding rapidly to our knowledge of the contribution of individual proteins to normal immune function.

However, identification of cytokines that induced cell division without promoting differentiation of stem cells, along with technical improvements in the isolation and transduction of HSCs, led to modest but real gains in transduction efficiency.

            "content": "Another group of autosomally inherited defects leading to SCID is caused by failures of DNA rearrangement in developing lymphocytes. Mutations in either the RAG1 or RAG2 gene that result in nonfunctional proteins cause arrest of lymphocyte development at the pro to preTcell and Bcell transitions because of a failure of V(D)J recombination (see Fig. 13.2). Thus, there is a complete lack of both T cells and B cells in these patients. Because the effects of RAG deficiencies are limited to lymphocytes that undergo antigen gene rearrangement, NKcell development is not impaired. There are other children with hypomorphic mutations (which cause reduced, but not absent, function) in either RAG1 or RAG2 who can make a small amount of functional RAG protein, allowing limited V(D)J recombination. This latter group includes patients with a distinctive and severe disease called Omenn syndrome, which, in addition to increased susceptibility to multiple opportunistic infections, has clinical features"

It is caused by biallelic EPG5 gene mutation that results in defective autophagy. CHAPTER 375e Primary Immunodeficiencies Associated with (or Secondary to) Other Diseases Lastly, immunodeficiency, centromere instability, and facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome is a complex autosomal recessive syndrome that variably combines a mild T cell immunodeficiency and a more severe B cell immunodeficiency with a coarse face, intestinal disease, and mild mental retardation. A cytogenetic diagnostic feature is the presence of multiradial chromosomes (most frequently chromosomes 1, 9, and 16) caused by DNA defective methylation. The syndrome is a result of either DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B deficiency or ZBTB24 deficiency."
