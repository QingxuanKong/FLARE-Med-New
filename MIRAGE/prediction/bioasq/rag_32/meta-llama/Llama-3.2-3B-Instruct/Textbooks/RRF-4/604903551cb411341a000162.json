    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the information provided in the given documents. Mucins are glycoproteins that are secreted by mucous cells and are known to be heavily glycosylated. According to document [8], mucinogen granules, the secretory product within the cell, are PAS positive, indicating the presence of carbohydrate groups. This suggests that mucins are indeed glycosylated proteins. Furthermore, document [5] states that gastric mucins are about 80% carbohydrate by weight, indicating a high degree of glycosylation. Additionally, document [1] describes the structure of gastric mucins, which are tetramers of four similar monomers, each largely covered by carbohydrate side chains that protect it from proteolytic degradation. This further supports the fact that mucins are glycosylated proteins. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that mucins are indeed glycosylated proteins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

As discussed in Chapter 19, this process involves the polymerization of one or more glycosaminoglycan chains (long, unbranched polymers composed of repeating disaccharide units; see Figure 19\u201335) onto serines on a core protein. Many proteoglycans are secreted and become components of the extracellular matrix, while others remain anchored to the extracellular face of the plasma membrane. Still others form a major component of slimy materials, such as the mucus that is secreted to form a protective coating on the surface of many epithelia."

This gel is subject to proteolysis by pepsins that cleave disulfide bonds near the center of the tetramers. Proteolysis releases fragments that do not form gels and thus dissolves the protective mucous layer. Maintenance of the protective mucous layer requires continuous synthesis of new tetrameric mucins to replace the mucins cleaved by pepsins. Mucus is secreted at a significant rate in the resting stomach. Secretion of mucus is stimulated by some of the same stimuli that enhance acid and pepsinogen secretion, especially acetylcholine released from parasympathetic nerve endings near the gastric glands.

B. defects in the targeting of enzymes to lysosomes. C. an increased rate of synthesis of the carbohydrate component of proteoglycans. D. an insufficient rate of synthesis of proteolytic enzymes. E. the synthesis of abnormally small amounts of core proteins. F. the synthesis of heteropolysaccharides with an altered structure. Correct answer = A. The mucopolysaccharidoses are caused by deficiencies in any one of the lysosomal acid hydrolases responsible for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (not proteins). The enzyme is correctly targeted to the lysosome, so blood levels of the enzyme do not increase, but it is nonfunctional. In these diseases, synthesis of the protein and carbohydrate components of proteoglycans is unaffected, in terms of both structure and amount."
