According to Document [5], collagens are the major proteins of the extracellular matrix and are the most abundant proteins in mammals, constituting 25% of the total protein mass. Additionally, Document [8] states that collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body. Furthermore, Document [14] mentions that about 30 collagen types have been identified, and Document [25] states that type I collagen accounts for most of the protein of dermis, ligaments, tendons, and demineralized bone, indicating its abundance in various tissues. Considering these points, it is reasonable to conclude that collagen is indeed the most abundant human protein.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

A typical collagen molecule is a long, rigid structure in which three polypeptides (referred to as \u03b1 chains) are wound around one another in a rope-like triple helix (Fig. 4.1). Although these molecules are found throughout the body, their types and organization are dictated by the structural role collagen plays in a particular organ. In some tissues, collagen may be dispersed as a gel that gives support to the structure, as in the ECM or the vitreous humor of the eye. In other tissues, collagen may be bundled in tight, parallel fibers that provide great strength, as in tendons. In the cornea of the eye, collagen is stacked so as to transmit light with a minimum of scattering. Collagen of bone occurs as fibers arranged at an angle to each other so as to resist mechanical shear from any direction. A. Types"

For example, the most common collagen, type I, contains two chains called \u03b11 and one chain called \u03b12 (\u03b112\u03b12), whereas type II collagen contains three \u03b11 chains (\u03b113).

Collagen fibers are resistant to most proteases, but during degradation of connective tissues, they are cleaved by specific matrix metalloproteinases (collagenases) that cause partial unfolding of the triple helices into gelatin-like structures that are further degraded by less specific proteinases.

Collagen contains an abundance of proline, lysine, and glycine, the latter occurring at every third position in the primary structure. It also contains hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, and glycosylated hydroxylysine, each formed by posttranslational modification. Fibrillar collagen has a long, rigid structure, in which three collagen polypeptide \u03b1 chains are wound around one another in a rope-like triple helix stabilized by interchain hydrogen bonds. Diseases of fibrillar collagen synthesis affect bones, joints, skin, and blood vessels. Elastin is a connective tissue protein with rubber-like properties in tissues such as the lung. \u03b11-Antitrypsin (AAT), produced primarily by the liver, inhibits elastase-catalyzed degradation of elastin in the alveolar walls. A deficiency of AAT increases elastin degradation and can cause emphysema and, in some cases, cirrhosis of the liver."

OVERVIEW Collagen and elastin are examples of common, well-characterized fibrous proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that serve structural functions in the body. For example, collagen and elastin are found as components of skin, connective tissue, blood vessel walls, and the sclera and cornea of the eye. Each fibrous protein exhibits special mechanical properties, resulting from its unique structure, which is obtained by combining specific amino acids into regular, secondary structural elements. This is in contrast to globular proteins (discussed in Chapter 3), whose shapes are the result of complex interactions between secondary, tertiary, and, sometimes, quaternary structural elements. II.
