The selection of the optimal regimen for a given patient depends on a number of factors, the most important of which is the severity of the attack. Mild migraine attacks can usually be managed by oral agents; the average efficacy rate is 50\u201370%. Severe migraine attacks may require parenteral therapy. Most drugs effective in the treatment of migraine are members of one of three major pharmacologic classes: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 5-HT receptor agonists, and dopamine receptor antagonists."

In general, a preventive medication should be considered in the subset of patients with four or more attacks a month. Significant side effects are associated with the use of many of these agents; furthermore, determination of dose can be difficult because the recommended doses have been derived for conditions other than migraine. The mechanism of action of these drugs is unclear; it seems likely that the brain sensitivity that underlies migraine is modified. Patients are usually started on a low dose of a chosen treatment; the dose is then gradually increased, up to a reasonable maximum, to achieve clinical benefit."

Migraine in its \u201cclassic\u201d form is characterized by an aura of variable duration that may involve nausea, vomiting, visual scotomas or even hemianopsia, and speech abnormalities; the aura is followed by a severe throbbing unilateral headache that lasts for a few hours to 1\u20132 days. \u201cCommon\u201d migraine lacks the aura phase, but the headache is similar. After more than a century of intense study, the pathophysiology of migraine is still poorly understood. Although the symptom pattern and duration of prodrome and headache vary markedly among patients, the severity of migraine headache justifies vigorous therapy in the great majority of cases.

The triptans were designed to stimulate selectively subpopulations of 5-HT receptors; at least 14 different 5-HT receptors exist in humans.

Triptans are generally not effective in migraine with aura unless given after the aura is completed and the headache initiated. Side effects are common, although often mild and transient. Moreover, 5-HT receptor agonists are contraindi cated in individuals with a history of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Recurrence of headache, within usual time course of an attack, is another important limitation of triptan use and occurs at least occasionally in most patients. Evidence from randomized controlled trials show that coadministration of a longer-acting NSAID, naproxen 500 mg, with sumatriptan will augment the initial effect of sumatriptan and, importantly, reduce rates of headache recurrence."

This regimen \u201cworks\u201d in the sense that the pain of migraine is eliminated. However, this regimen is clearly suboptimal for patients with recurrent headache. Opioids do not treat the underlying headache mechanism; rather, they act to alter the pain sensation, and there is evidence their use may decrease the likelihood of a response to triptans in the future. Moreover, in patients taking oral opioids, such as oxycodone or hydrocodone, habituation or addiction can greatly confuse the treatment of migraine. Opioid craving and/or withdrawal can aggravate and accentuate migraine. Therefore, it is recommended that opioid use in migraine be limited to patients with severe, but infrequent, headaches that are unresponsive to to other therapies."
