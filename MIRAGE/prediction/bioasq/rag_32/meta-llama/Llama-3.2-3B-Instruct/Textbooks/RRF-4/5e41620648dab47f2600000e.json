    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the definition of poliosis and poliosis circumscripta. Poliosis refers to a condition characterized by the appearance of white or unpigmented patches on the skin or hair, often due to the loss of melanocytes or melanin. Poliosis circumscripta is a specific type of poliosis that is usually seen in the scalp and is often associated with alopecia areata, a condition that causes hair loss. The key difference between poliosis and poliosis circumscripta is that poliosis can occur anywhere on the body, whereas poliosis circumscripta is typically limited to the scalp. Therefore, we can deduce that poliosis circumscripta is a specific type of poliosis that is associated with alopecia areata and is characterized by white or unpigmented patches on the scalp. Based on this information, the correct answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Eczema is a reaction pattern that presents with variable clinical findings and the common histologic finding of spongiosis (intercellular edema of the epidermis). Eczema is the final common expression for a number of disorders, including those discussed in the following sections. Primary lesions may include erythematous macules, papules, and vesicles, which can coalesce to form patches and plaques. In severe eczema, secondary lesions from infection or excoriation, marked by weeping and crusting, may predominate. In chronic eczematous conditions, lichenification (cutaneous hypertrophy and accentuation of normal skin markings) may alter the characteristic appearance of eczema."

Basal cell carcinoma is a slow-growing tumor that usually does not metastasize. Typically, the cancer cells arise from the follicular bulge of the outer root sheath of the hair follicle. Almost in all cases of basal cell carcinoma, the recommended treatment is surgical removal of the tumor. The second most common skin cancer is the squa-mous cell carcinoma with more than 200,000 cases each year.

The distribution of skin thickening is invariably symmetric and bilateral. It typically starts in the fingers and then characteristically advances from distal to proximal extremities in an ascending fashion. The involved skin is firm, coarse, and thickened, and the extremities and trunk may be darkly pigmented. In some patients, diffuse tanning in the absence of sun exposure is a very early manifestation of skin involvement. In dark-skinned patients, vitiligolike hypopigmentation may occur. Because pigment loss spares the perifollicular areas, the skin may have a \u201csalt-and-pepper\u201d appearance, most prominently on the scalp, upper back, and chest. Dermal sclerosis due to collagen accumulation obliterates hair follicles, sweat glands, and eccrine and sebaceous glands, resulting in hair loss, decreased sweating, and dry skin."

Despite perceptions to the contrary, shaving does not increase the rate or density of hair growth. Chemical depilatory treatments may be useful for mild hirsutism that affects only limited skin areas, though they can cause skin irritation. Wax treatment removes hair temporarily but is uncomfortable. Electrolysis is effective for more permanent hair removal, particularly in the hands of a skilled electrologist. Laser phototherapy appears to be efficacious for hair removal. It delays hair regrowth and causes permanent hair removal in most patients.

Each such hair unit will connect with about 20 hairs to produce a large ovoid or irregularly shaped receptive field. These units are extremely sensitive to movement of even a single hair.

Clinically, these generally arise as slow-growing papules on the skin or mucosal surfaces. Regression of HPV lesions is frequently an immune-mediated, spontaneous event that is exemplified by the persistent and extensive manifestation of this virus in the immune-compromised patient.The subtypes are generally grouped, based on their pre-sentation, as cutaneous or mucosal. Cutaneous types most com-monly affect the hands and fingers. Verruca vulgaris, or common warts, are caused by HPV types 1, 2, and 4, with a prevalence of up to 33% in"

A common disease that may be caused by Pityrosporum ovale, a generally harmless yeast found in sebum and hair follicles. It has a predilection for areas with oily skin such as the scalp, eyebrows, nasolabial folds, and midchest. The appearance of rash varies with age: Infants: Presents as a severe, red diaper rash with yellow scale, erosions, and blisters. A thick crust (\u201ccradle cap\u201d) may be seen on the scalp. Children/adults: Red, scaly patches are seen around the ears, eyebrows, nasolabial fold, midchest, and scalp. The rash is more localized and less dramatic than that seen in infants. Patients with HIV/AIDS can develop severe seborrheic dermatitis or an overlapping syndrome of severe seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and even Reiter\u2019s syndrome. Diagnosed by clinical impression. Rule out contact dermatitis and psoriasis."

            "content": "(Table 72-9) Disorders of hypopigmentation are often classified as either diffuse or localized. The classic example of diffuse hypopigmentation is oculocutaneous albinism (OCA). The most common forms are due to mutations in the tyrosinase gene (type I) or the P gene (type II); patients with type IA OCA have a total lack of enzyme activity. At birth, different forms of OCA can appear similar\u2014white hair, gray-blue eyes, and pink-white skin. However, the patients with no tyrosinase activity maintain this phenotype, whereas those with decreased activity will acquire some pigmentation of the eyes, hair, and skin as they age. The degree of pigment formation is also a function of racial background, and the pigmentary dilution is more readily apparent when patients are compared to their first-degree relatives. The ocular findings in OCA correlate with the degree of hypopigmentation and CAuSES of HyPoPigMEnTATion I. Primary cutaneous disorders A. Diffuse 1. Generalized vitiligoa"

Esophagitis is common in patients with AIDS and in those with hematolymphoid malignancies. These patients present with dysphagia (painful swallowing) and retrosternal pain; endoscopy demonstrates white plaques and pseudomembranes resembling those found on other mucosal surfaces. Skin infection can manifest in many different forms, including infection of the nail (onychomycosis), nail folds (paronychia), hair follicles (folliculitis), moist, intertriginous skin such as armpits or webs of the fingers and toes (intertrigo), and penile skin (balanitis). Diaper rash is a cutaneous candidal infection seen in the perineum of infants, in the region of contact with wet diapers."
