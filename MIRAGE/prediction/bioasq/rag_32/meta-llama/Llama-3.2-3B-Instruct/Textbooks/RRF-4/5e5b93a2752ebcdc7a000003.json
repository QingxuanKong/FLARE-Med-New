    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what exosomes are and what markers are used to identify them. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that are secreted by cells and can carry proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids from their parent cells. They play a role in intercellular communication and can be used as biomarkers for various cellular processes and diseases. To identify exosomes, researchers use specific markers that are uniquely expressed on the surface of exosomes. Flotillin is a protein that is primarily associated with the actin cytoskeleton and is not typically considered an exosomal marker. However, it is possible that flotillin could be present on exosomes, but it is not a commonly used marker for identifying exosomes. In contrast, other proteins such as CD63, CD81, and TSG101 are commonly used as exosomal markers. Therefore, based on the available information, it is unlikely that flotillin can be used as a reliable exosomal marker.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

            "content": "are concentrated in secretory vesicles, which then fuse with the plasma membrane and expel their contents. Transcytosis is the movement of endocytosed vesicles between the apical and basolateral compartments of cells; this is a mechanism for transferring large amounts of intact proteins across epithelial barriers (e.g., ingested antibodies in maternal milk across intestinal epithelia) or for the rapid movement of large volumes of solute. In fact, increased transcytosis probably plays a role in the increased vascular permeability seen in tumors. We now return to the two forms of endocytosis mentioned earlier."
