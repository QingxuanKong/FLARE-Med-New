According to Document [4] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts), insulators function by forming loops of chromatin, which hold a gene and its control region in rough proximity and prevent the control region from \u201cspilling over\u201d to adjacent genes. This implies that insulators are structurally insulated within chromatin loops. Furthermore, Document [1] (Title: Pathology_Robbins) states that enhancers function by looping back to gene promoters, and therefore are spatially located close to the genes that they regulate, even though they may appear to be far apart in terms of genomic sequence. This suggests that enhancers are also structurally insulated within chromatin loops. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that super enhancers are structurally insulated in chromatin loops.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

In Chapter 4, we discussed barrier sequences that prevent the spread of heterochromatin into genes that need to be expressed. A second type of DNA element, called an insulator, prevents cis-regulatory sequences from running amok and activating inappropriate genes (Figure 7\u201324). Insulators function by forming loops of chromatin, an effect mediated by specialized proteins that bind them (see Figures 4\u201348 and 7\u201324B). The loops hold a gene and its control region in rough proximity and help to prevent the control region from \u201cspilling over\u201d to adjacent genes. Importantly, these loops can be in different in different cell types, depending on the particular proteins and chromatin structures that are present."

            "content": "The phenomenon of position effect variegation provides strong evidence for the inheritance of condensed states of chromatin from one cell generation to the next. A similar mechanism appears to be responsible for maintaining the specialized chromatin at centromeres. More generally, the ability to propagate specific chromatin structures across cell generations makes possible an epigenetic cell memory process that plays a role in maintaining the set of different cell states required by complex multicellular organisms."
