Polymyxins are most often used for infections due to pathogens resistant to multiple other antibacterial agents, including urinary tract infections, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and bloodstream infections.

However, the situation has recently changed, with the worldwide selection of strains carrying determinants that mediate resistance to \u03b2-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. This situation has been compounded by the lack of development of new classes of antipseudomonal drugs for nearly two decades. Physicians now resort to drugs such as colistin and polymyxin, which were discarded decades ago. These alternative approaches to the management of multiresistant P. aeruginosa infections were first used some time ago in CF patients, who receive colistin (polymyxin E) IV and by aerosol despite its renal toxicity.

Intramuscular or Intravenous Administration Gentamicin is used mainly in severe infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria that are likely to be resistant to other drugs, especially P aeruginosa, Enterobacter sp, Serratia marcescens, Proteus sp, Acinetobacter sp, and Klebsiella sp. It usually is used in combination with a second agent because an aminoglycoside alone may not be effective for infections outside the urinary tract. Aminoglycosides should not be used as single agents for therapy of pneumonia because penetration of infected lung tissue is poor and local conditions of low pH and low oxygen tension contribute to limited activity. Gentamicin 5\u20137 mg/kg/d traditionally is given intravenously in three equal doses, but once-daily administration is just as effective for some organisms and less toxic (see above)."

Meropenem, tigecycline, and colistin are typically the most active agents. Aeromonas Species More than 85% of Aeromonas infections are caused by A. hydrophila, A. caviae, and A. veronii biovar sobria. Aeromonas proliferates in potable water, freshwater, and soil. It remains controversial whether Aeromonas is a cause of bacterial gastroenteritis; asymptomatic colonization of the intestinal tract with Aeromonas occurs frequently. However, rare cases of hemolytic-uremic syndrome following bloody diarrhea have been shown to be secondary to the presence of Aeromonas."

Drugs of the neomycin group are active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and some mycobacteria. P aeruginosa and streptococci are generally resistant. Mechanisms of antibacterial action and resistance are the same as with other aminoglycosides. The former widespread use of these drugs in bowel preparation for elective surgery contributed to the selection of resistant organisms and some outbreaks of enterocolitis in hospitals. Cross-resistance between kanamycin and neomycin is complete and may result in amikacin cross-resistance. Like all aminoglycosides, drugs of the neomycin group are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. After oral administration, the intestinal flora is suppressed or modified, and the drug is excreted in the feces. Excretion of any absorbed drug is mainly through glomerular filtration into the urine."
