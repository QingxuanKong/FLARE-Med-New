Thrombin is the most potent platelet activator. FIIa binds to and activates protease-activated receptors, a type of G protein\u2013coupled receptor (GPCR), on the surface of platelets (Fig. 35.22). FIIa is primarily associated with Gq proteins (see p. 205), resulting in activation of phospholipase C and a rise in diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP3). [Note: Thrombomodulin, through its binding of FIIa, decreases the availability of FIIa for platelet activation (see Fig. 35.18).] 1. Degranulation: DAG activates protein kinase C, a key event"

In some cases, sarcoid myopathy becomes evident as a slowly progressive, occasionally fulminant, painless proximal or distal weakness. The CK levels are elevated. Muscle biopsy discloses numerous noncaseating granulomas. However, such lesions may also be found in patients with sarcoidosis who have no weakness. Treatment with moderate doses of corticosteroids (prednisone, 25 to 50 mg daily) is usually effective in symptomatic cases, but an additional immunosuppressive agent, such as cyclosporine, may have to be instituted if improvement is not evident in several weeks."
