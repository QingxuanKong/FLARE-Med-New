    "options": {
        "A": "yes",
        "B": "no"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if enasidenib can be used for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we need to analyze the available information about enasidenib and its application in AML treatment. Enasidenib is a JAK inhibitor that targets the mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene, which is often mutated in AML. According to document [25], IDH mutations have been described in a diverse collection of cancers, including AML, and drugs that inhibit mutated IDH have produced encouraging therapeutic responses. Therefore, it is plausible that enasidenib could be used for the treatment of AML with IDH mutations. However, the question is whether enasidenib is specifically approved for the treatment of AML. Upon reviewing the provided documents, there is no specific mention of enasidenib being approved for AML treatment. However, document [26] mentions that new drugs have been approved for MDS (myelodysplastic syndromes), which are often associated with AML, and enasidenib is one of the drugs mentioned. Additionally, document [27] discusses the use of gemtuzumab ozogamicin for AML, but does not mention enasidenib. In conclusion, based on the available information, it is unclear if enasidenib is approved for the treatment of AML. However, given its mechanism of action and potential therapeutic effects on IDH mutations, it is possible that enasidenib may be explored as a treatment option for AML in the future. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is not explicitly stated in the provided documents, but based on the information available, the best choice would be to say that enasidenib is not explicitly approved for AML treatment, but its potential therapeutic effects make it a candidate for further investigation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The results of randomized clinical trials suggest that both G-CSF and GM-CSF are safe following induction and consolidation treatment of myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemia. There has been no evidence that these growth factors reduce the rate of remission or increase relapse rate.

            "content": "down to as low as 20% of the optimal dose, residual tumor cells may not be entirely eliminated, thereby allowing for eventual relapse. Because toxicities are usually associated with anticancer drugs, it is often appealing for clinicians to avoid acute toxicity by simply reducing the dose and/or by increasing the time interval between each cycle of treatment. However, such empiric modifications in dose represent a major cause of treatment failure, especially in patients with drug-sensitive tumors."

            "content": "Doxorubicin is one of the most important anti-cancer drugs in clinical practice, with major clinical activity in cancers of the breast, endometrium, ovary, testicle, thyroid, stomach, bladder, liver, and lung; in soft tissue sarcomas; and in several childhood cancers, including neuroblastoma, Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. It also has clinical activity in hematologic malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and Hodgkin\u2019s and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas. It is generally used in combination with other anti-cancer agents (eg, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and 5-FU), and clinical activity is improved with combination regimens as opposed to single-agent therapy. Daunorubicin was the first agent in this class to be isolated, and it is still used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. In contrast to doxorubicin, its efficacy in solid tumors is limited."

            "content": "Patients in accelerated or blastic phase may receive therapy with TKIs, preferably secondor third-generation TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, ponatinib), alone or in combination with chemotherapy, to reduce the CML burden, before undergoing allogeneic SCT. Response rates with single-agent TKIs range from 30 to 50% in accelerated phase and from 20 to 30% in blastic phase. Cytogenetic 694 responses, particularly complete cytogenetic responses, are uncommon (10\u201330%) and transient in blastic phase. Studies of TKIs in combination with chemotherapy are ongoing; the general experience suggests that combined TKI-chemotherapy strategies increase the response rates and their durability and improve survival. In CML lymphoid blastic phase, the combination of anti-ALL chemotherapy with TKIs results in complete response rates of 60\u201370% and median survival times of 2\u20133 years (compared with historical response rates of 40\u201350% and median survival times of 12\u201318 months). This allows many patients"
