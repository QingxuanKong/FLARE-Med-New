The duration of progression before this transformation occurs and the latency to recurrence with modern treatment may extend for many years. A survey of the outcome of these low-grade supratentorial tumors showed that 10-year survival after operation was from 11 to 40 percent provided that conformal therapy (focused on the tumor, in contrast to whole brain radiation) 5,300 cGy was given postoperatively (Shaw et al). This, of course, is quite in contrast to the figures for glioblastoma. Repeated operations prolong life in some patients."

However, its behavior and its appearance on imaging, as well as the property of diffuse infiltration of neoplastic glial cells, involving much of one or both cerebral hemispheres without a discrete tumor mass, establishes it as a useful conceptualization for clinical purposes. Whether this type of \u201cgliomatosis\u201d represents neoplastic transformation of multicentric origin or direct spread from one or more small neoplastic foci is not known. For these and other reasons, the tumor is impossible to classify (or to grade) using the conventional brain tumor schemes.

At times a contrast-enhancing lesion can be seen on MRI/ CT that can mimic the tumor for which the patient received the RT. For patients with a malignant glioma, this has been described as \u201cpseudoprogression\u201d because it mimics tumor recurrence on MRI but actually represents inflammation and necrotic debris engendered by effective therapy. This is seen with increased frequency when chemotherapy, particularly temozolomide, is given concurrently with RT.

While a small, and not a randomized trial, surgical excision resulted in longer survival. Excision of part of a cerebral astrocytoma can improve survival in a good functional state for many years.

            "content": "Midline gliomas arise most commonly in the brain stem (specifically in the pons) and also occur in the spinal cord and thalamus. They are infiltrative and result in significant neurologic impairment because of the disruption of critical nearby structures. Although they may not show typical high-grade features such as necrosis or vascular proliferation, they often behave aggressively. These lesions typically have acquired point mutations in histone H3, the consequence of which is loss of a lysine residue that is the target of post-translational modifications that regulate gene expression, another example of oncogenesis via alteration of the cancer cell \u201cepigenome\u201d. Precisely how this mutation contributes to cellular transformation remains to be determined. http://ebooksmedicine.net Fig. 23.30 Inoligodendroglioma,tumorcellshaveroundnuclei,oftenwithaclearcytoplasmichalo.Bloodvesselsinthebackgroundarethinandcanformaninterlacingpattern."

            "content": "Treatment Surgical excision followed by radiation therapy has been the conventional treatment for oligodendroglioma. However, because of uncertainty as to the histologic classification of many of the reported cases, it is not clear whether radiation therapy is attended by longer survival. Well-differentiated oligodendrogliomas should probably not receive radiation if seizures are well controlled and there are no neurologic deficits. As mentioned earlier, in the discovery by Cairncross and MacDonald of considerable importance is that many oligodendrogliomas, especially anaplastic ones and those with IDH mutations and 1p/19q codeletion, respond impressively to chemotherapeutic agents. This has been studied with the PCV regimen (procarbazine, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine) given in approximately 6 cycles, but also applies to the better-tolerated temozolomide, which has become the preferred treatment."

            "content": "Although chemotherapy has an ambiguous place in the treatment of low-grade pure astrocytomas, tumors with an oligodendroglial component respond well to combination chemotherapy used for the treatment of anaplastic oligodendroglioma. One randomized trial has shown a modest benefit in overall survival by adding chemotherapy (procarbazine, CCNU, vincristine; termed PCV) to radiation therapy of the brain (13.8 years median survival vs 7.8 years; see Buckner et al). Temozolomide has replaced PCV in many centers. The special features of astrocytomas of the pons, hypothalamus, optic nerves, and chiasm, which produce highly characteristic clinical syndromes and do not behave like a cerebral mass, are discussed further on in this chapter."
