Of the 8600 genes depicted here (each represented by a thin, vertical line), just over 300 showed threefold or greater variation in their expression patterns in response to serum reintroduction.

There are about 21,000 protein-coding genes and a roughly estimated 9000 noncoding RNA genes in humans. When the patterns of RNA expression in different human cell lines are compared, the level of expression of almost every gene is found to vary from one cell type to another. A few of these differences are striking, like those of hemoglobin and tyrosine aminotransferase noted above, but most are much more subtle. But even those genes that are expressed in all cell types usually vary in their level of expression from one cell type to the next. 4."

These are arbitrarily defined as RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides that do not code for protein. As methods have improved for determining the nucleotide sequences of all the RNA molecules produced by a cell line or tissue, the sheer number of lncRNAs (an estimated 8000 for the human genome, for example) came as a surprise to scientists. Most lncRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II and have 5\u02b9 caps and poly-A tails, and, in many cases, they are spliced.
