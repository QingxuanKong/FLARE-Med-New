The standard dosage is 1 mg/d. Rasagiline is also used as adjunctive therapy at a dosage of 0.5 or 1 mg/d to prolong the effects of carbidopa-levodopa in patients with advanced disease and response fluctuations. A large double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-start study (the ADAGIO trial) to evaluate whether it had neuroprotective benefit (ie, slowed the disease course) yielded unclear results: a daily dose of 1 mg met all the end points of the study and did seem to slow disease progression, but a 2-mg dose failed to do so. These findings are difficult to explain and the decision to use rasagiline for neuroprotective purposes therefore remains an individual one."

Moreover, the benefits of levodopa therapy often diminish as the disease advances, and serious adverse effects may complicate longterm levodopa treatment. Nevertheless, dopaminergic therapy at a relatively early stage may be most effective in alleviating motor symptoms of parkinsonism and may also favorably affect the mortality rate due to the disease. Therefore, several strategies have evolved for optimizing dopaminergic therapy, as summarized in Figure 28\u20135. Symptomatic treatment of mild parkinsonism is probably best avoided until there is some degree of disability or functional limitation or until symptoms begin to impact the patient\u2019s lifestyle or cause significant social impairment."

The drug has an interesting history that includes many early trials that failed to persuade neurologists of its effectiveness; Barbeau\u2019s paper on this historical subject may be consulted by the interested reader. Most patients tolerate the drug initially, experiencing few serious adverse effects and showing various degrees of improvement, sometimes dramatic, especially in hypokinesia and tremor after several days or sooner. However, the side effects and limitations of l-dopa become considerable as the drug therapy continues and the disease progresses, as discussed below."

Cedarbaum and colleagues, who reviewed the course of the illness in 307 patients over a 7-year period, found no evidence that the early initiation of l-dopa treatment predisposed to the development of fluctuations in motor response or to dyskinesia and dementia. In fact, the findings of the \u201cElldopa\u201d trial by The Parkinson Study Group (2004) were that functional and other measures were better in patients who had taken l-dopa for 40 weeks and then stopped the medications than in those who received no medication.

Some patients become less responsive to levodopa, perhaps because of loss of dopaminergic nigrostriatal nerve terminals or some pathologic process directly involving striatal dopamine receptors. For such reasons, the benefits of levodopa treatment often begin to diminish after about 3 or 4 years of therapy, regardless of the initial therapeutic response. Although levodopa therapy does not stop the progression of parkinsonism, its early initiation lowers the mortality rate. However, long-term therapy may lead to a number of problems in management such as the on-off phenomenon discussed below. The most appropriate time to introduce levodopa therapy must therefore be determined individually."

The other parkinsonian syndromes are for the most part changed only slightly or only for a few weeks or months by the drug. Conversely, although some experts disagree, we have adhered to the notion that complete resistance of the symptoms to l-dopa early in the illness makes the diagnosis unlikely. Furthermore, almost all patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease eventually acquire dyskinesias in response to l-dopa and the complete absence of this sign after approximately 3 to 5 years of use of the drug also brings the diagnosis into question."

It is worth noting that Parkinson disease is far more common than any of the degenerative syndromes that resemble it but the accuracy of diagnosis, especially early in the course of disease has been poor when compared with pathologic verification as noted just below. Much of this discrepancy in our view has been due simply to inadequate examination and follow up. Bradykinesia and rigidity of the limbs and axial musculature are symptoms shared with other forms of parkinsonism, but it is mainly in Parkinson disease that one observes an early sign of \u201cresting\u201d alternating tremor that is more prominent in one arm.

The loss of natural body movements and the alerting effects of l-dopa contribute to the insomnia. The directly acting dopaminergic agonist drugs used for the treatment of Parkinson disease may have the side effect of a pronounced and often rapid daytime sleepiness; however, a similar problem arises in some patients with advancing disease alone.

Experiments in the late 1950s by Carlsson demonstrated that blocking dopamine uptake with reserpine caused rabbits to become parkinsonian; this could be reversed with the dopamine precursor, levodopa. Subsequently, Hornykiewicz demonstrated a dopamine deficiency in the striatum of PD patients and suggested the potential benefit of dopaminergic replacement therapy. Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), so clinical trials were initiated with levodopa, a precursor of dopamine. Studies over the course of the next decade confirmed the value of levodopa and revolutionized the treatment of PD."

Brain aging and PD have long been thought to be related. The nigrostriatal system deteriorates with aging, and many older persons tend to develop a mild form of movement disorder characterized by bradykinesia and stooped posture that mimics mild PD. It is interesting that, in PD, older age at presentation is associated with a more severe and rapid decline in gait, balance, posture, and cognition. These age-related motor and cognitive manifestations of PD tend to be poorly responsive to levodopa or dopamine agonist treatments, especially in the oldest old. In contrast, age at presentation does not correlate with the severity and progression of other classic PD symptoms, such as tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, nor does it affect the response of these symptoms to levodopa. The pattern of PD features in older persons suggests that late-life"
