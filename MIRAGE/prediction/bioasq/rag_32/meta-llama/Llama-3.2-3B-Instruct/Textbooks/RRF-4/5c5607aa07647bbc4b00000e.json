Durvalumab is an immunotherapy drug, and immunotherapy is a growing area of treatment for lung cancer. According to document [22], durvalumab is an anti-PD-1 inhibitor, which is used to treat various cancers, including melanoma and lung cancer. In document [25], it is mentioned that durvalumab is used for metastatic squamous cell NSCLC whose cancer has progressed during or after standard platinum-based chemotherapy. This indicates that durvalumab is indeed used for lung cancer treatment, specifically for squamous cell NSCLC.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

In addition, there are active research efforts aimed at defining novel targetable mutations in lung cancer as well as defining mechanisms of acquired resistance to small-molecule inhibitors used in the treatment of patients with NSCLC. to supportive care alone. As first-line chemotherapy regimens improve, a substantial number of patients will maintain a good performance status and a desire for further therapy when they develop recurrent disease. Currently, several agents are FDA approved for second-line use in NSCLC including docetaxel, pemetrexed, erlotinib (approved for second-line therapy regardless of tumor genotype), and crizotinib (for patients with ALK -mutant lung cancer only). Most of the survival benefit for any of these agents is realized in patients who maintain a good performance status."

Metastases from certain tumor types that are highly chemosensitive, such as germ cell tumors or small-cell lung cancer, may respond to chemotherapeutic regimens chosen according to the underlying malignancy. Increasingly, there are data demonstrating responsiveness of brain metastases to chemotherapy including small molecule\u2013targeted therapy when the lesion possesses the target. This has been best illustrated in patients with lung cancer harboring EGFR mutations that sensitize them to EGFR inhibitors. Antiangiogenic agents such as bevacizumab may also prove efficacious in the treatment of CNS metastases."

Recently, however, this perception has changed based on preliminary results of studies using monoclonal antibodies that activate antitumor immunity through blockade of immune checkpoints. For example, ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody directed at cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), was studied in combination with paclitaxel plus carboplatin in patients with both SCLC and NSCLC. There appeared to be a small but not statistically significant advantage to the combination when ipilimumab was instituted after several cycles of chemotherapy. A randomized phase III trial in SCLC is under way to validate these data. Antibodies to the T cell programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1), nivolumab and pembrolizumab, have been shown to produce responses in lung cancer, renal cell cancer, and melanoma.

            "content": "Squamous cell NSCLC makes up approximately 30% of NSCLC. This form of NSCLC is responsive to platinum-based chemotherapy with either cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with gemcitabine. Recent studies have shown superior clinical activity when cisplatin and gemcitabine are combined with the anti-EGFR antibody necitumumab when compared to the cisplatin-gemcitabine combination in the first-line treatment of metastatic disease. In 2015, the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab was approved to treat metastatic squamous cell NSCLC whose cancer has progressed during or after standard platinum-based chemotherapy. This agent binds to the PD-1 receptor and inhibits the PD-1 immune signaling pathway, which then leads to activation and proliferation of T cells as well as inhibition of T-regulatory cells."

            "content": "Although response rates with EGFR TKI therapy are clearly superior in patients with lung tumors harboring activating EGFR kinase domain mutations, the EGFR TKI erlotinib is also FDA approved for secondand third-line therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC irrespective of tumor genotype. The reason for this apparent discrepancy is that erlotinib was initially evaluated in lung cancer before the discovery of EGFR activating mutations. In fact, EGFR mutations were initially identified in lung cancer by studying the tumors of patients who had dramatic responses to this agent. With the rapid pace of scientific discovery, additional driver mutations in lung cancer have been identified and targeted therapeutically with impressive clinical results. For example, chromosomal rearrangements involving the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene on chromosome 2 have been found in \u223c3\u20137% of NSCLC. The result of these ALK rearrangements is hyperactivation of the ALK TK domain. Similar to"

            "content": "First-Line Chemotherapy for Metastatic or Recurrent NSCLC A landmark meta-analysis published in 1995 provided the earliest meaningful indication that chemotherapy could provide a survival benefit in metastatic NSCLC as opposed to supportive care alone. However, the survival benefit was seemingly confined to cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (hazard ratio 0.73; 27% reduction in the risk of death; 10% improvement in survival at 1 year). These data launched two decades of clinical research aimed at detecting the optimal chemotherapy regimen for advanced NSCLC. For the most part, however, these efforts proved unsuccessful because the overwhelming majority of randomized trials showed no major survival improvement with any one regimen versus another (Table 107-11). On the other hand, differences in progression-free survival, cost, side effects, and schedule were frequently observed. These first-line studies were later extended to elderly patients, where doublet chemotherapy was found to"
