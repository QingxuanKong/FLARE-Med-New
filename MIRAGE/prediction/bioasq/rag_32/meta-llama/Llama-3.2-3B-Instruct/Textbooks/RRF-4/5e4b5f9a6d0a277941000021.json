The provided documents do not mention Pentoxifylline as a treatment for ALS. However, we can look at the information related to Pentoxifylline and ALS in Document [9] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) and Document [6] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung). According to Document [9], Pentoxifylline is used to treat endometriosis in subfertile, premenopausal women, and its effectiveness on pain, fertility, and recurrence of endometriosis is not significant. Document [6] discusses the use of Pentoxifylline as a spasmolytic agent in multiple sclerosis, but it does not mention its use in treating ALS. Additionally, Document [20] (Title: Neurology_Adams) mentions that there is no trial data on the use of Pentoxifylline for ALS. Based on the available information, there is no clear evidence to support the use of Pentoxifylline for treating ALS. Therefore, the answer is likely B (no).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

However, most such cases are of benign nature and settle down in a matter of weeks or months. In the cases reported by Hudson and colleagues, the condition, even after years, did not progress to spinal muscular atrophy, polyneuropathy, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This conforms to our experience and to that reported from the Mayo Clinic where 121 patients with benign fasciculations, followed in some cases for more than 30 years, showed no progression of symptoms and did not acquire motor neuron disease or neuropathy (Blexrud et al).

Progabide and glycine have also been found in preliminary studies to reduce spasticity. Progabide is a GABAA and GABAB agonist and has active metabolites, including GABA itself. Glycine is another inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter (see Chapter 21) that appears to possess pharmacologic activity when given orally and readily passes the blood-brain barrier.

With Joffroy in 1869 and Gombault in 1871, he studied the pathologic aspects of the disease. In a series of lectures given from 1872 to 1874, he provided a lucid account of the clinical and pathologic findings. Although called Charcot disease in France, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (the term recommended by Charcot) has been preferred in the English-speaking world. Duchenne had earlier (1858) described labioglossolaryngeal paralysis, a term that Wachsmuth in 1864 changed to progressive bulbar palsy. In 1869, Charcot called attention to the nuclear origin of progressive bulbar palsy, and in 1882 Dejerine established its relationship to ALS. Most authors credit Aran and Duchenne with the earliest descriptions of progressive spinal muscular atrophy, which they believed to be of myogenic origin. This interpretation was, of course, incorrect; Cruveilhier, a few years later, noted"

Reports that vitamin B12 levels are marginally low in a proportion of MS patients have suggested an underlying disturbance of homocysteine metabolism but this has not been confirmed (Vrethem et al)."

Oxygen supplementation is, of course, used cautiously in these patients in order to avoid suppressing respiratory drive; marginally compensated patients treated with excessive oxygen have lapsed into coma. Treatment of heart failure, phlebotomy to reduce the viscosity of the blood, and antibiotics to suppress pulmonary infection may be necessary. Often these measures result in a surprising degree of improvement, which may be maintained for months or years. If aminophylline is administered for the treatment of the underlying pulmonary airway disease, it may produce high blood levels and a tendency to produce seizures. Unlike pure hypoxic encephalopathy, prolonged coma because of hypercapnia is relatively rare and in our experience has not led to irreversible brain damage. Papilledema, myoclonus, and especially asterixis are important diagnostic features."

Some patients with cancer develop upper or lower motor neuron dysfunction or both, resembling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It is unclear whether these disorders have a paraneoplastic etiology or simply coincide with the presence of cancer. There are isolated case reports of cancer patients with motor neuron dysfunction who had neurologic improvement after tumor treatment.
