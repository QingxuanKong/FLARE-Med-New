Suspicion must be high in patients who present with diffuse symptoms, particularly adolescent girls. Many of the clinical manifestations of SLE are found in other inflammatory illnesses and during acute or chronic infection. Criteria have been developed for the diagnosis of SLE (see Table 90-1). The presence of 4 of 11 of these criteria has 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity for SLE."

This maldistribution of flow usually results from abnormalities in vascular tone. Septic shock is the most common type of distributive shock in children. Other causes include anaphylaxis, neurologic injury, and drug-related causes (see Table 40-1). Distributive shock may present with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), defined as two or more of the following: temperature greater than 38\u00b0 C or less than 36\u00b0 C; heart rate greater than 90 beats/min or more than two standard deviations above normal for age; tachypnea; or white blood count greater than 12,000 cells/mm3, less than 4000 cells/mm3, or greater than 10% immature forms."

Critical illness, in association with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), can lead to multisystem organ failure. This syndrome can occur in the setting of apparent sepsis, severe burns, or trauma, even without clear identification of an infectious agent. Many patients with critical illness, sepsis, or SIRS develop encephalopathy without obvious explanation. This condition is broadly termed sepsis-associated encephalopathy. Although the specific mediators leading to neurologic dysfunction remain uncertain, it is clear that the encephalopathy is not simply the result of metabolic derangements of multiorgan failure. The cytokines tumor necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, and IL-6 are thought to play a role in this syndrome."
