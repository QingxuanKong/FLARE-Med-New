Studies in animals suggest that it may reduce disease progression, but trials to test the effect of selegiline on the progression of parkinsonism in humans have yielded ambiguous results. The findings in a large multicenter study were taken to suggest a beneficial effect in slowing disease progression but may simply have reflected a symptomatic response."

            "content": "Parkinson\u2019s disease generally follows a progressive course. Moreover, the benefits of levodopa therapy often diminish as the disease advances, and serious adverse effects may complicate longterm levodopa treatment. Nevertheless, dopaminergic therapy at a relatively early stage may be most effective in alleviating motor symptoms of parkinsonism and may also favorably affect the mortality rate due to the disease. Therefore, several strategies have evolved for optimizing dopaminergic therapy, as summarized in Figure 28\u20135. Symptomatic treatment of mild parkinsonism is probably best avoided until there is some degree of disability or functional limitation or until symptoms begin to impact the patient\u2019s lifestyle or cause significant social impairment."

As discussed earlier, several sites are implicated in the familial forms of Parkinson disease, some related to the gene that codes for synuclein, the main component of the Lewy body. Although there is no current treatment that clearly halts or reverses the neuronal degeneration underlying Parkinson disease, methods are now available that afford considerable relief from symptoms. Treatment can be medical or surgical, although reliance is placed mainly on drugs, particularly on l-dopa (Table 38-4). The following sections are necessarily detailed so as to give the clinician a full comprehension of the use and side effects and interactions of these drugs."

The drug has an interesting history that includes many early trials that failed to persuade neurologists of its effectiveness; Barbeau\u2019s paper on this historical subject may be consulted by the interested reader. Most patients tolerate the drug initially, experiencing few serious adverse effects and showing various degrees of improvement, sometimes dramatic, especially in hypokinesia and tremor after several days or sooner.

Bradykinesia should be present before a diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease is made. Focal dystonic features may be present. Cognitive decline occurs in many patients as the disease advances. Other nonmotor symptoms include affective disorders (anxiety or depression); confusion, cognitive impairment, or personality changes; apathy; fatigue; abnormalities of autonomic function (eg, sphincter or sexual dysfunction, dysphagia and choking, sweating abnormalities, sialorrhea, or disturbances of blood pressure regulation); sleep disorders; and sensory complaints or pain.

They have found a place both as the initial treatment, replacing l-dopa in this role, and in modulating the effects of l-dopa later in the illness. However, dopamine agonists are less potent than l-dopa in managing the main features of Parkinson disease and, in higher doses and in older individuals, they produce undesirable motor and cognitive side effects (see further on). They are favored because they are associated with fewer dyskinetic motor complications, or at least, delay the need for l-dopa and its dyskinetic effects. Bromocriptine and lisuride are synthetic ergot derivatives whose action in Parkinson disease is explained by their direct stimulating effect on dopamine (D2) receptors located on striate neurons.

As discussed in Chapter 28, parkinsonian tremor and rigidity seem to result from a relative excess of cholinergic activity because of a deficiency of dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia-striatum system. The combination of an antimuscarinic agent with a dopamine precursor drug (levodopa) can sometimes provide more effective therapy than either drug alone. Vestibular disturbances, especially motion sickness, appear to involve muscarinic cholinergic transmission. Scopolamine is often effective in preventing or reversing these disturbances."

In either case, the dose of the dopamine agonist is built up gradually depending on response and tolerance.

To correct the basic dopamine deficiency from a loss of nigral cells that underlies Parkinson disease, attempts were at first made to administer dopamine directly.

But its immediate precursor, L-dopa, does cross the blood\u2013barrier and is effective in decreasing the symptoms of Parkinson disease as well as of the above-described MPTP-induced parkinsonism.

Recognition of the effects of MPTP suggested that spontane-ously occurring Parkinson\u2019s disease may result from exposure to an environmental toxin that is similarly selective in its target. However, no such toxin has yet been identified. It also suggested a successful means of producing an experimental model of Parkinson\u2019s disease in animals, especially nonhuman primates. This model is useful in the development of new antiparkinson-ism drugs. Pretreatment of exposed animals with a monoamine oxidase B inhibitor such as selegiline prevents the conversion of MPTP to MPP+ and thus protects against the occurrence of par-kinsonism. This observation has provided one reason to believe that selegiline or rasagiline may retard the progression of Parkin-son\u2019s disease in humans."

            "content": "When symptomatic treatment becomes necessary, a trial of rasagiline, selegiline, amantadine, or an antimuscarinic drug (in young patients) may be worthwhile. With disease progression, dopaminergic therapy becomes necessary. This can conveniently be initiated with a dopamine agonist, either alone or in combination with low-dose carbidopa-levodopa therapy, unless risk factors for impulse control disorders are present. Alternatively, especially in older patients, a dopamine agonist can be omitted and the patient started immediately on carbidopa-levodopa, which is the most effective symptomatic treatment of the motor disturbances of parkinsonism. Physical therapy is helpful in improving mobility. In patients with severe parkinsonism and long-term complications of levodopa therapy such as the on-off phenomenon, a trial of treatment with the newer extended-release formulation of carbidopa-levodopa (Rytary), a COMT inhibitor, or rasagiline may be helpful.

            "content": "Interest in MAO-B inhibitors has also focused on their potential to have disease-modifying effects. MPTP toxicity can be prevented experimentally by coadministration of an MAO-B inhibitor that blocks its conversion to the toxic pyridinium ion MPP+. MAO-B inhibitors also have the potential to block the oxidative metabolism of dopamine and prevent oxidative stress. In addition, both selegiline and rasagiline incorporate a propargyl ring within their molecular structure that provides antiapoptotic effects in laboratory models. The DATATOP study showed that selegiline significantly delayed the time until the emergence of disability, necessitating the introduction of levodopa, in untreated PD patients. However, it could not be determined whether this was due to a neuroprotective effect that slowed disease progression or a symptomatic effect that merely masked ongoing neurodegeneration. More recently, the ADAGIO study demonstrated that early treatment with rasagiline 1 mg/d, but not 2 mg/d,"
