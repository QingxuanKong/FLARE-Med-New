Document [1] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) mentions a study where patients who received music during surgery had less rescue anesthesia, more effective analgesia, and early mobilization compared to those who did not receive music. Although this study was conducted on patients undergoing hysterectomy, it suggests that music therapy can be beneficial for pain management. Document [11] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) discusses the use of music therapy in pain management, but it does not specifically mention neonates. Document [12] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) provides an overview of pain management, but it does not mention music therapy as an effective method for neonates. Document [14] (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson) discusses patient-controlled analgesia and other methods for pain management in older children and adolescents, but it does not mention music therapy. However, Document [1] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) does mention that music decreases sedative requirements during spinal anesthesia, which may be relevant to neonates undergoing medical procedures. Considering these documents, there is limited direct evidence on the effectiveness of music therapy for pain management in neonates. However, the available information suggests that music therapy may have a positive impact on pain management in other populations. Given the limited direct evidence and the potential benefits mentioned in the available documents, the answer to the question is not definitively clear. However, based on the available information, the most appropriate answer would be: answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Nicotine itself and certain nicotine analogs cause analgesia, and their use for postoperative analgesia is under investigation. Use of antibod-ies that bind nerve growth factor (NGF) has been shown to block inflammatory and back pain and is awaiting US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Finally, work on cannabinoids and vanilloids and their receptors suggest that \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol, which acts primarily on CB1 canna-binoid receptors, can synergize with \u03bc-receptor analgesics and interact with the TRPV1 capsaicin receptor to produce analgesia under certain circumstances. As our understanding of peripheral and central pain transduction improves, additional therapeutic targets and strategies will become available. Combined with our present"

Nonetheless, in some areas, particularly pain management, it is increasingly possible to perform the kind of rigorous systematic reviews of complementary health approaches that are the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine. A particularly valuable resource in this respect is the Cochrane Collaboration, which has performed more than 300 systematic reviews of complementary health practices. Practitioners will find this a valuable source to answer patient questions. Practice guidelines, particularly for pain management, are also available from several professional organizations. Links to these resources are provided in Table 14e-3."

At minimum, intravenous luids are given, and opioids are administered promptly for severe pain. Oxygen via nasal cannula may decrease the intensity of sickling at the capillary level. We have found that red cell transfusions after the onset of severe pain do not dramatically improve pain intensity and may not shorten its duration. Conversely, as discussed later, prophylactic transfusions almost always prevent further vasoocclusive episodes and pain crises. Recent reports suggest benefits from epidural analgesia (Verstraete, 2012; Winder, 2011). Long term, afected women can become habituated to narcotics. his problem is highlighted by the increased rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome, which is a constellation of withdrawal symptoms (Shirel,"

Blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate remained stable throughout the surgery, which is a significant advantage over pharmaceutical anesthesia (113). Although it is unlikely that acupuncture will readily be used as the only source of anesthesia in this country, it demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach and encourages its consideration as an adjunct. In one randomized controlled trial in patients undergoing upper-and lower-abdominal (gastrointestinal) surgery, acupuncture was given 2.5 cm lateral to the spine before induction. Postoperatively, patients who received the acupuncture had decreased postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting, analgesic requirement, and sympathoadrenal responses. Supplemental morphine use dropped by 50%, and postoperative nausea was reduced by 30%. Cortisol and"

One PCA regimen uses intravenous morphine given as needed as a I-mg dose with a 6-minute lockout interval and maximum dose of 30 mg in 4 hours. An additional 2-mg booster dose is permitted for a maximum of 2 doses. Alternatively, intramuscular (1M) meperidine, 50 to 75 mg every 3 to 4 hours, or 1M morphine, 10 to 15 mg every 3 to 4 hours, is suitable. In a trial using these options, Yost and associates (2004) found that morphine provided superior pain relief to meperidine and was associated with significantly higher rates of breastfeeding and continuation of newborn rooming in. Breastfeeding can be ini tiated the day of surgery. If the mother elects not to breastfeed, a binder that supports the breasts without marked compression usually will minimize discomfort."
