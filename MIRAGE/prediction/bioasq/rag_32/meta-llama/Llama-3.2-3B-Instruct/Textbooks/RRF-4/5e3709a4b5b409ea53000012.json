Although strength is a very important criterion, large-scale genetic studies suggest that other factors are equally important. For example, multiple studies reported several variants at the 8q24 chromosomal region associated with prostate and other cancers (12).

This applies even to the drugs that target genetic instability itself. Thus, PARP inhibitors give valuable remission of illness, but in the long term the disease generally comes back. For example, Brca-deficient cancers can sometimes develop resistance to PARP inhibitors by undergoing a second mutation in an affected Brca gene that restores its function.

Thus, with a number of notable exceptions (e.g., mtDNA mutations causing Leber\u2019s hereditary optic neuropathy; see below), most homoplasmic mutations are considered to be neutral markers of human evolution, which are useful and interesting in the population genetics analysis of shared maternal ancestry but which have little significance in human phenotypic variation or disease predisposition."

            "content": "Approximately 5% to 10% of breast cancers have an inherited basis. All inherited genes are autosomal dominant but have variable penetrance. Men carry the gene 50% of the time. The most common mutations are the BRCA1 (chromosome 17q21) and BRCA2 (chromosome 13q12-13) gene deletions. Carriers of these germline mutations have up to a 4% per year risk of developing breast cancer and a lifetime risk that ranges from 35% to 85% (4). These individuals have up to a 65% risk of developing a contralateral breast cancer. The BRCA1 mutation is associated with an increased risk of ovarian and prostate cancer, whereas BRCA2 carriers, although less common, demonstrate increased risks of male breast and prostate cancers. Both mutations are rare in the general public (0.1%) but are more commonly identified in Jews of Ashkenazi descent (1% to 2.3%) (5). Genetic testing is available and should be considered if there is a high likelihood that results will be positive and will be used to in\ufb02uence"

Risk factors that are less consistently associated with breast cancer (diet, use of oral contraceptives, lactation) or are rare in the general population (radiation exposure) are not included in either the Gail or Claus risk assessment model. Other models have been proposed that account for mammographic breast density in assessing breast cancer risk.54,56Neither the Gail model nor the Claus model accounts for the risk associated with mutations in the breast cancer suscepti-bility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 (described in detail in the fol-lowing section). The BRCAPRO model is a Mendelian model that calculates the probability that an individual is a carrier of a mutation in one of the breast cancer susceptibility genes based on their family history of breast and ovarian cancer.57 The prob-ability that an individual will develop breast or ovarian cancer is derived from this mutation probability based on age-specific incidence curves for"

More than 500 sequence variations in BRCA1 have been identified. It now is known that germline mutations in BRCA1 represent a predisposing genetic factor in as many as 45% of hereditary breast cancers and in at least 80% of hereditary ovarian cancers. Female mutation carriers have been reported to have up to an 85% lifetime risk (for some families) for developing breast cancer and up to a 40% lifetime risk for developing ovarian cancer. The initial families reported had high penetrance and subsequently the average lifetime risk has been reported to lie between 60% and 70%. Breast cancer susceptibility in these families appears as an autosomal dominant trait with high pen-etrance. Approximately 50% of children of carriers inherit the trait.

One of the most commonly used models for risk assessment in breast cancer is the Gail model.103 Gail and colleagues analyzed the data from 2852 breast cancer cases and 3146 controls from the Breast Cancer Detection and Demonstration Project, a mammography screening project conducted in the 1970s,"

These selectively neutral mutations can also spread and become fixed in a population, and they make a large contribution to evolutionary change in genomes. For example, as we saw earlier, they account for most of the DNA sequence differences between apes and humans. The spread of neutral mutations is not as rapid as the spread of the rare strongly advantageous mutations. It depends on a random variation in the number of mutation-bearing progeny produced by each mutation-bearing individual, causing changes in the relative frequency of the mutant allele in the population. Through a sort of \u201crandom walk\u201d process, the mutant allele may eventually become extinct, or it may become commonplace. This can be modeled mathematically for an idealized interbreeding population, on the assumption of constant population size and random mating, as well as selective neutrality for the mutations.

A brisk lymphocytic infiltrate with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes is not uncommon in these tumors. The risk of carrying a germline mutation that predisposes to ovarian cancer depends on the number of first-or second-degree relatives (or both) with a history of epithelial ovarian carcinoma or breast cancer (or both) and on the number of malignancies that occurs at an earlier age. The degree of risk is difficult to determine precisely unless a full pedigree analysis is performed. 1. In families with two first-degree relatives (i.e., mother, sister, or daughter) with documented premenopausal epithelial ovarian cancer, the risk that a female first-degree relative has an affected gene could be as high as 35% to 40% (60). 2."
