Additionally, Document [12] also mentions a distinct form of distal myopathy with autosomal dominant inheritance and onset before 2 years of age, but it is not explicitly classified as a type of SMA. However, Document [12] does mention the existence of other forms of SMA, such as Kugelberg-Welander syndrome (SMA 3) and Dubowitz syndrome (SMA 2). These are indeed types 3 and 2 respectively, which are not classified as types 1-4.

Despite the clinical heterogeneity of the heritable childhood spinal muscular atrophies, they all derive from mutations in the SMN gene (see below; see Gilliam et al; Brzustowicz et al).

It was first separated from other forms of motor system disease and from muscular dystrophy by Wohlfart et al and by Kugelberg and Welander in the mid-1950s. In about one-third of the cases the onset is before 2 years of age, and in half, between 3 and 18 years. Males predominate, especially among patients with juvenile and adult onset. The usual form of transmission is by an autosomal recessive pattern; most cases result from mutations in the SMN gene; as mentioned, multiple copies of the SMN2 gene partly rescue the loss of SMN1 and lead to this milder form of disease. Families with dominant and sex-linked inheritance have also been described."

The genetic discovery in relation to this disease that opened a new chapter in understanding the disease was the discovery of the mutation in the superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene in familial cases of motor neuron disease.

The EMG is helpful, if not decisive, in differentiating these disorders. A mild hemiparesis or monoparesis because of multiple sclerosis may be, for a time, difficult to distinguish from early ALS and primary lateral sclerosis. Progressive spinal muscular atrophy may be differentiated from peroneal muscular atrophy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy) by the lack of family history, the complete lack of sensory change, and different EMG patterns, as described in Chap. 43. Motor system disease beginning in the proximal limb muscles may be misdiagnosed as an inflammatory myopathy or a limb-girdle type of muscular dystrophy."

Beginning with Brossard in 1886, there were numerous reports of a distinctive pattern of progressive muscular weakness and wasting that involved the muscles of the neck, shoulders, and upper arms, and of the anterior tibial and peroneal groups, causing severe foot-drop. The nature of this disorder has been a matter of controversy, some writers claiming it to be a progressive muscular dystrophy and others, a muscular atrophy of spinal or neuropathic type. Probably both are correct in that either process can produce more or less the same pattern of weakness.

Muscle necrosis at all ages excites a regenerative response from sarcolemmal and satellite cells in any intact parts of the fibers. If this occurs repeatedly, the regenerative potential wanes, with ultimate death of the fiber leading to permanent depopulation of fibers with the expected muscle weakness. The number and diversity of diseases of striated muscle greatly exceed the number of symptoms and signs by which they express themselves clinically; thus, different diseases share certain common symptoms and syndromes. To avoid excessive repetition in the description of individual diseases, we discuss here, in one place, the broad clinical manifestations of muscle disease."

All the SMA phenotypes in children have been mapped to mutations affecting the \u201csurvival of motor neuron\u201d (SMN1) gene. The SMN protein participates in forming protein-RNA complexes (small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and RNA) that are essential for gene splicing. Within the SMN locus there are 2 alleles: SMN1, which generates a full-length, fully functional form of SMN, and SMN2, which makes a truncated, partially functional SMN. The latter can partially compensate for the loss of SMN1. Making matters more complex, individuals vary in the number copies of SMN2. As a result, disease due to loss of both copies of SMN1 causes very severe SMA in individuals who carry only one copy of SMN2, while those with multiple copies of SMN2 have milder disease. Thus, the amount of SMN2 protein determines the severity and time of onset"

            "content": "Monoplegia with Muscular Atrophy This is more frequent than monoplegia without muscular atrophy. Long-continued disuse of one limb may lead to atrophy, but it is usually of lesser degree than atrophy caused by lower motor neuron disease (denervation atrophy). In disuse atrophy, the tendon reflexes are retained and nerve conduction studies are normal. With denervation of muscles, there may be visible fasciculations and reduced or abolished tendon reflexes in addition to paralysis. The location of the lesion (in nerves, spinal roots, or spinal cord) can usually be determined by the pattern of weakness, by the associated neurologic symptoms and signs, and by special tests\u2014MRI of the spine, examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and electrical studies of nerve and muscle. If the limb is partially denervated, the EMG shows reduced numbers of motor unit potentials (often of large size) as well as fasciculations and fibrillations."

            "content": "The differentiation of dystrophic diseases of muscle from those secondary to neuronal degeneration was an achievement of neurologists of the second half of the nineteenth century. Isolated cases of muscular dystrophy had been described earlier, but no distinction was made between neuropathic and myopathic disease. In 1855, Duchenne described the progressive muscular atrophy of childhood that now bears his name. However, it was not until the second edition of his monograph in 1861 that the \u201chypertrophic paraplegia of infancy\u201d was recognized as a distinct syndrome. By 1868, he was able to write a comprehensive description of 13 cases and recognized that the disease was muscular in origin and restricted to males. Gowers in 1879 gave a masterful account of 21 personally observed cases and called attention to the characteristic way in which such patients arose from the floor (Gowers sign). Erb, in 1891, crystallized the clinical and histologic concept of a group of diseases caused by"
