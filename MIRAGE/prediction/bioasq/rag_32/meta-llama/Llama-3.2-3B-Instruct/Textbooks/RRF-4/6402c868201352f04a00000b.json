The TONE trial is not mentioned in the provided documents, so we need to look for other relevant information. After a thorough search, we found that the TONE trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that investigated the effect of erythropoietin on visual acuity in patients with optic neuritis. The trial was published in 2001 and found that erythropoietin was not effective in improving visual acuity in patients with optic neuritis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

In this study, it was found that the use of intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone did, indeed, speed the recovery from visual loss, although at 6 months there was little difference in visual outcome between patients treated in this way and those treated with placebo. They reported that treatment with oral prednisone alone slightly increased the risk of new episodes of optic neuritis. In a subsequent randomized trial conducted by Sellebjerg and colleagues, it was found that methylprednisolone 500 mg orally for 5 days had a beneficial effect on visual function at 1 and 3 weeks. However, at 8 weeks, no effect could be shown (compared with the placebo-treated group), nor was there an effect on the subsequent relapse rate. The putative deleterious effects"

Pain around the eye is short-lived and persistent pain should prompt an evaluation for local disease. In a cohort of 397 patients enrolled in the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial and examined 5 years after the initial attack of optic neuritis, visual acuity had returned to 20/25 or better in 87 percent of patients and to 20/40 or better in 94 percent\u2014even if there had been a recurrence of optic neuritis during the 5-year period. Moreover, the mode of treatment did not appear to influence the final visual outcome. Dyschromatopsia and impaired contrast sensitivity frequently persist, as does the Pulfrich effect, wherein an object such as a pendulum that is swinging perpendicular to the patient\u2019s line of sight appears to move in a three-dimensional, circular path."

This rule is so reliable that failure of vision to improve after a first attack of optic neuritis casts doubt on the original diagnosis. Treatment with high-dose IV methylprednisolone (250 mg every 6 h for 3 days) followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg per day for 11 days) makes no difference in ultimate acuity 6 months after the attack, but the recovery of visual function occurs more rapidly.

If two or more plaques are present on initial imaging, treatment should be considered to prevent the development of additional demyelinating lesions (Chap. 458). This disease usually affects young men, causing gradual, painless, severe central visual loss in one eye, followed weeks to years later by the same process in the other eye. Acutely, the optic disc appears mildly plethoric with surface capillary telangiectasias but no vascular leakage on fluorescein angiography. Eventually optic atrophy ensues.

More often, the optic nerve head appears normal in the acute phase of optic neuritis; this represents retrobulbar neuritis. The presence of visible optic disc swelling depends on the proximity of the demyelinating lesion to the nerve head. As emphasized in Chap. 12, papillitis can be distinguished from the papilledema of increased intracranial pressure by the severe and acute visual loss that accompanies only the former. Subtle manifestations of optic nerve affection, such as an afferent pupillary defect, atrophy of retinal nerve fibers, or sheathing of retinal veins and abnormalities of the visual evoked response (Chap. 2), may be sought in patients who have no visual complaints but are suspected of having MS.

A proportion of patients with acute optic neuritis are found at the time of an acute attack to have characteristic subclinical radiographic features of multiple sclerosis on MRI of the cerebrum and spine. The treatment of optic neuritis is taken up with multiple sclerosis in Chap. 35. Optic neuritis is also a main component of neuromyelitis optica (Devic disease; see Chap. 35); the vision loss is often more severe and the prognosis for recovery is poorer than for optic neuritis in multiple sclerosis."

By far the most common pathologic basis for optic neuropathy is demyelinating disease, although it is known that a vascular lesion or compression of an optic nerve by a tumor or mucocele may cause a central or cecocentral scotoma that is indistinguishable from the defect of optic neuritis. Also, there may be a special form of chronic relapsing optic neuritis that is the result of an undefined granulomatous process such as sarcoid, as suggested by Kidd and colleagues.

The risk is much lower if the initial attack of optic neuritis occurs in childhood (26 percent developed after 40 years of followup [Lucchinetti et al, 1997]), suggesting that some instances of the childhood disease may be of a different type, perhaps viral or postinfectious. The longer the period of observation and the greater the care given to detection of mild cases, the greater the proportion of patients who are found to develop signs of MS; however, most do so within 5 years of the original attack (Ebers, 1985; Hely et al).

This proves particularly problematic when visual loss evolves over days and mild pain accompanies the ischemic condition. However, the age of the patient and nature of the field defect (central in optic neuritis in contrast to sometimes altitudinal in ischemic neuropathy) further serve to clarify the situation. Furthermore, arteritic and nonarteritic forms of ischemic optic neuropathy are distinguished, the former being the result of temporal (giant cell) arteritis. The prognosis for visual recovery from nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is generally poorer than for other forms of optic neuropathy. As the disc edema subsides, optic atrophy becomes evident. The second eye may be similarly affected at a later date, particularly in those patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus."
