    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if indinavir is effective for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we need to analyze the available information. According to the provided documents, there is no direct evidence that suggests indinavir is used or approved for the treatment of ALS. However, we can look for any indirect connections or potential interactions. Document [5] (Title: Neurology_Adams) mentions that the antiglutamate agent riluzole, when given orally, was shown by Bensimon and colleagues to slow the progression of ALS and improve survival in patients with disease of bulbar onset. Document [5] (Title: Neurology_Adams) also mentions that some additional agents, such as antioxidants, have slowed the clinical progress of ALS in limited and unconfirmed trials. There is no mention of indinavir in these documents. However, Document [25] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) mentions that grazoprevir, a potent, pan-genotypic protease inhibitor, is under development for HSV infection, but it is not related to ALS treatment. Document [31] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) does not mention indinavir at all. Therefore, based on the provided information, there is no clear evidence that indinavir is effective for the treatment of ALS. The correct answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Clinical trials of a conditionally immortalized human cell line and of USCs in stroke are also in progress. Because of the incapacitating nature of neural disorders and the limited endogenous repair capacity of the nervous system, clinical trials of stem cells in neurologic disorders have been particularly numerous, including trials in spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, ALS, acute and chronic stroke, numerous genetic disorders, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and others.

In HIV patients, aggressive treatment using antiretroviral drug combinations, including protease inhibitors, slows the progression of PML and has led to remission in almost half of cases, as in the large series reported by Antinori and colleagues. Several series found that the disease occurs with a CD4 count below 200 cells/\u03bcL, most often with counts below 50/\u03bcL and a higher count makes the diagnosis of PML unlikely, although up to 10 percent of patients have higher values.

The recommended treatment in these circumstances is amphotericin supplemented by flucytosine for 2 weeks. Subsequently, fluconazole, an oral triazole antifungal agent, is given (or less preferably, oral itraconazole), for up to 1 year or indefinitely to prevent relapse (Saag et al; Powderly et al). The medication can be discontinued if the CD4 exceeds 100/mm3 and HIV viral load is suppressed. The optimum use of these drugs has not been settled, and some trials have yielded ambiguous results in both HIV and other patients. Details of a randomized trial in HIV comparing amphotericin as above to a regimen of additional flucytosine is given by Day and colleagues. They showed no advantage to an initial regimen of both drugs over amphotericin alone."

Because all of the treated mice develop neurologic dysfunction at the same time, the mutation rate as judged by drug resistance is likely to approach 100%, which is much higher than mutation rates recorded for bacteria and viruses. Mutations in prions seem likely to represent conformational variants that are selected for in mammals where survival becomes limited by the fastest-replicating prions.
