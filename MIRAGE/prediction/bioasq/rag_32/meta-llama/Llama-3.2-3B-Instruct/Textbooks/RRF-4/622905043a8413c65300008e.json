In fact, the provided documents do not mention air pollution as a known cause of ANE.

Rather, it is believed that immune cells responding to pathogen-associated antigens cross-react against myelin antigens, resulting in myelin damage. There are two general patterns of postinfectious autoimmune reactions to myelin; unlike MS, they both are associated with acute-onset monophasic illnesses. In acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, symptoms typically develop 1 or 2 weeks after an antecedent infection and are nonlocalizing (headache, lethargy, and coma), in contrast with the focal findings of MS. Symptoms progress rapidly, and the illness is fatal in as many as 20% of cases; in the remaining patients, there is complete recovery. Acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis is a more devastating related disorder, which typically affects young adults and children."

When there is no coexistent epidemic of encephalitis to suggest the diagnosis, or the preceding systemic illness is absent or obscure, a differentiation between the two may not be possible on clinical grounds alone. The fever is generally higher in the infectious type but even this difference does not always hold in young children with ADEM.

Neurologic symptoms often appear subacutely or abruptly, sometimes precipitated by a febrile illness or a surgical operation. It has seemed to us that this rapid onset is more characteristic of Leigh disease than it is of the other mitochondrial disorders and the disease could reasonably be designated as \u201cacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy\u201d (ANE), a term applied to a similar entity in Japan and China."
