MAIT cells are a type of T cell that recognizes metabolites of vitamin B derived mainly from the riboflavin metabolism pathway in microbes presented by the MR1 MHC class Ib molecule.\\n\\nNext, we need to see if there is any connection between MAIT cells and multiple myeloma. After reviewing the documents, we can see that MR1 is mentioned as a nonclassical MHC class I molecule that presents microbial folate metabolites to MAIT cells. Additionally, multiple myeloma is associated with dysregulation of the cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 genes, and it is also linked to the production of factors that upregulate the expression of RANKL by bone marrow stromal cells, which activates osteoclasts and leads to bone resorption.\\n\\nHowever, there is no direct information in the documents that links MAIT cells to the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma or its clinical manifestations. Therefore, we can conclude that MAIT cells do not have a direct role in multiple myeloma.\\n\\nHowever, based on the provided information, it can be inferred that MAIT cells may play a role in the immune response to infections that may be associated with multiple myeloma, such as bacterial infections, which can activate MAIT cells.\\n\\nThus, the answer to the question is that MAIT cells may have an indirect role in multiple myeloma through their activation in response to infections, but they are not directly involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Myeloma cells are sensitive to inhibitors of the proteasome, a cellular organelle that degrades unwanted and misfolded proteins. As discussed in Chapter 2, misfolded proteins activate apoptotic pathways, and myeloma cells are prone to the accumulation of misfolded, unpaired immunoglobulin chains. Proteasome inhibitors likely induce myeloma cell death by exacerbating this inherent tendency.

Moreover, some patients generate a population of circulating regulatory cells in response to their myeloma that can suppress normal antibody synthesis.

Differentiate into cytotoxic T cells (express CD8, recognize MHC I), helper T cells (express CD4, recognize MHC II), and regulatory T cells. CD28 (costimulatory signal) necessary for T-cell activation. Most circulating lymphocytes are T cells (80%). T = Thymus. CD4+ helper T cells are the primary target of HIV. Rule of 8: MHC II \u00d7 CD4 = 8; MHC I \u00d7 CD8 = 8. Plasma cells Produce large amounts of antibody specific to Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell dyscrasia. a particular antigen. \u201cClock-face\u201d chromatin distribution and eccentric nucleus, abundant RER, and well-developed Golgi apparatus (arrows in A ). Found in bone marrow and normally do not circulate in peripheral blood."

CD8\u03b1 chains can form homodimers, although these are usually not found when CD8\u03b2 is expressed. Naive T cells express CD8\u03b1\u03b2, but the CD8\u03b1\u03b1 homodimer can be expressed by highly activated effector and memory T cells. CD8\u03b1\u03b1 is also expressed by a population of intraepithelial lymphocytes known as mucosal associated invariant T cells (MAIT cells); these cells recognize metabolites of folic acid that are produced by bacteria in association with the nonclassical MHC class I molecule MR1, which we will describe in Chapter 6."
