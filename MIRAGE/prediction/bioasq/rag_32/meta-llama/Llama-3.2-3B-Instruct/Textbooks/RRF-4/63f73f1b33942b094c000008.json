After reviewing the documents, I found that there is no specific information about erenumab being used to treat trigeminal neuralgia. However, I found that erenumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor, which is involved in migraine treatment. While CGRP is also involved in other types of headaches, such as cluster headaches, there is no direct information about erenumab being used for trigeminal neuralgia. Therefore, based on the provided documents, we can conclude that there is not enough information to determine the effectiveness of erenumab for trigeminal neuralgia. However, considering the broader context of CGRP's role in headaches, it is possible that erenumab might have some effect on trigeminal neuralgia, but this is highly speculative and not directly supported by the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Phenytoin (Dilantin) and carbamazepine (Tegretol) were first shown to relieve the pain of trigeminal neuralgia. This pain has a characteristic brief, shooting, electric shock\u2013like quality. In fact, anticonvulsants seem to be particularly helpful for pains that have such a lancinating quality. Newer anticonvulsants, gabapentin (Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica), are effective for a broad range of neuropathic pains. Furthermore, because of their favorable side effect profile, these newer anticonvulsants are often used as first-line agents."

Pain from migraine or cluster headache tends to be deep-seated and steady, unlike the superficial stabbing quality of trigeminal neuralgia; rarely, cluster headache is associated with trigeminal neuralgia, a syndrome known as cluster-tic. In temporal arteritis, superficial facial pain is present but is not typically shock-like, the patient frequently complains of myalgias and other systemic symptoms, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is usually present (Chap. 385). When trigeminal neuralgia develops in a young adult or is bilateral, multiple sclerosis (MS) is a key consideration, and in such cases, the cause is a demyelinating plaque near the root entry zone of the fifth nerve in the pons; often, evidence of facial sensory loss can be found on careful examination.

It may be triggered by coughing, sneezing, swallowing, and pressure on the tragus of the ear. Temporary blocking of the pain by anesthetizing the tonsillar fauces and posterior pharynx with 10 percent lidocaine spray is diagnostic. Rarely, herpes zoster may involve the glossopharyngeal nerve. Fainting as a manifestation of vagoglossopharyngeal neuralgia is described in Chap. 9."

When these possibilities are eliminated by appropriate studies, there always remain examples of primary idiopathic otalgia, lower cluster headache, and glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Some patients with migraine have pain centered in the ear region and occiput, but we have never observed a trigeminal neuralgia in which the ear was the predominant site of pain. Occasionally, temporomandibular joint disease is the cause (see below)."
