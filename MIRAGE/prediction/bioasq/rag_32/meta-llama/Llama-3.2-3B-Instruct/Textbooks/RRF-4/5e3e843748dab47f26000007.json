    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the difference between stretch enhancers and super-enhancers. Stretch enhancers are long-range enhancers that can be located up to 1 MB away from the promoter of a gene and can be transcribed themselves. Super-enhancers, on the other hand, are the largest and most active enhancer elements in the genome, typically found in developmentally regulated genes and often involved in cell-type-specific gene expression. The question asks whether stretch enhancers are transcribed more than super-enhancers. Based on the provided documents, there is no direct information comparing the transcription levels of stretch enhancers and super-enhancers. However, we can make an educated guess based on the understanding of the role of enhancers in regulating gene expression. Enhancers, including stretch enhancers and super-enhancers, are transcribed themselves and can regulate the transcription of nearby genes. Given that super-enhancers are often involved in cell-type-specific gene expression and are typically found in developmentally regulated genes, it is plausible that they may be transcribed more than stretch enhancers, which may have a more general regulatory function. Therefore, the answer is likely B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

In animals and plants, it is not unusual to find the regulatory sequences of a gene dotted over stretches of DNA as large as 100,000 nucleotide pairs. Some of this DNA is transcribed (but not translated), and we discuss these long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) later in this chapter.

Enhancers contain DNA sequences called response elements that bind STF. By bending or looping the DNA, STF can interact with other TF bound to a promoter and with RNA pol II, thereby stimulating transcription (see Fig. 31.13B). Mediator also binds enhancers.

In contrast, contractility results from: (1) enhanced interactions between the actin and myosin proteins; (2) heightened excitability of individual myometrial cells; and (3) promotion of intracellular crosstalk that allows synchronous contractions to develop."

            "content": "In addition to introns and exons, each gene is associated with regulatory DNA sequences, which are responsible for ensuring that the gene is turned on or off at the proper time, expressed at the appropriate level, and only in the proper type of cell. In humans, the regulatory sequences for a typical gene are spread out over tens of thousands of nucleotide pairs. As would be expected, these regulatory sequences are much more compressed in organisms with concise genomes. We discuss how regulatory DNA sequences work in Chapter 7."

            "content": "Although chromosomes are organized into orderly domains that discourage control regions from acting indiscriminately, there are special circumstances where a control region located on one chromosome has been found to activate a gene located on a different chromosome. Although there is much we do not understand about this mechanism, it indicates the extreme versatility of transcriptional regulation strategies."

            "content": "Studies of RNA polymerase II and its general transcription factors acting on DNA templates in purified in vitro systems established the model for transcription initiation just described. However, as discussed in Chapter 4, DNA in eukaryotic cells is packaged into nucleosomes, which are further arranged in higher-order chromatin structures. As a result, transcription initiation in a eukaryotic cell is more complex and requires more proteins than it does on purified DNA. First, gene regulatory proteins known as transcriptional activators must bind to specific sequences in DNA (called enhancers) and help to attract RNA polymerase II to the start point of transcription (Figure 6\u201318). We discuss the role of these activators in Chapter 7, because they are one of the main ways in which cells regulate expression of their genes. Here we simply note that their presence on DNA is required for transcription initiation in a eukaryotic cell. Second, eukaryotic transcription initiation in vivo"
