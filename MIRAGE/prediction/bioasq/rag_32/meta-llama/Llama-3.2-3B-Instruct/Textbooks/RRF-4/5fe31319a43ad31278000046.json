ATAC-Seq stands for Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing, which is a technique used to analyze chromatin structure and identify regions of the genome that are accessible to transcription factors and other proteins. It is typically performed on bulk cell samples or tissues and provides information on DNA accessibility, which is associated with active transcription. Considering that ATAC-Seq requires large amounts of DNA material and is typically performed on bulk samples, it is not suitable for single-cell analysis. Single-cell RNA-seq and other techniques like ChIP-seq can be employed in single-cell mode, but ATAC-Seq is not.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

This method covers a majority of promoters as well as some repetitive regions in the genome.RNA-seq is usually performed to analyze transcription for the same purpose as performing a microarray. However, RNA-seq is more accurate and provides more information such as splicing variants than traditional microarray. Usually, cDNA that is reversely transcribed from extracted RNA is used to generate libraries. Depending on the needs, mRNA and ncRNA can be enriched in different protocols for RNA extraction. Currently, techniques have been improved to perform RNA profiling on a single cell level. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows expression analysis of individual cells in a population.

It is important to keep in mind that although genomes remain the same from cell to cell and from tissue to tissue, the RNA produced from the genome can vary enormously. We will see later in this chapter that sequencing the entire repertoire of RNA from a cell or tissue (known as deep RNA sequencing, or RNA-seq) is a powerful way to understand how the information present in the genome is used by different cells under different circumstances.

It is the dramatic consequences of its absence that focused early efforts on the identification of insulin and the study of its normal role in physiology.\u201d 8\u201316 You have just gotten back the results from an RNA-seq analysis of mRNAs from liver. You had anticipated counting the number of reads of each mRNA to determine the relative abundance of different mRNAs. But you are puzzled because many of the mRNAs have given you results like those shown in Figure Q8\u20134. How is it that different parts of an mRNA can be represented at different levels?"
