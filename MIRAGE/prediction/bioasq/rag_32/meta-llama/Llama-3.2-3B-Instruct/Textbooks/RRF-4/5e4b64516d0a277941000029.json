According to Document [0], the first two placebo-controlled trials of \u03b3-secretase inhibitors, tarenflurbil and semagacestat, were negative, and semagacestat may have accelerated cognitive decline compared to placebo. This suggests that semagacestat is not effective for Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, Document [14] states that a series of trials using a small molecule inhibitors of the enzyme \u03b3-secretase (including semagacestat) have failed to demonstrate clear benefit in even early stages of Alzheimer disease.

(It should be borne in mind that these are not pathologically proven cases and, while probably correct as an approximation, are likely combined with other diseases.) Prevalence rates, which depend also on overall mortality, are approximately 3 times higher in women, although the incidence of new cases is only slightly disproportionate in women. However, there is a suggestion that incidence rates for dementia in general are declining (see Satizabal et al) and it is likely that most of the cases are due to Alzheimer disease. The survival of patients with Alzheimer disease is reduced to half the expected rate, mainly because of respiratory and cardiovascular causes and inanition, but also for other reasons that are not entirely clear."

Treatment with antiretroviral drugs can result in cognitive improvement. There is an interest in rare cases of poor penetration of antiretroviral drugs into the central nervous system, allowing for viral replication and reemergence despite elimination of HIV from the peripheral blood."

It is one of the most frequent mental illnesses, making up a large proportion of persons in assisted living and skilled nursing facilities. The incidence of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer disease is similar throughout the world, and it increases with age, approximating 3 new cases yearly per 100,000 persons younger than age 60 years and a staggering 125 new cases per 100,000 of those older than age 60 years. The prevalence of the disease per 100,000 population is near 300 in the group aged 60 to 69 years; it is 3,200 in the 70to 79-year-old group and 10,800 in those older than age 80.
