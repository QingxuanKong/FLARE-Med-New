    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer whether PRDM9 is essential for meiosis, we need to understand the role of PRDM9 in the context of meiosis. PRDM9 is known to play a role in the regulation of meiosis, particularly in the control of crossovers. It binds to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes and is required for the proper regulation of recombination hotspots. However, there is no direct information provided in the given documents about the necessity of PRDM9 for meiosis itself. The provided documents discuss the general process of meiosis, including the role of crossing-over, homologous recombination, and the regulation of crossovers, but they do not specifically mention PRDM9. Therefore, we cannot determine the essentiality of PRDM9 for meiosis based on the given information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The relatively few crossovers that do form are distributed along chromosomes in such a way that a crossover in one position inhibits crossing-over in neighboring regions. Termed crossover control, this fascinating but poorly understood regulatory mechanism ensures the roughly even distribution of crossover points along chromosomes. It also ensures that each chromosome\u2014 no matter how small\u2014undergoes at least one crossover every meiosis. For many organisms, roughly two crossovers per chromosome occur during each meiosis, one on each arm. As discussed in detail in Chapter 17, these crossovers play an important mechanical role in the proper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis."

As might be expected, therefore, crossing-over is highly regulated: the number and location of double-strand breaks along each chromosome is controlled, as is the likelihood that a break will be converted into a crossover. On average, the result of this regulation is that each pair of human homologs is linked by about two or three crossovers (Figure 17\u201359). Although the double-strand breaks that occur in meiosis I can be located almost anywhere along the chromosome, they are not distributed uniformly: they cluster at \u201chot spots,\u201d where the DNA is accessible, and occur only rarely in \u201ccold spots,\u201d such as the heterochromatin regions around centromeres and telomeres."

Because no DNA replication precedes meiosis II, after this division each spermatid has the haploid (1n) number of chromosomes, each containing a single chromatid (1d). Meiosis is described in detail in Chapter 3 (see page 89); a brief description of spermatocyte meiosis follows. Prophase of the first meiotic division, during which the chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, lasts up to 22 days in human primary spermatocytes. At the end of prophase, 44 autosomes and an X and a Y chromosome, each having two chromatin strands (chromatids), can be identified.

Another important difference is that, in meiosis, recombination occurs preferentially between maternal and paternal chromosomal homo-logs rather than between the newly replicated, identical DNA duplexes that pair in double-strand break repair.

In humans, each meiosis requires that the starting cell keep track of 92 chromatids (46 chromosomes, each of which has duplicated), distributing one complete set of each type of autosome to each of the four haploid progeny. Not surprisingly, mistakes can occur in allocating the chromosomes during this elaborate process. Mistakes are especially common in human female meiosis, which arrests for years after diplotene: meiosis I is completed only at ovulation, and meiosis II only after the egg is fertilized. Indeed, such chromosome segregation errors during egg development are the most common cause of both spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) and mental retardation in humans."

This cleavage allows the sister chromatids to separate at anaphase II and move to opposite poles of the cell. During meiosis II, the cells pass through prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telophase II. These stages are essentially the same as those in mitosis except that they involve a haploid set of chromosomes (1n) and produce daughter cells that have only haploid DNA content (1d).

Cohesin phosphorylation is normally required for separase to cleave cohesin; thus, removal of this phosphorylation near the centromere prevents cohesin cleavage. Sister-chromatid pairs therefore remain linked through meiosis I, allowing their correct bi-orientation on the spindle in meiosis II. Shugoshin is inactivated after meiosis I. At the onset of anaphase II, APC/C activation triggers centromeric cohesin cleavage and sisterchromatid separation\u2014much as it does in mitosis.
