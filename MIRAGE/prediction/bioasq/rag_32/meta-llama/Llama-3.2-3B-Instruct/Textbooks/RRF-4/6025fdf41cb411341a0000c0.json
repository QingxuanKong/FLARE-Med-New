Document [10] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) mentions that nesiritide has been investigated for the treatment of decompensated acute heart failure, but Document [24] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) states that large trials with nesiritide have failed to show an improvement in mortality or rehospitalization. Document [24] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) also mentions that the Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide in Decompensated Heart Failure (ASCEND-HF) study did not show an improvement in outcomes with nesiritide compared to regular care in patients with heart failure. Based on this information, it appears that nesiritide is not supported as an effective treatment for ischemic stroke. Furthermore, Document [24] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) notes that excessive hypotension is a common adverse effect of nesiritide, which could potentially worsen outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke. Therefore, the use of nesiritide for treatment of ischemic stroke should be approached with caution, if at all. The current evidence does not support the use of nesiritide for this indication.

            "content": "Neuroprotection is the concept of providing a treatment that prolongs the brain\u2019s tolerance to ischemia. Drugs that block the excitatory amino acid pathways have been shown to protect neurons and glia in animals, but despite multiple human trials, they have not yet been proven to be beneficial. Hypothermia is a powerful neuroprotective treatment in patients with cardiac arrest (Chap. 330) and is neuroprotective in animal models of stroke, but it has not been adequately studied in patients with ischemic stroke and is associated with an increase in pneumonia rates that could adversely impact stroke outcomes."

            "content": "Excitotoxicity refers to neuronal cell death caused by activation of excitatory amino acid receptors (Fig. 444e-4). Compelling evidence for a role of excitotoxicity, especially in ischemic neuronal injury, is derived from experiments in animal models. Experimental models of stroke are associated with increased extracellular concentrations of the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter glutamate, and neuronal damage is attenuated by denervation of glutamate-containing neurons or the administration of glutamate receptor antagonists. The distribution of cells sensitive to ischemia corresponds closely with that of N-methyld-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (except for cerebellar Purkinje cells, which are vulnerable to hypoxia-ischemia but lack NMDA receptors); and competitive and noncompetitive NMDA antagonists are effective in preventing focal ischemia. In global cerebral ischemia, non-NMDA receptors (kainic acid and \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate [AMPA]) are activated, and"

            "content": "Ticlopidine is approved for prevention of stroke in patients with a history of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or thrombotic stroke, and in combination with aspirin for prevention of coronary stent thrombosis. Adverse effects of ticlopidine include nausea, dyspepsia, and diarrhea in up to 20% of patients, hemorrhage in 5%, and, most seriously, leukopenia in 1%. The leukopenia is detected by regular monitoring of the white blood cell count during the first 3 months of treatment. Development of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has also been associated with the ingestion of ticlopidine. The dosage of ticlopidine is 250 mg twice daily orally. Because of the significant side effect profile, the use of ticlopidine for stroke prevention should be restricted to those who are intolerant of or have failed aspirin therapy. Dosages of ticlopidine less than 500 mg/d may be efficacious with fewer adverse effects."

            "content": "Several considerations weigh in any discussion of the institution and choice of antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment (meant here to denote the agents that alter the clotting cascade) for stroke. First is the distinction between anticoagulation to prevent the progression of an acute stroke and the prophylactic use of anticoagulation for the prevention of future strokes. Second, the pivotal issue in prevention of further strokes is whether the stroke or TIA is atherothrombotic or cardioembolic. As discussed further on, several studies point conclusively to a role for anticoagulation in stroke due to certain cardioembolic sources, particularly atrial fibrillation, while the indications in acute stroke are less certain."
