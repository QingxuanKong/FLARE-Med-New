Sotrovimab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which is a key component of the COVID-19 virus. The available documents do not provide specific information about Sotrovimab. However, we can analyze the available information about other monoclonal antibodies and COVID-19 treatment options.\\n\\nMonoclonal antibodies have been shown to be effective in treating COVID-19, particularly in high-risk patients or those who have not responded to other treatments. For example, Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been shown to have a favorable safety profile and may be effective in treating COVID-19. Similarly, the use of corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with severe COVID-19.\\n\\nHowever, there is limited information available about Sotrovimab specifically. To determine its effectiveness, we need to look for clinical trial data or studies that have evaluated Sotrovimab in the treatment of COVID-19.\\n\\nBased on the available information, it is not possible to determine the effectiveness of Sotrovimab for COVID-19 treatment. However, we can conclude that monoclonal antibodies have been shown to be effective in treating COVID-19 in certain contexts.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is not explicitly stated in the provided documents, and more information is needed to determine the effectiveness of Sotrovimab for COVID-19 treatment.\\n\\nHowever, based on the available information about monoclonal antibodies, a possible answer could be:\\n\\nAnswer Choice A: No, the available information is not sufficient to determine the effectiveness of Sotrovimab for COVID-19 treatment.\\n\\nThis answer is not explicitly stated in the provided documents, but it is a reasonable conclusion based on the available information.\\n\\nAnswer Choice B: Yes, the available information is not sufficient to determine the effectiveness of Sotrovimab for COVID-19 treatment.\\n\\nThis answer is also not explicitly stated in the provided documents, but it is a reasonable conclusion based on the available information.\\n\\nGiven the lack of information about Sotrovimab, the most accurate answer is:\\n\\nAnswer Choice A: No, the available information is not sufficient to determine the effectiveness of Sotrovimab for COVID-19 treatment.\\n\\nThis answer is chosen based on the analysis of the available information and the limitations in determining the effectiveness of Sotrovimab.\\n\\nAnswer Choice B: No\\n\\n\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

These CART-19 transduced T cells were expanded in vitro and transferred into a patient. The results of this case combined with others have demonstrated that CD8 T cells expressing CART-19 (see Fig. 16.18) are effective at achieving complete clinical remissions in many patients with ALL. This approach is not without its side-effects, however, as it also eliminates normal B cells in patients and they therefore require treatment with IVIG."

The incidence of PML is very low in the first year of treatment but then rises by the second year to reach a level of about 2 cases per 1000 patients per year. Nevertheless, the measurement of antibodies against the JC virus in the serum can be used to stratify this risk. Thus, in patients who do not have these antibodies, the risk of PML is either minimal or nonexistent (as long as they remain JC antibody free). Conversely, in patients who have these antibodies (especially those who have them in high titer), the risk may be as high as 0.6% or greater. The risk is also high in patients who have previously received immunosuppressive therapy.

Although head-to-head comparisons are not available, natalizumab is thought to be more effective than these other agents, and therefore, this therapy can be considered even in minimally affected, JCV antibody\u2013seronegative patients. The injectable agents (IFN-\u03b2 and glatiramer acetate) have a superb track record for safety but have a high nuisance factor due to the need for frequent injections, as well as bothersome side effects that contribute to noncompliance. Some of the oral agents (DMF and fingolimod) are probably more effective than the injectables, but long-term risks are mostly unknown; DMF produces bothersome gastrointestinal symptoms in many patients at least initially (can be mitigated by beginning at one-quarter strength and gradually advancing to full dose), and fingolimod can lead to bradycardia and other cardiac disturbances of unclear clinical significance. Teriflunomide may be less effective than the other oral agents,"
