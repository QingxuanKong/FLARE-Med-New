The comet assay is a technique used to detect DNA damage in cells, particularly single-strand breaks and other types of damage that can be caused by radiation or other mutagens. It involves using fluorescent dyes to label DNA and then subjecting the cells to a mild electric field that causes the DNA to unwind and form a \"comet\" shape. The size of the comet is proportional to the amount of DNA damage. Given this understanding, we can now evaluate the options.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

However, because colony formation was rare relative to the numbers of transplanted cells, it was possible that undispersed clumps of two or more cells were the actual initiators. A classic paper resolved this issue by exploiting rare, cytologically visible genome rearrangements generated by irradiation. Recipient mice were first irradiated to deplete bone marrow cells, and then they were irradiated a second time after transplantation to generate rare genome rearrangements in the transplanted cell population. Spleen colonies were then screened to find ones that carried genome rearrangements. How do you suppose this experiment distinguishes between colonization by single cells versus cellular aggregates?"

Damage to DNA is sensed by intracellular sentinel proteins, which transmit signals that lead to the accumulation of p53 protein. p53 first arrests the cell cycle (at the G1 phase) to allow the DNA to be repaired before it is replicated (Chapter 6). However, if the damage is too great to be repaired successfully, p53 triggers apoptosis, mainly by stimulating BH3-only sensor proteins that ultimately activate Bax and Bak, proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. When p53 is mutated or absent (as it is in certain cancers), cells with damaged DNA that would otherwise undergo apoptosis survive. In such cells, the DNA damage may result in mutations or DNA rearrangements (e.g., translocations) that lead to neoplastic transformation (Chapter 6)."

For example, the DNA of each Figure 5\u201337 A summary of spontaneous alterations that require DNA repair."
