Transmission generally occurs from May through October, with three-fourths of cases presenting in July and August. The vectors for transmission of B. duncani and B. divergens\u2013 like organisms are thought to be Ixodes pacificus and Ixodes dentatus, respectively.

            "content": "Nairoviruses are maintained by ixodid ticks, which vertically (transovarially and transstadially) transmit these viruses to progeny tick generations and horizontally spread them through viremic vertebrate hosts. Humans are usually infected via a tick bite or during handling of infected vertebrates. Orthobunyaviruses are largely mosquito-borne and rarely midge-borne and have viremic vertebrate intermediate hosts. Many orthobunyaviruses are also transovarially transmitted in their mosquito host. Numerous orthobunyaviruses have been associated with human infection and disease. They have been considered to be members of ~19 serogroups based on antigenic cross-reactions, but this grouping is currently undergoing revision with the accumulation of new genomic 1305 data and phylogenetic analyses. Human viruses are found in at least nine serogroups."

            "content": "Removal of hard ticks during the first 36 h of attachment nearly always prevents transmission of the agents of Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and ehrlichiosis, although several tick-borne viruses may be transmitted more quickly. Ticks should be removed by traction with fine-tipped forceps placed firmly around the tick\u2019s mouthparts. Careful handling (to avoid rupture of ticks) and use of gloves may avert accidental contamination with pathogens contained in tick fluids. Use of occlusive dressings, heat, or other substances (in an attempt to induce the tick to detach) merely delay tick removal. Afterward, the site of attachment should be disinfected. Tick mouthparts sometimes remain in the skin but generally are shed spontaneously within days without excision. Although somewhat controversial, current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that, rather than awaiting the onset of erythema migrans, the results of tick testing, or seroconversion to"

Epidemiology RMSF occurs in 47 states (with the highest prevalence in the south-central and southeastern states) as well as in Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America. The infection is transmitted by Dermacentor variabilis, the American dog tick, in the eastern two-thirds of the United States and California; by D. andersoni, the Rocky Mountain wood tick, in the western United States; by Rhipicephalus sanguineus in Mexico, Arizona, and probably Brazil; and by Amblyomma cajennense and A. aureolatum in Central and/or South America. Maintained principally by transovarian transmission from one generation of ticks to the next, R. rickettsii can be acquired by uninfected ticks through the ingestion of a blood meal from rickettsemic small mammals."
