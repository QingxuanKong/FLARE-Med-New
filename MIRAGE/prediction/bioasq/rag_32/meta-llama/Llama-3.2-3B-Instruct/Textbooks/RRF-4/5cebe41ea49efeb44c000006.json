    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if the process of DNA loop-extrusion is independent of ATP, we need to consider the role of ATP in DNA helicases and their function in unwinding DNA double helix. According to Document [9], DNA helicases use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to propel themselves along a DNA single strand, thereby prying apart the helix. This indicates that ATP is required for the process of DNA helicase activity, which is essential for loop-extrusion. Additionally, Document [25] states that the formation of a DNA supercoil to compensate for the unwound DNA requires the energy from ATP hydrolysis, which is necessary for the process of DNA loop-extrusion. Based on these points, it can be inferred that the process of DNA loop-extrusion is not independent of ATP.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

By using the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move this DNA relative to the core, the protein complex changes the structure of a nucleosome temporarily, making the DNA less tightly bound to the histone core. Through repeated cycles of ATP hydrolysis that pull the nucleosome core along the DNA double helix, the remodeling complexes can catalyze nucleosome sliding.

As a result, both negative and positive supercoils can be relieved by this ATP-requiring process. DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase found in bacteria and plants, has the unusual property of being able to introduce negative supercoils into circular DNA using energy from the hydrolysis of ATP. This facilitates the replication of DNA because the negative supercoils neutralize the positive supercoils introduced during opening of the double helix.

In eukaryotes, DNA topoisomerase enzymes rapidly remove this superhelical tension (see pp. 251\u2013253). But in bacteria a specialized topoisomerase called DNA gyrase uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to pump supercoils continuously into the DNA, thereby maintaining the DNA under constant tension. These are negative supercoils, having the opposite handedness from the positive supercoils that form when a region of DNA helix opens (see Figure 6\u201319B). Whenever a region of helix opens, it removes these negative supercoils from bacterial DNA, reducing the superhelical tension. DNA gyrase therefore makes the opening of the DNA helix in bacteria energetically favorable compared with helix opening in DNA that is not supercoiled.

To force the entire cycle to proceed in one direction, it is enough to make any one of the changes in shape irreversible. Most proteins that are able to walk in one direction for long distances achieve this motion by coupling one of the conformational changes to the hydrolysis of an ATP molecule that is tightly bound to the protein. The mechanism is similar to the one just discussed that drives allosteric protein shape changes by GTP hydrolysis. Because ATP (or GTP) hydrolysis releases a great deal of free energy, it is very unlikely that the nucleotide-binding protein will undergo the reverse shape change needed for moving backward\u2014 since this would require that it also reverse the ATP hydrolysis by adding a phosphate molecule to ADP to form ATP."

It would also hinder the rapid passage of the DNA transcription and replication machinery through chromatin.

The formation of this supercoil is energetically favorable because it restores a normal helical twist to the base-paired regions that remain, which would otherwise need to be overwound because of the fixed ends."

            "content": "Figure 5\u20132 The DNA double helix acts as a template for its own duplication. Because the nucleotide A will pair successfully only with T, and G only with C, each strand of DNA can serve as a template to specify the sequence of nucleotides in its complementary strand by DNA base-pairing. In this way, a double-helical DNA molecule can be copied precisely. the DNA helix exposes the hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor groups on each DNA base for base-pairing with the appropriate incoming free nucleotide, aligning it for its enzyme-catalyzed polymerization into a new DNA chain. The first nucleotide-polymerizing enzyme, DNA polymerase, was discovered in 1957. The free nucleotides that serve as substrates for this enzyme were found to be deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, and their polymerization into DNA required a single-strand DNA template. Figure 5\u20133 and Figure 5\u20134 illustrate the stepwise mechanism of this reaction. The DNA Replication Fork Is Asymmetrical"

In that scheme, a second enzyme catalyzes the energetically favorable reaction Y \u2192 Z, pulling all of the X to Y in the process. But when the required product is Y and not Z, this mechanism is not useful."
