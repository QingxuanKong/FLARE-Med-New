Although most authors agree that postoperative radiotherapy is necessary in the presence of positive surgical margins, the use of radiation in patients with other high risk factors is controversial. Increasing evidence supports the use of adjuvant radiation. Particularly controversial, but best studied, is the use of radiation in the presence of positive pelvic lymph nodes. The rationale for treatment is the knowledge that pelvic lymphadenectomy does not remove all of the nodal and lymphatic tissue and subsequent radiotherapy can eradicate microscopic disease. The hesitancy to recommend postoperative radiotherapy derives from the significant rate of postradiation bowel and"

The therapeutic modalities for achieving this goal include primary treatment with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or chemoradiation. Whereas radiation therapy can be used in all stages of disease, surgery is limited to patients with stage I to IIa disease. The 5-year survival rate for stage I cancer of the cervix is approximately 85% with either radiation therapy or radical hysterectomy. A study using the National Cancer Institute\u2019s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results data by an intent-to-treat analysis showed that patients in the surgery arm had an improved survival when compared with patients in the radiation arm (58). Optimal therapy consists of radiation, or surgery alone, to limit the increased morbidity that occurs when the two treatment modalities are combined."

A long latent or preclinical phase where early treatment increases the chance of cure is a hallmark of many cancers; for example, polypectomy prevents progression to colon cancer. Similarly, early identification of hypertension or hyperlipidemia allows therapeutic interventions that reduce the long-term risk of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events.
