Additionally, dosage modifications are recommended on the basis of certain laboratory changes such as elevated liver enzymes, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. 3. Indications: Tocilizumab is a bDMARD indicated for adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more DMARDs. It is also indicated in patients who are older than 2 years with active SJIA or active PJIA. A recent study showed that it is slightly more effective than adalimumab. There is an ongoing phase 3 study to test its use in SSc. 4."

IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by different cell types including T cells, B cells, monocytes, fibroblasts, and synovial and endothelial cells. IL-6 is involved in a variety of physiologic processes such as T-cell activation, hepatic acute-phase protein synthesis, and stimulation of the inflammatory processes involved in diseases such as RA and systemic sclerosis (SSc).

IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of RA, with detrimental effects on both joint inflammation and damage. IL-6 binding to its receptor activates intracellular signaling pathways that affect the acute-phase response, cytokine production, and osteoclast activation. Clinical trials attest to the clinical efficacy of tocilizumab therapy for RA, both as monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate and other DMARDs. Tocilizumab has been associated with an increased risk of infection, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia; however, the hematologic abnormalities appear to be reversible upon stopping the drug. In addition, this agent has been shown to increase LDL cholesterol; however, it is not known as yet if this effect on lipid levels increases the risk for development of atherosclerotic disease."

IL-6 can suppress several CYP450 isoenzymes; thus, inhibiting IL-6 may restore CYP450 activities to higher levels. This may be clinically relevant for drugs that are CYP450 substrates and have a narrow therapeutic window (eg, cyclosporine or warfarin), and dosage adjustment of these medications may be needed. Tocilizumab can be used in combination with nonbiologic DMARDs or as monotherapy. In the United States the recommended starting dose for RA is 4 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks followed by an increase to 8 mg/kg (not exceeding 800 mg/infusion) dependent on clinical response."

Demyelinating disorders including multiple sclerosis are rarely associated with tocilizumab use. Fewer than 1% of the patients taking tocilizumab develop anaphylactic reaction. Anti-tocilizumab antibodies develop in 2% of the patients, and these can be associated with hypersensitivity reactions requiring discontinuation. Cytokines play a central role in the immune response (see Chapter 55) and in RA. Although a wide range of cytokines are expressed in the joints of RA patients, TNF-\u03b1 appears to be particularly important in the inflammatory process."

            "content": "Specific conditions that can be confused with lymphoma include Castleman\u2019s disease, which can present with localized or disseminated lymphadenopathy; some patients have systemic symptoms. The disseminated form is often accompanied by anemia and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, and the condition has been associated with overproduction of interleukin 6 (IL-6), in some cases produced by human herpesvirus 8 infection. Patients with localized disease can be treated effectively with local therapy, whereas the initial treatment for patients with disseminated disease is usually with systemic glucocorticoids. IL-6-directed therapy (tocilizumab) has produced short-term responses. Rituximab appears to produce longer remissions than tocilizumab."

Similarly, anti-IL-6, IFN-\u03b2, and IL-11 act to inhibit pathogenic proinflammatory cytokines. Anti-IL-6 (tocilizumab) inhibits IL-6 activity, whereas IFN-\u03b2 and IL-11 decrease IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 production. Of particular note has been the successful use of IFN-\u03b3 in the treatment of the phagocytic cell defect in chronic granulomatous disease (Chap. 80)."

Dosing for UC and CD are identical, with induction dosing at 0, 2, and 6 weeks and every 8 weeks thereafter. There is a similar study to SONIC in patients with moderate to severe UC. After 16 weeks of therapy, UC patients taking azathioprine plus infliximab had a glucocorticoidfree remission rate of 40% compared to 24% (article now published) and 22% of those on azathioprine and infliximab alone, respectively. This is even further evidence for \u201ctop-down\u201d or more aggressive therapy for both moderate to severe CD and UC."
