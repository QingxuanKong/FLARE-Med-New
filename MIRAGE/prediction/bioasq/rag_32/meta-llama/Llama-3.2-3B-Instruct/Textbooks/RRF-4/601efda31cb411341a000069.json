A nonproductive cough with or without fever may be an early sign. This toxicity is dose-related and dose-limiting. The diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon dioxide (DLCO) is a sensitive measure of toxicity and recovery, and a baseline value is generally obtained for future comparison prior to bleomycin therapy. Additive or synergistic risk factors include age, prior lung disease, and concomitant use of other chemotherapy, lung irradiation, and high concentrations of inspired oxygen. Other chemotherapeutic agents notable for pulmonary toxicity include mitomycin, nitrosoureas, doxorubicin with radiation, gemcitabine combined with weekly docetaxel, methotrexate, and fludarabine.

Radiation-induced lung toxicity is a function of the irradiated lung volume, dose per fraction, and radiation dose. The larger the irradiated lung field, the higher is the risk for radiation pneumonitis. The use of concurrent chemoradiation, particularly regimens including paclitaxel, increases pulmonary toxicity.

The clinical syndrome, which varies in severity, consists of dyspnea, cough with scanty sputum, low-grade fever, and an initial hazy infiltrate on chest radiographs.

            "content": "As in other transplant recipients, EBV infection in lung and heart-lung recipients may cause either a mononucleosis-like syndrome or EBV-LPD. The tendency of the B cell blasts to present in the lung appears to be greater after lung transplantation than after the transplantation of other organs, possibly because of a rich source of B cells in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue. Reduction of immunosuppression and switching of regimens, as discussed in earlier sections, cause remission in some cases, but mTor inhibitors such as rapamycin may contribute to lung toxicity. Airway compression can be fatal, and rapid intervention may therefore become necessary. The approach to EBV-LPD is similar to that described in other sections."

            "content": "Although glyphosate seems to have little persistence and lower toxicity than other herbicides, the commercial formulations often contain surfactants and other active compounds that complicate the toxicity of the product. Some of the toxic effects are related to the surfactant material. Paraquat is the most important agent of this class (Figure 56\u20131). Its mechanism of action is said to be similar in plants and animals and involves single-electron reduction of the herbicide to free radical species. Ingestion (accidental or suicidal) is among the most serious and potentially lethal pesticide poisonings. Many serious exposures take place in developing countries where limited treatment resources are available. Paraquat accumulates slowly in the lung by an active process and causes lung edema, alveolitis, and progressive fibrosis. It probably inhibits superoxide dismutase, resulting in intracellular free-radical oxygen toxicity."

            "content": "Small cell lung cancer is the most aggressive form of lung cancer. It is usually exquisitely sensitive, at least initially, to platinum-based combination regimens, including cisplatin and etoposide or cisplatin and irinotecan. Unfortunately, drug resistance eventually develops in nearly all patients with extensive disease. When diagnosed at an early stage, this disease is potentially curable using combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Topotecan is used as second-line monotherapy in patients who have failed a platinum-based regimen."
