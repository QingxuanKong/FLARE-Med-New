MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to specific mRNAs, typically 20-22 nucleotides in length. They are involved in posttranscriptional gene regulation and are encoded by the genome. PCAT6 is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents as a microRNA, and its function or characteristics are not described. However, we can infer that if PCAT6 is a microRNA, it would be a small noncoding RNA that regulates gene expression, possibly through binding to specific mRNAs.

MicroRNAs are short (average 22 nucleotides in length) RNA molecules that silence gene expression after transcription by binding and inhibiting the translation or promoting the degradation of mRNA transcripts. It is estimated that more than 1000 microRNAs are encoded in the human genome. Each tissue has a distinctive repertoire of microRNA expression, and this pattern is altered in specific ways in cancers. However, specific correlations between microRNA expression and tumor biology and clinical behavior are just now emerging. Therapies targeting microRNAs are not currently at hand but represent a novel area of treatment development. lncRNAs are longer than 200 nucleotides and compose the largest group of noncoding RNAs. Some of them have been shown to play important roles in gene regulation. The potential for altering these RNAs for therapeutic benefit is an area of active investigation,"

MicroRNAs are endog-enous, single-stranded RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides in length that are highly conserved in eukaryotes. MicroRNAs are encoded either singly or can be transcribed in a \u201cpolycis-tronic\u201d clusters and produced by an elaborate expression and processing mechanism. After a primary miRNA transcript is generated by RNA polymerase II or III, it is processed in the nucleus to produce a short hairpin precursor miRNA transcript. The precursor is then transported into the cytoplasm where the final mature miRNA is generated by a protein termed Dicer. The mature double-stranded miRNA is then incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) in the cytoplasm. Once programmed with a small RNA, RISC can silence targeted genes by one of several distinct mechanisms, working at (a) the level of protein synthesis through translation inhibition, (b) the transcript level through mRNA"

With old age, there are often reductions in the expression of genes and proteins associated with mitochondrial function and increased expression of those involved with inflammation, genome repair, and oxidative stress.

Instead, as discussed in Chapter 6, the selection of an AUG codon as a translation start site is largely determined by its proximity to the cap at the 5\u02b9 end of the mRNA molecule, which is the site at which the small ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA and begins scanning for an initiating AUG codon. In eukaryotes, translational repressors can bind to the 5\u02b9 end of the mRNA and thereby inhibit translation initiation. Other repressors recognize nucleotide sequences in the 3\u02b9 UTR of specific mRNAs and decrease translation initiation by interfering with the communication between the 5\u02b9 cap and 3\u02b9 poly-A tail, a step required for efficient translation (see Figure 6\u201370). A particularly important type of translational control in eukaryotes relies on small RNAs (termed microRNAs or miRNAs) that bind to mRNAs and reduce protein output, as described later in this chapter."

Because these chemical modifications alter the pairing properties of the bases (I pairs with C, and U pairs with A), they can have profound effects on the meaning of the RNA. If the edit occurs in a coding region, it can change the amino acid sequence of the protein or produce a truncated protein by creating a premature stop codon. Edits that occur outside coding sequences can affect the pattern of pre-mRNA splicing, the transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytosol, the efficiency with which the RNA is translated, or the base-pairing between microRNAs (miRNAs) and their mRNA targets, a form of regulation that will be discussed later in the chapter."

Most of the known genetic defects are autosomal dominant mutations causing loss (or sometimes gain) of function of a particular factor. Several mutations involve transcription factors. For example, atrial septal defects (ASDs) and ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and/or conduction defects may be caused by transcription factor mutations, such as TBX5 mutations in the Holt-Oram syndrome. Other disorders (e.g., Noonan syndrome) are associated with mutations in intracellular signaling cascades that cause constitutive activation. MicroRNAs, as well as epigenetic changes (e.g., DNA methylation), also are increasingly recognized as important contributors. It is likely that even transient environmental stresses at critical junctures early in pregnancy can cause subtle changes in transcription factor activity that may recapitulate defects produced by heritable mutations."

            "content": "It is worth noting that until recently the major focus of gene hunting has been discovery of genes that encode proteins. Recent studies indicate, however, that a very large number of genes do not encode proteins. Instead, the non-encoded products of these genes\u2014so-called \u201cnon-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)\u201d\u2014play important regulatory functions. Although many distinct families of ncRNAs exist, the two most important examples,\u2014small RNA molecules called microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)\u2014are discussed in Chapter 1. With this brief review of the nature of abnormalities that contribute to the pathogenesis of human diseases, we can turn our attention to the three major categories of genetic disorders:"

            "content": "rRNAs; RNA polymerase II synthesizes the precursors of mRNA as well as microRNA; and RNA polymerase III makes tRNAs and 5S rRNAs. (b) In eukaryotes, the initial transcript is often the pre-cursor to final mRNAs, tRNAs, and rRNAs. The precursor is then modified and/or processed into its final functional form. RNA splicing is one type of processing to remove the noncoding introns (the region between coding exons) on an mRNA. (c) In contrast to bacterial DNA, eukaryotic DNA often is packaged with histone and nonhistone proteins into chromatins. Transcrip-tion will only occur when the chromatin structure changes in such a way that DNA is accessible to the polymerase. (d) RNA is made in the nucleus and transported into cytoplasm, where translation occurs. Therefore, unlike bacteria, eukaryotes undergo uncoupled transcription and translation.Eukaryotic gene transcription also involves the recogni-tion and binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter DNA. However, the interaction between the"

Beneficial and Toxic Effects Mediated by Different Types of Receptors Therapeutic advantages resulting from new chemical entities with improved receptor selectivity were mentioned earlier in this chapter and are described in detail in later chapters. Many receptors, such as catecholamines, histamine, acetylcholine, and corticosteroids, and their associated therapeutic uses were discovered by analyzing effects of the physiologic chemical signals. This approach continues to be fruitful. For example, mis-expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), small RNAs that regulate protein expression by binding to protein-coding (messenger) RNAs, was linked recently to Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Current preclinical investigations include the utility of RNA-based therapy for this and other diseases."

            "content": "Timing does not always depend on cell\u2013cell interactions; many developing animal cells have intrinsic developmental programs that play out even in isolated cells in culture. Neuroblasts in Drosophila embryos, for example, go through set programs of asymmetric divisions, generating different neural cell types at each division with a predictable sequence and timing, through a cascade of gene switching events. Studies in both vertebrates and invertebrates show that such programs are rarely governed by the timing of cell division and can unfold even when cell division is blocked. MicroRNAs produced at critical moments sharpen developmental transitions by blocking the translation and promoting the degradation of specific sets of mRNAs. Global coordination of developmental timing is achieved by hormones: as a tadpole grows, for example, thyroid hormone levels surge and trigger its metamorphosis into a frog. Environmental control of developmental timing is especially striking in plants and"
