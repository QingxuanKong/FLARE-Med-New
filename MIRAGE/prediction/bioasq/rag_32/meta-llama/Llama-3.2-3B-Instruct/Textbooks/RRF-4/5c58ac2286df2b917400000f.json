Ibudilast is not mentioned in any of the provided documents, so we can't find any information about its effectiveness for multiple sclerosis. However, we can look at the list of FDA-approved immunomodulators for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in document [16] and other relevant information to make an educated guess about its potential effectiveness. The list of FDA-approved immunomodulators includes dimethyl fumarate (DMF), fingolimod, interferon beta-1a (IFN-\u03b2-1a), interferon beta-1b (IFN-\u03b2-1b), ocrelizumab, natalizumab, and teriflunomide. None of these drugs are ibudilast. Based on the lack of information about ibudilast in the provided documents, we can conclude that we cannot determine its effectiveness for multiple sclerosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

            "content": "Teriflunomide is FDA-approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Although immunomodulatory, its exact mechanism of action in the treatment of multiple sclerosis is unclear. It is hypothesized to decrease the number of activated lymphocytes in the central nervous system. It is a once-daily oral drug that, unlike leflunomide, does not require a loading dose. Teriflunomide\u2019s side effect profile is similar to that of leflunomide, and it is contraindicated in pregnancy and severe liver disease. The incidence of neutropenia in patients taking the drug is 15%, and 10% of patients have a decrease in platelet counts. Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial agent with immunosuppressant properties. It is thought to suppress intracellular antigen processing and loading of peptides onto MHC class II molecules by increasing the pH of lysosomal and endosomal compartments, thereby decreasing T-cell activation."

However, immediately after its infusion, most multiple sclerosis patients suffered a frightening, although fortunately brief, flare-up of their illness, illustrating another potential complication of antibody therapy. Alemtuzumab was acting as intended, killing cells by complementand Fc-dependent mechanisms. However, it also stimulated the release of cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, and IL-6, which transiently block nerve conduction in nerve fibers previously affected by demyelination. This caused the transient but dramatic exacerbation of symptoms. Nevertheless, alemtuzumab may be useful at early stages of the disease, when the inflammatory response is maximal, but this has yet to be determined."

In a study that ran for 6 months, Miller and colleagues (2003) were able to demonstrate a reduction in the number of relapses and a slowing of the accumulation of MRI lesions. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 942 patients with relapsing\u2013remitting MS (Polman et al, 2006; the AFFIRM study) showed a 68 percent reduction in relapses, an 80 percent reduction in new or enlarging T2 cerebral lesions and a 96 percent reduction in gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI after a year.

ACTH therapy in MS was first studied in 1969 and showed faster recovery from acute clinical relapses. This treatment was ultimately abandoned as its benefit was in proportion to elevation of endogenous glucocorticoids, an effect that is more easily obtained by oral or intravenous administration of these drugs. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the major medications became subcutaneous or intramuscular injectable forms of interferon or a compound called glatiramer acetate, a synthetic mixture of polypeptides that has immunomodulatory effects. In 2006, the intravenous monoclonal antibody natalizumab became available and was shown to be quite efficacious, but its use was limited by risk of opportunistic infection with JC virus causing PML.

Until recently, it was unclear how IFN-\u03b2 could reduce rather than enhance immunity. In Section 3-9, we described the inflammasome, in which innate sensors of the NLR family activate caspase 1 to cleave the IL-1 pro-protein into the active form of the cytokine (see Fig. 3.19). We now know that IFN-\u03b2 acts at two levels to reduce IL-1 production. It inhibits the activity of the NALP3 (NLRP3) and NLRP1 inflammasomes and also reduces expression of the IL-1 pro-protein, reducing the substrate available to caspase 1. Thus, IFN-\u03b2 limits the production of a powerful pro-inflammatory cytokine, which may explain its observed effects on the symptoms of multiple sclerosis."

Lymphopenia may be significant, so blood counts must be monitored regularly and the drug may be withheld if active infection is present.

            "content": "An illustration of the importance of TNF-\u03b1 in defending against infection is the observation that TNF-\u03b1 blockade carries a small but increased risk of patients developing serious infections, including tuberculosis (see Section 3-20). AntiTNF-\u03b1 therapy has not been successful in all diseases. TNF-\u03b1 blockade as a treatment for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, led to amelioration of the disease, but in human patients with multiple sclerosis treated with anti-TNF-\u03b1, relapses became more frequent, possibly because of an increase in T-cell activation."

            "content": "As time progresses, more than half of adults with idiopathic optic neuritis will develop other symptoms and signs of multiple sclerosis within 5 years, and even more do so when they are observed for longer periods. Conversely, in approximately 15 percent of patients with multiple sclerosis, the history discloses that retrobulbar neuritis was the first symptom. A proportion of patients with acute optic neuritis are found at the time of an acute attack to have characteristic subclinical radiographic features of multiple sclerosis on MRI of the cerebrum and spine. The treatment of optic neuritis is taken up with multiple sclerosis in Chap. 35. Optic neuritis is also a main component of neuromyelitis optica (Devic disease; see Chap. 35); the vision loss is often more severe and the prognosis for recovery is poorer than for optic neuritis in multiple sclerosis."
