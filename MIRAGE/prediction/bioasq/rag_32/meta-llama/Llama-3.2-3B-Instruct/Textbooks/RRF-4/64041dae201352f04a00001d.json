Appropriate screening tests should be performed. The etiology of psoriasis is still poorly understood, but there is clearly a genetic component to the disease. In various studies, 30\u201350% of patients with psoriasis report a positive family history. Psoriatic lesions contain infiltrates of activated T cells that are thought to elaborate cytokines responsible for keratinocyte hyperproliferation, which results in the characteristic clinical findings. Agents inhibiting T cell activation, clonal expansion, or release of proinflammatory cytokines are often effective for the treatment of severe psoriasis (see below)."

The mechanism of action of dimethyl fumarate in psoriasis may be due to immunomodulatory effects on lymphocytes and keratinocytes, resulting in a shift away from a psoriatic cytokine profile.

A recent double-blind trial assessing methotrexate 15 mg weekly in PsA demonstrated no benefit to the joint-based inflammation, but improvement was seen in patient and assessor global scores and skin scores. Other agents with efficacy in psoriasis reported to benefit PsA are cyclosporine, retinoic acid derivatives, and psoralens plus ultraviolet A light (PUVA). There is controversy regarding the efficacy in PsA of gold and antimalarials, which have been widely used in RA. The pyrimidine synthetase inhibitor leflunomide has been shown in a randomized controlled trial to be beneficial in both psoriasis and PsA."

Prompt and dramatic resolution of both arthritis and skin lesions has been observed in large, randomized controlled trials of etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab. Many of the responding patients had long-standing disease that was resistant to all previous therapy, as well as extensive skin disease. The clinical response is often more dramatic than in RA, and delay of disease progression has been demonstrated radiographically. The potential additive effect of methotrexate to anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents in PsA remains uncertain. As noted above, anti-TNF therapy, paradoxically, has been reported to trigger exacerbation or de novo appearance of psoriasis, typically the palmoplantar pustular variety. In some cases, the therapy can nevertheless be continued."

            "content": "Treatment of psoriasis depends on the type, location, and extent of disease. All patients should be instructed to avoid excess drying or irritation of their skin and to maintain adequate cutaneous hydration. Most cases of localized, plaque-type psoriasis can be managed with mid-potency topical glucocorticoids, although their long-term use is often accompanied by loss of effectiveness (tachyphylaxis) and atrophy of the skin. A topical vitamin D analogue (calcipotriene) and a retinoid (tazarotene) are also efficacious in the treatment of limited psoriasis and have largely replaced other topical agents such as coal tar, salicylic acid, and anthralin."

            "content": "Psoriasis most frequently affects the skin of the elbows, knees, scalp, lumbosacral areas, intergluteal cleft, glans penis, and vulva. Nail changes on the fingers and toes occur in 30% of cases. In most cases psoriasis is limited in distribution, but it can be widespread and severe. The clinical subtypes are defined by pattern of involvement and severity. Treatment is aimed at preventing the release or actions of inflammatory mediators. Mild disease is treated topically with ointments containing corticosteroids or other immunomodulatory agents, whereas more severe disease is treated with phototherapy (which has immunosuppressive effects) or systemic therapy with immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate or TNF antagonists. http://ebooksmedicine.net"
