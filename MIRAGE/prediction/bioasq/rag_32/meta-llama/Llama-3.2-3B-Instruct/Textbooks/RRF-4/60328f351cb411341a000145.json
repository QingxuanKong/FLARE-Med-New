The type of CD4 T-cell response induced by a peptide depends on the way in which it is presented to the immune system (see Section 9-18). For instance, peptides given orally tend to induce regulatory T cells through production of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, but do not induce TH1 cells or systemic antibody production (see Section 12-14). Indeed, experiments in animals indicate that oral antigens can protect against induced autoimmune disease. Diseases resembling multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis can be induced in mice by the injection of myelin basic protein (MBP) or collagen type II, respectively, in Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant (see Section 16-29). Oral administration of MBP or type II collagen inhibits the development of these diseases in animals, but oral administration of the whole protein in patients with multiple sclerosis or"

This shows directly that autoimmunity can be provoked by inducing a specific adaptive immune response to self antigens. Such experimental systems highlight the importance of the activation of other components of the immune system, primarily dendritic cells, by bacteria contained in the adjuvant. There are drawbacks to the use of such animal models for the study of autoimmunity, however. In humans and genetically autoimmune-prone animals, autoimmunity usually arises spontaneously: that is, we do not know what events initiate the immune response to self that leads to autoimmune disease. By studying the patterns of autoantibodies and particular tissues affected, it has been possible to identify some of the self antigens that are targets of"

Indeed, many foreign proteins do not induce an immune response when injected on their own because they fail to induce co-stimulatory activity in antigen-presenting cells. When such protein antigens are mixed with bacteria, however, they become immunogenic, because the bacteria induce the essential co-stimulatory activity in cells that ingest the protein. Bacteria or bacterial components used in this way are known as adjuvants (see Appendix I, Section A-1). We will see in Chapter 15 how self proteins mixed with bacterial adjuvants can induce autoimmune disease, illustrating the crucial importance of the regulation of co-stimulatory activity in the discrimination of self from nonself."

As disease progresses, the inflamed synovium invades and damages the cartilage; this is followed by bone erosion (Fig. 15.29), leading to chronic pain, loss of function, and disability. RA was first considered an autoimmune disease driven by B cells producing anti-IgG autoantibodies called rheumatoid factor (see Section 15-4). However, the identification of rheumatoid factor in some healthy individuals, and its absence in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis, suggested that more complex mechanisms orchestrate this pathology. The discovery that RA has an association with particular class II HLA-DR genes of the MHC suggested that T cells are also involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. In RA, as in MS, most data from humans and mouse models indicate that, at least early in disease development, autoreactive TH17 cells become activated. Autoreactive T cells"

First, adjuvants convert soluble protein antigens into particulate material, which is more readily ingested by phagocytic antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. For example, the antigen can be adsorbed on particles of the adjuvant (such as alum), be made particulate by emulsification in mineral oils, or be incorporated into the colloidal particles of immune stimulatory complexes (ISCOMs). Second, and more important, adjuvants contain PAMPs that elicit a strong innate immune response. When taken up by phagocytic cells, the PAMPs in the adjuvant stimulate inflammatory cytokine production and induce the activation of the antigen-presenting cell.

Most nociceptors contain polypeptide mediators that are released from their peripheral terminals when they are activated (Fig. 18-2). An example is substance P, an 11-amino-acid peptide. Substance P is released from primary afferent nociceptors and has multiple biologic activities. It is a potent vasodilator, degranulates mast cells, is a chemoattractant for leukocytes, and increases the production and release of inflammatory mediators. Interestingly, depletion of substance P from joints reduces the severity of experimental arthritis.

            "content": "It is important to note that autoantibodies of a given specificity may cause disease only in genetically susceptible hosts, as has been shown in experimental models of myasthenia gravis, SLE, rheumatic fever, and rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, once organ damage is initiated, new inflammatory cascades are initiated that can sustain and amplify the autoimmune process. Finally, some autoantibodies seem to be markers for disease but have, as yet, no known pathogenic potential. Manifestations of autoimmunity are found in a large number of pathologic conditions. However, their presence does not necessarily imply that the pathologic process is an autoimmune disease. A number of attempts to establish formal criteria for the classification of diseases as autoimmune have been made, but none is universally accepted. One set of criteria is shown in Table 377e-4; however, this scheme should be viewed merely as a guide in consideration of the problem."
