This antibody thus can bring T cells (with its anti-CD3 activity) close to B cells bearing the CD19 determinant.

Murine monoclonal antibodies are designated by the suffix -omab, such as muromomab (originally called OKT3), a murine antibody against CD3. Chimeric antibodies in which the entire variable region is spliced into human constant regions have the suffix -ximab, such as basiliximab, an anti-CD25 antibody approved for the treatment of transplantation rejection.

Many patients can be shown to have serum antibodies directed at their tumors, but these do not appear to influence disease progression. However, the ability to grow very large quantities of high-affinity antibody directed at a tumor by the hybridoma technique has led to the application of antibodies in the treatment of cancer.

A major impediment to therapy with monoclonal antibodies in humans has been that these antibodies are most readily made by immunizing nonhuman species, such as the mouse, to generate antibodies of the desired specificity (see Appendix I, Section A-7). Humans may develop an antibody response against such nonhuman antibodies, since aggregated forms of foreign antibodies can be immunogenic. Such a reaction not only interferes with the therapeutic actions of the antibodies, but also leads to allergic reactions, and, if treatment is continued, may result in anaphylaxis (see Section 14-10). Once a patient has made a response to an antibody, it can no longer be used for future treatment. This problem can, in principle, be avoided by making antibodies that are not recognized as foreign by the human immune system, a process called humanization."
