    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's consider the process of phagocytosis and the role of ubiquitination in this process. Phagocytosis is the process by which cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, engulf and internalize foreign particles and microorganisms. The phagosome is a large vesicle that forms around the ingested material and eventually fuses with lysosomes to degrade the contents. Phagosomal proteins, which are proteins associated with the phagosome, are not typically ubiquitinated. Ubiquitination is a process by which ubiquitin is covalently attached to specific lysine residues on target proteins, marking them for degradation by the proteasome. This process is primarily involved in the degradation of proteins that are no longer needed or are damaged, not in the degradation of phagosomal proteins themselves. Therefore, based on the function of ubiquitination and the characteristics of phagosomal proteins, it is likely that phagosomal proteins are not ubiquitinated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Protein synthesis decreases because of reduced metabolic activity. The degradation of cellular proteins occurs mainly by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Nutrient deficiency and disuse may activate ubiquitin ligases, which attach multiple copies of the small peptide ubiquitin to cellular proteins and target them for degradation in proteasomes. This pathway is also thought to be responsible for the accelerated proteolysis seen in a variety of catabolic conditions, including the cachexia associated with cancer. In many situations, atrophy also is associated with autophagy, with resulting increases in the number of autophagic vacuoles.

The major form of ubiquitin addition produces polyubiquitin chains in which\u2014once the first ubiquitin molecule is attached to the target\u2014each subsequent ubiquitin molecule links to Lys48 of the previous ubiquitin, creating a chain of Lys48-linked ubiquitins that are attached to a single lysine side chain of the target protein. This form of polyubiquitin directs the target protein to the interior of a proteasome, where it is digested to small"

            "content": "An Elaborate Ubiquitin-Conjugating System Is Used to Mark Proteins How do cells select target proteins for ubiquitin addition? As an initial step, the carboxyl end of ubiquitin needs to be activated. This activation is accomplished when a protein called a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) uses ATP hydrolysis energy to attach ubiquitin to itself through a high-energy covalent bond (a thioester). E1 then passes this activated ubiquitin to one of a set of ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes, each of which acts in conjunction with a set of accessory (E3) proteins called ubiquitin ligases. There are roughly 30 structurally similar but distinct E2 enzymes in mammals, and hundreds of different E3 proteins that form complexes with specific E2 enzymes."

The bacterium attaches to E-cadherin on the surface of host epithelial cells and induces its own uptake by the zipper mechanism (see Figure 23\u201319A). Within the phagosome, the bacterium secretes the protein listeriolysin O, which is activated at pH <6 and forms oligomers in the phagosome membrane, thereby creating large pores and eventually disrupting the membrane. Once in the host-cell cytosol, the bacteria begin to replicate and continue to secrete listeriolysin O; because the pH in the cytosol is >6, however, the listeriolysin O there is inactive and is also rapidly degraded by proteasomes. Thus, the host cell\u2019s plasma membrane remains intact. resist the lysosome\u2019s antimicrobial armaments. Intracellular pathogens must also provide a pathway for importing nutrients from the host cytosol into their compartment of choice."
