According to Document [4] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung), Nivolumab is approved for non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and other cancers. Document [8] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) mentions that Necitumumab is a Mab directed against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and approved for use in patients with squamous non-small cell lung cancer in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin. However, Document [4] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) also mentions that Nivolumab is approved for non-small cell lung cancer, which implies that MAGE-A3 is not explicitly mentioned as an approved treatment for NSCLC. Furthermore, Document [4] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) lists other approved treatments for NSCLC, such as ipilimumab and pembrolizumab, which target different pathways. Therefore, we can conclude that MAGE-A3 is not an immunotherapeutic effective for non-small-cell lung cancer based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) makes up about 75\u201380% of all cases of lung cancer, and this group includes adenocarcinoma, squamous cell cancer, and large cell cancer, while small cell lung cancer (SCLC) makes up the remaining 20\u201325%. When NSCLC is diagnosed in an advanced stage with metastatic disease, the prognosis is extremely poor, with a median survival of about 8 months. It is clear that prevention (primarily through avoidance of cigarette smoking) and early detection remain the most important means of control. When diagnosed at an early stage, surgical resection results in patient cure. Moreover, recent studies have shown that adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy provides a survival benefit in patients with pathologic stage IB, II, and IIIA disease. However, in most cases, distant metastases have occurred at the time of diagnosis. In certain instances, radiation therapy can be"

Recently, however, this perception has changed based on preliminary results of studies using monoclonal antibodies that activate antitumor immunity through blockade of immune checkpoints. For example, ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody directed at cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), was studied in combination with paclitaxel plus carboplatin in patients with both SCLC and NSCLC. There appeared to be a small but not statistically significant advantage to the combination when ipilimumab was instituted after several cycles of chemotherapy. A randomized phase III trial in SCLC is under way to validate these data.

Male germ cells do not express MHC molecules, and therefore peptides from these molecules are not normally presented to T lymphocytes. Tumor cells show widespread abnormalities of gene expression, including the activation of genes encoding cancer-testis antigens, such as the melanoma-associated antigens (MAGE) (see Fig. 16.17). When expressed by tumor cells, peptides derived from these \u2018germ-cell\u2019 proteins can now be presented to T cells by MHC class I molecules. Therefore, these proteins are effectively tumor-specific in their expression as antigens.
