Curare is a plant-derived drug that was originally used by South American Indians to make poison arrows. It is known for its neuromuscular blocking effects, which can lead to muscle paralysis. According to Document [14], blockade of end plate function can be accomplished by two basic mechanisms: pharmacologic blockade of the physiologic agonist acetylcholine and blockade of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Curare is known to block nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are ion-channel-coupled receptors on skeletal muscle and nerve cells. This suggests that Curare does not stimulate the acetylcholine receptor, but rather blocks its action. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Thus signaling molecules frequently have many different effects that are dependent on the cell type. For example, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine stimulates contraction of skeletal muscle but decreases the force of contraction in heart muscle. This is because skeletal muscle and heart cells express different acetylcholine receptors. aThe acetylcholine receptor in skeletal muscle is termed nicotinic because nicotine can mimic this action of the neurotransmitter. In contrast, the acetylcholine receptor in cardiac muscle is termed muscarinic because this effect is mimicked by muscarine, an alkaloid derived from the mushroom Amanita muscaria."

For example, acetylcholine uses ligand-gated ion channels (nicotinic AChRs) to initiate a fast (in milliseconds) excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in post-ganglionic neurons. Acetylcholine also activates a separate class of G protein-coupled receptors (muscarinic AChRs), which mediate slower (seconds to minutes) modulatory effects on the same neurons. In addition, each structural class usually includes multiple subtypes of receptor, often with significantly different signaling or regulatory properties.

Selectivity of action is based on several factors. Some drugs stimulate either muscarinic receptors or nicotinic receptors selectively. Some agents stimulate nicotinic receptors at neuromuscular junctions preferentially and have less effect on nicotinic receptors in ganglia.

This can be easily accomplished with cholinesterase inhibitors; neostigmine and edrophonium are the drugs of choice. They are given intravenously or intramuscularly for prompt effect. Some snake venoms have curare-like effects, and the use of neostigmine as a nasal spray is under study to prevent respiratory arrest. D. Heart The short-acting cholinesterase inhibitor edrophonium was used to treat supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, particularly paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. In this application, edrophonium has been replaced by newer drugs with different mechanisms (adenosine and the calcium channel blockers verapamil and diltiazem, see Chapter 14). E.
