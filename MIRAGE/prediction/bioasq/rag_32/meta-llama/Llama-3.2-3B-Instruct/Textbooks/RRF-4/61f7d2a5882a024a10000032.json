Belimumab is a medication that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of seropositive patients with SLE who have failed standard treatments. According to Document [0], belimumab is approved for the treatment of active, autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who are also receiving standard therapy. Additionally, Document [1] states that recent trials of standard therapy plus belimumab showed improvement in 51\\% of SLE patients compared to 36\\% of those on placebo, indicating its effectiveness in treating SLE. However, Document [3] notes that belimumab is not indicated for the treatment of active renal or neurological manifestations of SLE. Furthermore, Document [8] suggests that the mainstay of treatment for any inflammatory life-threatening or organ-threatening manifestations of SLE is systemic glucocorticoids. Although belimumab is not explicitly mentioned as a treatment for lupus nephritis in Document [8], we can infer that it may be used in certain cases of SLE, especially in those who have failed standard treatments. However, we need to look for specific information about its use in lupus nephritis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

For patients who are not able to tolerate the tapering of corticosteroids, the use of steroid-sparing agents, such as azathioprine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil, may be indicated. Patients with SLE should be counseled to wear sun block and avoid sun exposure because exposure to the sun precipitates flares of the disease.

Although significant renal pathology can be found on biopsy even in the absence of major abnormalities in the urinalysis, most nephrologists do not biopsy patients until the urinalysis is convincingly abnormal. The extrarenal manifestations of lupus are important in establishing a firm diagnosis of systemic lupus because, while serologic abnormalities are common in lupus nephritis, they are not diagnostic.

Thirty to 50% of patients will have clinical manifestations of renal disease at the time of diagnosis, and 60% of adults and 80% of children develop renal abnormalities at some point in the course of their disease. Lupus nephritis results from the deposition of circulating immune complexes, which activate the complement cascade leading to complement-mediated damage, leukocyte infiltration, activation of procoagulant factors, and release of various cytokines. In situ immune complex formation following glomerular binding of nuclear antigens, particularly necrotic nucleosomes, also plays a role in renal injury.

Preeclampsia and lupus nephritis share features of hypertension, proteinuria, edema, and renal function deterioration. However, the management is distinct, as lupus nephritis is treated with immunosuppression, and severe preeclampsia/eclampsia requires delivery (Lazzaroni, 2016). It may be diicult, if not impossible, to diferentiate lupus lare with nephropathy from severe preeclampsia if the kidney is the only involved organ (Petri, 2007). Central nervous system involvement with lupus may culminate in convulsions similar to those of eclampsia. One proposed schema for diferentiating the two is shown in Table 59-4.

When a diagnosis of SLE is made, it is important to establish the severity and potential reversibility of the illness and to estimate the possible consequences of various therapeutic interventions. In the following paragraphs, descriptions of some disease manifestations begin with relatively mild problems and progress to those more life-threatening."

            "content": "Patients with any of the above lesions also can transform to another lesion; hence patients often require reevaluation, including repeat renal biopsy. Lupus patients with class VI lesions have greater than 90% sclerotic glomeruli and end-stage renal disease with interstitial fibrosis. As a group, approximately 20% of patients with lupus nephritis will reach end-stage disease, requiring dialysis or transplantation. Systemic lupus tends to become quiescent once there is renal failure, perhaps due to the immunosuppressant effects of uremia. However, patients with lupus nephritis have a markedly increased mortality compared with the general population. Renal transplantation in renal failure from lupus, usually performed after approximately 6 months of inactive disease, results in allograft survival rates comparable to patients transplanted for other reasons."
