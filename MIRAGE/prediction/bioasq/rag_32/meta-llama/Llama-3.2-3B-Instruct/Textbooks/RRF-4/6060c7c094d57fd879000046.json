    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the characteristics of cadherins and their location in the cell. Cadherins are a type of cell adhesion molecule that play a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion, and they are indeed associated with the plasma membrane. However, the question asks if cadherin is a plasma membrane marker, which means we need to determine if cadherins are located on the plasma membrane itself or if they are associated with it but not part of it. From the provided documents, we know that cadherins have extracellular and intracellular domains. The extracellular domain is located on the outside of the cell, while the intracellular domain is linked to the cytoskeleton. The extracellular domain of cadherins is what interacts with other cadherins on adjacent cells, mediating cell-cell adhesion. This interaction occurs at the plasma membrane, but the cadherin molecules themselves are not part of the plasma membrane. Instead, they are attached to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GpI) anchor or a similar mechanism. Therefore, cadherins are not part of the plasma membrane but are associated with it through these anchors. Based on this information, we can conclude that cadherin is not a plasma membrane marker but rather a cell surface protein that interacts with the plasma membrane.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Proteins of the cadherin superfamily chiefly mediate attachment of cell to cell (Movie 19.1). Proteins of the integrin superfamily chiefly mediate attachment of cells to matrix. There is specialization within each family: some cadherins link to actin and form adherens junctions, while others link to intermediate filaments and form desmosomes; likewise, some integrins link to actin and form actinlinked cell\u2013matrix junctions, while others link to intermediate filaments and form hemidesmosomes (Table 19\u20131)."

Cadherins generally bind to one another homophilically: the head of one cadherin molecule binds to the head of a similar cadherin on an opposite cell. This selectivity enables mixed populations of cells of different types to sort out from one another according to the specific cadherins they express, and it helps to control cell rearrangements during development. The \u201cclassical\u201d cadherins at adherens junctions are linked to the actin cytoskeleton by intracellular adaptor proteins called catenins. These form an anchoring complex on the intracellular tail of the cadherin molecule, and are involved not only in physical anchorage but also in the detection of and response to tension and other regulatory signals at the junction."

The nonclassical cadherins include proteins with known adhesive function, such as the diverse protocadherins found in the brain, and the desmocollins and desmogleins that form desmosomes (see Table 19\u20131). Other family members are involved primarily in signaling. Together, the classical and nonclassical cadherin proteins constitute the cadherin superfamily (Figure 19\u20134), with more than 180 members in humans. Anchoring junctions between cells are usually symmetrical: if the linkage is to actin in the cell on one side of the junction, it will be to actin in the cell on the other side. In fact, the binding between cadherins is generally homophilic (liketo-like, Figure 19\u20135): cadherin molecules of a specific subtype on one cell bind to cadherin molecules of the same or closely related subtype on adjacent cells."

The appearance and disappearance of specific cadherins correlate with steps in embryonic development where cells regroup and change their contacts to create new tissue structures. In the vertebrate embryo, for example, changes in cadherin expression are seen when the neural tube forms and pinches off from the overlying ectoderm: neural tube cells lose E-cadherin and acquire other cadherins, including N-cadherin, while the cells in the overlying ectoderm continue to express E-cadherin (Figure 19\u20138A and B). Then, when the neural crest cells migrate away from the neural tube, these cadherins become scarcely detectable, and another cadherin (cadherin 7) appears that helps hold the migrating cells together as loosely associated cell groups (Figure 19\u20138C). Finally, when the cells aggregate to form a ganglion, they switch on expression of N-cadherin again. If N-cadherin is artificially overexpressed in the"

Strong attachments result from the formation of many such weak bonds in parallel. When binding to oppositely oriented partners on another cell, cadherin molecules are often clustered side-to-side with many other cadherin molecules on the same cell (Figure 19\u20136C). The strength of this junction is far greater than that of any individual intermolecular bond, and yet regulatory mechanisms can easily disassemble the junction by separating the molecules sequentially, just as two pieces of fabric can be joined strongly by Velcro and yet easily peeled apart from the sides.

            "content": "The first step, local invasiveness, requires a relaxation of the mechanisms that normally hold epithelial cells together. As mentioned earlier, this step resembles the normal developmental process known as the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT ), in which epithelial cells undergo a shift in character, becoming less adhesive and more migratory (discussed in Chapter 19). A key part of the EMT process involves switching off expression of the E-cadherin gene. The primary function of the transmembrane E-cadherin protein is in cell\u2013cell adhesion, binding epithelial cells together through adherens junctions (see Figure 19\u201313). In some carcinomas of the stomach and of the breast, E-cadherin has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene, and a loss of E-cadherin may promote cancer development by facilitating local invasiveness."

Increased K+ permeability makes the membrane harder to depolarize, increasing the delay between action potentials and decreasing the response of the cell to constant, prolonged stimulation (adaptation). Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaM-kinase) Serine/ threonine protein kinase that is activated by Ca2+/calmodulin. Indirectly mediates the effects of an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ by phosphorylating specific target proteins.
