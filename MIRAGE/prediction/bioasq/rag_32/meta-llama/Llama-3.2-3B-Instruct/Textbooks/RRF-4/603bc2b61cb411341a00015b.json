The documents mention the relationship between arginine vasopressin (AVP) and various physiological processes, including water balance, blood pressure regulation, and social behavior. However, the specific connection between AVP and autism is not explicitly stated in the documents. Nevertheless, we can identify some relevant information that may be related to autism. For example, documents 51, 52, and 55 mention the role of oxytocin and AVP in social behavior and their potential link to autistic disorders. Specifically, document 51 states that receptor variants for these two molecules were linked to the spectrum of autistic disorders, suggesting a possible relationship between AVP and autism. Additionally, document 53 discusses the molecular genetic studies of the AVPR1a and OXTR genes, which are involved in social behavior and may be related to autism. While the documents do not explicitly state that AVP is directly related to autism, they do suggest a potential connection between AVP and social behavior, which is a characteristic often observed in individuals with autism. Therefore, the answer to the question is not a straightforward yes or no, but rather a nuanced \\\"yes, there is some evidence suggesting a potential relationship between AVP and autism, but more research is needed to fully understand this connection.\\\" However, based on the available information and the format requested, the most appropriate answer choice is\\\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

It is synthesized via a polypeptide precursor that includes AVP, neurophysin, and copeptin, all encoded by a single gene on chromosome 20. After preliminary processing and folding, the precursor is packaged in neurosecretory vesicles, where it is transported down the axon; further processed to AVP, neurophysin, and copeptin; and stored in neurosecretory vesicles until released by exocytosis into peripheral blood. AVP secretion is regulated primarily by the \u201ceffective\u201d osmotic pressure of body fluids. This control is mediated by specialized hypothalamic cells known as osmoreceptors, which are extremely sensitive FIGURE 404-1 Primary structures of arginine vasopressin (AVP), oxytocin, and desmopressin (DDAVP)."

Robertson The neurohypophysis, or posterior pituitary, is formed by axons that originate in large cell bodies in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. It produces two hormones: (1) arginine vasopressin (AVP), also known as antidiuretic hormone, and (2) oxytocin. AVP acts on the renal tubules to reduce water loss by concentrating the urine. Oxytocin stimulates postpartum milk letdown in response to suckling. A deficiency of AVP secretion or action causes diabetes insipidus (DI), a syndrome characterized by the production of large amounts of dilute urine. Excessive or inappropriate AVP production impairs urinary water excretion and predisposes to hyponatremia if water intake is not reduced in parallel with urine output."

These functions include modulation of sexual activity and appetite, learning and memory consolidation, temperature regulation, and regulation of maternal behaviors (47). In the human, these neuropeptides were linked to social attachment (48\u201350). Receptor variants for these two molecules were linked to the spectrum of autistic disorders, suggesting that proper function of these two neuropeptides with their receptors is required for positive group interactive behavior. This relationship is strengthened by a strong association between altruistic behavior and the length of the AVP-1a receptor promoter region (51). It is both surprising and humbling that complex human behaviors may be partially explained by such a relatively simple neuropeptide system. Continuing investigation should help elucidate this physiology and potential therapeutic interventions."

Specific receptors throughout the body can trigger the release of AVP. Osmoreceptors located in the hypothalamus sense changes in blood osmolality from a mean of 285 mOSM/kg. Baroceptors sense changes in blood pressure caused by alterations in blood volume and are peripherally located in the walls of the left atrium, carotid sinus, and aortic arch (53). These receptors can respond to changes in blood volume of more than 10%. In response to decreases in blood pressure or volume, AVP is released and causes arteriolar vasoconstriction and renal free-water conservation. This in turn leads to a decrease in blood osmolality and an increase in blood pressure."

            "content": "Vasopressin, acting on the V2 receptors in kidney tubules, serves as the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and, complemented by thirst mechanisms, maintains the osmolality of the blood. Plasma osmolality modifies vasopressin secretion by acting directly on the supraoptic and paraventricular neurons as well as separate osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus. If serum osmolality falls below 280 mOsm/L, the release of ADH is completely inhibited. Antidiuresis is maximal when plasma levels of vasopressin reach 5 pg/mL. This system is most effective in maintaining homeostasis when serum osmolality is in the range between 280 and 295 mOsm/L."

In addition to axonal processes and termini from the SON and PVN, there are glial-like support cells called pituicytes. The posterior pituitary is extensively vascularized and the capillaries are fenestrated, thereby facilitating diffusion of hormones into the systemic circulation. Synthesis of ADH and Oxytocin ADH and oxytocin are small peptides (nine amino acids) that differ in only two amino acids, yet they have limited overlapping activity. ADH and oxytocin are synthesized as preprohormones ("

            "content": "Five genetic forms of pituitary DI are now known. By far, the most common is transmitted in an autosomal dominant mode and is caused by diverse mutations in the coding region of one allele of the AVP\u2013 neurophysin II (or AVP-NPII) gene. All the mutations alter one or more amino acids known to be critical for correct processing and/or folding of the prohormone, thus interfering with its trafficking through the endoplasmic reticulum. The misfolded mutant precursor accumulates and interferes with production of AVP by the normal allele, eventually destroying the magnocellular neurons in which it is produced. The AVP deficiency and DI are usually not present at birth but develop gradually over a period of several months to years, progressing from partial to severe at different rates depending on the mutation. Once established, the deficiency of AVP is permanent, but for unknown reasons, the DI occasionally improves or remits spontaneously in late middle age. The parvocellular neurons that"

The peptide hormones that are released are antidiuretic hormone (ADH, or arginine vasopressin) and oxytocin. The cell bodies of the neurons that project to the pars nervosa are located in the supraoptic nuclei (SON) and paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus (a nucleus refers to a collection of neuronal cell bodies residing within the central nervous system (CNS); a ganglion is a collection of neuronal cell bodies residing outside the CNS). The large cell bodies of these neurons are described as magnocellular, and they project axons down the infundibular stalk as the hypothalamohypophyseal tracts. Individual magnocellular neurons are hormone specific, producing \u2022Fig. 41.1 Cross-sectionalimageoftheheaddemonstratingtheproximityofthehypothalamusandpituitaryglandandtheirconnectionbyaneurohypophyseal(pituitary)stalk."

Vasopressin (AVP) is synthesized in magnocellular neurons within the hypothalamus; the distal axons of these neurons project to the posterior pituitary or neurohypophysis, from which AVP is released into the circulation. A network of central \u201cosmoreceptor\u201d neurons, which includes the AVP-expressing magnocellular neurons themselves, sense circulating osmolality via nonselective, stretch-activated cation channels. These osmoreceptor neurons are activated or inhibited by modest increases and decreases in circulating osmolality, respectively; activation leads to AVP release and thirst."
