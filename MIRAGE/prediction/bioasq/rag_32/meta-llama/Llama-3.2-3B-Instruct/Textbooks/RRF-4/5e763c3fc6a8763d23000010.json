However, the question asks about vivotif, which is not mentioned in Document [26]. Therefore, we need to look for information about vivotif in other documents. Unfortunately, without more context or information about vivotif, it is difficult to determine if it was licensed in Europe and the US at the same time. However, based on the information provided, we can make an educated guess that the answer is unlikely to be A. yes, as there is no clear evidence of vivotif being licensed in Europe and the US at the same time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Given that vector-mediated gene therapy is arguably one of the most complex therapeutics yet developed, consisting of both a nucleic acid and a protein component, this time course from first clinical trial to licensed product is noteworthy for being similar to that seen with other novel classes of therapeutics, including monoclonal antibodies or bone marrow transplantation. Over 5000 subjects have been enrolled in gene transfer studies, and serious adverse events have been rare.

In Europe, the emergence of VRE in the mid-1980s was seen primarily in isolates recovered from animals and healthy humans rather than from hospitalized patients. The presence of VRE was associated with the use of the glycopeptide avoparcin as a growth promoter in animal feeds; this association prompted the European Union to ban the use of this compound in animal husbandry in 1996. However, after an initial decrease in the isolation of VRE from animals and humans, the prevalence of hospital-associated VRE infections has slowly increased in certain European countries, with important regional differences. For example, rates of vancomycin resistance among E. faecium clinical isolates in Europe are highest in Greece, the United Kingdom, and Portugal (10\u201330%), whereas rates in the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands are <1%."

Why are both these types of mutation usually dominant? 8\u201315 Discuss the following statement: \u201cWe would have no idea today of the importance of insulin as a regulatory hormone if its absence were not associated with the human disease diabetes. It is the dramatic consequences of its absence that focused early efforts on the identification of insulin and the study of its normal role in physiology.\u201d 8\u201316 You have just gotten back the results from an RNA-seq analysis of mRNAs from liver. You had anticipated counting the number of reads of each mRNA to determine the relative abundance of different mRNAs. But you are puzzled because many of the mRNAs have given you results like those shown in Figure Q8\u20134. How is it that different parts of an mRNA can be represented at different levels?"

Patients planning to travel abroad to obtain health care, particularly when surgery is involved, should be immunized for hepatitis B and should consider having baseline hepatitis C and HIV tests preoperatively. Prevalence rates of hepatitis B and C and HIV infection vary considerably around the world and are generally higher in developing regions than in the United States and Western Europe.

CaniLeish\u00ae is the first licensed canine vaccine developed in Europe. Personal prophylaxis with bed nets and repellants may reduce the risk of CL infections disease in humans.

The narrowly focused action of CD8 cytotoxic T cells allows them to kill single infected cells in a tissue without creating widespread tissue damage (Fig. 9.47) and is of crucial importance in tissues where cell regeneration does not occur, as with the neurons of the central nervous system, or is very limited, as in the pancreatic islets."

Some serotypes (e.g., types 1 and 5) not only tend to cause disease in areas with a high disease burden but also cause waves of disease in lower-burden areas (e.g., Europe) or outbreaks (e.g., in military barracks; meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa). The broader range of serotypes causing disease among adults than among children is apparent from a comparison of the coverage of existing multiserotype vaccines in different age groups. For example, data from the United States for 2006\u20132007 on the serotypes causing IPD indicated that a"
