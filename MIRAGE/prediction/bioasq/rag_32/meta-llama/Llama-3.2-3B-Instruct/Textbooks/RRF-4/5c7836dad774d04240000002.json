            "content": "Figure 149-1 Major cytokine sources and actions to promote hematopoiesis. Cells of the bone marrow microenvironment, such as macrophages, endothelial cells, and reticular fibroblasts, produce macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) after stimulation. For all lineages, optimal development requires a combination of early and late acting factors. BFU, Burst-forming unit; CFU, colony-forming unit; EPO, erythropoietin; IL, interleukin; MSC, myeloid stem cell; PSC, pluripotent stem cell; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TPO, thrombopoietin.

Each stem-cell system nevertheless raises similar fundamental questions. What are the distinguishing features of the stem cell in molecular terms? What conditions serve to keep the stem cell in its proper place and to maintain its stem-cell character? What decides whether a given daughter cell commits to differentiation or remains a stem cell? In a tissue where several distinct types of differentiated cells must be produced, are they all derived from a single type of stem cell, or is there a distinct type of stem cell for each one? wnt Signaling maintains the Gut Stem-Cell Compartment"
