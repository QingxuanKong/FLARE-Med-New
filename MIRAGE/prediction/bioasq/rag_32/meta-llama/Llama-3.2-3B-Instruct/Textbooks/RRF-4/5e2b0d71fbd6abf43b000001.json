After reviewing the documents, we can see that there is no specific information about the RAPT tool. However, we can infer that the tools mentioned in the documents, such as the PSI (Pneumonia Severity Index), CURB-65, and APACHE II, are used to predict patient outcomes and severity of illness, but not discharge destinations. Therefore, it is unlikely that the RAPT tool is used to predict discharge destinations. Additionally, the documents do not provide any information about the RAPT tool being validated or used in clinical practice. However, the documents do discuss the use of various tools and algorithms to predict patient outcomes, which suggests that the development of such tools is an active area of research.

The importance of independent validation in a population separate from the one used to develop the model cannot be overstated. An unvalidated prediction model should be viewed with the skepticism appropriate for any new drug or medical device that has not had rigorous clinical trial testing. When statistical models have been compared directly with expert clinicians, they have been found to be more consistent, as would be expected, but not significantly more accurate. Their biggest promise, then, may be in helping less-experienced clinicians identify critical discriminating patient characteristics and become more accurate in their predictions."

Numerous severity-of-illness (SOI) scoring systems have been developed and validated over the past three decades.

SOI scoring systems are important for defining populations of critically ill patients. Such systematic scoring allows effective comparison of groups of patients enrolled in clinical trials. In verifying a purported benefit of therapy, investigators must be confident that different groups involved in a clinical trial have similar illness severities. SOI scores are also useful in guiding hospital administrative policies, directing the allocation of resources such as nursing and ancillary care and assisting in assessments of quality of ICU care over time.

Thus the decision to admit a patient with CAP to the hospital has considerable implications. Certain patients clearly can be managed at home, and others clearly require treatment in the hospital, but the choice is sometimes difficult. Tools that objectively assess the risk of adverse outcomes, including severe illness and death, can minimize unnecessary hospital admissions. There are currently two sets of criteria: the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), a prognostic model used to identify patients at low risk of dying; and the CURB-65 criteria, a severity-of-illness score."

This cardiac risk index was further modified and validated prospectively, resulting in a tool for clinical risk assessment in nonemergent major noncardiac surgery, the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (178). Risk factors include high-risk surgical procedures, history of ischemic heart disease, history of congestive heart failure, history of transient ischemic attack or stroke, preoperative insulin therapy, and preoperative serum creatinine levels greater than 2.0 mg/dL.

As described earlier, a wide variety of biomarkers have been shown to individually predict prognosis and response to therapy, but they do not improve the accuracy of either the assessment of prognosis or the prediction of response to therapy.As knowledge regarding cellular, biochemical, and molec-ular biomarkers for breast cancer have improved, prognostic indices have been developed that combine the predictive power Table 17-12Traditional prognostic and predictive factors for invasive breast cancerTUMOR FACTORSHOST FACTORSNodal statusAgeTumor sizeMenopausal"

When looking specifically at a low-frequency complication event such as bile duct injury with laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the detection of a small, positive training effect is statistically improbable. However, the use of available Kirkpatrick level 3 data to support assumptions about training benefits is fully supportable given the preponderance of literature showing such benefit.The best current evidence for improved patient outcomes with simulation is that of technical and cognitive training for central venous catheter (CVC) insertion. In 2009, Barsuk et al monitored"

            "content": "To determine the PSI, points are given for 20 variables, including age, coexisting illness, and abnormal physical and laboratory findings. On the basis of the resulting score, patients are assigned to one of five classes with the following mortality rates: class 1, 0.1%; class 2, 0.6%; class 3, 2.8%; class 4, 8.2%; and class 5, 29.2%. Determination of the PSI is often impractical in a busy emergency-department setting because of the number of variables that must be assessed. However, clinical trials demonstrate that routine use of the PSI results in lower admission rates for class 1 and class 2 patients. Patients in class 3 could ideally be admitted to an observation unit until a further decision can be made."

A proposed \u201cphenotype\u201d definition characterized by weight loss, fatigue, impaired grip strength, diminished physical activity, and slow gait has shown good internal consistency and strong predictive validity and has been used in many clinical and epidemiologic studies. An alternative approach, the Frailty Index, assesses cumulative physiologic and functional burden. When combined with a structured clinical assessment (the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment), the Frailty Index can be applied in clinical settings and has low rates of missing data; it predicts survival in community-dwelling older people as well as survival, length of stay and discharge location in acute-care settings.
