Streptococci of groups C and G account for a minority of cases, although these serogroups are nonrheumatogenic. Fusobacterium necrophorum has been increasingly recognized as a cause of pharyngitis in adolescents and young adults and is isolated nearly as often as group A streptococci. This organism is important because of the rare but life-threatening Lemierre\u2019s disease, which is generally associated with F. necrophorum and is usually preceded by pharyngitis (see \u201cOral Infections,\u201d below).

PATHOLOGY AND MICROBIOLOGY Primary Lung Abscesses In primary lung abscesses, the dependent segments (posterior upper lobes and superior lower lobes) are the most common locations, given the predisposition of aspirated materials to be deposited in these areas. Generally, the right lung is affected more commonly than the left because the right mainstem bronchus is less angulated.

Treatment consists of airway management, operative drainage of fluid collections, and at least 10 days of IV therapy with an antibiotic active against streptococci and oral anaerobes (e.g., ampicillin/ sulbactam). A particularly severe form of this infection involving the components of the carotid sheath (postanginal septicemia, Lemierre\u2019s disease) is described above (see \u201cOral Infections\u201d). Infection of the retropharyngeal space also can be extremely dangerous, as this space runs posterior to the pharynx from the skull base to the superior mediastinum.
