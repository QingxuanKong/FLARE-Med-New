The RSC complex is a type of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including transcription, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation. It is known to target specific histone variants for repositioning or removal. One of the histone variants that the RSC complex targets is H2A.Z. H2A.Z is a variant of the H2A histone, which is a component of nucleosomes. The RSC complex has been shown to interact with H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes and reposition them, which can affect gene expression and chromatin structure. Therefore, based on this understanding, it is likely that the chromatin remodeling complex, RSC, targets H2A.Z nucleosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Some bound proteins favor the formation of a nucleosome adjacent to them. Others create obstacles that force the nucleosomes to move elsewhere. The exact positions of nucleosomes along a stretch of DNA therefore depend mainly on the presence and nature of other proteins bound to the DNA.

This subunit binds both to the protein core of the nucleosome and to the double-stranded DNA that winds around it. By using the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move this DNA relative to the core, the protein complex changes the structure of a nucleosome temporarily, making the DNA less tightly bound to the histone core.

            "content": "Chromatin remodeling complexes can reposition nucleosomes on DNA, exposing (or obscuring) gene regulatory elements such as promoters. writer\u201d complexes carry out more than 70 different covalent histone modifications generically denoted as marks. These include methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation of specific histone amino acid residues: Histone methylation of lysines and arginines is accomplished by specific writer enzymes; methylation of histone lysine residues can lead to transcriptional activation or repression, depending on which histone residue is \u201cmarked.\u201d Histone acetylation of lysine residues (occurring through histone acetyl transferases) tends to open up chromatin and increase transcription; histone deacetylases (HDAC) reverse this process, leading to chromatin condensation. Histone phosphorylation of serine residues can variably open or condense chromatin, to increase or decrease transcription, respectively."

These histones are present in much smaller amounts than the major histones, and they have been less well conserved over long evolutionary times. Variants are known for each of the core histones with the exception of H4; some examples are shown in Figure 4\u201335."
