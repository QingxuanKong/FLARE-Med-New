Curare is a group of plant-derived toxins that are used to paralyze animals and humans. According to document [5], curare was first found in the Amazon Basin of South America, where it was used by natives to kill animals. Document [5] also mentions that the active compound, d-tubocurarine, and its modern synthetic analogs have had a major influence on the practice of anesthesia and surgery. However, it does not mention the genus Strychnos specifically. Document [6] states that atropine and its congeners are tertiary amine alkaloid esters of tropic acid, and that atropine is found in the plant Atropa belladonna, also known as deadly nightshade. However, it does not mention Strychnos. Based on this information, we can infer that the genus Strychnos is not the original source of curare. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Digitalis is the name of the genus of plants that provide most of the medically useful cardiac glycosides, eg, digoxin. Such plants have been known for thousands of years but were used erratically and with variable success until 1785, when William Withering, an English physician and botanist, published a monograph describing the clinical effects of an extract of the purple foxglove plant (Digitalis purpurea, a major source of these agents)."

ACh release stimulated by parasympathetic stimulation of the heart opens K channels, causing hyperpolarization of cardiac muscle fibers. This hyperpolarization slows rhythmic contraction of the heart. In contrast, the nicotinic ACh receptor in skeletal muscles is a transmitter-gated Na channel. Opening of this channel causes rapid depolarization of skeletal muscle fibers and initiation of contraction. Various drugs affect the release of ACh into the synaptic cleft as well as its binding to its receptors. For instance, curare, the South American arrow-tip poison\u2014binds to Na channels and blocks the action of nicotinic ACh receptors, causing muscle paralysis.

Whereas animals rely heavily on GPCRs and RTKs, plants rely mainly on enzyme-coupled receptors of the receptor serine/threonine kinase type, especially ones with extracellular leucinerich repeats. Various plant hormones, or growth regulators, including ethylene and auxin, help coordinate plant development.

When oxidizing glucose to CO2, heart muscle consumes O2 at a rate of 10 \u03bcmol/min per g of tissue, in order to replace the ATP used in contraction and give a steady-state ATP concentration of 5 \u03bcmol/g of tissue. At this rate, What structures are needed to form the barriers that separate and maintain the differentiated membrane domains in a single continuous membrane\u2014as for the cristae and inner boundary membrane in mitochondria? how does a eukaryotic cell regulate the many functions of mitochondria, including atp production? What are the origins and evolutionary history of photosynthetic complexes? are there undiscovered types of photosynthesis present on Earth to help answer this question? Why is the mutation rate so much higher in mitochondria than in the nucleus (and chloroplasts)? Could this high rate have been useful to the cell?"

            "content": "In 1994, the US Congress, influenced by growing \u201cconsumerism\u201d as well as strong manufacturer lobbying efforts, passed the DSHEA. The DSHEA required the establishment of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards for the supplement industry; however, it was not until 2007 that the FDA issued a final rule on the proposed GMP standards. This 13-year delay allowed supplement manufacturers to self-regulate the manufacturing process and resulted in many instances of adulteration, misbranding, and contamination. For example, a study using DNA barcoding to confirm botanical content evaluated 44 botanicals containing 30 plant species and found product substitutions in 32% of samples (see Newmaster reference). Therefore, much of the criticism regarding the dietary supplement industry involves problems with botanical misidentification, a lack of product purity, and variations in potency and purification, which continue to be problematic even with GMP standards in place. When the new GMP"

It was the thick cell walls of cork, visible in a primitive microscope, that in 1663 enabled Robert Hooke to distinguish and name cells for the first time. The walls of neighboring plant cells, cemented"
