            "content": "Alemtuzumab, discussed above for its use in treating leukemia and in transplant rejection, has shown some beneficial effect in studies of small numbers of patients with multiple sclerosis. However, immediately after its infusion, most multiple sclerosis patients suffered a frightening, although fortunately brief, flare-up of their illness, illustrating another potential complication of antibody therapy. Alemtuzumab was acting as intended, killing cells by complementand Fc-dependent mechanisms. However, it also stimulated the release of cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, and IL-6, which transiently block nerve conduction in nerve fibers previously affected by demyelination. This caused the transient but dramatic exacerbation of symptoms. Nevertheless, alemtuzumab may be useful at early stages of the disease, when the inflammatory response is maximal, but this has yet to be determined."

            "content": "Teriflunomide is FDA-approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Although immunomodulatory, its exact mechanism of action in the treatment of multiple sclerosis is unclear. It is hypothesized to decrease the number of activated lymphocytes in the central nervous system. It is a once-daily oral drug that, unlike leflunomide, does not require a loading dose. Teriflunomide\u2019s side effect profile is similar to that of leflunomide, and it is contraindicated in pregnancy and severe liver disease. The incidence of neutropenia in patients taking the drug is 15%, and 10% of patients have a decrease in platelet counts. Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial agent with immunosuppressant properties. It is thought to suppress intracellular antigen processing and loading of peptides onto MHC class II molecules by increasing the pH of lysosomal and endosomal compartments, thereby decreasing T-cell activation."

Natalizumab is directed against alpha-integrin in order to block lymphocyte and monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and their migration through the vessel wall. It has been used in rheumatoid arthritis and fistulizing Crohn disease. In a study that ran for 6 months, Miller and colleagues (2003) were able to demonstrate a reduction in the number of relapses and a slowing of the accumulation of MRI lesions. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 942 patients with relapsing\u2013remitting MS (Polman et al, 2006; the AFFIRM study) showed a 68 percent reduction in relapses, an 80 percent reduction in new or enlarging T2 cerebral lesions and a 96 percent reduction in gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI after a year.

A randomized trial conducted over 36 months comparing the drug to interferon-\u03b2-1a found it to be superior in preventing relapses and in reducing the accumulation of disability (CAMMS223 Trial Investigators). A series of subsequent trials have confirmed its effectiveness in comparison to interferon (Cohen et al).

Several other promising agents are in varying stages of product development. Each of these treatments can also be used in SPMS patients who continue to experience attacks, both because SPMS can be difficult to distinguish from RRMS and because the available clinical trials, although not definitive, suggest that such patients may sometimes derive therapeutic benefit. Thus, in several phase 3 clinical trials, recipients of each of these agents experienced fewer clinical exacerbations and fewer new MRI lesions compared to placebo recipients (Table 458-6). Because of its potential toxicity as an immunosuppressant, mitoxantrone is generally reserved for patients with progressive disability who have failed other treatments. When considering the data in"

            "content": "Alemtuzumab Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the CD52 antigen, which is expressed on both monocytes and lymphocytes. It causes lymphocyte depletion (of both B and T cells) and a change in the composition of lymphocyte subsets. Both of these changes, particularly the impact on lymphocyte subsets, are long lasting. In preliminary trials, alemtuzumab markedly reduced the attack rate and significantly improved all measures of disease severity in MS patients. In two phase 3 trials, however, its impact on clinical disability was less convincing. Notably, both trials used the active comparator of thrice-weekly, high-dose IFN-\u03b2-1a. The European and Canadian drug agencies were the first to approve this agent for use in RRMS; the FDA has also approved alemtuzumab, but only after an appeal following initial disapproval. The reasons for the initial disapproval were based on a perceived lack of a convincing disability effect and concerns over potential toxicity. The"

IFN-\u03b2 is probably ineffective in patients with SPMS who are not having acute attacks. All of the other agents have not yet been studied in this patient population. Although mitoxantrone has been approved for patients with progressive MS, this is not the population studied in the pivotal trial. Therefore no evidence-based recommendation can be made with regard to its use in this setting."
