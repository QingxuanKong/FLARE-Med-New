To answer this question, we need to analyze the available information about CPX-351 and its indications. However, the provided documents do not mention CPX-351. We can infer that the question is likely referring to a different drug, and the correct answer will depend on the actual properties and indications of CPX-351. Since CPX-351 is not mentioned in the provided documents, I will provide a general answer based on the information about the treatment of tuberculosis. The treatment of tuberculosis typically involves the use of a combination of antituberculous drugs, and the choice of drugs depends on the severity of the disease, the presence of drug resistance, and the patient's medical history. The standard treatment regimens for drug-susceptible tuberculosis typically include isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, among others. The use of a single drug or a combination of two drugs is not sufficient to treat tuberculosis, as the bacteria can develop resistance. Therefore, the correct answer would depend on the specific properties and indications of CPX-351, which are not provided in the documents. However, based on the general information about the treatment of tuberculosis, the answer is unlikely to be A. yes, without more information about CPX-351.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

            "content": "The typical dosage of isoniazid is 5 mg/kg/d; a typical adult dose is 300 mg given once daily. Up to 10 mg/kg/d may be used for serious infections or if malabsorption is a problem. A 15-mg/kg dose, or 900 mg, may be used in a twice to three times-weekly dosing regimen in combination with a second antituberculous agent (eg, rifampin, 600 mg). Pyridoxine, 25\u201350 mg/d, is recommended for those with conditions predisposing to neuropathy, an adverse effect of isoniazid. Isoniazid is usually given by mouth but can be given parenterally in the same dosage. Isoniazid as a single agent is also indicated for treatment of latent tuberculosis. The dosage is 300 mg/d (5 mg/kg/d) or 900 mg twice weekly, and the duration is usually 9 months. The incidence and severity of untoward reactions to isoniazid are related to dosage and duration of administration. A. Immunologic Reactions Fever and skin rashes are occasionally seen. Drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported."
