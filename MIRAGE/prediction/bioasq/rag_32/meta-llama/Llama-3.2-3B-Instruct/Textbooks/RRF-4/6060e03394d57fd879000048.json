    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what synonymous sites are and what functional constraint means in the context of genetics. Synonymous sites refer to positions in a DNA sequence where different codons specify the same amino acid. Functional constraint, on the other hand, refers to the degree to which a gene or a region of the genome is under selective pressure to maintain its original sequence. If a region is functionally constrained, it is less likely to undergo mutations that alter its sequence. Given the information from the provided documents, we can infer that synonymous sites in primates and rodents are not under strong functional constraint. The observation that the human and chimpanzee genomes are nearly identical even where there is no functional constraint on the nucleotide sequence, such as in the third position of synonymous codons, suggests that these regions are not subject to strong selective pressure. Furthermore, the document mentions that the human and mouse genomes have had approximately 80 million years to diverge through accumulated mutations, resulting in a relatively high rate of changes in these regions. This implies that synonymous sites in primates and rodents are not under strong functional constraint, as they can accumulate mutations over time without significant selective pressure. Therefore, based on the information provided, the answer to the question is that synonymous sites in primates and rodents are not functionally constrained.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The basic organizing framework for comparative genomics is the phylogenetic tree. A simple example is the tree describing the divergence of humans from the great apes (Figure 4\u201363). The primary support for this tree comes from comparisons of gene or protein sequences.

            "content": "During the course of evolution, more than three out of every four CGs have been lost in this way, leaving vertebrates with a remarkable deficiency of this dinucleotide. The CG sequences that remain are very unevenly distributed in the genome; they are present at 10 times their average density in selected regions, called CG islands, which average 1000 nucleotide pairs in length. The human genome contains roughly 20,000 CG islands and they usually include promoters of genes. For example, 60% of human protein-coding genes have promoters embedded in CG islands and these include virtually all the promoters of the so-called housekeeping genes\u2014those genes that code for the many proteins that are essential for cell viability and are therefore expressed in nearly all cells (Figure 7\u201346). Over evolutionary timescales, the CG islands were spared the accelerated mutation rate of bulk CG sequences because they remained unmethylated in the germ line (Figure 7\u201347)."

            "content": "The mouse Is the Predominant mammalian model organism Mammals have typically two times as many genes as Drosophila, a genome that is 16 times larger, and millions or billions of times as many cells in their adult bodies. In terms of genome size and function, cell biology, and molecular mechanisms, mammals are nevertheless a highly uniform group of organisms. Even anatomically, the differences among mammals are chiefly a matter of size and proportions; it is hard to think of a human body part that does not have a counterpart in elephants and mice, and vice versa. Evolution plays freely with quantitative features, but it does not readily change the logic of the structure."
