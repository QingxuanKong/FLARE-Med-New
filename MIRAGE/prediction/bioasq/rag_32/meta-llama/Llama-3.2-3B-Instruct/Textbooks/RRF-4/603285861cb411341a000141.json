TLRs are pattern recognition receptors that recognize microbial molecular patterns, such as lipopolysaccharides, lipoteichoic acids, bacterial DNA, and single-stranded RNA. They are expressed by various cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells. The activation of TLRs by microbial components triggers an inflammatory response, which is a key component of the innate immune system. Therefore, it can be inferred that TLRs are indeed induced by microbes, as they recognize and respond to microbial products.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The TLR receptors have many structural similarities both extracellularly and intracel-lularly, but they differ from each other in ligand specificities, expression patterns, and with some variability in the signaling pathways they activate.The TLR receptors were initially identified as compo-nents of the innate immune system that acted as a front-line defense mechanism against infections. Their recognition of patterns on pathogens, such as microbial peptides, lipopolysac-charide, lipoteichoic acids, bacterial DNA, and single-stranded RNA, resulted in the activation of an inflammatory response meant for controlling the invading organisms. In situations of noninfectious inflammation such as seen in trauma, clinicians have long recognized similar activation of the same inflamma-tory pathways and systemic manifestations. This observation, among others, led to the hypothesis that the immune system is"

            "content": "recruit specific and more powerful adaptive immune responses to help fight the infection. Innate immune responses rely on the ability of host cells to recognize characteristic features of microbial molecules called pathogen\u2011associated molecular patterns, or PAMPs, which can be associated with a pathogen\u2019s proteins, lipids, sugars, or nucleic acids. PAMPs are mainly recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including the Toll\u2011like receptors (TLRs) found on or in both plant and animal cells. In vertebrates, some PRRs are secreted and can activate complement when they bind microbial PAMPs. The complement system, which can also be activated by antimicrobial antibodies bound to pathogens, consists of a group of blood proteins that are activated in sequence to help fight infections, by disrupting the pathogen's membrane, stimulating an inflammatory response, or targeting the microbe for phagocytosis\u2014mainly by macrophages and neutrophils. The phagocytes use a combination of"
