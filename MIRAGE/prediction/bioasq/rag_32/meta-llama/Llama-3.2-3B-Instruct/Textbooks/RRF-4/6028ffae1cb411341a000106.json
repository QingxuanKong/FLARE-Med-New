The common side effects of calcitonin therapy are nausea and facial flushing. Secondary resistance after prolonged use may be due to either the formation of anticalcitonin antibodies or downregulation of osteoclastic cell\u2013surface calcitonin receptors. The lower potency and injectable mode of delivery make this agent a less attractive treatment option that should be reserved for patients who either do not tolerate bisphosphonates or have a contraindication to their use. In early reports, denosumab, an antibody to RANKL, has shown promise but has not been approved for this indication."

Calcitonin preparations are approved by the FDA for Paget\u2019s disease, hypercalcemia, and osteoporosis in women >5 years past menopause. Concerns have been raised about an increase in the incidence of cancer associated with calcitonin use. Initially, the cancer noted was of the prostate, but an analysis of all data suggested a more general increase in cancer risk. In Europe, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has removed the osteoporosis indication, and an FDA Advisory Committee has voted for a similar change in the United States."

These effects are mediated by receptors on osteoclasts and renal tubular cells. Calcitonin exerts additional effects through receptors present in the brain, the gastrointestinal tract, and the immune system. The hormone, for example, exerts analgesic effects directly on cells in the hypothalamus and related structures, possibly by interacting with receptors for related peptide hormones such as calcitonin gene\u2013related peptide (CGRP) or amylin. Both of these ligands have specific high-affinity receptors that share considerable structural similarity with the PTH1R and can also bind to and activate calcitonin receptors. The calcitonin receptor shares considerable structural similarity with the PTH1R."

The peptide is released during migraine attacks, and successful treatment of migraine with a selective serotonin agonist normalizes cranial CGRP levels. Clinical trials showed olcegepant to be effective in treating migraine, but because of its low bioavailability, it has to be administered by intravenous injection.

            "content": "Specific treatment strategies for ADPKD have focused on slowing renal disease progression and lowering cardiovascular risk. For the latter, the main approach is to control blood pressure by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The ongoing HALT PKD trial was set to evaluate the impact of intensive blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and levels of blood pressure control on progressive renal disease. Most approaches target the slowing of renal disease progression by inhibiting cell proliferation and fluid secretion. Several clinical trials have been conducted targeting cell proliferation, including studies on sirolimus and everolimus, inhibitors of the mTOR pathway; OPC31260 and tolvaptan, which inhibit cAMP pathways by antagonizing the activation of vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) in collecting ducts and reduce cell proliferation by decreasing renal cAMP levels; and somatostatin analogues, which reduce cAMP levels by binding to several GPCRs. Both the V2R"

            "content": "Denosumab is a human IgG2 monoclonal antibody specific for human RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand; see Chapter 42). By binding RANKL it inhibits the maturation of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption. Denosumab is indicated for treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. Before starting denosumab, patients must be evaluated to be sure they are not hypocalcemic. During treatment, patients should receive supplements of calcium and vitamin D."

            "content": "Injectable calcitonin produces small increments in bone mass of the lumbar spine. However, difficulty of administration and frequent reactions, including nausea and facial flushing, make general use limited. A nasal spray containing calcitonin (200 IU/d) is available for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. One study suggests that nasal calcitonin produces small increments in bone mass and a small reduction in new vertebral fractures in calcitonintreated patients versus those on calcium alone. There has been no proven effectiveness against nonvertebral fractures. Calcitonin is not indicated for prevention of osteoporosis and is not sufficiently potent to prevent bone loss in early postmenopausal women. Calcitonin might have an analgesic effect on bone pain, both in the subcutaneous and possibly the nasal form."

            "content": "5-HT1P receptors of the intrinsic primary afferent nerves (IPANs), which contain calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and acetylcholine and project to myenteric plexus interneurons. 5-HT4 receptors on the presynaptic terminals of the IPANs appear to enhance release of CGRP or acetylcholine. The myenteric interneurons are important in controlling the peristaltic reflex, promoting release of excitatory mediators proximally and inhibitory mediators distally. Motilin may stimulate excitatory neurons or muscle cells directly. Dopamine acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the gastrointestinal tract, decreasing the intensity of esophageal and gastric contractions."
