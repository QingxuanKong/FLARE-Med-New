Specifically, PSCs are believed to play a role in maintaining normal pancreatic architecture that can shift toward fibrogenesis in the case of chronic pancreatitis. The sentinel acute pancreatitis event (SAPE) hypothesis uniformly describes the events in the pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis. It is believed that alcohol or additional stimuli lead to matrix metalloproteinase\u2013mediated destruction of normal collagen in pancreatic parenchyma, which later allows for pancreatic remodeling. Proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and interleukin 6 (IL-6), as well as oxidant complexes, are able to induce PSC activity with subsequent new collagen synthesis.

It stimulates muscle breakdown and cachexia through increased catabolism, insulin resistance, and redistribution of amino acids to hepatic circulation as fuel substrates. TNF also mediates coagulation activation, cell migration, and macrophage phago-cytosis and enhances the expression of adhesion molecules, prostaglandin E2, platelet-activating factor, glucocorticoids, and eicosanoids.

In response to pancreatic injury, the PSCs become activated and proliferate (similarly to hepatic stellate cells), lose their lipid vesicles, and transform into myofibroblast-like cells.

In addition to being stimulated by cytokines, oxidants, or growth factors, PSCs also possess transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)\u2013mediated self-activating autocrine pathways that may explain disease progression in chronic pancreatitis even after removal of noxious stimuli."

Between abutting hepatocytes are bile canaliculi, channels 1 to 2 \u00b5m in diameter that are formed by grooves in the plasma membranes of adjacent hepatocytes and are separated from the vascular space by tight junctions. These channels drain successively into the intralobular canals of Hering, periportal bile ductules, and finally into the terminal bile ducts within the portal tracts."

Mice in which the ADAM17 gene has been selectively inactivated in myeloid cells are also resistant to septic shock, confirming that the release of soluble TNF-\u03b1into the circulation both depends on TACE and is the main factor responsible for septic shock. Blockade of TNF-\u03b1 activity, either with specific antibodies or with soluble proteins that mimic the receptor, is a successful treatment for several inflammatory disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis. However, these treatments have been found to reactivate tuberculosis in some apparently well patients with evidence of previous infection (as demonstrated by skin test), which is a direct demonstration of the importance of TNF-\u03b1 in keeping infection local and in check. 3-21 Cytokines made by macrophages and dendritic cells induce a systemic reaction known as the acute-phase response."

Activation of TNFR may later lead to apoptosis (programmed cell death) of activated cells."
