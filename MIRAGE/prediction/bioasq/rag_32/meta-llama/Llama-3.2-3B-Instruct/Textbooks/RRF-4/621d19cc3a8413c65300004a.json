Cytokeratin is a type of intermediate filament protein that is found in the cytoskeleton of epithelial cells. It is a key component of desmosomes and hemidesmosomes, which provide mechanical strength to epithelial cells. Cytokeratins are also used as markers to identify the origin of epithelial tumors. According to Document [5], cytokeratin is one of the commonly used markers in adenocarcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) cases, and it is also used to differentiate between adenocarcinoma and other types of cancers. Additionally, cytokeratin is used as a marker for detecting metastatic deposits in the lymph nodes, as mentioned in Document [1]. Furthermore, cytokeratin is used as a marker for detecting minimal residual disease in bone marrow, as mentioned in Document [2]. Based on these points, it is clear that cytokeratin plays a significant role in cancer diagnosis and is indeed a tumor marker.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Detection of cytokeratin by stains performed with specific monoclonal antibodies points to a diagnosis of undifferentiated carcinoma rather than large cell lymphoma. Similarly, detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in metastatic deposits by immunohistochemical staining allows definitive diagnosis of a primary tumor in the prostate gland. Immunocytochemical detection of estrogen receptors allows prognostication and directs therapeutic intervention in breast cancers. Flow cytometry is used routinely in the classification of leukemias and lymphomas. In this method, fluorescently labeled antibodies against cell surface molecules and differentiation antigens are used to obtain the phenotype of malignant cells (Chapter 12)."

Not only does it permit an accurate prognosis, but in many cases, therapeutic decision-making is based largely on the TNM (primary tumor, regional nodes, metastasis) classification (Table 108-1). Comparison with historic series should be undertaken with caution, as the staging has changed several times in the past 20 years. The current staging is complex and results in significant changes in outcome by stage as compared with prior staging systems. One of the most exciting aspects of breast cancer biology has been its subdivision into at least five subtypes based on gene expression profiling. 1. Luminal A: The luminal tumors express cytokeratins 8 and 18, have the highest levels of estrogen receptor expression, tend to be low grade, are most likely to respond to endocrine therapy, and have a favorable prognosis.

Table 120e-2 lists additional tests that may be useful to further define the tumor lineage. A more comprehensive algorithm may improve the diagnostic accuracy but can make the process complex. With the use of immunohistochemical markers, electron microscopic analysis, which is time-consuming and expensive, is rarely needed."

If there is no clear ADC or SQCC morphology, the tumor is regarded as NSCLC\u2014not otherwise specified (NOS). Step 2: NSCLC-NOS can be further classified based on (a) immunohistochemical stains, (b) mucin (DPAS or mucicarmine) stains, or (c) molecular data. If the stains all favor ADC-positive ADC marker(s) (i.e., TTF-1 and/or mucin positive) with negative SQCC markers, then the tumor is classified as NSCLC, favor ADC. If SQCC markers (i.e., p63 and/or CK5/6) are positive with negative ADC markers, the tumor is classified as NSCLC, favor SQCC. If the ADC and SQCC markers are both strongly positive in different populations of tumor cells, the tumor is classified as NSCLC-NOS, with a comment it may represent adenosquamous carcinoma. If all markers are negative, the tumor is classified as NSCLC-NOS. \u2020EGFR mutation"

            "content": "in conjunction with upregulation of N-cadherin, a change in the pattern of expression of integrins (which mediate cell\u2013extracellular matrix associations that are important for cell motility), and a switch in intermediate filament expression from cytokeratin to vimentin, results in the phenotypic change from adherent highly organized epithelial cells to motile and invasive cells with a fibroblast or mesenchymal morphology. EMT is thought to be an important step leading to metastasis in some human cancers. Host stromal cells, including tumor-associated fibroblasts and macrophages, play an important role in modulating tumor cell behavior through secretion of growth factors and proangiogenic cytokines, and matrix metalloproteinases that degrade the basement membrane. VEGF-A, -C, and -D are produced by tumor cells and stromal cells in response to hypoxemia or oncogenic signals and induce production of new blood vessels and lymphatic channels through which tumor cells metastasize to lymph"
