    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the impact of rotavirus vaccines on the epidemiology of rotavirus infections and the predominant rotavirus genotypes. The provided documents suggest that rotavirus vaccines have led to a decline in rotavirus detections in the United States, with a 74-90% decline in the number of rotavirus detections during the latest two seasons (2010-2012). This decline is consistent with the implementation of rotavirus vaccines in 2006. However, the documents do not provide direct information on whether the vaccines have changed the predominant rotavirus genotypes. However, the fact that the vaccines have been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of rotavirus infections in various settings, including developing countries, suggests that they may have had a broader impact on the rotavirus population, potentially altering the predominant genotypes. Moreover, the documents mention that the efficacy of rotavirus vaccines was moderate (50-65%) in developing countries, which may indicate that the vaccines have targeted a specific subset of rotavirus strains. It is possible that the vaccines have reduced the circulation of more virulent or vaccine-unresponsive strains, potentially leading to a shift in the predominant genotypes. However, without direct evidence from studies specifically investigating the impact of rotavirus vaccines on the predominant genotypes, it is difficult to conclude definitively. Based on the available information, the most appropriate answer is that the effect of rotavirus vaccines on the predominant rotavirus genotypes is not explicitly stated, but it is possible that they may have had an impact on the rotavirus population, leading to a shift in the predominant genotypes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

These efforts include improving access to new and underutilized vaccines, such as pneumococcal conjugate, rotavirus, human papillomavirus (HPV), and meningococcal A conjugate vaccines. The American Red Cross, the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Foundation, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are partners in the Measles & Rubella Initiative, which targets reduction of worldwide measles deaths by 95% from 2000 to 2015. During 2000\u20132011, global measles mortality rates declined by 71%\u2014i.e., from an estimated 548,000 deaths in 2000 to 158,000 deaths in 2011. Rotary International, UNICEF, the CDC, and the WHO are leading partners in the global eradication of polio, an endeavor that reduced the annual number of paralytic polio cases from 350,000 in 1988 to"

Antibody is acquired at an earlier age in developing countries\u2014a pattern consistent with the presumed fecal-oral mode of transmission. Infections occur year-round, although, in temperate climates, a distinct increase has been noted in cold-weather months. Noroviruses may be the most common infectious agents of mild gastroenteritis in the community and affect all age groups, whereas sapoviruses primarily cause gastroenteritis in children. Noroviruses also cause traveler\u2019s diarrhea, and outbreaks have occurred among military personnel deployed to various parts of the world. The limited data available indicate that norovirus may be the second most common viral agent (after rotavirus) among young Norovirus Caliciviridae Positive-sense All ages + + EM, RT-PCR single-strand RNA"
