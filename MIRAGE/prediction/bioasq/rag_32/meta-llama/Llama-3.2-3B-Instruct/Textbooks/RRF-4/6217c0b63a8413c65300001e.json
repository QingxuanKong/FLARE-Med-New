In addition, recent deep sequencing of clear cell carcinoma genomes has revealed frequent loss-of-function mutations in genes that encode proteins that regulate histone methylation, suggesting that changes in the \u201cepigenome\u201d have a central role in the genesis of this subtype of renal carcinoma."

These neoplasms represent 80% to 85% of all primary malignant neoplasms of the kidney and 2% to 3% of all cancers in adults. These data translate into about 65,000 cases per year in the United States; 40% of patients die of the disease. Carcinomas of the kidney are most common from the sixth to seventh decades, and men are affected about twice as commonly as women. The risk for developing these neoplasms is higher in smokers, hypertensive or obese patients, and those who have had occupational exposure to cadmium. The risk for developing renal cell cancer is increased 30-fold in individuals with acquired polycystic disease as a complication of chronic dialysis. The role of genetic factors in the causation of these cancers is discussed later. http://ebooksmedicine.net"

These neoplasms are frequently multifocal and bilateral and appear as early-stage tumors. Like clear cell carcinomas, they occur in familial and sporadic forms, but unlike these neoplasms, papillary renal cancers are not associated with abnormalities of chromosome 3. The culprit in most cases of hereditary papillary renal cell cancers is the MET proto-oncogene, located on chromosome 7q. The MET gene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor. The increased dosage of the MET gene due to duplications of chromosome 7 seems to spur abnormal growth in the proximal tubular epithelial cell precursors of papillary carcinomas. In familial cases, genetic analysis shows activating mutations of MET in the germ line, along with increased gene dosage in the cancers. Activating mutations of the MET gene also are found in a subset of patients with"

Thus, loss or inactivation of both copies of the VHL gene seems to be the common underlying molecular abnormality in both sporadic and familial forms of clear cell carcinomas. The VHL protein causes the degradation of hypoxia-induced factors (HIFs), and in the absence of VHL, HIFs are stabilized.

These mutations may alter the type II TGF-\u03b2 receptor or SMAD molecules that serve to transduce anti-proliferative signals from the receptor to the nucleus. Mutations affecting the type II receptor are seen in cancers of the colon, stomach, and endometrium. Mutational inactivation of SMAD4, 1 of the 10 proteins known to be involved in TGF-\u03b2 signaling, is common in pancreatic cancers. In other cancers, by contrast, loss of TGF-\u03b2\u2013mediated growth control occurs at a level downstream of the core TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway; for example, there may be loss of p21 expression and/or overexpression of MYC.

The transcription factor nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) is a heterodimer composed of p65 and p50 subunits that associate with an inhibitor, I\u03baB, in the cell cytoplasm. In response to growth factor or cytokine signaling, a multi-subunit kinase called IKK (I\u03baB kinase) phosphorylates I\u03baB and directs its degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome system. NF-\u03baB, free of its inhibitor, translocates to the nucleus and activates target genes, many of which promote the survival of tumor cells. Novel drugs called proteasome inhibitors block the proteolysis of I\u03baB, thereby preventing NF-\u03baB activation. For unexplained reasons, this is selectively toxic to tumor cells.

Kidney manifestations of VHL include multiple bilateral kidney cysts and renal cell carcinomas. Kidney cysts and carcinoma affect the majority of VHL patients. Nonrenal features of VHL include pheochromocytomas, cerebellar hemangioblastomas, and retinal hemangiomas.

In one analysis, no prior nephrectomy, a KPS <80, low hemoglobin, high corrected calcium, and abnormal lactate dehydrogenase were poor prognostic factors. Patients with zero, one or two, and three or more factors had a median survival of 24, 12, and 5 months, respectively. These tumors may follow an unpredictable and protracted clinical course. It may be best to document progression before considering systemic treatment. 115 of the prostate Howard I. Scher, James A. Eastham"
