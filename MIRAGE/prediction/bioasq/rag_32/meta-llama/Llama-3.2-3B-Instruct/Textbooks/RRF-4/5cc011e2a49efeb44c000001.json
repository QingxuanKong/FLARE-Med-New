    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the role of nuclear pore complexes in gene regulation. According to document [8] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts), nuclear pore complexes are involved in the transport of proteins and RNAs between the nucleus and cytoplasm. However, the question asks about the promotion of gene silencing, not the transport of molecules. In document [8] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts), it is mentioned that X-chromosome inactivation is initiated and spread from a single site near the middle of the X chromosome, and that a transcribed 20,000-nucleotide lncRNA (called Xist) is expressed solely from the inactive X chromosome. This suggests that association with the nuclear pore complex may not promote gene silencing. Instead, it may be involved in the transport of proteins and RNAs that are involved in gene regulation. However, in document [9] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts), it is mentioned that epigenetic changes, such as methylation, can irreversibly silence genes, and that barriers can be formed to stop the spread of heterochromatin. This suggests that association with the nuclear pore complex may not be necessary for gene silencing. Therefore, the answer is not explicitly stated in the provided documents. However, based on the information provided, we can conclude that association with the nuclear pore complex is not mentioned as promoting gene silencing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

There, Ran-GAP triggers Ran-GTP to hydrolyze its bound GTP, thereby converting it to Ran-GDP, which dissociates from the receptor. The receptor is then ready for another cycle of nuclear import. Nuclear export occurs by a similar mechanism, except that Ran-GTP in the nucleus promotes cargo binding to the export receptor, rather than promoting cargo dissociation. Once the export receptor moves through the pore to the cytosol, it encounters Ran-GAP, which induces the receptor to hydrolyze its GTP to GDP. As a result, the export receptor releases both its cargo and Ran-GDP in the cytosol. Free export receptors are then returned to the nucleus to complete the cycle (Figure 12\u201313B).

To understand the general principles by which sorting signals operate, it is important to distinguish three fundamentally different ways by which proteins move from one compartment to another. These three mechanisms are described below, and the transport steps at which they operate are outlined in Figure 12\u20135. We discuss the first two mechanisms (gated transport and transmembrane transport) in this chapter, and the third (vesicular transport, green arrows in Figure 12\u20135) in Chapter 13. 1. In gated transport, proteins and RNA molecules move between the cytosol and the nucleus through nuclear pore complexes in the nuclear envelope. The nuclear pore complexes function as selective gates that support the active transport of specific macromolecules and macromolecular assemblies between the two topologically equivalent spaces, although they also allow free diffusion of smaller molecules. 2."

For type II receptors such as TR and retinoic acid receptor (RAR), co-repressor proteins bind to the receptor in the absence of ligand and silence gene transcription. Hormone binding induces conformational changes, triggering the release of corepressors and inducing the recruitment of coactivators that stimulate transcription. Thus, these receptors are capable of mediating dramatic changes in the level of gene activity. Certain disease states are associated with defective regulation of these events. For example, mutations in the TR prevent co-repressor dissociation, resulting in an autosomal dominant form of hormone resistance (Chap. 405). In promyelocytic leukemia, fusion of RAR\u03b1 to other nuclear proteins causes aberrant gene silencing that prevents normal cellular differentiation.

These models are derived from experimental analyses of barrier action, and a combination of several of them may function at any one site. The tethering of a region of chromatin to a large fixed site, such as the nuclear pore complex illustrated here, can form a barrier that stops the spread of heterochromatin. The tight binding of barrier proteins to a group of nucleosomes can make this chromatin resistant to heterochromatin spreading. (C) by recruiting a group of highly active histone-modifying enzymes, barriers can erase the histone marks that are required for heterochromatin to spread. For example, a potent acetylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 will compete with lysine 9 methylation, thereby preventing the binding of the HP1 protein needed to form a major form of heterochromatin.

Import receptors, facilitated by FG-repeat binding, then enter the channel.

(Figures 12\u20139 and 12\u201313) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy NMR is the resonant absorption of electromagnetic radiation at a specific frequency by atomic nuclei in a magnetic field, due to flipping of the orientation of their magnetic dipole moments. The NMR spectrum provides information about the chemical environment of the nuclei. NMR is used widely to determine the three-dimensional structure of small proteins and other small molecules. The principles of NMR are also used for medical diagnostic purposes in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Explain why or why not. 12\u20131 Like the lumen of the ER, the interior of the nucleus is topologically equivalent to the outside of the cell. 12\u20132 ER-bound and free ribosomes, which are structurally and functionally identical, differ only in the proteins they happen to be making at a particular time. 12\u20133 To avoid the inevitable collisions that would occur if two-way traffic through a single pore were allowed, nuclear pore complexes are specialized so that some mediate import while others mediate export. 12\u20134 Peroxisomes are found in only a few specialized types of eukaryotic cell. Discuss the following problems. 12\u20135 What is the fate of a protein with no sorting signal?"

            "content": "When a nucleus is dismantled during mitosis, the NPCs and nuclear lamina disassemble and the nuclear envelope fragments. The dismantling process is at least partly a consequence of direct phosphorylation of nucleoporins and lamins by the cyclin-dependent protein kinase (Cdk) that is activated at the onset of mitosis (discussed in Chapter 17). During this process, some NPC proteins become bound to nuclear import receptors, which play an important part in the reassembly of NPCs at the end of mitosis. Nuclear envelope membrane proteins\u2014no longer tethered to the pore complexes, lamina, or chromatin\u2014disperse throughout the ER membrane. The dynein motor protein, which moves along microtubules (discussed in Chapter 16), actively participates in tearing the nuclear envelope off the chromatin. Together, these processes break down the barriers that normally separate the nucleus and cytosol, and the nuclear proteins that are not bound to membranes or chromosomes intermix completely with the"
