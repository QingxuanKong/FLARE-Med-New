As noted above, trials of certain drugs (e.g., selegiline and rasagiline) have provided positive results consistent with a disease-modifying effect. However, it is not possible to determine if the positive results were due to neuroprotection with slowing of disease progression or confounding symptomatic effects that mask ongoing progression.

With Joffroy in 1869 and Gombault in 1871, he studied the pathologic aspects of the disease. In a series of lectures given from 1872 to 1874, he provided a lucid account of the clinical and pathologic findings. Although called Charcot disease in France, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (the term recommended by Charcot) has been preferred in the English-speaking world. Duchenne had earlier (1858) described labioglossolaryngeal paralysis, a term that Wachsmuth in 1864 changed to progressive bulbar palsy. In 1869, Charcot called attention to the nuclear origin of progressive bulbar palsy, and in 1882 Dejerine established its relationship to ALS. Most authors credit Aran and Duchenne with the earliest descriptions of progressive spinal muscular atrophy, which they believed to be of myogenic origin.

In one trial involving patients with chronic progressive MS, weekly low-dose oral methotrexate resulted in slight improvement difference and produced some reduction in the volume of cerebral lesions on the MRI compared with control cases (Goodkin et al, 1996). Because this regimen is well tolerated, it may still have some occasional use.

This is in part true because small albeit statistically significant effects in large groups may be of little consequence when applied to an individual patient. It goes without saying that data derived from trials must be used in the context of a patient\u2019s overall physical and mental condition and age. Furthermore, for many neurologic conditions there is, at the moment, inadequate evidence on which to base treatment. Here, the physician makes judgments based on partial or insufficient data. Even deciding purposefully to wait before committing to an intervention displays wisdom. Even when no effective treatment is possible, neurologic diagnosis is more than an intellectual pastime.

Multifocal motor neuropathy, but not multifocal conduction block, is associated in half or more of cases with a particular IgM antibody, anti-GM1, directed against a ganglioside component of peripheral myelin (Pestronk et al). For this reason, some view this illness as belonging to the class of paraproteinemic neuropathies (see earlier and Simmons et al) and it is distinctive enough clinically to be categorized separately. Its importance as a clinical entity lies in the similarity of the clinical picture to a purely lower motor neuron type of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and, unlike ALS, its potential responsiveness to treatment. The pathophysiologic role of anti-GM1 antibodies is displayed by a case of transplacental transmission of a motor neuropathy to a neonate (Attarian et al)."
