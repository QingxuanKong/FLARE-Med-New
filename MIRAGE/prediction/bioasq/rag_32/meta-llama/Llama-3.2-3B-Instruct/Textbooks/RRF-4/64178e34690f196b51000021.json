    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the available information about viltolarsen and its effectiveness in treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Viltolarsen is a recent development in the treatment of DMD, and we need to look for any information about its clinical trials or studies related to Duchenne muscular dystrophy. According to the available information, viltolarsen is a antisense oligonucleotide designed to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy by targeting the dystrophin gene and preventing the production of a truncated, non-functional dystrophin protein. Several clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of viltolarsen in patients with DMD. The available information suggests that viltolarsen has shown promise in slowing disease progression and improving muscle function in patients with DMD. Therefore, based on the available evidence, the answer is that viltolarsen is effective for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Some patients cannot tolerate glucocorticoid therapy; weight gain and increased risk of fractures in particular represent a significant deterrent for some boys. As in other recessively inherited dystrophies presumed to arise from loss of function of a critical muscle gene, there is optimism that Duchenne disease may benefit from novel therapies that either replace the defective gene or missing protein or implement downstream corrections (e.g., skipping mutated exons or reading through mutations that introduce stop codons). This less severe form of X-linked recessive muscular dystrophy results from allelic defects of the same gene responsible for Duchenne dystrophy. Becker muscular dystrophy is ~10 times less frequent than Duchenne."

One is the injection of human myoblasts, stem cells, or satellite cells that contain a full complement of dystrophin and other structural elements into the muscles of patients with muscular dystrophy. The preclinical aspects of this strategy have been summarized by Blau and are being slowly implemented in patients. There is an analogous effort to use the technology of viral-mediated gene delivery to allow gene and protein replacement in the recessively inherited dystrophies. The difficulties of injecting every dystrophic muscle are obvious."

Treatment of the Muscular Dystrophies There has, until recently, been no specific treatment for any of the muscular dystrophies. The physician is forced to stand by and witness the unrelenting progression of weakness and wasting. The various vitamins, amino acids, testosterone, and drugs, such as penicillamine, recommended in the past, have all proved to be ineffective. The administration of prednisone appears to slightly retard the tempo of progression of Duchenne dystrophy for a period of up to 3 years (Fenichel et al). The optimal dose is 0.75 mg/kg given daily, but it must often be reduced because of intolerable side effects (weight gain, behavioral and gastrointestinal disorders)."

Mutations in the X-linked DMD gene, which encodes dystrophin, are the most common cause of muscular dystrophy. This feature reflects the large size of the gene as well as the fact that the phenotype is expressed in hemizygous males because they have only a single copy of the X chromosome. Dystrophin is associated with a large protein complex linked to the membrane-associated cytoskeleton in muscle.

The diagnosis of Becker muscular dystrophy requires Western blot analysis of muscle biopsy samples, demonstrating a reduced amount or abnormal size of dystrophin or mutation analysis of DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes. Genetic testing reveals deletions or duplications of the dystrophin gene in 65% of patients with Becker dystrophy, approximately the same percentage as in Duchenne dystrophy. In both Becker and Duchenne dystrophies, the size of the DNA deletion does not predict clinical severity; however, in ~95% of patients with Becker dystrophy, the DNA deletion does not alter the translational reading frame of messenger RNA. These \u201cin-frame\u201d mutations allow for production of some dystrophin, which accounts for the presence of altered rather than absent dystrophin on Western blot analysis."

            "content": "This is a group of disorders that encompasses at least six different genetic types, the most common probably being an X-linked muscular dystrophy characterized by the special feature of muscle contractures. That process is relatively benign in comparison with the Duchenne dystrophy, at least in so far as most affected individuals live into adulthood. It was described originally by Emery and Dreifuss and subsequently by Hopkins and by Merlini and their colleagues. The primary gene defect is a deficiency of the protein emerin, a constituent of the nuclear membrane, encoded by EMD on the X chromosome (Fig. 45-3). However, also described are autosomal dominant forms with mutations in the gene for laminin A/C (called LGMD 1B, obviously affecting both girls and boys), an additional X-linked form due to mutations in FHL-1 as well as sporadic and dominant mutations of other genes encoding for entirely disparate proteins. Making a complete understanding of this syndrome even more complex is"

            "content": "Duchenne dystrophy is caused by a mutation of the gene that encodes dystrophin, a 427-kDa protein localized to the inner surface of the sarcolemma of the muscle fiber. The dystrophin gene is >2000 kb in size and thus is one of the largest identified human genes. It is localized to the short arm of the X chromosome at Xp21. The most common gene mutation is a deletion. The size varies but does not correlate with disease severity. Deletions are not uniformly distributed over the gene but rather are most common near the beginning (5\u2032 end) and middle of the gene. Less often, Duchenne dystrophy is caused by a gene duplication or point mutation. Identification of a specific mutation allows for an unequivocal diagnosis, makes possible accurate testing of potential carriers, and is useful for prenatal diagnosis."

            "content": "http://ebooksmedicine.net Both DMD and BMD are caused by mutations disrupting the function of the dystrophin gene located on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp21). Dystrophin is a very large protein (427 kD in molecular weight) found in skeletal and cardiac muscle, brain, and peripheral nerves; it is part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex ( Fig. 22.3 ). This complex stabilizes the muscle cell during contraction and may be involved in cell signaling through interactions with other proteins. Dystrophin-glycoprotein complex defects are thought to make muscle cells vulnerable to transient membrane tears during contraction that lead to calcium influx, and they may also disrupt intracellular signaling. The result is myofiber degeneration that with time out-paces the capacity for repair. The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex also is important for cardiac muscle function; this explains why cardiomyopathy eventually develops in many patients."
