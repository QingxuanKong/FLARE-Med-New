            "content": "M. kansasii can cause a clinical syndrome that strongly resembles tuberculosis, consisting of hemoptysis, chest pain, and cavitary lung disease. The rapidly growing NTM, such as M. abscessus, have been associated with esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia. Patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis are prone to pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial and Nocardia infections; the underlying mechanism may be inhibition of alveolar macrophage function due to the autoantibodies to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor found in these patients."

Distal ileal and cecal involvement predominates, and patients present with symptoms of small-bowel obstruction and a tender abdominal mass. The diagnosis is made most directly by colonoscopy with biopsy and culture. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex infection occurs in advanced stages of HIV infection and in other immunocompromised states; it usually manifests as a systemic infection with diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, fever, and malabsorption. Diagnosis is established by acid-fast smear and culture of mucosal biopsies."

            "content": "Replication in macrophages. Once internalized, the organisms inhibit normal microbicidal responses by preventing the fusion of the lysosomes with the phagocytic vacuole, allowing the mycobacterium to persist and proliferate. Thus, the earliest phase of primary tuberculosis (the first 3 weeks) in the nonsensitized patient is characterized by bacillary proliferation within the pulmonary alveolar macrophages and air spaces, eventually resulting in bacteremia and seeding of the organisms to multiple sites. Despite the bacteremia, most individuals at this stage are asymptomatic or have a mild flulike illness. Development of cell-mediated immunity. This occurs approximately 3 weeks after exposure. Processed mycobacterial antigens reach the draining lymph nodes and are presented to CD4 T cells by dendritic cells and macrophages. Under the influence of macrophage-secreted IL-12, CD4+ T cells of the TH1 subset are generated that are capable of secreting IFN-\u03b3."
