Pregabalin is a newer analog of gabapentin that may also prove useful in relieving painful disorders that involve a muscle spasm component. Progabide and glycine have also been found in preliminary studies to reduce spasticity. Progabide is a GABAA and GABAB agonist and has active metabolites, including GABA itself. Glycine is another inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter (see Chapter 21) that appears to possess pharmacologic activity when given orally and readily passes the blood-brain barrier. Idrocilamide and riluzole are newer drugs for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that appear to have spasm-reducing effects, possibly through inhibition of glutamatergic transmission in the CNS."

A large double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-start study (the ADAGIO trial) to evaluate whether it had neuroprotective benefit (ie, slowed the disease course) yielded unclear results: a daily dose of 1 mg met all the end points of the study and did seem to slow disease progression, but a 2-mg dose failed to do so. These findings are difficult to explain and the decision to use rasagiline for neuroprotective purposes therefore remains an individual one."

With Joffroy in 1869 and Gombault in 1871, he studied the pathologic aspects of the disease. In a series of lectures given from 1872 to 1874, he provided a lucid account of the clinical and pathologic findings. Although called Charcot disease in France, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (the term recommended by Charcot) has been preferred in the English-speaking world. Duchenne had earlier (1858) described labioglossolaryngeal paralysis, a term that Wachsmuth in 1864 changed to progressive bulbar palsy. In 1869, Charcot called attention to the nuclear origin of progressive bulbar palsy, and in 1882 Dejerine established its relationship to ALS. Most authors credit Aran and Duchenne with the earliest descriptions of progressive spinal muscular atrophy, which they believed to be of myogenic origin.

Cedarbaum and colleagues, who reviewed the course of the illness in 307 patients over a 7-year period, found no evidence that the early initiation of l-dopa treatment predisposed to the development of fluctuations in motor response or to dyskinesia and dementia. In fact, the findings of the \u201cElldopa\u201d trial by The Parkinson Study Group (2004) were that functional and other measures were better in patients who had taken l-dopa for 40 weeks and then stopped the medications than in those who received no medication.

Moreover, the benefits of levodopa therapy often diminish as the disease advances, and serious adverse effects may complicate longterm levodopa treatment. Nevertheless, dopaminergic therapy at a relatively early stage may be most effective in alleviating motor symptoms of parkinsonism and may also favorably affect the mortality rate due to the disease. Therefore, several strategies have evolved for optimizing dopaminergic therapy, as summarized in Figure 28\u20135. Symptomatic treatment of mild parkinsonism is probably best avoided until there is some degree of disability or functional limitation or until symptoms begin to impact the patient\u2019s lifestyle or cause significant social impairment."

Levodopa remains the most effective symptomatic therapy for PD, and some recommend starting it immediately using low doses (\u2264400 mg/d), but others prefer to delay levodopa treatment, particularly in younger patients, in order to reduce the risk of inducing motor complications. An alternate approach is to begin with an MAO-B inhibitor and/or a dopamine agonist, and reserve levodopa for later stages when these drugs can no longer provide satisfactory control.

Such information is important for prognostic purposes."
