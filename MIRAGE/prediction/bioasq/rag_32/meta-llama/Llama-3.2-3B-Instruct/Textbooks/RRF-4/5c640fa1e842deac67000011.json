Thus, in most cases, mutations inactivating the Apc gene appear to be the first, or at least a very early step, as they are detected at the same high frequency in small benign polyps as in large malignant tumors. Changes that lead to genetic and epigenetic instability are likely also to arise early in tumor progression, since they are needed to drive the later steps. Activating mutations in the K-Ras gene occur later, as they are rare in small polyps but common in larger ones that show disturbances in cell differentiation and histological pattern."

Indeed, many carcinomas show either chromosomal instability or defective mismatch repair\u2014but rarely both. These findings clearly demonstrate that genetic instability is not an accidental by-product of malignant behavior but a contributory cause\u2014and that cancer cells can acquire this instability in multiple ways.

Thus, it is excessive activity in the Wnt signaling pathway that is critical for the initiation of this cancer, rather than any single oncogene or tumor suppressor gene that the pathway contains. This being so, why is the Apc gene in particular so often the most common culprit in colorectal cancer? The Apc protein is large and it interacts not only with \u03b2-catenin but also with various other cell components, including microtubules. Loss of Apc appears to increase the frequency of mitotic spindle defects, leading to chromosome abnormalities when cells divide. This additional, independent cancer-promoting effect could explain why Apc mutations feature so prominently in the causation of colorectal cancer."

In simplest terms, mutations involving the APC/\u03b2-catenin pathway lead to increased WNT signaling, whereas those involving the microsatellite instability pathway are associated with defects in DNA mismatch repair (see Table 15.7). Both pathways involve the stepwise accumulation of multiple mutations, but the genes involved and the mechanisms by which the mutations accumulate differ.

Thus, when people are screened by colonoscopy in their fifties and the polyps are removed through the colonoscope\u2014a quick and easy surgical procedure\u2014the subsequent incidence of colorectal cancer is much lower: according to some studies, less than a quarter of what it would be otherwise."
