Untranslated regions (UTRs) are noncoding regions of the mRNA that do not code for protein but can have regulatory functions. According to document [0], many of the conserved sequences that do not code for protein are now known to produce untranslated RNA molecules, such as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are thought to have important functions in regulating gene transcription. Document [2] also mentions that noncoding elements are found throughout the genome, including short repeats, regulatory factor binding regions, noncoding regulatory RNAs, and transposons. Additionally, document [8] states that the 3' UTR of an mRNA can be thought of as a \u201czip code\u201d that directs mRNAs to different places in the cell, and proteins interpret this information by binding specifically to these sequences. Document [22] further explains that the untranslated regions of eukaryotic mRNAs resemble the transcriptional control regions of genes, and their nucleotide sequences contain information specifying the way the RNA is to be used. Based on this information, it can be inferred that untranslated regions (UTRs) can indeed regulate gene expression by providing regulatory information that proteins can bind to.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

But it is uncertain how much of the conserved noncoding DNA can be accounted for in these ways, and the function of most of it remains a mystery. This enigma highlights how much more we need to learn about the fundamental biological mechanisms that operate in animals and other complex organisms, and its solution is certain to have profound consequences for medicine."

OVERVIEW Gene expression refers to the multistep process that ultimately results in the production of a functional gene product, either ribonucleic acid (RNA) or protein. The first step in gene expression, the use of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for the synthesis of RNA (transcription), is the primary site of regulation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, however, gene expression also involves extensive posttranscriptional and posttranslational processes as well as actions that influence access to particular regions of the DNA. Each of these steps can be regulated to provide additional control over the kinds and amounts of functional products that are produced."

First, a single miRNA can regulate a whole set of different mRNAs, so long as the mRNAs carry a common short sequence in their UTRs. This situation is common in humans, where a single miRNA can control hundreds of different mRNAs. Second, regulation by miRNAs can be combinatorial. When the base-pairing between the miRNA and mRNA fails to trigger cleavage, additional miRNAs binding to the same mRNA lead to further reductions in its translation. As discussed earlier for transcription regulators, combinatorial control greatly expands the possibilities available to the cell by linking gene expression to a combination of different regulators rather than a single regulator. Third, an miRNA occupies relatively little"

Historically, genes were identified because they conferred specific traits that are transmitted from one generation to the next. Increasingly, they are characterized based on expression in various tissues (transcriptome). The size of genes is quite broad; some genes are only a few hundred base pairs, whereas others are extraordinarily large (2 Mb). The number of genes greatly underestimates the complexity of genetic expression, because single genes can generate multiple spliced messenger RNA (mRNA) products (isoforms), which are translated into proteins that are subject to complex posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation.

The regulatory DNA sequences are called cis-acting because they influence expression of genes on the same chromosome as the regulatory sequence (see p. 439). The regulatory molecules are called trans-acting because they can diffuse (transit) through the cell from their site of synthesis to their DNA-binding sites (Fig. 33.2).

Point mutations can be located in the promoter, the CAP site, the 5\u2019-untranslated region, the initiation codon, each of the three exons, the introns, or the polyadenylation signal. Many mutations introduce missense or nonsense mutations, whereas others cause defective RNA splicing. Not shown here are deletion mutations of the \u03b2-globin gene or larger deletions of the globin locus that can also result in thalassemia. \u25bc, promoter mutations; *, CAP site; \u2022, 5\u2019UTR; 1 , initiation codon; \u2666, defective RNA processing; \u2726, missense and nonsense Chapter 82 Principles of Human Genetics A, Poly A signal."

            "content": "Figure 1\u201347 A very simple regulatory circuit\u2014a single gene regulating its own expression by the binding of its protein product to its own regulatory DNA. simple schematic diagrams such as this are found throughout this book. They are often used to summarize what we know, but they leave many questions unanswered. When the protein binds, does it inhibit or stimulate transcription from the gene? how steeply does the transcription rate depend on the protein concentration? how long, on average, does a molecule of the protein remain bound to the dnA? how long does it take to make each molecule of mRnA or protein, and how quickly does each type of molecule get degraded? As explained in chapter 8, mathematical modeling shows that we need quantitative answers to all these and other questions before we can predict the behavior of even this single-gene system. For different parameter values, the system may settle to a unique steady state; or it may behave as a switch, capable of existing in one"
