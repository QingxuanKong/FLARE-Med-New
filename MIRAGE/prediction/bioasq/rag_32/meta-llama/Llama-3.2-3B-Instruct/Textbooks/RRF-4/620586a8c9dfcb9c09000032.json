        "A": "yes",
        "B": "no"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if bergapten can cross the blood-brain barrier, we need to consider the characteristics of the blood-brain barrier and the properties of bergapten. The blood-brain barrier is a highly selective permeable barrier that restricts the passage of substances, including drugs, into the central nervous system (CNS). It is composed of tight junctions between capillary endothelial cells and a surrounding layer of astrocyte end-feet. Substances that can cross the blood-brain barrier are typically highly polar or have specific transport mechanisms. Bergapten, however, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents as a known substance that crosses the blood-brain barrier. In fact, the documents suggest that large molecules, such as albumin, are prevented from entry by the capillary endothelium, and this is the barrier also for such molecules as are bound to album in, for example, aniline dyes. Additionally, the documents mention that substances with a molecular weight greater than 500 daltons generally cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Since bergapten is not mentioned in the context of crossing the blood-brain barrier, it is likely that it does not cross the barrier. However, without specific information on bergapten, we can only make an educated guess based on the general characteristics of the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, the most likely answer is that bergapten does not cross the blood-brain barrier.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

This separation is accomplished by the presence of tight junctions between the capillary endothelial cells as well as a surrounding layer of astrocyte end-feet. As such, to enter the CNS, drugs must either be highly hydrophobic or engage specific transport mechanisms. For example, the second-generation antihistamines cause less drowsiness because they were developed to be significantly more polar than older antihistamines, limiting their crossing of the BBB (see Chapter 16). Many nutrients, such as glucose and the essential amino acids, have specific transporters that allow them to cross the BBB. l-DOPA, a precursor of the neurotransmitter dopamine, can enter the brain using an amino acid transporter, whereas dopamine cannot cross the BBB. Thus, the orally administered drug l-DOPA, but not"

They are assisted by endothelial cells of the blood\u2013brain barrier that effectively limit movement of K into the extracellular fluid of the CNS.

Part of this control is provided by the presence of a blood-brain barrier (other mechanisms are the buffering functions of glia, regulation of CNS circulation, and exchange of substances between the CSF and extracellular fluid of the CNS). Movement of large molecules and highly charged ions from blood into the brain and spinal cord is severely restricted. The restriction is at least partly due to the barrier action of the capillary endothelial cells of the CNS and the tight junctions between them. Astrocytes may also help limit the movement of certain substances. For example, astrocytes can take up potassium ions and thus regulate [K+] in the extracellular space.
