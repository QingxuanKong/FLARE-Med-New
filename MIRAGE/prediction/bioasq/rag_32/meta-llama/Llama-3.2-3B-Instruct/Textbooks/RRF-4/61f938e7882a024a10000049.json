Gastroenterologists have limited experience with injection of a cytotoxic agent into the cyst in an attempt to ablate the cyst epithelium. Ethanol has been used and more recently this has been combined with paclitaxel. The combination of ethanol and paclitaxel injection resulted in elimination of the cysts, as determined by CT scan-ning, in 29 out of 47 (62%) of patients in a median follow-up period of 21.7 months.377Recently, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) published guidelines for asymptomatic mucinous cysts (http://www.gastro.org/guidelines/pancreatic-cysts) that are different from all previously published guidelines in the following areas: 2-year interval for cyst of any size undergoing surveillance, stopping surveillance after 5 years if no change, surgery only if more than one concerning feature on MRI confirmed on EUS and only in centers with high volumes of"

Despite the fact that many tumor markers such as CA19-9 have been studied, there are still no effective screening tests for pancreatic cancer. Research tak-ing advantage of recent advances in genomics, gene expression analysis, and proteomics has demonstrated thousands of genes and corresponding proteins that are differentially expressed in pancreatic tumors that have potential for early detection of pan-creatic cancer.316 Some of these proteins would be expected to be expressed at the cell surface or in pancreatic juice and may become useful as biomarkers for pancreatic cancer in the future.In patients presenting with jaundice, a reasonable first diagnostic imaging study is abdominal ultrasound. If bile duct dilation is not seen, hepatocellular disease is likely. Demonstra-tion of cholelithiasis and bile duct dilation suggests a diagnosis of choledocholithiasis, and the next logical step would be ERCP to clear the bile duct. In the"

In general, there are three clinical prob-lems in advanced pancreatic cancer that require palliation: pain, jaundice, and duodenal obstruction. The mainstay of pain con-trol is oral narcotics. Sustained-release preparations of morphine sulfate are frequently used. Invasion of retroperitoneal nerve trunks accounts for the severe pain experienced by patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. A celiac plexus nerve block can control pain effectively for a period of months, although the procedure sometimes needs to be repeated.320Jaundice is present in the majority of patients with pan-creatic cancer, and the most troublesome aspect for the patient is the accompanying pruritus. Biliary obstruction may also lead to cholangitis, coagulopathy, digestive symptoms, and hepato-cellular failure. In the past, surgeons traditionally"

Furthermore, because IRE is not based on thermal damage of cancer cells, the heat-sink phenomenon is not a concern, and even lesions abutting large vessels can be ablated with radical intent. Irreversible electroporation using the Nanoknife is reported to enable treatment of pancreatic tumors abutting vascular structures without compromise of the vessels or concern for the heat sink effect of nearby blood flow.329 Martin has created a registry and accumulated multi-institutional data on 200 patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer showing OS of 28.3 months for patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer and 23.2 months in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Those numbers compare favorably with the survival of patients treated with chemoradiation alone, which is 13 months in historical controls.330 This modality is new, but"

A reasonable consideration in a disease with high rates of distant metastases is to begin with adjuvant chemotherapy, followed by radiation therapy in patients who do not progress, particularly in patients where there may be increased concern about local recurrence such as in patients with close margins.Remarkable results in adjuvant therapy were reported by the Virginia Mason Clinic with combination 5-FU, cisplatinum, interferon-\u3008, and external beam radiation.367 Although the toxic-ity was high (42% hospitalized for GI toxicity), the promising results prompted larger confirmatory studies. Unfortunately, one such study was stopped due to toxicity, and this protocol has not been widely adopted. More recent results with FOLFIRINOX in the setting of metastatic disease have encouraged clinical tri-als using this regimen in the"
