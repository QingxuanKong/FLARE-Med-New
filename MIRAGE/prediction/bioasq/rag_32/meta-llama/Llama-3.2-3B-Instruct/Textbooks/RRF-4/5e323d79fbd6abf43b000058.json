The duration of progression before this transformation occurs and the latency to recurrence with modern treatment may extend for many years. A survey of the outcome of these low-grade supratentorial tumors showed that 10-year survival after operation was from 11 to 40 percent provided that conformal therapy (focused on the tumor, in contrast to whole brain radiation) 5,300 cGy was given postoperatively (Shaw et al). This, of course, is quite in contrast to the figures for glioblastoma. Repeated operations prolong life in some patients."

First, many types of tumor, both primary and secondary, occur in the cranial cavity and spinal canal but certain ones are much more frequent than others and are prone to occur in particular age groups. For example, secondary metastatic deposits are more common than primary brain tumors in adults and the opposite is true in children. Furthermore, certain cancers (breast, lung, melanoma, renal cell cancer) display a tendency to metastasize to nervous tissue and many others rarely do so. Second, some primary intracranial and spinal tumors, such as craniopharyngioma, meningioma, and schwannoma, have a disposition to grow in particular parts of the cranial cavity, thereby producing characteristic neurologic syndromes.

If a patient becomes resistant to systemic chemotherapy, hepatic arterial infusion of chemotherapy may induce complete remission in selected cases. Hepatic resection may be required to control acute bleeding or to excise a focus of resistant tumor. New techniques of arterial embolization may reduce the need for surgical intervention. At the NETDC, cerebral metastases are treated with either whole-brain radiation (3,000 cGy in 10 fractions) or stereotactic radiosurgery in conjunction with combination chemotherapy. Because irradiation may be hemostatic and tumoricidal, the risk of spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage may be lessened by the concurrent use of combination chemotherapy and brain irradiation. Excellent remission rates (86%) were reported in patients with cranial metastases treated with intensive intravenous combination chemotherapy and intrathecal methotrexate (MTX) (64)."

Current programs utilize various combinations of corticosteroids, radiation therapy (focal or whole brain treatment), surgical removal, and chemotherapy and immune modulating treatment. Corticosteroids produce prompt improvement, probably on the basis of a reduction in the edema surrounding the lesion(s), but sustained use is restricted by side effects and eventual loss of efficacy. Most patients with multiple metastases also temporarily benefit from the use of whole-brain irradiation, usually administered over approximately a 2-week period, in multiple doses. Various studies report a response rate, albeit temporary, in 50 to 70 percent of patients with multiple metastases but the type of tumor also determines the likelihood of response. High-dose and focused radiotherapy (radiosurgery) is now considered the main alternative for single or several cerebral metastases."

            "content": "Despite all of these measures, survival is only slightly prolonged by treatment. The average period of survival in cases of brain metastases, even with therapy, is about 6 months, but it varies widely and is dominated by the extent of other systemic metastases. Between 15 and 30 percent of patients live for a year and 5 to 10 percent for 2 years; with certain radiosensitive tumors (lymphoma, testicular carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, some breast cancers), however, survival can be much longer. It has been stated, without strong corroboration, that patients with bone metastases tend to live longer than those with brain and meningeal metastases."

            "content": "In patients with a single parenchymatous metastasis (shown to be solitary by gadolinium-enhanced MRI), surgical extirpation may be undertaken provided that growth of the primary tumor and its systemic metastases is under good control and the metastasis is accessible to the surgeon and not located in a strategic motor or language area of the brain. Usually, excision is followed by radiation therapy to the entire brain. Patchell and coworkers have shown that survival and the interval between treatment and recurrence are longer and that the quality of life is better in patients treated in this way than in comparable patients treated with whole-brain radiation alone. Single or dual metastases from renal cell cancer, melanoma, and adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract lend themselves best to surgical removal, as implemented in the matched cohort study by Bindal and colleagues."

The several types of glial cells give rise to distinct primary CNS neoplasms.Astrocytoma. Astrocytoma is the most common primary CNS neoplasm. The term glioma often is used to refer to astrocyto-mas specifically, excluding other glial tumors. Astrocytomas are graded from I to IV. Grades I and II are referred to as low-grade astrocytoma or low grade glioma, grade III as anaplastic astro-cytoma, and grade IV as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Prog-nosis varies significantly between grades I/II, III, and IV, but not between I and II. Median survival is 8 years after diagnosis with a low-grade tumor, 2 to 3 years with an anaplastic astrocytoma, and roughly 1 year with a GBM. GBMs account for almost two-thirds of all astrocytomas, anaplastic astrocytomas account for two-thirds of the rest, and low-grade astrocytomas the remainder. Fig. 42-21 demonstrates the"
