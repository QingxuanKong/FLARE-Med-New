    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to evaluate the relationship between breastfeeding and the risk of type 1 diabetes. According to Document [4] (Title: Obstentrics_Williams), breastfeeding has been associated with decreased risk of child to develop asthma, allergies, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Document [16] (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson) also mentions that cumulative lactation of 12 to 23 months correlates with reduced risk of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes in the mother. However, there is no direct information on the relationship between breastfeeding and the risk of type 1 diabetes. Document [13] (Title: Immunology_Janeway) suggests that HLA genotypes (DQ alleles) confer susceptibility to type 1 diabetes, but there is no mention of breastfeeding as a protective factor. Document [24] (Title: Obstentrics_Williams) does not mention breastfeeding as a protective factor for type 1 diabetes. However, Document [5] (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson) states that mothers who breastfeed experience both short- and long-term health benefits, including a decreased risk of postpartum hemorrhages, more rapid uterine involution, and decreased postpartum depression. Although these benefits are not directly related to type 1 diabetes, they suggest a positive impact of breastfeeding on maternal health. Based on the available information, it is unclear whether breastfeeding can confer protection from type 1 diabetes. However, given the general benefits of breastfeeding, we can infer that breastfeeding is not contraindicated in women with type 1 diabetes. Therefore, the answer is not explicitly stated in the documents, but we can make an educated guess based on the available information.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

If both parents have type 2 diabetes, the risk of developing it approaches 40 percent. Both types of diabetes develop after a complex interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Type 1 diabetes is prompted by environmental triggers such as infection, diet, or toxins and heralded by the appearance of islet cell autoantibodies in genetically vulnerable individuals (Pociot, 2016; Rewers, 2016). Some but not all studies have shown a reduction in risk for type 1 or type 2 diabetes associated with breastfeeding (Owen, 2006; Rewers, 2016). Diabetes and pregnancy interact signiicantly such that maternal welfare can be seriously jeopardized. With the possible exception of diabetic retinopathy, however, the long-term course of diabetes is not afected by pregnancy."

From a psychological standpoint, the patient experiences greater control over his or her diabetes and often notes an improved sense of well-being, greater flexibility in the timing and content of meals, and the capability to alter insulin dosing with exercise. In addition, intensive diabetes management prior to and during pregnancy reduces the risk of fetal malformations and morbidity. Intensive diabetes management is encouraged in newly diagnosed patients with type 1 DM because it may prolong the period of C-peptide production, which may result in better glycemic control and a reduced risk of serious hypoglycemia. Although intensive management confers impressive benefits, it is also accompanied by significant personal and financial costs and is therefore not appropriate for all individuals."

Identification of an environmental trigger has been difficult because the event may precede the onset of DM by several years (Fig. 417-6). Putative environmental triggers include viruses (coxsackie, rubella, enteroviruses most prominently), bovine milk proteins, and nitrosourea compounds. There is increasing interest in the microbiome and type 1 diabetes (Chap. 86e). Prevention of Type 1 DM A number of interventions have prevented diabetes in animal models. None of these interventions have been successful in preventing type 1 DM in humans. For example, the Diabetes Prevention Trial\u2013Type 1 concluded that administering insulin (IV or PO) to individuals at high risk for developing type 1 DM did not prevent type 1 DM.

Type 1 dia betes is further subdivided into immune-mediated (type 1a) and idiopathic causes (type 1b). The immune form is the most com mon form of type 1 diabetes. Although most patients are younger than 30 years of age at the time of diagnosis, the onset can occur at any age. Type 1 diabetes is found in all ethnic groups, but the highest incidence is in people from northern Europe and from"

            "content": "-J. Whitridge Williams (1903) In 1903, little was known of many endocrine disorders. Still, endocrinopathies seem particularly closely related to pregnancy because of its gestational proclivity for prodigious hormone secretion. This is best illustrated by placental lactogen in diabetes, the most common endocrinopathy encountered in pregnancy (Chap. 57, p. 1097). Pregnancy is also interrelated with some endocrinopathies that are at least partially due to autoimmune dysregulation. Clinical manifestations of this result from complex interplay among genetic, environmental, and endogenous factors that activate the immune system against targeted cells within endocrine organs. An extraordinary example of these interactions comes from studies that implicate maternal organ engraftment by fetal cells that were transferred during pregnancy. These cells later provoke antibody production, tissue destruction, and autoimmune endocrinopathies."

The Fifth International Workshop Conference on Gestational Diabetes recommended that women diagnosed with gestational diabetes undergo postpartum evaluation with a 75-g OGTT (Metzger, 2007). These recommendations are shown in Table 57-14 along with the classification scheme of the ADA (20 17b). Eggleston and colleagues (2016) reviewed insurance claim data from 2000 to 2013 and found that only 24 percent of women with a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes underwent postpartum screening within a year, and less than half of those underwent a 75-g OGTT. he American College TABLE 57-14.

            "content": "Glucose intolerance developing during pregnancy is classified as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Insulin resistance is related to the metabolic changes of late pregnancy, and the increased insulin requirements may lead to IGT or diabetes. GDM occurs in ~7% (range 1\u201314%) of pregnancies in the United States; most women revert to normal glucose tolerance postpartum but have a substantial risk (35\u201360%) of developing DM in the next 10\u201320 years. The International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommend that diabetes diagnosed at the initial prenatal visit should be classified as \u201covert\u201d diabetes rather than GDM. With the rising rates of obesity, the number of women being diagnosed with GDM or overt diabetes is rising worldwide."

Breastfeeding has been recognized for some time as a mode of HIV transmission and is proscribed in developed countries in which adequate nutrition is otherwise available. Other viral infections do not contraindicate breastfeeding. For example, with maternal cytomegalovirus infection, both virus and antibodies are present in breast milk. And, although hepatitis B virus is excreted in milk, breastfeeding is not contraindicated if hepatitis B immune globulin is given to the newborns of afected mothers. Maternal hepatitis C infection is not a contraindication because breastfeeding has not been shown to transmit infection (Society for MaternalFetal"
