            "content": "Parkinson\u2019s disease generally follows a progressive course. Moreover, the benefits of levodopa therapy often diminish as the disease advances, and serious adverse effects may complicate longterm levodopa treatment. Nevertheless, dopaminergic therapy at a relatively early stage may be most effective in alleviating motor symptoms of parkinsonism and may also favorably affect the mortality rate due to the disease. Therefore, several strategies have evolved for optimizing dopaminergic therapy, as summarized in Figure 28\u20135. Symptomatic treatment of mild parkinsonism is probably best avoided until there is some degree of disability or functional limitation or until symptoms begin to impact the patient\u2019s lifestyle or cause significant social impairment."

These disorders include multisystem atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and diffuse Lewy body disease. The prognosis is worse than for Parkinson\u2019s disease, and the response to antiparkinsonian treatment may be limited. Treatment is symptomatic."

The drug has an interesting history that includes many early trials that failed to persuade neurologists of its effectiveness; Barbeau\u2019s paper on this historical subject may be consulted by the interested reader. Most patients tolerate the drug initially, experiencing few serious adverse effects and showing various degrees of improvement, sometimes dramatic, especially in hypokinesia and tremor after several days or sooner. However, the side effects and limitations of l-dopa become considerable as the drug therapy continues and the disease progresses, as discussed below."

The standard dosage is 1 mg/d. Rasagiline is also used as adjunctive therapy at a dosage of 0.5 or 1 mg/d to prolong the effects of carbidopa-levodopa in patients with advanced disease and response fluctuations. A large double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-start study (the ADAGIO trial) to evaluate whether it had neuroprotective benefit (ie, slowed the disease course) yielded unclear results: a daily dose of 1 mg met all the end points of the study and did seem to slow disease progression, but a 2-mg dose failed to do so.

However, dopamine agonists are less potent than l-dopa in managing the main features of Parkinson disease and, in higher doses and in older individuals, they produce undesirable motor and cognitive side effects (see further on). They are favored because they are associated with fewer dyskinetic motor complications, or at least, delay the need for l-dopa and its dyskinetic effects.

To correct the basic dopamine deficiency from a loss of nigral cells that underlies Parkinson disease, attempts were at first made to administer dopamine directly. However, dopamine as such cannot cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and therefore has no therapeutic effect. But its immediate precursor, L-dopa, does cross the blood\u2013barrier and is effective in decreasing the symptoms of Parkinson disease as well as of the above-described MPTP-induced parkinsonism.

In addition, both selegiline and rasagiline incorporate a propargyl ring within their molecular structure that provides antiapoptotic effects in laboratory models. The DATATOP study showed that selegiline significantly delayed the time until the emergence of disability, necessitating the introduction of levodopa, in untreated PD patients. However, it could not be determined whether this was due to a neuroprotective effect that slowed disease progression or a symptomatic effect that merely masked ongoing neurodegeneration. More recently, the ADAGIO study demonstrated that early treatment with rasagiline 1 mg/d, but not 2 mg/d,"

            "content": "A list of the major drugs and available dosage strengths is provided in Table 449-5. Despite the many therapeutic agents available for the treatment of PD, patients continue to experience disease progression with intolerable disability. A neuroprotective therapy that slows or stops disease progression remains the major unmet therapeutic need in PD. As noted above, trials of certain drugs (e.g., selegiline and rasagiline) have provided positive results consistent with a disease-modifying effect. However, it is not possible to determine if the positive results were due to neuroprotection with slowing of disease progression or confounding symptomatic effects that mask ongoing progression. CoQ10, a mitochondrial bioenhancer and antioxidant, attracted attention with a positive preliminary trial, but this was not replicated in larger double-blind studies."

This view has been validated in clinical practice in that one observes a beneficial effect on parkinsonian symptoms after the administration of anticholinergic agents. The use of drugs that enhance dopamine synthesis or its release, or that directly stimulate dopaminergic receptors in the striatum (e.g., pramipexole), represents another more direct method of treating Parkinson disease as outlined in Chap. 38."
