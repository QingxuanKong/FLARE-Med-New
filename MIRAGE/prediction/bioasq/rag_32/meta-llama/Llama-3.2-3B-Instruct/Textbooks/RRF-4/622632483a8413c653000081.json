The documents suggest that immune responses to fetal antigens can be detected during pregnancy, and that successful pregnancy requires some form of generalized suppression of maternal immune response. Research indicates that Treg cells and reproductive hormones play important roles in regulating immune responses during pregnancy. However, disruptions in these mechanisms may lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia. The documents also mention that preeclampsia is characterized by defective placentation, endothelial dysfunction, and increased levels of antiangiogenic factors, which are all related to immune regulation mechanisms. Furthermore, studies have shown that women with recurrent pregnancy loss have abnormal in vitro TH1 cellular immune responses, and that Treg cells may be altered in women with preeclampsia. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that disruption of immune regulation mechanisms is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preeclampsia (PE).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

            "content": "Although many mechanisms are aimed at avoiding maternal immune recognition of the implanting fetus, research in both humans and animals indicates that immune responses to fetal antigens can be detected (216\u2013218). Thus, the regulation of this response at the maternal\u2013fetal interface may be critical. The concept that successful pregnancy requires some form of generalized suppression of maternal immune response is supported by reports that failure to downregulate maternal responses to recall antigens, such as tetanus toxoid and in\ufb02uenza, is associated with poor pregnancy outcome among recurrent pregnancy loss patients (219). Treg cells appear important in this respect (see above). So too do reproductive hormones. Reproductive hormones have dramatic effects on peripheral cell\u2013mediated immunity, as demonstrated by well-documented and notable gender differences in immune responsiveness (220). The levels of these potentially immunosuppressive hormones are quite elevated in pregnant women."

In women destined to be preeclamptic, extravillous trophoblasts early in pregnancy express reduced amounts of immunosuppressive nonclassic human leukocyte antigen G (HLA G). Black women more commonly have the 1597 \ufffdC gene allele that further predisposes to preeclampsia (Loisel, 2013). hese changes may contribute to the defective placental vascularization in stage 1 of the preeclampsia syndrome. As discussed in Chapter 4 (p. 59), T-helper (h) lymphocytes during normal pregnancy are produced so that type 2 activity is increased in relation to type 1-so-called ype 2 bias (Redman, 2012, 2015a). h2 cells promote humoral immunity, whereas Th1 cells stimulate inlammatory cytoine secretion. Beginning in the early second trimester in women who develop preeclampsia, Th1 action is increased."

It has only been recently that the TH17 concept has been applied to pregnancy (202). In humans, a single study demonstrates an increase in the number of TH17 cells in the decidua and peripheral blood of women with otherwise unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss (203).

Certain viral organisms, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can directly infect the placenta and fetus (116,117). The resulting villitis and related tissue destruction may lead to pregnancy disruption. Another theoretic possibility warranting study is that infection-associated early pregnancy loss may result from immunologic activation in response to pathologic organisms. A large body of evidence supports the role of this mechanism in adverse events later in gestation, such as intrauterine growth restriction, premature rupture of membranes, and preterm birth (118,119). Alternatively, mechanisms that protect the fetus from autoimmune rejection also may protect virally infected placental cells from recognition and clearance.

Th1-type cytokine production-for example, interferon gamma and interleukin 2-appears to be somewhat suppressed, leading to a h2 bias in pregnancy. This bias afects the ability to rapidly eliminate certain intracellular pathogens during pregnancy, although the clinical implications of this suppression are unknown (Kourtis, 2014; Svensson-Arvelund, 2014). Importantly, the h2 humoral immune response remains intact. It also appears that human leukocyte antigen (HA)-C expressed by extravillous trophoblasts elicits responses from decidual natural killer (dNK) and decidual CD8+ T cells (Crespo, 2017)."

Myriad other platelet alterations are attributed to the preeclampsia syndrome. hese were reviewed by Kenny and coworkers (2015) and include platelet activation with increased .-degranulation producing \ufffd-thromboglobulin, factor 4, and enhanced clearance. Paradoxically, in most studies, in vitro platelet aggregation is reduced compared with the normal increase that is characteristic of pregnancy. This likely is due to platelet \"exhaustion\" following in vivo activation. Although the cause is unknown, immunological processes or simply platelet deposition at sites of endothelial damage may be implicated. Levels of platelet-bound and circulating platelet-bindable immunoglobulins are elevated, which suggests platelet surface alterations."
