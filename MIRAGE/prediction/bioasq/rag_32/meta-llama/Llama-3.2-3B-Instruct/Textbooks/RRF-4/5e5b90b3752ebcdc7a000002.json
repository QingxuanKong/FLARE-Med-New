    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the process of exosome formation and function in cells, as well as the characteristics of APP (amyloid precursor protein) and its relationship to exosomes. APP is a type of protein that is cleaved into A\\u00b2 (amyloid beta) peptides, which are known to accumulate in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Exosomes are small vesicles that are secreted by cells and can carry proteins, lipids, and other molecules from the cell of origin. They play a role in intercellular communication and can transport molecules between cells. Given that APP is a protein that is processed in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, which are organelles involved in exosome formation, it is possible that APP could be packaged into exosomes. However, the specific question of whether brain-derived exosomes can carry APP molecules requires consideration of the following: APP is primarily localized to the cell surface and is not typically found in exosomes. Exosomes are formed from the endosomal pathway, and APP is not typically associated with endosomes. However, it is possible that APP could be packaged into exosomes if it is transported from the cell surface to the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus before exosome formation. Furthermore, research has shown that APP can be secreted from cells through a process called ectodomain shedding, which could potentially involve the formation of exosomes. Given the complexity of APP processing and the mechanisms of exosome formation, it is unclear whether brain-derived exosomes can carry APP molecules. However, based on the available information, the most likely answer is that brain-derived exosomes may not carry APP molecules.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Adults with trisomy 21 (Down\u2019s syndrome) consistently develop the typical neuropathologic hallmarks of AD if they survive beyond age 40 years, and many develop a progressive dementia superimposed on their baseline mental retardation. The extra dose of the APP gene on chromosome 21 is the initiating cause of AD in adult Down\u2019s syndrome and results in excess cerebral amyloid production. Supporting this hypothesis, some families with early age-of-onset familial AD (FAD) have point mutations in APP.

Furthermore, the ratio of A\u03b242 to A\u03b240 is increased in Down syndrome. Another suggestive connection has been the finding that there are genetic defects in the genes encoding APP and in a pair of endosomal proteins termed presenilin 1 and 2 in some familial forms of Alzheimer disease.

As shown schematically in Fig. 38-2, the A\u03b2 protein is cleaved from APP by the action of proteases termed \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 secretase. One current hypothesis focuses on the manner in which APP is cleaved by these enzymes to give rise to different-length residues of A\u03b2. During normal cellular metabolism, APP is cleaved by either \u03b1 or \u03b2 secretase. The products of this reaction are then cleaved by the \u03b3-secretase isoform of the enzyme. The sequential cleavage by \u03b1 and then \u03b3 produces tiny fragments that are not toxic to neurons. However, cleavage by \u03b2 and then \u03b3 results in a 40-amino-acid product, A\u03b240, and a longer 42-amino-acid form.

What other functions might signal sequences have that could account for their evolutionary sequence conservation? how are polyribosomes on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane arranged so that the next initiating ribosome will find an unoccupied translocator? Why does the signal-recognition particle have an indispensable rna subunit? Which statements are true? Explain why or why not."

RNA is fed into one end of the central pore and is degraded by RNAses that associate with the other end. Nine different protein subunits (each represented by a different color) make up this large ring structure. Eukaryotic cells have both a nuclear exosome and a cytoplasmic exosome; both forms include the core exosome shown here and additional subunits (including specialized RNAses) that differentiate the two forms. The nuclear exosome degrades aberrant RNAs before they are exported to the cytosol. It also processes certain types of RNA (for example, the ribosomal RNAs) to produce their final form. The cytoplasmic form of the exosome is responsible for degrading mRNAs in the cytosol, and is thus crucial in determining the lifetime of each mRNA molecule. (PDB code: 2NN6.)"

This drawing shows the blood\u2013brain barrier, which consists of endothelial cells joined together by elaborate, complex tight junctions, endothelial basal lamina, and the end foot processes of astrocytes. responsible for buffering the concentration of K in the brain extracellular fluid (page 369). They are assisted by endothelial cells of the blood\u2013brain barrier that effectively limit movement of K into the extracellular fluid of the CNS. Substances that do cross the capillary wall are actively transported by specific receptor-mediated endocytosis. For instance, glucose (which the neuron depends on almost exclusively for energy), amino acids, nucleosides, and vitamins are actively transported by specific transmembrane carrier proteins. The permeability of the blood\u2013brain barrier to these macromolecules is attributable to the level of expression of specific carrier proteins on the endothelial cell surface."

            "content": "In normal humans, the quality control mechanisms governing proteins gradually decline with age, occasionally permitting normal proteins to form pathological aggregates. The protein aggregates may be released from dead cells and accumulate as amyloid in the extracellular matrix. In extreme cases, the accumulation of such amyloid fibrils in the cell interior can kill the cells and damage tissues. Because the brain is composed of a highly organized collection of nerve cells that cannot regenerate, the brain is especially vulnerable to this sort of cumulative damage. Thus, although amyloid fibrils may form in different tissues, and are known to cause pathologies in several sites in the body, the most severe amyloid pathologies are neurodegenerative diseases. For example, the abnormal formation of highly stable amyloid fibrils is thought to play a central causative role in both Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases."
