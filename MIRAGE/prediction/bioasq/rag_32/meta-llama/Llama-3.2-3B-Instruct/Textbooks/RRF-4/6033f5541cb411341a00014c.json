Summary of the reactions of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis Of the 11 reactions required to convert pyruvate to free glucose, 7 are catalyzed by reversible glycolytic enzymes (Fig. 10.7).

In gluconeogenesis, the equilibria of the reversible glycolytic reactions are pushed toward glucose synthesis as a result of the essentially irreversible formation of PEP, fructose 6-phosphate, and glucose by the gluconeogenic enzymes.

First, insulin activates PDH as just discussed, thereby diverting pyruvate away from the PC reaction. Additionally, PC is allosterically activated by high levels of intramitochondrial acetyl CoA. Insulin keeps intramitochondrial levels of acetyl CoA low by activation of cytosolic DNL, which promotes removal of acetyl CoA via citrate from the mitochondria. Another key mechanism is to prevent \u03b2-oxidation of FFAs within the mitochondria, which generates high levels of acetyl CoA.

            "content": "B. Citrate synthesis The irreversible condensation of acetyl CoA and OAA to form citrate (a tricarboxylic acid) is catalyzed by citrate synthase, the initiating enzyme of the TCA cycle (Fig. 9.4). This aldol condensation has a highly negative change in standard free energy ([\u2206G0] see p. 70), which strongly favors citrate formation. The enzyme is inhibited by citrate (product inhibition). Substrate availability is another means of regulation for citrate synthase. The binding of OAA greatly increases the enzyme\u2019s affinity for acetyl CoA. [Note: Citrate, in addition to being an intermediate in the TCA cycle, is a source of acetyl CoA for the cytosolic synthesis of fatty acids (see p. 183) and cholesterol (see p. 220). Citrate also inhibits phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis (see p. 99), and activates acetyl CoA carboxylase (the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid synthesis, see p. 183).] C.

Increased gluconeogenesis: The synthesis of glucose and its release into the circulation are vital hepatic functions during short-and long-term fasting (see Fig. 24.12, ). The carbon skeletons for gluconeogenesis are derived primarily from glucogenic amino acids and lactate from muscle and glycerol from adipose tissue. Gluconeogenesis, favored by activation of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (because of decreased availability of its inhibitor fructose 2,6-bisphosphate; see p. 121) and by induction of PEPCK by glucagon (see p. 122), begins 4\u20136 hours after the last meal and becomes fully active as stores of liver glycogen are depleted (see Fig. 24.11). [Note: The decrease in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate simultaneously inhibits glycolysis at PFK-1 (see p. 99).]"

This decreases PEP conversion to pyruvate, which has the effect of diverting PEP to gluconeogenesis (Fig. 10.8). the enzyme. [Note: Only the hepatic isozyme is subject to covalent regulation.] AMP. 3. Induction of enzyme synthesis: Glucagon increases transcription of the gene for PEPCK via the transcription factor cAMP response element\u2013 binding (CREB) protein, thereby increasing the availability of this enzyme as levels of its substrate rise during fasting. [Note: Cortisol (a glucocorticoid) also increases expression of the gene, whereas insulin decreases expression.] B. Substrate availability"

Correct answer = B. During a 2-day fast, glycogen stores are depleted, and gluconeogenesis maintains blood glucose. This is an energy-requiring (endergonic) pathway (both ATP and GTP get hydrolyzed) that occurs primarily in the liver, with the kidneys becoming major glucose producers in prolonged fasting. Gluconeogenesis uses both mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes and is stimulated by a fall in the insulin/glucagon ratio. Fatty acid degradation yields acetyl coenzyme A (CoA), which cannot be converted to glucose. This is because there is no net gain of carbons from acetyl CoA in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is physiologically irreversible. It is the carbon skeletons of most amino acids that are glucogenic."

Regulation by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate: Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase is inhibited by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, an allosteric effector whose concentration is influenced by the insulin/glucagon ratio. When glucagon is high, the effector is not made by hepatic PFK-2 (see p. 99), and thus, the phosphatase is active (Fig. 10.5). [Note: The signals that inhibit (low energy, high fructose 2,6-bisphosphate) or activate (high energy, low fructose 2,6-bisphosphate) gluconeogenesis have the opposite effect on glycolysis, providing reciprocal control of the pathways that synthesize and oxidize glucose (see p. 100).] E.
