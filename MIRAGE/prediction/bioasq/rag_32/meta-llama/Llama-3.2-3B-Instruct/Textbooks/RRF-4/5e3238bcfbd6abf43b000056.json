Document 17 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) mentions that tinea capitis occurs most commonly in children 3\u20137 years old, but it does not directly mention a link between tinea capitis and brain tumors. However, Document 8 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) discusses the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer and mentions that external radiation increases the risk of benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Document 18 (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) also discusses the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer and mentions that radiation exposure increases the risk of thyroid cancer. However, tinea capitis is not directly related to thyroid cancer. Therefore, we need to look for a connection between radiation therapy and brain tumors. Document 9 (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson) mentions that radiation therapy can increase the risk of secondary cancers, including leukemia and solid tumors, in individuals who received radiation therapy for cancers such as Hodgkin's disease. However, this is not directly related to tinea capitis. Document 16 (Title: Pathology_Robbins) discusses the effects of radiation on DNA damage and mentions that tissue hypoxia can reduce the extent of damage, but it does not specifically mention a link between radiation therapy for tinea capitis and brain tumors. Document 26 (Title: Neurology_Adams) discusses the symptoms of delayed radiation injury, which can occur months to years after radiation therapy, but it does not specifically mention a link between radiation therapy for tinea capitis and brain tumors.

Tumors that affect the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes are more commonly associated with seizures than are occipital lesions.

Three syndromes of radiation damage have been delineated: acute, early delayed, and late delayed, although these syndromes often blend into one another. The acute reaction may begin during the latter part of a series of fractionated treatments or soon thereafter. There may be a seizure, a transitory worsening of the tumor symptoms, or signs of increased intracranial pressure. Although the condition has been attributed to brain edema, this is not always visible on MRI and its basis is unknown. The symptoms subside in days to weeks. Corticosteroids are usually administered, but with the exception of cases with demonstrable edema, their effect is uncertain. A novel syndrome of migraine-like headache and focal neurologic deficits, usually developing many years after cranial radiation, is described in more detail below."

Radiation exposure increases the risk of benign and malignant thyroid nodules, is associated with multicentric cancers, and shifts the incidence of thyroid cancer to an earlier age group. Radiation from nuclear fallout also increases the risk of thyroid cancer. Children seem more predisposed to the effects of radiation than adults.

            "content": "Treatment usually involves transcranial or transsphenoidal surgical resection followed by postoperative radiation of residual tumor. Surgery alone is curative in less than half of patients because of recurrences due to adherence to vital structures or because of small tumor deposits in the hypothalamus or brain parenchyma. The goal of surgery is to remove as much tumor as possible without risking complications associated with efforts to remove firmly adherent or inaccessible tissue. In the absence of radiotherapy, about 75% of craniopharyngiomas recur, and 10-year survival is less than 50%. In patients with incomplete resection, radiotherapy improves 10-year survival to 70\u201390% but is associated with increased risk of secondary malignancies. Most patients require lifelong pituitary hormone replacement."

            "content": "For clinicians, several generalizations create a helpful framework for understanding these diseases. First, many types of tumor, both primary and secondary, occur in the cranial cavity and spinal canal but certain ones are much more frequent than others and are prone to occur in particular age groups. For example, secondary metastatic deposits are more common than primary brain tumors in adults and the opposite is true in children. Furthermore, certain cancers (breast, lung, melanoma, renal cell cancer) display a tendency to metastasize to nervous tissue and many others rarely do so. Second, some primary intracranial and spinal tumors, such as craniopharyngioma, meningioma, and schwannoma, have a disposition to grow in particular parts of the cranial cavity, thereby producing characteristic neurologic syndromes. Third, the presence of a state of immunosuppression such as AIDS or cancer chemotherapy, special inherited disorders such as neurofibromatosis, and exposure to radiation each"
