The major effect of corticosteroids is to switch off the transcription of multiple activated genes that encode inflammatory proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and inflammatory enzymes. This effect involves several mechanisms, including inhibition of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, but an important mechanism is recruitment of HDAC2 to the inflammatory gene complex, which reverses the histone acetylation associated with increased gene transcrip tion. Corticosteroids also activate anti-inflammatory genes, such as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase-1, and increase the expression of \u03b22-receptors. Most of the metabolic and endocrine side effects of corticosteroids are also mediated through transcriptional activation."

First, Notch signaling induces the expression of two transcription factors, T-cell factor-1 (TCF1) and GATA3, each of which is required for T-cell development. Together, TCF1 and GATA3 initiate expression of several T-lineage-specific genes, such as those encoding components of the CD3 complex, as well as Rag1, a gene required for T-cell receptor and B-cell receptor gene rearrangements (see Fig. 8.18). However, TCF1 and GATA3 are not sufficient to induce the entire program of T-cell-specific gene expression. A third transcription factor, Bcl11b, is required to induce T-lineage commitment by restricting progenitor cells from adopting alternative fates; this final phase of T-cell commitment is a necessary prerequisite for activating the complete T-cell gene expression program."

Histone acetylases are components of coactivator complexes recruited to promoter/enhancer regions by sequence-specific transcription factors during the activation of genes (Fig. 102e-4). Histone deacetylases (HDACs; at least 17 are encoded in the human genome) are recruited to genes by transcriptional repressors and prevent the initiation of gene transcription. Methylated cytosine residues in promoter regions become associated with methyl cytosine\u2013binding proteins that recruit protein complexes with HDAC activity.

The initiation of DNA replication (S phase) requires the activity of cyclin E/CDK2 complexes, and expression of cyclin E is dependent on the E2F family of transcription factors. Early in G1, RB is in its hypophosphorylated active form, and it binds to and inhibits the E2F family of transcription factors, preventing transcription of cyclin E. Hypophosphorylated RB blocks E2F-mediated transcription in at least two ways ( Fig. 6.20 ). First, it sequesters E2F, preventing it from interacting with other transcriptional activators. Second, RB recruits chromatin remodeling proteins, such as histone deacetylases and histone methyltransferases, which bind to the promoters of E2F-responsive genes such as cyclin E. These enzymes modify chromatin at the promoters to make DNA insensitive to transcription factors."

In some cases, as soon as the transcription regulator dissociates from DNA, the chromatin modifications are rapidly reversed, restoring the gene to its pre-activated state. This rapid reversal is especially important for genes that the cell must quickly switch on and off in response to external signals. In other cases, the altered chromatin structure persists, even after the transcription regulator that directed its establishment has dissociated from DNA. In principle, this memory can extend into the next cell generation because, as discussed in Chapter 4, chromatin structure can be self-renewing (see Figure 4\u201344). The fact that different histone modifications persist for different times provides the cell with a mechanism that makes possible both longerand shorter-term memory of gene expression patterns."

            "content": "We begin our discussion by describing how transcription regulators recognize cis-regulatory sequences. the Sequence of nucleotides in the DnA Double helix Can Be read by proteins As discussed in Chapter 4, the DNA in a chromosome consists of a very long double helix that has both a major and a minor groove (Figure 7\u20136). Transcription regulators must recognize short, specific cis-regulatory sequences within Figure 7\u20135 Six steps at which eukaryotic gene expression can be controlled. Controls that operate at steps 1 through 5 are discussed in this chapter. Step 6, the regulation of protein activity, occurs largely through covalent post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitylation (see table 3\u20133, p. 165). Step 6 was introduced in Chapter 3 and is subsequently discussed in many chapters throughout the book."

            "content": "The regulation of one gene\u2019s expression by another is more complicated than a single arrow connecting them, and a complete understanding of this regulation requires that we tease apart the underlying biochemical processes. Figure 8\u201372A sketches some of the biochemical steps in the activation of gene expression by a transcription activator. A gene encoding the activator, designated as gene A, will produce its product, protein A, via an RNA intermediate. This protein A will then bind to pX, the regulatory promoter of gene X, to form the complex A:pX. Once the A:pX complex forms, it stimulates the production of an RNA transcript that is subsequently translated to produce protein X."

            "content": "Cells contain dozens of different ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes that are specialized for different roles. Most are large protein complexes that can contain 10 or more subunits, some of which bind to specific modifications on histones (see Figure 4\u201326C). The activity of these complexes is carefully controlled by the cell. As genes are turned on and off, chromatin remodeling complexes are brought to specific regions of DNA where they act locally to influence chromatin structure (discussed in Chapter 7; see also Figure 4\u201340, below)."
