Sunitinib is a small molecule inhibitor that targets multiple kinases, including PDGFR-\u03b1 and PDGFR-\u03b2, VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, VEGFR3, and c-kit. It is approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell cancer and for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors after disease progression on or with intolerance to imatinib.\\n\\nSunitinib works by inhibiting the activity of these kinases, which are involved in various cellular processes such as angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and survival. By inhibiting these kinases, sunitinib can potentially prevent the growth and spread of cancer cells.\\n\\nHowever, the question asks about dasatinib, not sunitinib. Dasatinib is also a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, but it targets a different set of kinases, including BCR-ABL, src family, KIT, EPHA2, and PDGFR-\u03b2. It is approved for the treatment of certain types of cancer, including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).\\n\\nBased on the information provided, there is no mention of dasatinib promoting oncogenesis. In fact, dasatinib is used to treat cancers, including CML and GIST, which are characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. Therefore, dasatinib is actually used to inhibit oncogenesis, not promote it.\\n\\nSo, the correct answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

This success story has fueled efforts to identify small-molecule inhibitors for other oncogenic protein kinases and to use them to attack the appropriate cancer cells. Increasing numbers are being developed.

In such cases, targeted inhibition of the pathway can lead to specific killing of the cancer cells.

Other inhibitors of VEGFR approved for the treatment of RCC include axitinib and pazopanib.

This situation (Fig. 102e-3) is created when a tumor cell develops an activating mutation in an oncogene that becomes a dominant pathway for survival and growth with reduced contributions from other pathways, even when there may be abnormalities in those pathways. This dependency on a single pathway creates a cell that is vulnerable to inhibitors of that oncogene pathway. For example, cells harboring mutations in BRAF are very sensitive to MEK inhibitors that inhibit downstream signaling in the BRAF pathway."

This resistance is usually associated with secondary mutations in the part of the Bcr-Abl gene that encodes the kinase domain, disrupting the ability of imatinib to bind to Bcr-Abl kinase. Second-generation inhibitors that function effectively against a whole range of imatinib-resistant mutants have now been developed.

Cell cycle regulators mediate progression through the cell cycle (e.g., cyclin and cyclin-dependent kinase). i. Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) form a complex which phosphorylates proteins that drive the cell through the cell cycle. ii. For example, the cyclinD/CDK4 complex phosphorylates the retinoblastoma protein, which promotes progression through the G/ S checkpoint. III. TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENES A. Regulate cell growth and, hence, decrease (\"suppress\") the risk of tumor formation; p53 and Rb (retinoblastoma) are classic examples. B. p53 regulates progression of the cell cycle from G to S phase. Table 3.3: Important Oncogenes and Associated Tumors PDGFB Platelet-derived growth factor Overexpression, autocrine loop Astrocytoma"

            "content": "tumor stem cells, reside within a tumor mass. They retain the ability to undergo repeated cycles of proliferation as well as to migrate to distant sites in the body to colonize various organs in the process called metastasis. Such tumor stem cells thus can express clonogenic (colony-forming) capability, and they are characterized by chromosome abnormalities reflecting their genetic instability, which leads to progressive selection of subclones that can survive more readily in the multicellular environment of the host. This genetic instability also allows them to become resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The invasive and metastatic processes as well as a series of metabolic abnormalities associated with the cancer result in tumor-related symptoms and eventual death of the patient unless the neoplasm can be eradicated with treatment."

            "content": "Nonresponsiveness to external growth-inhibiting signals: Cancer cells have lost responsiveness to signals normally present to stop proliferating when they have overgrown the niche normally occupied by the organ from which they are derived. We know very little about this mechanism of growth regulation. Increased angiogenesis: Due to increased gene expression of proangiogenic factors (VEGF, FGF, IL-8) by tumor or stromal cells, or loss of negative regulators (endostatin, tumstatin, thrombospondin). Invasion: Loss of cell-cell contacts (gap junctions, cadherins) and increased production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Often takes the form of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), with anchored epithelial cells becoming more like motile fibroblasts. Metastasis: Spread of tumor cells to lymph nodes or distant tissue sites. Limited by the ability of tumor cells to survive in a foreign environment."

These driver mutations affect pathways that promote cell proliferation and inhibit normal pathways of apoptosis in response to DNA repair (see below). The altered melanocytes accumulate DNA damage, and selection occurs for all the attributes that constitute the malignant phenotype: invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis."
