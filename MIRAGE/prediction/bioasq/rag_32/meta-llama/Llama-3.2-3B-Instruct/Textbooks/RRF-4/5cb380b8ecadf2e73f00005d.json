Deducing the three-dimensional structure of a large molecule from the diffraction pattern of its crystal is a complex task and was not achieved for a protein molecule until 1960. But in recent years x-ray diffraction analysis has become increasingly automated, and now the slowest step is likely to be the generation of suitable protein crystals. This step requires large amounts of very pure protein and often involves years of trial and error to discover the proper crystallization conditions; the pace has greatly accelerated with the use of recombinant DNA techniques to produce pure proteins and robotic techniques to test large numbers of crystallization conditions."

Second, an attached phosphate group can form part of a structure that the binding sites of other proteins recognize. As previously discussed, the SH2 domain binds to a short peptide sequence containing a phosphorylated tyrosine side chain (see Figure 3\u201340B). More than ten other common domains provide binding sites for attaching their protein to phosphorylated peptides in other protein molecules, each recognizing a phosphorylated amino acid side chain in a different protein context. Third, the addition of a phosphate group can mask a binding site that otherwise holds two proteins together, and thereby disrupt protein\u2013protein interactions. As a result, protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation very often drive the regulated assembly and disassembly of protein complexes (see, for example, Figure 15\u201311)."

Thus, an ability to reliably predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence would improve our ability to infer protein function from the sequence information in genomic databases. In recent years, major progress has been made in predicting the precise structure of a protein. These predictions are based, in part, on our knowledge of the thousands of protein structures that have already been determined by x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy and, in part, on computations using our knowledge of the physical forces acting on the atoms. However, it remains a substantial and important challenge to predict the structures of proteins that are large or have multiple domains, or to predict structures at the very high levels of resolution"

Such multidomain proteins are believed to have originated from the accidental joining of the DNA sequences that encode each domain, creating a new gene. In an evolutionary process called domain shuffling, many large proteins have evolved through the joining of preexisting domains in new combinations (Figure 3\u201314). Novel binding surfaces have often been created at the juxtaposition of domains, and many of the functional sites where proteins bind to small molecules are found to be located there. A subset of protein domains has been especially mobile during evolution; these seem to have particularly versatile structures and are sometimes referred to as protein modules.

Figure 3\u201341 Three ways in which two proteins can bind to each other. Only the interacting parts of the two proteins are shown. (A) A rigid surface on one protein can bind to an extended loop of polypeptide chain (a \u201cstring\u201d) on a second protein. (B) Two \u03b1 helices can bind together to form a coiled-coil. (C) Two complementary rigid surfaces often link two proteins together. Binding interactions can also involve the pairing of \u03b2 strands (see, for example, Figure 3\u201318)."

For technical reasons, the structure of small proteins of about 20,000 daltons or less can be most readily determined by NMR spectroscopy. Resolution decreases as the size of a macromolecule increases. But recent technical advances have now pushed the limit to about 100,000 daltons, thereby making the majority of proteins accessible for structural analysis by NMR. Because NMR studies are performed in solution, this method also offers a convenient means of monitoring changes in protein structure, for example during protein folding or when the protein binds to another molecule. NMR is also used widely to investigate molecules other than proteins and is valuable, for example, as a method to determine the three-dimensional structures of RNA molecules and the complex carbohydrate side chains of glycoproteins."

            "content": "A second feature of these protein domains that explains their utility is the ease with which they can be integrated into other proteins. Two of the three domains illustrated in Figure 3\u201315 have their Nand C-terminal ends at opposite poles of the domain. When the DNA encoding such a domain undergoes tandem duplication, which is not unusual in the evolution of genomes (discussed in Chapter 4), the duplicated domains with this \u201cin-line\u201d arrangement can be readily linked in series to form extended structures\u2014either with themselves or with other in-line domains (Figure 3\u201316). Stiff extended structures composed of a series of domains are especially common in extracellular matrix molecules and in the extracellular portions of cell-surface receptor proteins. Other frequently used domains, including the kringle domain illustrated in Figure 3\u201315 and the SH2 domain, are of a \u201cplug-in\u201d type, with their Nand C-termini close together. After genomic rearrangements, such domains are usually"
