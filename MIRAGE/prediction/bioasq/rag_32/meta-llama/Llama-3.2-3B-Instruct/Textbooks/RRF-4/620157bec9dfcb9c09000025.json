The wide diversity of these transmembrane proteins permits subtle differentiation of thousands of different odorant molecules, as delineated by Young and Trask and the genetic basis for which Buck and Axel were awarded a Nobel Prize. This specificity for molecules is encoded neuroanatomically. Different odorant molecules activate specific olfactory receptors. Each olfactory neuron expresses only one allele of one receptor gene. Moreover, each olfactory glomerulus receives inputs from neurons expressing only one type of odorant receptor. In this way, each of the glomeruli is attuned to a distinct type of odorant stimulus. Presumably, this encoding is preserved in the olfactory cortex."

Each olfactory receptor neuron produces only one of these receptors; the neuron responds to a specific set of odorants by means of the specific receptor it displays, and each odorant activates its own characteristic set of olfactory receptor neurons. The same receptor also helps direct the elongating axon of each developing olfactory neuron to the specific target neurons that it will connect to in the brain. A different set of GPCRs acts in a similar way in some vertebrates to mediate responses to pheromones, chemical signals detected in a different part of the nose that are used in communication between members of the same species.
