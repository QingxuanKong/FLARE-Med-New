    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if Axitinib prolongs survival of pancreatic cancer patients, we need to consider the available information. Axitinib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets KIT, FDGFR\u03b2, VEGFR1/2/3. According to the provided documents, Axitinib is FDA-approved for the treatment of certain cancers, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The documents do not specifically mention Axitinib for pancreatic cancer treatment. However, we can look at the information about other targeted therapies for pancreatic cancer, such as Sunitinib, which is approved for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNET) and pancreatic cancer. Sunitinib has shown antitumor activity against pancreatic cancer, but the information is not as detailed as for Axitinib. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot conclude that Axitinib prolongs survival of pancreatic cancer patients. The correct answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

If a mass is not visualized, use ERCP or endoscopic ultrasound for better visualization. CA-19-9 is often elevated, but this measure lacks sensitivity and specificity. Most patients present with metastatic disease, and treatment is palliative. Some 10\u201320% of pancreatic head tumors have no evidence of metastasis or major vessel involvement and may be resected using the Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy). Chemotherapy with 5-FU and gemcitabine may improve short-term survival, but long-term prognosis is poor (5\u201310% five-year survival).

Patients with nonserous papillary primary peritoneal carcinomatosis can have a large differential diagnosis, which is mainly of gastrointestinal profile and includes gastric, appendiceal, colon, and pancreaticobiliary profiles. Traditionally, platinum-based combination chemotherapy regimens have been used to treat CUP. Several broadly used regimens have been studied in the last two decades; these include paclitaxelcarboplatin, gemcitabine-cisplatin, gemcitabine-oxaliplatin, and irinotecan and fluoropyrimidine-based therapies. These chemotherapeutic agents used as empiric regimens have shown a response rate of 25\u201340%, and their use obtains median survival times of 6\u201313 months."

            "content": "main foundation of cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. Recent clinical studies have shown that in tumors with wild-type KRAS and NRAS, FOLFOX/FOLFIRI regimens in combination with the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab or with the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab or panitumumab result in significantly improved clinical efficacy with no worsening of the toxicities normally observed with chemotherapy. In order for patients to derive maximal benefit, they should be treated with each of these active agents in a continuum of care approach. Regorafenib and TAS102 are approved for the chemo-refractory disease setting, but unfortunately, each drug is associated with significant toxicities and only limited clinical efficacy with very low overall response rates; median progression-free survival is about 2-months. Given all of the available treatment regimens, median overall survival for metastatic CRC is now in the 28to 30-month range and, in some cases, approaches or even exceeds 3 years."

A reasonable consideration in a disease with high rates of distant metastases is to begin with adjuvant chemotherapy, followed by radiation therapy in patients who do not progress, particularly in patients where there may be increased concern about local recurrence such as in patients with close margins.Remarkable results in adjuvant therapy were reported by the Virginia Mason Clinic with combination 5-FU, cisplatinum, interferon-\u3008, and external beam radiation.367 Although the toxic-ity was high (42% hospitalized for GI toxicity), the promising results prompted larger confirmatory studies. Unfortunately, one such study was stopped due to toxicity, and this protocol has not been widely adopted. More recent results with FOLFIRINOX in the setting of metastatic disease have encouraged clinical tri-als using this regimen in the"

External-beam radiotherapy is controversial but can be consid-ered for patients with resected T4 disease and for patients with unresectable residual or recurrent tumor and symptomatic bony metastases. Liver metastases tend to be multiple and are typi-cally not amenable to resection, percutaneous ethanol ablation, or radiofrequency ablation. However, chemoembolization may be helpful in this setting. There is no effective chemotherapy regimen.Various targeted therapies directed against the RET kinase have been investigated for the treatment of MTC.43 Many of these also inhibit VEGF receptor due to their close structural similarities. Sorafenib, sunitinib, lenvatinib, and cabozantinib are some such multikinase inhibitors, whereas axitinib and pazopanib act only on VEGFR. Vandetanib inhibits both targets and is also an EGF receptor inhibitor, and cabozantinib targets c-MET in addition to RET and VEGF receptor. Both drugs are currently approved by the FDA and EMA for the treatment"
