From Document [0], we know that Tocilizumab binds to soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors, and inhibits the IL-6-mediated signaling via these receptors. This suggests that Tocilizumab is used to block or antagonize the IL-6 receptor. Additionally, from Document [2], we can see that Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the membrane and soluble forms of the IL-6 receptor, which further supports the idea that it blocks the IL-6 receptor.

Mechanism of Action: Tocilizumab, a newer biologic humanized antibody, binds to soluble and membrane-bound IL-6 receptors, and inhibits the IL-6-mediated signaling via these receptors. IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by different cell types including T cells, B cells, monocytes, fibroblasts, and synovial and endothelial cells. IL-6 is involved in a variety of physiologic processes such as T-cell activation, hepatic acute-phase protein synthesis, and stimulation of the inflammatory processes involved in diseases such as RA and systemic sclerosis (SSc). In a phase 4 superiority study, tocilizumab monotherapy was superior to adalimumab monotherapy for reduction of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis in patients with incomplete response to MTX. 2."

Siltuximab is a Mab that binds to and blocks IL-6 from binding to its cellular receptor.

Tocilizumab is recombinant humanized IgG1 that binds to soluble and membrane-associated IL-6 receptors. It inhibits IL-6-mediated signaling on lymphocytes, suppressing inflammatory processes. Similar to anti-TNF-\u03b1 Mabs, patients receiving tocilizumab should be closely monitored for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and other invasive bacterial, fungal, and viral infections."

IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of RA, with detrimental effects on both joint inflammation and damage. IL-6 binding to its receptor activates intracellular signaling pathways that affect the acute-phase response, cytokine production, and osteoclast activation. Clinical trials attest to the clinical efficacy of tocilizumab therapy for RA, both as monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate and other DMARDs. Tocilizumab has been associated with an increased risk of infection, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia; however, the hematologic abnormalities appear to be reversible upon stopping the drug. In addition, this agent has been shown to increase LDL cholesterol; however, it is not known as yet if this effect on lipid levels increases the risk for development of atherosclerotic disease."

IL-6 can suppress several CYP450 isoenzymes; thus, inhibiting IL-6 may restore CYP450 activities to higher levels. This may be clinically relevant for drugs that are CYP450 substrates and have a narrow therapeutic window (eg, cyclosporine or warfarin), and dosage adjustment of these medications may be needed. Tocilizumab can be used in combination with nonbiologic DMARDs or as monotherapy. In the United States the recommended starting dose for RA is 4 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks followed by an increase to 8 mg/kg (not exceeding 800 mg/infusion) dependent on clinical response."

Anti-inflammatory therapy either can attempt to eliminate an autoimmune response altogether, as with immunosuppressive drugs or depleting antibodies, or it can try to reduce the tissue injury caused by the immune response. This second category of treatment is called immunomodulatory therapy, and is illustrated by the use of conventional anti-inflammatory agents such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or low-dose corticosteroids. A newer avenue of immunomodulatory therapy using biologics is illustrated by several FDA-approved antibodies that block the activity of powerful pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-6."

            "content": "1. Mechanism of Action: Rilonacept is the ligand-binding domain of the IL-1 receptor. It binds mainly to IL-1\u03b2 and binds with lower affinity to IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1RA. Rilonacept neutralizes IL-1\u03b2 and prevents its attachment to IL-1 receptors. 2. Pharmacokinetics: The subcutaneous dose of rilonacept for CAPS is age-dependent. In patients 12\u201317 years of age, 4.4 mg/kg (maximum of 320 mg) is the loading dose, with a maintenance dose of 2.2 mg/kg (maximum of 160 mg) weekly. Those 18 years and older receive 320 mg as a loading dose and 160 mg weekly thereafter. The steady-state plasma concentration is reached after 6 weeks. 3. Indications: Rilonacept is approved to treat CAPS subtypes: familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome and Muckle-Wells syndrome in patients 12 years or older. Rilonacept is also used to treat gout (see below). Adverse Effects of Interleukin-1 Inhibitors"

            "content": "IL-6 plays important roles in the systemic compartment. Released by many different cell types, IL-6 is an important stimulus to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, is the major procoagulant cytokine, and is a principal inducer of the acute-phase response, which increases the blood concentrations of numerous molecules that have anti-infective, procoagulant, or anti-inflammatory actions. Blood levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist often greatly exceed those of circulating IL-1\u03b2, for example, and this excess may inhibit the binding of IL-1\u03b2 to its receptors. High levels of soluble TNF receptors neutralize TNF-\u03b1 that enters the circulation. Other acute-phase proteins are protease inhibitors or antioxidants; these may neutralize potentially harmful molecules released from neutrophils and other inflammatory cells. Increased hepatic production of hepcidin (stimulated largely by IL-6) promotes the sequestration of iron in hepatocytes, intestinal epithelial cells, and erythrocytes; this"

            "content": "anti-TNF agents The development of TNF inhibitors was originally spurred by the experimental finding that TNF is a critical upstream mediator of joint inflammation. Currently, five agents that inhibit TNF-\u03b1 are approved for the treatment of RA. There are three different anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies. Infliximab is a chimeric (part mouse and human) monoclonal antibody, whereas adalimumab and golimumab are humanized monoclonal antibodies. Certolizumab pegol is a pegylated Fc-free fragment of a humanized monoclonal antibody with binding specificity for TNF-\u03b1. Lastly, etanercept is a soluble fusion protein comprising the TNF receptor 2 in covalent linkage with the Fc portion of IgG1. All of the TNF inhibitors have been shown in randomized controlled clinical trials to reduce the signs and symptoms of RA, slow radiographic progression of joint damage, and improve physical function and quality of life. Anti-TNF drugs are typically used in combination with background methotrexate therapy."

            "content": "Tofacitinib Tofacitinib is a small-molecule inhibitor that primarily inhibits JAK1 and JAK3, which mediate signaling of the receptors for the common \u03b3-chain-related cytokines IL-2, -4, -7, -9, -15, and -21 as well as IFN-\u03b3 and IL-6. These cytokines all play roles in promoting T and B cell activation as well as inflammation. Tofacitinib, an oral agent, has been shown in randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials to improve the signs and symptoms of RA significantly over placebo. Major adverse events include elevated serum transaminases indicative of liver injury, neutropenia, increased cholesterol levels, and elevation in serum creatinine. Its use is also associated with an increased risk of infections. Tofacitinib can be used as mono-therapy or in combination with methotrexate. APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:"
