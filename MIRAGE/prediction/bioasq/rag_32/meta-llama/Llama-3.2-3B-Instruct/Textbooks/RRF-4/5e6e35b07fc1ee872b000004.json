The blood-brain barrier is a complex structure that restricts the passage of certain substances from the bloodstream to the brain and spinal cord. It is composed of endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes. Astrocytes play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier by forming a glia limitans, a relatively impermeable barrier surrounding the CNS. They also release soluble factors that increase barrier properties and tight junction protein content. Additionally, astrocytes can take up potassium ions and neurotransmitter substances, which they metabolize, biodegrade, or recycle, thus buffering the extracellular environment of neurons. Furthermore, astrocytes are involved in the regulation of blood flow and capillary permeability through the neurovascular unit. Based on this information, it is clear that astrocytes are an integral part of the blood-brain barrier.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The presence of only a few small vesicles indicates that pinocytosis across the brain endothelial cells is severely restricted. Substances with a molecular weight greater than 500 daltons generally cannot cross the blood\u2013brain barrier. Many molecules that are required for neuronal integrity leave and enter the blood capillaries through the endothelial cells. Thus, O2 and CO2 as well as certain lipid-soluble molecules (e.g., ethanol and steroid hormones) easily penetrate the endothelial cells and pass freely between the blood and extracellular fluid of the CNS. Due to the high K permeability of the neuronal membrane, neurons are particularly sensitive to changes in the concentration of extracellular K.

Part of this control is provided by the presence of a blood-brain barrier (other mechanisms are the buffering functions of glia, regulation of CNS circulation, and exchange of substances between the CSF and extracellular fluid of the CNS). Movement of large molecules and highly charged ions from blood into the brain and spinal cord is severely restricted. The restriction is at least partly due to the barrier action of the capillary endothelial cells of the CNS and the tight junctions between them. Astrocytes may also help limit the movement of certain substances. For example, astrocytes can take up potassium ions and thus regulate [K+] in the extracellular space. Some pharmaceutical agents, such as penicillin, are removed from the CNS by transport mechanisms."

The astrocyte membrane becomes depolarized, and the charge is dissipated over a large area by the extensive network of astrocyte processes.

At the other pole, astrocytes converge on vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells of cerebral vessels. When activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate or acetylcholine, astrocytes produce inositol trisphosphate (IP3), which causes the release of Ca++, which, in turn, activates large conductance potassium (BKCa) channels. The released K+ raises extracellular [K+] to 8 to 15 mEq/L in the space between the astrocyte and arteriolar smooth muscle. The elevated extracellular [K+] causes hyperpolarization of smooth muscle by activating Na+/K+-ATPase and also by increasing the conductance of inward-rectifying K+ channels. The hyperpolarization reduces Ca++ entry into vascular smooth muscle because the membrane potential is shifted away from the threshold. Hence, the parenchymal arteriole dilates, and blood flow increases."

However, the dopamine formed from the decarboxylation of L-dopa in endothelial cells cannot cross the barrier and is restricted from the CNS. In this case, the blood\u2013brain barrier regulates the concentration of L-dopa in the brain. Clinically, this restriction explains why L-dopa is administered for the treatment of dopamine deficiency (e.g., Parkinson\u2019s disease) rather than dopamine."

            "content": "The most plausible hypothesis relates hepatic coma to an abnormality of nitrogen metabolism, wherein ammonia, which is formed in the bowel by the action of urease-containing organisms on dietary protein, is carried to the liver in the portal circulation but fails to be converted into urea because of hepatocellular disease, portal\u2013 systemic shunting of blood, or both. As a result, excess NH3 reaches the systemic circulation, where it interferes with cerebral metabolism in a way that is not fully understood. The ammonia theory best explains the basic neuropathologic change. Because the brain is lacking in urea cycle enzymes, Norenberg has proposed that the hypertrophy of the astrocytic cytoplasm and proliferation of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, as well as the increase in the astroglial glutamic dehydrogenase activity, all reflect heightened metabolic activity of these systems within astrocytes associated with ammonia detoxification. Removal of brain ammonia depends on the"
