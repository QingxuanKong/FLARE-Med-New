    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break down the information provided in the documents. X-chromosome inactivation is a process where one of the two X chromosomes in female somatic cells is inactivated to achieve dosage compensation between males and females. This inactivation is random and occurs early in fetal life, and the inactivated X chromosome remains inactive in all progeny cells. Genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation are active and can contribute to various phenotypes, including mental impairment. Fragile X syndrome, a common cause of inherited intellectual disability, is caused by the expansion of a CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. This expansion leads to the inactivation of the FMR1 gene, resulting in the absence of the fragile X mental retardation 1 protein, which is essential for normal cognitive development. Furthermore, research has shown that genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation, such as the MECP2 gene, can be associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including Rett syndrome and other X-linked developmental delays. Therefore, genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation are indeed related to mental impairment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Also notable are the somewhat different patterns of performance between males and females on subtests of the various intelligence tests (males perform better in spatial ability and certain mathematical tasks). Males are more likely to be affected by advantageous or by aberrant genes on their single X chromosome, whereas females benefit from the mosaic provided by two X chromosomes. In some families, high intelligence segregates to certain individuals through an X-linked pattern. Further study will determine the validity of these views and of what will certainly prove to be a polygenic inheritance of intelligence and"

Most important, the initial presumption that all of the genes on the inactive X are \u201cswitched off\u201d has been revised, as roughly 21% of genes on Xp, and a smaller number (3%) on Xq, escape X inactivation. This observation has implications for monosomic X chromosome disorders, or Turner syndrome, as discussed later. Extra Y chromosomes are readily tolerated because the only information known to be carried on the Y chromosome seems to relate to male differentiation. Of note, whatever the number of X chromosomes, the presence of a Y invariably dictates the male phenotype. The gene for male differentiation (SRY, sex-determining region of Y chromosome) is located on the short arm of the Y. Described briefly next are two disorders, Klinefelter syndrome and Turner syndrome, that result from aberrations of sex chromosomes."

Elucidation of these signaling pathways has already begun to provide insights into the cause of a variety of neurologic disorders, including inherited disorders of cognition such as X-linked mental retardation. This problem affects ~1 in 500 males, and linkage studies in different families suggest that as many as 60 different X-chromosome-encoded genes may be responsible.

The genetics of this and other retardations was reviewed by Nokelainen and Flint. Rousseau and colleagues described a simple and sensitive test using DNA analysis for the diagnosis of the syndrome both prenatally and after birth. Because of mosaicism, the length of the triplet repeat does not directly relate to the degree of expression of cognitive impairment, and the fragile X alteration occasionally turns up in cognitively normal males; in some instances, the male children of their daughters have the disease.

There are, however, important exceptions to this rule. X-inactivation prevents the expression of most genes on one of the two X chromosomes in every cell of a female. Gene inactivation through genomic imprinting occurs on selected chromosomal regions of autosomes and leads to inheritable preferential expression of one of the parental alleles. It is of pathophysiologic importance in disorders where the transmission of disease is dependent on the sex of the transmitting parent and, thus, plays an important role in the expression of certain genetic disorders. Two classic examples are the Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman\u2019s syndrome (Chap. 83e). Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by diminished fetal activity, obesity, hypotonia, mental retardation, short stature, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism."

Xist RNA spreads from the XIC over the entire chromosome and directs gene silencing.

However, even if the abnormal X chromosome is not widely expressed, the female carrier may still exhibit minor abnormalities. In the latter case, sex-linked inheritance becomes difficult to distinguish from dominant inheritance. Also, sex linkage is deceptive when a disease is lethal to one sex.

An obvious possibility is that the stability of the pattern of gene expression in an adult cell may depend, in part at least, on self-perpetuating modifications of chromatin, as discussed in Chapter 4. As explained in Chapter 7, the phenomenon of X-inactivation in mammals provides a clear example of such epigenetic control. Two X chromosomes exist side by side in each female cell, exposed to the same chemical environment, but while one remains active, the other persists from one cell generation to the next in a condensed inactive state; cytoplasmic factors cannot be responsible for the difference, which must instead reflect mechanisms intrinsic to the individual chromosome. Elsewhere in the genome also, controls at the level of chromatin act in combination with other forms of regulation to govern the expression of each gene."

The consideration of lyonization must begin with Mary Lyon, who in 1962 proposed that in females, only one X chromosome is genetically active. X inactivation occurs early in fetal life, about 16 days after conception. Either the paternal or the maternal X chromosome is randomly inactivated in each cell of the developing embryo.

From 30% to 50% of carrier women with the fragile X mutation on one chromosome might show features of mild cognitive impairment or other behavioral disturbances. Approximately 20% develop features of premature reproductive failure (see below). The presence of symptoms in carrier females, albeit mild, is unusual for an X-linked recessive disease. Anticipation. This term refers to the phenomenon whereby clinical features of fragile X syndrome worsen with each successive generation, as if the mutation becomes increasingly deleterious as it is transmitted from a man to his grandsons and great-grandsons."

            "content": "Mammals achieve dosage compensation by the transcriptional inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in female somatic cells, a process known as X-inactivation. As a result of X-inactivation, two X chromosomes can coexist within the same nucleus, exposed to the same diffusible transcription regulators, yet differ entirely in their expression."

            "content": "Genomic imprinting is Based on DnA Methylation Mammalian cells are diploid, containing one set of genes inherited from the father and one set from the mother. The expression of a small minority of genes depends on whether they have been inherited from the mother or the father: when the paternally inherited gene copy is active, the maternally inherited gene copy is silent, or vice versa. This phenomenon is called genomic imprinting. Roughly 300 genes are imprinted in humans. Because only one copy of an imprinted gene is expressed, imprinting can \u201cunmask\u201d mutations that would normally be covered by the other, functional copy. For example, Angelman syndrome, a disorder of the nervous system in humans that causes reduced mental ability and severe speech impairment, results from a gene deletion on one chromosomal homolog and the silencing, by imprinting, of the intact gene on the other homolog."
