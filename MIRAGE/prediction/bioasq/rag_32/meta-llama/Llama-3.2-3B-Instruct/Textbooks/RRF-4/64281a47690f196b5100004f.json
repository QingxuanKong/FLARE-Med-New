The frequency of renal calcium oxalate calculi increases significantly in patients with a small-intestinal resection and an intact colon; this greater frequency is due to an increase in oxalate absorption by the large intestine, with subsequent enteric hyperoxaluria. Two possible mechanisms for the increase in oxalate absorption in the colon have been suggested: (1) increased bile acids and fatty acids that augment colonic mucosal permeability, resulting in enhanced oxalate absorption; and (2) increased fatty acids that bind calcium, resulting in an enhanced amount of soluble oxalate that is then absorbed. Since oxalate is high in relatively few foods (e.g., spinach, rhubarb, tea), dietary restrictions alone do not constitute adequate treatment. Cholestyramine (an anion-binding resin) and calcium have proved useful in reducing hyperoxaluria. Similarly, an increase in cholesterol"

Intraparenchymal calcium oxalate deposition in the kidney can eventually lead to renal failure. Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive disorder that causes abnormal reabsorption of filtered dibasic amino acids. The excessive urinary excretion of cystine, which is poorly soluble, leads to cystine stone formation.

Such patients characteristically have normal or low urine calcium levels but elevated urine oxalate levels. The reasons for the development of oxaluria in such patients are thought to be twofold: first, in the intestinal lumen, calcium (which is now bound to fat) fails to bind oxalate and no longer prevents its absorption; second, enteric flora, acting on the increased supply of nutrients reaching the colon, produce larger amounts of oxalate. Although one would ordinarily avoid treating a patient with calcium oxalate stones with calcium supplementation, this is precisely what is done in patients with enteric oxaluria. The increased intestinal calcium binds the excess oxalate and prevents its absorption.

However, allopurinol reduced stone recurrence in one randomized controlled trial in patients with calcium oxalate stones and high urine uric acid levels. The lack of association between urine uric acid level and calcium oxalate stones suggests that a different mechanism underlies the observed beneficial effect of allopurinol. Additional dietary modifications may be beneficial in reducing stone recurrence. Restriction of nondairy animal protein (e.g., meat, chicken, seafood) is a reasonable approach and may result in higher excretion of citrate and lower excretion of calcium. In addition, reducing sodium intake to <2.5 g/d may decrease urinary excretion of calcium. Sucrose and fructose intake should be minimized."

            "content": "Azathioprine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is metabolized primarily to mercaptopurine. Xanthine oxidase converts much of the active material to 6-thiouric acid prior to excretion in the urine. After administration of azathioprine, small amounts of unchanged drug and mercaptopurine are also excreted by the kidney, and as much as a twofold increase in toxicity may occur in anephric or anuric patients. Since much of the drug\u2019s inactivation depends on xanthine oxidase, patients who are also receiving allopurinol (see Chapters 36 and 54) for control of hyperuricemia should have the dose of azathioprine reduced to one-fourth to one-third the usual amount to prevent excessive toxicity."
