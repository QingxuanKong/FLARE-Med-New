Royal jelly proteins are mentioned in Document [25] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) as being involved in the development of the mammary glands and the production of milk, while yellow proteins are mentioned in Document [12] (Title: Immunology_Janeway) as part of the immune system, specifically as epitopes on antigens that are recognized by antibodies. However, I can make an educated guess based on the context of Document [12] (Title: Immunology_Janeway), which mentions that \"most antigens are larger than the sites on the antibody or antigen receptor to which they bind, and the actual portion of the antigen that is bound is known as the antigenic determinant, or epitope, for that receptor.\" Given that royal jelly proteins are involved in the development of the mammary glands, it is possible that they may interact with antibodies or immune cells in a way that could be similar to the interaction between antigens and antibodies. However, without more specific information, it is impossible to definitively answer the question. Therefore, I must choose the most conservative answer based on the available information. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After analyzing the provided documents, I was unable to find any direct comparison between royal jelly proteins and yellow proteins.

Both patterns were discovered more than 60 years ago from studies of hair and silk. The first folding pattern to be discovered, called the \u03b1 helix, was found in the protein \u03b1-keratin, which is abundant in skin and its derivatives\u2014such as hair, nails, and horns. Within a year of the discovery of the \u03b1 helix, a second folded structure, called a \u03b2 sheet, was found in the protein fibroin, the major constituent of silk. These two patterns are particularly common because they result from hydrogen-bonding between the N\u2013H and C=O groups in the polypeptide backbone, without involving the side chains of the amino acids. Thus, although incompatible with some amino acid side chains, many different amino acid sequences can form them. In each case, the protein chain adopts a"

            "content": "The major functions of vitamin A are maintenance of normal vision, regulation of cell growth and differentiation, and regulation of lipid metabolism. Vitamin A is a generic name for a group of related fat-soluble compounds that include retinol, retinal, and retinoic acid, which have similar biologic activities. Retinol is the chemical name for vitamin A. It is the transport form and, as retinol ester, also the storage form. A widely used term, retinoids, refers to both natural and synthetic chemicals that are structurally related to vitamin A but may not necessarily have vitamin A activity. Animal-derived foods such as liver, fish, eggs, milk, and butter are important dietary sources of preformed vitamin A. Yellow and leafy green vegetables such as carrots, squash, and spinach supply large amounts of carotenoids, many of which are provitamins that are metabolized to active vitamin A in the body. Carotenoids contribute approximately 30% of the vitamin A in human diets; the most"

Structurally related to blue-light-sensitive enzymes called photolyases (involved in the repair of ultraviolet-induced DNA damage) but do not have a role in DNA repair.

Since transmembrane domains are hydrophobic, how is it that they can associate with one another so specifically? 10\u201310 Three mechanisms by which membrane-binding proteins bend a membrane are illustrated in Figure Q10\u20132A, B, and C. As shown, each of these cytosolic membrane-bending proteins would induce an invagination of the plasma membrane. Could similar kinds of cytosolic proteins induce a protrusion of the plasma membrane (Figure Q10\u20132D)? Which ones? Explain how they might work."

            "content": "Because evolution has selected for protein function in living organisms, the amino acid sequence of most present-day proteins is such that a single conformation is stable. In addition, this conformation has its chemical properties finely tuned to enable the protein to perform a particular catalytic or structural function in the cell. Proteins are so precisely built that the change of even a few atoms in one amino acid can sometimes disrupt the structure of the whole molecule so severely that all function is lost. And, as discussed later in this chapter, when certain rare protein misfolding accidents occur, the results can be disastrous for the organisms that contain them."
