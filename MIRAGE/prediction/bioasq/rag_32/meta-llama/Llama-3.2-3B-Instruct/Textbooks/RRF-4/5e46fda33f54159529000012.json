Here, short single-stranded RNAs (20\u201330 nucleotides) serve as guide RNAs that selectively reorganize and bind\u2014through base-pairing\u2014other RNAs in the cell. When the target is a mature mRNA, the small noncoding RNAs can inhibit its translation or even catalyze its destruction. If the target RNA molecule is in the process of being transcribed, the small noncoding RNA can bind to it and direct the formation of certain types of repressive chromatin on its attached DNA template (Figure 7\u201374). Three classes of small noncoding RNAs work in this way\u2014microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs)\u2014and we discuss them in turn in the next sections.

As methods have improved for determining the nucleotide sequences of all the RNA molecules produced by a cell line or tissue, the sheer number of lncRNAs (an estimated 8000 for the human genome, for example) came as a surprise to scientists. Most lncRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II and have 5\u02b9 caps and poly-A tails, and, in many cases, they are spliced.

One well understood use of noncoding RNAs occurs in RNA interference, where guide RNAs (miRNAs, siRNAs, piRNAs) base-pair with mRNAs. RNA interference can cause mRNAs to be either destroyed or translationally repressed. It can also cause specific genes to be packaged into heterochromatin suppressing their transcription.
