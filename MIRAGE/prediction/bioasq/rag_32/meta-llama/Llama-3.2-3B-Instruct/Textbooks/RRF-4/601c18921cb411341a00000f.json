    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step analysis: 1. The question asks if an antiphlogistic promotes inflammation. To answer this question, we need to understand the meaning of \"antiphlogistic\" and its relationship to inflammation. 2. An antiphlogistic is a substance that is used to counteract or reduce inflammation. It is the opposite of an anti-inflammatory agent, which is a substance that reduces inflammation. 3. Based on this definition, it is clear that an antiphlogistic would not promote inflammation, but rather reduce or counteract it. 4. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is that an antiphlogistic does not promote inflammation, but rather reduces or counteracts it. Here is my output in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The question asks if an antiphlogistic promotes inflammation. An antiphlogistic is a substance that reduces or counteracts inflammation. Therefore, the answer is that an antiphlogistic does not promote inflammation, but rather reduces or counteracts it.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

These cells secrete molecules (cytokines and other mediators) that induce and regulate the subsequent inflammatory response. Inflammatory mediators are also produced from plasma proteins that react to the microbes or to products of necrotic cells. Some of these mediators promote the efflux of plasma and the recruitment of circulating leukocytes to the site where the offending agent is located. Mediators also activate the recruited leukocytes, enhancing their ability to destroy and remove the offending agent. Understanding the role of chemical mediators is important because most anti-inflammatory drugs target specific mediators. We shall discuss the mediators of inflammation in detail later, after we review the main steps in inflammatory reactions."

The mediators of inflammation are the substances that initiate and regulate inflammatory reactions. Although the harried student may find the list of mediators daunting (as do professors!), it is worthy of note that this knowledge has been used to design a large armamentarium of anti-inflammatory agents that are used every day by many people and which include familiar drugs such as aspirin and acetaminophen. The most important mediators of acute inflammation are vasoactive amines, lipid products (prostaglandins and leukotrienes), cytokines (including chemokines), and products of complement activation ( Table 3.5 ). We begin by summarizing the general properties of the Table 3.5 Principal Mediators of Inflammation Prostaglandins Mast cells, Vasodilation, pain, fever leukocytes http://ebooksmedicine.net mediators of inflammation and then discuss some of the more important molecules."

The list of cytokines implicated in inflammation is huge and constantly growing. In addition to the ones described earlier, two that have received considerable interest are IL-6, made by macrophages and other cells, which is involved in local and systemic reactions, and IL-17, produced mainly by T lymphocytes, which promotes neutrophil recruitment. IL-6 receptor antagonists are used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and IL-17 antagonists are very effective in psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases. Type I interferons, whose normal function is to inhibit viral replication, contribute to some of the systemic manifestations of inflammation. Cytokines also play key roles in chronic inflammation; these are described later in the chapter."

Macrophages display antigens to T cells, express membrane molecules (called costimulators) that activate T cells, and produce cytokines (IL-12 and others) that also stimulate T cell responses (Chapter 5). Activated T lymphocytes, in turn, produce cytokines, described earlier, which recruit and activate macrophages, promoting more antigen presentation and cytokine secretion. The result is a cycle of cellular reactions that fuel and sustain chronic inflammation. Activated B lymphocytes and antibody-producing plasma cells are often present at sites of chronic inflammation. The antibodies may be specific for persistent foreign or self antigens in the inflammatory site or against altered tissue components. However, the specificity and even the importance of antibodies in most chronic inflammatory disorders are unclear."

Chronic inflammation involves the release of multiple cytokines and chemokines plus a very complex interplay of immunoactive cells.

The answer is that infection sets up inflammation, which induces the expression of co-stimulatory molecules on the antigen-presenting dendritic cells and the production of cytokines promoting lymphocyte activation. The outcome of an encounter with antigen in these conditions is the activation, proliferation, and differentiation of the lymphocyte to effector-cell status. In the absence of infection or inflammation, dendritic cells still process and present self antigens, but in the absence of co-stimulatory and other signals, any interaction of a mature lymphocyte with its specific antigen seems to result in a tolerance-inducing (tolerogenic) signal from the antigen receptor.
