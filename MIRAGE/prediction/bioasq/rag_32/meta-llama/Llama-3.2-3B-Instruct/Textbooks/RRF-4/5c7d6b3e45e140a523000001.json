There is no evidence to suggest that statins cause liver failure in patients with any chronic liver disease, including NAFLD. The incidence of liver enzyme elevations in NAFLD patients taking statins is also no different than that of healthy controls or patients with other chronic liver diseases. Moreover, several studies have suggested that statins may improve aminotransferases and histology in patients with NASH. Yet, there is continued reluctance to use statins in patients with NAFLD. The lack of evidence that statins harm the liver in NAFLD patients, combined with the increase risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in NAFLD patients, warrants the use of statins to treat dyslipidemia in patients with NAFLD/NASH."

Metformin, an agent that mainly improves hepatic insulin sensitivity, has been evaluated in several small, open-label studies in adults and a recent larger, prospectively randomized trial in children (dubbed the TONIC study). Although several of the adult NASH studies suggested improvements in aminotransferases and/or liver histology, metformin did not improve liver histology in the TONIC study of children with NASH.

The benefits of different dietary macronutrient contents (e.g., low-carbohydrate vs low-fat diets, saturated vs unsaturated fat diets) and different intensities of calorie restriction appear to be comparable. In adults with NAFLD, exercise regimens that improve fitness may be sufficient to reduce hepatic steatosis, but their impact on other aspects of liver histology remains unknown. Unfortunately, most NAFLD patients are unable to achieve sustained weight loss. Although pharmacologic therapies such as orlistat, topiramate, and phentermine to facilitate weight loss are available, their role in the treatment of NAFLD remains experimental."

The goal of staging is to distinguish patients with NASH from those with simple steatosis and to identify which of the NASH patients have advanced fibrosis. The 10-year probability of developing liver-related morbidity or mortality in steatosis is negligible, and hence, this subgroup of NAFLD patients tends to be managed conservatively (see below). In contrast, more intensive follow-up and therapy are justified in NASH patients, and the subgroup with advanced fibrosis merits the most intensive scrutiny and intervention because their 10-year risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality is clearly increased."

It is estimated that over half of the lipid found in hepatocytes in NAFLD is derived from adipose tissue, with most of the remainder coming from de novo synthesis in liver cells. Precisely how the accumulation of lipid in hepatocytes predisposes to the development of NASH is not known and may involve several interrelated mechanisms. Excessive intrahepatic lipids and their metabolic intermediates enhance insulin resistance in the liver and sensitize hepatocytes to the toxic effects of inflammatory cytokines, which are produced in increased amounts in the setting of the metabolic syndrome.

Other associations include chronic fatigue, mood alterations, obstructive sleep apnea, thyroid dysfunction, and chronic pain syndrome. NAFLD is an independent risk factor for metabolic syndrome (Chap. 422). Longitudinal studies suggest that patients with NASH are at twoto threefold increased risk for the development of metabolic syndrome. Similarly, studies have shown that patients with NASH have a higher risk for the development of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The presence of NAFLD is also independently associated with endothelial dysfunction, increased carotid intimal thickness, and the number of plaques in carotid and coronary arteries. Such data indicate that NAFLD has many deleterious effects on health in general."

Its most severe form-nonacoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-is an increasingly recognized condition that may occasionally progress to hepatic cirrhosis. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a macrovesicular fatty liver condition that resembles alcohol-induced liver injury but is seen without this substance abuse. Obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemiasyndrome X-frequently coexist (Chap. 48 p. 938). The current hypothesis suggests that these conditions may interact with other unknown etiological agents to cause multiple insults or \"hits\" leading to hepatic injury. For example, half of persons with type 2 diabetes have NAFLD, and insulin resistance has been postulated to act as one possible \"hit\" (Buzzetti, 2016). Browning and associates (2004) used MR spectroscopy to determine the prevalence ofNAFLD in Dallas County and found that approximately a"
