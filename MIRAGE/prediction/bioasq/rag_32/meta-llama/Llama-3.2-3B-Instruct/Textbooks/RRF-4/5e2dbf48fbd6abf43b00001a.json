According to Document [6] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung), Phase 4 trials are postmarketing studies that are conducted after the drug is approved for marketing. Document [8] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) mentions a phase 2 trial of ProSavin, a lentiviral vector-based gene therapy for Parkinson\u2019s disease, but it does not mention phase 4 trials. Document [27] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) mentions a European study involving bilateral intrastriatal delivery of ProSavin, but it does not indicate that it is a phase IV trial. However, Document [7] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) mentions that the results of a European study involving bilateral intrastriatal delivery of ProSavin were encouraging, and a phase 2 trial of AADC is planned. Since ProSavin is a gene therapy, it is likely that phase 4 trials will be conducted after its approval for marketing. Given that the last document mentioned was from 2014, it is possible that ProSavin has undergone phase IV clinical trials by 2018.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

This constitutes monitoring the safety of the new drug under actual conditions of use in large numbers of patients. The importance of careful and complete reporting of toxicity by physicians after marketing begins can be appreciated by noting that many important drug-induced effects have an incidence of 1 in 10,000 or less and that some adverse effects may become apparent only after chronic dosing. The sample size required to disclose drug-induced events or toxicities is very large for such rare events. For example, several hundred thousand patients may have to be exposed before the first case is observed of a toxicity that occurs with an average incidence of 1 in 10,000. Therefore, low-incidence drug effects are not generally detected before phase 4 no matter how carefully phase 1, 2, and 3 studies are executed. Phase 4 has no fixed duration.

Interpretation of the results may be difficult because of unexpected confounding variables, loss of subjects from some groups, or realization that results differ markedly between certain subgroups within the active treatment (new drug) group.

Therefore, new \u201cadaptive\u201d statistical methods are under development that allow changes in the study design when interim data evaluation indicates the need. Preliminary results with such methods suggest that they may allow decisions regarding superiority as well as noninferiority, shortening of trial duration, discovery of new therapeutic benefits, and more reliable conclusions regarding the results (see Bhatt & Mehta, 2016)."

Marketing approval requires submission of a New Drug Application (NDA)\u2014or for biologicals, a Biological License Application (BLA)\u2014to the FDA. The application contains, often in hundreds of volumes, full reports of all preclinical and clinical data pertaining to the drug under review. The number of subjects studied in support of the new drug application has been increasing and currently averages more than 5000 patients for new drugs of novel structure (new molecular entities). The duration of the FDA review leading to approval (or denial) of the new drug application may vary from months to years. If problems arise, eg, unexpected but possibly serious toxicities, additional studies may be required and the approval process may extend to several additional years."

The study showed that the combination regimen was better tolerated than the sequential administration of the agents in suboptimally resected patients. The second-generation platinum analogue, carboplatin, was developed to have less toxicity than its parent compound, cisplatin. In early trials, carboplatin had lower overall toxicity (204). Fewer gastrointestinal side effects, especially nausea and vomiting, were observed than with cisplatin, and there was less nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and ototoxicity. Carboplatin is associated with a higher degree of myelosuppression (206)."

            "content": "The HCV RNA genome encodes a single polyprotein, which is cleaved during and after translation by host and viral-encoded proteases. One protease involved in the cleavage of the viral polyprotein is an NS3-4A viral protein that has serine protease activity. Telaprevir and boceprevir are serine protease inhibitors that target NS3-4A. In 2011, telaprevir and boceprevir used in combination with PEG IFN and ribavirin were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of hepatitis C genotype 1 in adults with stable liver disease, both in patients who have not been treated before or who have failed previous treatment. Because the presently available HCV protease inhibitors have not been studied comprehensively in patients with genotypes other than 1, their use in these populations is not recommended."

Sorafenib demonstrated progression-free sur-vival (PFS) improvement by 5 months with about 12% partial response rates, whereas lenvatinib prolonged median PFS by 15.7 months compared with placebo with response rates of 65%, including some complete responses. Vandetanib is mainly a RET-kinase inhibitor, but it also affects the VEGF-receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor. It has been evaluated in a phase 2 trial and also demonstrated an improved PFS.57 However, none of the agents show improvements in overall survival. Moreover, they are associated with significant side effects (diarrhea, fatigue hypertension,"

It is distinct from earlier-generation protease inhibitors due to its pan-genotypic activity, as well activity against some of the major resistance-associated variants (R155K and D168Y) resulting in failure with first-generation protease inhibitors. It is only available in combination with elbasvir for treatment of HCV genotypes 1 and 4."
