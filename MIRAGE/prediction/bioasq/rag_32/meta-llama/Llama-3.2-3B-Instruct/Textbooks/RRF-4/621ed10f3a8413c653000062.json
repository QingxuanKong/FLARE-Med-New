Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are known to suppress immune responses, rather than activate them. They express the transcription factor FoxP3 and produce immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, which inhibit lymphocyte activation and effector functions. This suggests that Tregs play a role in limiting or modulating the immune response, rather than enhancing it. Therefore, the answer to the question is that Tregs are not a positive regulator of the immune response, but rather a negative regulator. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Other CD4 T cells have a different function. These are called regulatory T cells, or Treg cells, because their function is to suppress T-cell responses rather than activate them. Thus, Treg cells are involved in limiting the immune response and preventing autoimmunity. Two main subsets of regulatory T cells are currently recognized. One subset becomes committed to a regulatory fate while still in the thymus, and is known as natural, or thymically derived, T cells (nT and tT , respectively; see Section 8-26). The other subset of T cells differenti ates from naive CD4 T cells in the periphery under the influence of particular environmental conditions. This group is known as induced, or peripherally derived, T cells (iT and pT , respectively). These cells will be discussed further in Section 9-23."

Among these negative regulators are regulatory T (Treg) cells, which are produced in the thymus and induced in the periphery to suppress immune-mediated inflammation. They are characterized by the surface expression of CD25 and the transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) and orchestrate dominant tolerance through contact with other immune cells and secretion of inhibitory cytokines, such as TGF-\u03b2, IL-10, and IL-35. T reg cells appear to be heterogeneous and capable of suppressing distinct classes (TH1, TH2, TH17) of the immune response.

Regulatory T cells play a central role in preventing autoreactive immune responses and fall into different groups that are defined by their different developmental origins and functions. Natural T-regulatory (nT ) cells develop in the thymus (see Section 8-26) and are CD4-positive cells that constitutively express CD25 and high levels of the L-selectin receptor CD62L and of CTLA-4. Induced T (iT ) cells arise in the periphery from naive CD4 T cells and also express CD25 and CTLA-4 (see Section 9-20). Collectively, T cells represent about 5\u201310% of the CD4 T cells in circuation. A hallmark of both natural and induced T cells is expression of the transcription factor FoxP3, which, among other actions, interferes with the interaction between AP-1 and NFAT at the IL-2 gene promoter, preventing transcriptional activation of the gene and production of IL-2."

Thus, it is the presence or absence of IL-6 that determines whether TGF-\u03b2 co-signaling leads to the development of immunosuppressive Treg cells or of TH17 cells, which promote inflammation and the generation of immunity (Fig. 9.33). The generation of IL-6 by innate immune cells is regulated by the presence or absence of pathogens, with pathogen products tending to stimulate its production. In the absence of pathogens, IL-6 production is low, favoring differentiation of the immunosuppressive Treg cells and so preventing unwanted immune responses. Like nT cells, iT cells are distinguished by expression of the transcription factor FoxP3 and cell-surface CD25, and appear to be functionally equivalent to nT cells. Both iT and nT cells"

The passage of bone marrow\u2013derived T cells through the fetal thymus during early development has been well described. During this developmental interval, the T cells encounter a process termed thymic education. During thymic education, T cells that express either the CD4 or the CD8 coreceptor are chosen, and autoreactive cells are effectively eliminated. In short, this education promotes T-cell tolerance, allowing selection and survival only of those T cells that recognize non-self and will not react against self. Recently, a subpopulation of CD4+ T cells has been described that, like all activated lymphocytes, strongly express CD25 on their cell surface (123).

            "content": "In murine models of diabetes, when cytokines were infused to influence T-cell differentiation or when knockout mice predisposed to TH2 differentiation were studied, the development of diabetes was inhibited. In some cases, potentially pathogenic T cells specific for pancreatic islet-cell components, and expressing TH2 instead of TH1 cytokines, actually suppressed disease caused by TH1 cells of the same specificity. So far, attempts to control human autoimmune disease by switching cytokine profiles from one effector cell type to another (for example, TH1 to TH2), a procedure termed immune modulation, have not proved successful. Another subset of CD4 T cells, Treg cells, might prove to be more important in the prevention of autoimmune disease, and efforts to deviate effector to regulatory T-cell responses are being studied as a novel therapy for autoimmunity. 15-7 Autoimmune responses can be controlled at various stages by regulatory T cells."

Treg cells express the transcription regulator FoxP3, which serves as both a marker of these cells and a master controller of their development: if the gene encoding this protein is inactivated in mice or humans, the individuals fail to produce Treg cells and develop a fatal autoimmune disease involving multiple organs\u2014findings that establish the crucial importance of Treg cells in self-tolerance."

These specific CD4-positive cells are known as h17 cells and Treg cells. h17 cells are proinflammatory and express the cytokine IL-17 and the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors (RORs). Treg cells express the transcription factor forkhead box protein-3 (FOXP3) and confer tolerizing activity. here is a shift toward Treg CD4 cells in the first trimester, which peaks during the second trimester and falls toward delivery (Figueiredo, 2016). his shift may promote tolerance at the maternal-fetal interface (La Rocca, 2014). In particular, failure of these CD4 T lymphocyte subpopulation alterations may be related to preeclampsia development (Vargas-Rojas, 2016)."

            "content": "The various subsets of effector CD4 T cells each have very different functions. For the immune response to efficiently control different types of pathogens it must orchestrate a coordinated effector response that is dominated by one of these subsets. A principal means of achieving this is through the distinct ensemble of cytokines that are produced by the different subsets. Importantly, some of these same cytokines also participate in positive and negative feedback loops that control the differentiation of effector T cells from naive precursors, thereby providing a mechanism to promote one pattern of effector response while suppressing others. For example, both IFN-\u03b3 (produced by TH1 cells) and IL-4 (produced by TH2 cells) potently inhibit TH17 development, promoting TH1 or TH2 development, respectively (Fig. 9.34). Similarly, there is cross-regulation between TH1 and TH2 cells. IL-4 produced by TH2 cells potently inhibits TH1 development. Conversely, IFN-\u03b3, a product of TH1 cells,"

            "content": "On recognizing antigen, naive T cells differentiate into several functional classes of effector T cells that are specialized for different activities. CD8 T cells recognize pathogen peptides presented by MHC class I molecules, and naive CD8 T cells differentiate into cytotoxic effector T cells that recognize and kill infected cells. CD4 T cells have a more flexible repertoire of effector activities. After recognizing pathogen peptides presented by MHC class II molecules, naive CD4 T cells can differentiate down distinct pathways that generate effector subsets with different immunological functions. The main CD4 effector subsets are TH1, TH2, TH17, and TFH, which activate their target cells; and regulatory T cells, or Treg cells, which inhibit the extent of immune activation."
