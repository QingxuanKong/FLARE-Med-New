(From WJ Boyle et al: Nature 423: 337, 2003.) in situations of estrogen deprivation, the life span of osteoblasts may be decreased, whereas the longevity and activity of osteoclasts are increased. The rate and duration of bone loss after menopause are heterogeneous and unpredictable. Once surfaces are lost in cancellous bone, the rate of bone loss must decline. In cortical bone, loss is slower but continues for a longer time period."

The molecular action of 1,25(OH)2D on bone is more complex and controversial as it is both direct and indirect. Much of the skeletal effect is attributed to the provision of adequate calcium and phosphate from the diet by stimulation of their intestinal absorption. However, like PTH, 1,25(OH)2D can induce RANKL in osteoblasts to regulate osteoclast activity and proteins such as osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase, which may regulate the mineralization process by osteoblasts. The metabolites 25(OH)D and 24,25(OH)2D are far less potent stimulators of intestinal calcium and phosphate transport or bone resorption."
