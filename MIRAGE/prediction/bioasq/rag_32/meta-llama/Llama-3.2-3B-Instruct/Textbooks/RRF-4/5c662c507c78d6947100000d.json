According to document [4], lithium is not mentioned as a treatment for ALS. However, in document [5], it is mentioned that idrocilamide and riluzole are newer drugs for the treatment of ALS that appear to have spasm-reducing effects, possibly through inhibition of glutamatergic transmission in the CNS. In document [24], riluzole is shown to slow the progression of ALS and improve survival in patients with disease of bulbar onset. This suggests that riluzole may be effective for the treatment of ALS, but not lithium. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

A number of novel agents are under investigation for bipolar depression, including riluzole, a neuroprotective agent that is approved for use in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ketamine, a noncompetitive NMDA antagonist previously discussed as a drug believed to model schizophrenia but thought to act by producing relative enhancement of AMPA receptor activity; and AMPA receptor potentiators.

A confusional psychosis with polymyoclonus and ataxia-simulating Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (including periodic sharp waves in the electroencephalogram) may occur at toxic levels. In patients who do not tolerate lithium, carbamazepine, valproate, or another antiepileptic may be substituted. A combination of lithium and a tricyclic or SSRI medication at the lowest effective level has been one of the most often used long-term preventive therapies for bipolar disease, and the same combination is useful for patients with mixed bipolar disorder in which depressive and manic manifestations occur within a single episode of illness."

Most important is that the prophylactic use of lithium can prevent both mania and depression. Many experts believe that the aggressive marketing of newer drugs has inappropriately produced a shift to drugs that are less effective than lithium for substantial numbers of patients."

Failing this, a \u201cmood stabilizing\u201d drug such as lamotrigine or divalproex has been used. As mentioned earlier, there is scant evidence that these approaches are superior to lithium. The point to be made is that the use of conventional antidepressants is currently less popular because of the risk of worsening depression to the point of a suicidal state or of inducing mania. Other combinations have been used such as olanzapine with a serotonergic antidepressant (e.g., fluoxetine). These are summarized in the review by Frye. Taken together the effectiveness of these new approaches serve to emphasize the importance of proper diagnosis of bipolar disease in contrast to unipolar depression.

At blood lithium concentrations above 3.5 mEq/L, these symptoms are replaced by stupor and coma, sometimes with convulsions, and may prove fatal. Discontinuing lithium in the intoxicated patient, which is the initial step in therapy, does not result in immediate disappearance of toxic symptoms. This may be delayed by a week or two, and the diabetes insipidus may persist even longer. Fluids, sodium chloride, aminophylline, and acetazolamide promote the excretion of lithium. Lithium coma may require hemodialysis, which has proved to be the most rapid means of reducing the blood lithium concentration."

            "content": "Most of the degenerative diseases, as emphasized in the earlier general comments, are characterized by the selective involvement of anatomically and physiologically related systems of neurons. This feature is exemplified by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in which the pathologic process is virtually limited to motor neurons of the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord, and by the progressive ataxias, in which only the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum are affected. Many other examples could be cited (e.g., Friedreich ataxia, Parkinson disease) in which discrete neuronal systems disintegrate, leaving others unscathed. Thus, these degenerative diseases had in the past been called system atrophies. The selective vulnerability of certain systems of neurons is not an exclusive property of the degenerative diseases; several different processes of known cause have similarly circumscribed effects on the nervous system. Contrariwise, in many degenerative diseases, the pathologic"
