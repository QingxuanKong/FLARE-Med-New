Lamivudine should never be used as monotherapy in patients with HBV-HIV infection because HIV resistance emerges rapidly to both viruses. Adefovir has been used successfully to treat chronic hepatitis B in HBV-HIV co-infected patients but is no longer considered a first-line agent for HBV. Entecavir has low-level activity against HIV and can result in selection of HIV resistance; therefore, it should be avoided in HBV-HIV co-infection. Tenofovir and the combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine in one pill are approved therapies for HIV and represent excellent choices for treating HBV infection in HBV-HIV co-infected patients. Generally, even for HBVHIV co-infected patients who do not yet meet treatment criteria for HIV infection, treating for both HBV and HIV is recommended."

The decision regarding choice of drugs not only will affect the immediate response to therapy but also will have implications regarding options for future therapeutic regimens. The initial regimen is usually the most effective insofar as the virus has yet to develop significant resistance. HIV is capable of rapidly developing resistance to any single agent, and therapy must be given as a multidrug combination. Given that patients can be infected with viruses that harbor drug resistance mutations, it is recommended that a viral genotype be done prior to the initiation of therapy to optimize the selection of antiretroviral agents. The combination regimens currently recommended for initial therapy in any treatment-na\u00efve patient are listed in Table 226-24.

When used as part of initial regimens in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, these agents have been shown to be capable of suppressing levels of HIV replication to under 50 copies/mL in the majority of patients for a minimum of 5 years. As in the case of reverse transcriptase inhibitors, resistance to protease inhibitors can develop rapidly in the setting of monotherapy, and thus these agents should be used only as part of combination therapeutic regimens. A summary of known resistance mutations for protease inhibitors is shown in Fig. 226-46.

Patterns of susceptibility of HIV-2 to these agents may vary; however, there is innate resistance to the NNRTIs and enfuvirtide as well as a lower barrier of resistance to NRTIs and PIs. The NRTIs act by competitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase; incorporation into the growing viral DNA chain causes premature chain termination due to inhibition of binding with the incoming nucleotide (Figure 49\u20133).

These patients should be treated for both HIV and HBV with an HIV drug regimen that includes or is supplemented by at least two drugs active against HBV; antiretroviral therapy (ART) often contains two drugs with antiviral activity against HBV (e.g., tenofovir and emtricitabine), but if lamivudine is part of the regimen, the daily dose should be 300 mg (Chap. 226).

The viruses that are found within the first few months after HIV infection almost invariably use CCR5, which explains why individuals that carry a defective CCR5 gene are less susceptible to HIV infection. In the later stages of infection, viruses often either switch to use CXCR4 or adapt to use both co-receptors through the accumulation of mutations; in this way, the virus can change the cell types it infects as the disease progresses. It may seem paradoxical that viruses would infect immune cells, as we might expect that virus binding would trigger an immune response; but invasion of an immune cell can be a useful way for a virus to weaken the immune response and travel around the body to infect other immune cells."

The diagnosis of HIV infection in most infants born in the United States is confirmed before development of clinical signs of infection. HIV infection can be diagnosed definitively by 1 month of age and in virtually all infected infants by 6 months of age using viral diagnostic assays (RNA polymerase chain reaction [PCR], DNA PCR, or virus culture). Maternal antibodies may be detectable until 12 to 15 months of age, and a positive serologic test is not considered diagnostic until 18 months of age."

            "content": "Maraviroc is a CCR5 antagonist that interferes with HIV binding at the stage of co-receptor engagement. It was licensed in 2007 for treatment of HIV infection in combination with other agents in treatment-experienced patients infected with only CCR5-tropic (R5) virus resistant to multiple agents. The license was extended in 2009 to include treatment-na\u00efve patients with R5 virus. A co-receptor tropism assay should be performed if one is considering the use of maraviroc to ensure that the potential patient is only harboring R5 viruses. In phase III trials of treatment-experienced patients randomized to receive optimal therapy plus maraviroc or placebo, 61% of patients randomized to maraviroc achieved HIV RNA levels <400 copies/mL compared with 28% of patients randomized to placebo. An allergic reaction\u2013associated hepatotoxicity has been reported with maraviroc. Among the most common side effects of maraviroc are dizziness due to postural hypotension, cough, fever, colds, rash, muscle"

Among patients co-infected with HBV and HIV and who have normal CD4+ T cell counts, adefovir dipivoxil is effective in suppressing HBV dramatically (by 5 logs10 in one study). Moreover, adefovir dipivoxil is effective in lamivudine-resistant, YMDD-mutant HBV and can be used when such lamivudine-induced variants emerge. When lamivudine resistance occurs, adding adefovir (i.e., maintaining lamivudine to preempt the emergence of adefovir resistance) is superior to switching to adefovir. Almost invariably, patients with adefovir-mutant HBV respond to lamivudine (or newer agents, such as entecavir, see below). When, in the past, adefovir had been evaluated as therapy for HIV infection, doses of 60\u2212120 mg were required to suppress HIV, and, at these doses, the drug was nephro-2035 toxic. Even at 30 mg/d, creatinine elevations of 44 \u03bcmol/L (0.5 mg/ dL) occurred in 10% of patients; however, at the HBV-effective dose of 10 mg, such elevations"

Ledipasvir was the first NS5A inhibitor to be available in the United States. It is available in a fixed-dose combination with sofosbuvir. Ledipasvir is not recommended for treatment of HCV genotype 2 infection (since potency is lost in the presence of the highly prevalent L31M polymorphism) or genotype 3 (due to the availability of more efficacious therapies (see Table 49\u20137)."
