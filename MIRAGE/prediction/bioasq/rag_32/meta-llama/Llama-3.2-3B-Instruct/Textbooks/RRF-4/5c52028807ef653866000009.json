The key point to consider is the mechanism of mitochondrial inheritance in humans. Mitochondria are inherited exclusively from the mother, as they are passed down through the maternal line. This is because sperm cells contain very few mitochondria, if any, and the mitochondrial DNA is transferred from the mother to the fertilized egg during conception. The documents clearly state that mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited, and there is no evidence to suggest that mitochondria can be inherited from the father. Therefore, the answer to this question is that mitochondria cannot be inherited by both parents in humans.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

In some animals, including humans, the survival of multiple, dependent offspring is beyond the capacity and resources of a single parent. In this situation, the presence of a long-lived grandmother who shares in the care of her grandchildren can have a major impact on their survival. These children share some of the genes of their grandmother including those that promoted their grandmother\u2019s longevity. Mother\u2019s curse. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a key component of the aging process. Mitochondria contain their own DNA and are only passed on from mother to child because sperm cells contain almost no mitochondria.

Their daughters and sons will inherit this mixture of normal and mutant mitochondrial DNAs and be healthy unless the process of mitotic segregation results in a majority of defective mitochondria in a particular tissue.

Mitochondria contain their own extrachromosomal DNA, distinct from nuclear DNA. Mitochondrial DNA (\u201cthe other human genome\u201d) is a double-stranded, circular molecule that encodes the protein subunits required mainly for translation of the proteins located on the mitochondrial inner membrane. Of the 37 mitochondrial genes, small in number by comparison with nuclear DNA, 13 partake in the cellular processes of oxidative phosphorylation and the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A few genes in the cell\u2019s nucleus also code for a considerable number of oxidative enzymes of the mitochondria, but their inheritance follows a mendelian pattern; consequently, a mitochondrial disorder may fail to display maternal inheritance that is characteristic of mitochondrial mutations as described below."

Alterations in the mtDNA that involves enzymes required for oxidative phosphorylation lead to reduction of ATP supply, generation of free radicals, and induction of apoptosis. Several syndromic disorders arising from mutations in the mitochondrial genome are known in humans and they affect both protein-coding and tRNA genes (Chap. 85e). The broad clinical spectrum often involves (cardio) myopathies and encephalopathies because of the high dependence of these tissues on oxidative phosphorylation. The age of onset and the clinical course are highly variable because of the unusual mechanisms of mtDNA transmission, which replicates independently from nuclear DNA.

When a cell replicates, mitochondrial DNA sorts randomly into each of the daughter cells, a process termed replicative segregation. A consequence of replicative segregation is that any mitochondrial mutation will be propagated randomly into the daughter cells. Because each cell holds multiple copies of mitochondrial DNA, the mitochondrion may contain only normal or only abnormal DNA, termed homoplasmy. Alternatively, it may contain both normal and mutated DNA, namely heteroplasmy. If a heteroplasmic oocyte is fertilized, the relative proportion ofmutated DNA may afect whether the individual manifests a given mitochondrial disease. It is not possible to predict the potential degree of heteroplasmy among ofspring, and this poses challenges for genetic counseling."

The genetics of mitochondrial diseases differ from the genetics of chromosomal disorders. The DNA of mitochondria is directly inherited from the cytoplasm of the gametes, mainly from the oocyte. The sperm contributes very little of its mitochondria to the offspring at the time of fertilization.

This is explained by the transmission of virtually all mitochondria from the ovum at the time of conception. Moreover, mitochondrial DNA does not recombine, thus permitting the accumulation of mutations through maternal lines.

Mitochondrial inheritance in yeasts is therefore biparental: both parents contribute equally to the mitochondrial gene pool of the progeny. However, during the course of the subsequent asexual, vegetative growth, the mitochondria become distributed more or less randomly to daughter cells. After a few generations, the mitochondria of any given cell contain only the DNA from one or the other parent cell, because only a small sample of the mitochondrial DNA passes from the mother cell to the bud of the daughter cell. This process is known as mitotic segregation, and it gives rise to a distinct form of inheritance that is called non-Mendelian, or cytoplasmic inheritance, in contrast to the Mendelian inheritance of nuclear genes."

In these organisms, the egg cell contributes much more cytoplasm to the zygote than does the male gamete (sperm in animals, pollen in plants). For example, a typical human oocyte contains about 100,000 copies of maternal mitochondrial DNA, whereas a sperm cell contains only a few. In addition, an active process ensures that the sperm mitochondria do not compete with those in the egg. As sperm mature, the DNA is degraded in their mitochondria. Sperm mitochondria are also specifically recognized then eliminated from the fertilized egg cell by autophagy in very much the same way that damaged mitochondria are removed (by ubiquitylation followed by delivery to lysosomes, as discussed in Chapter 13). Because of these two processes, the mitochondrial inheritance in both animals and plants is uniparental. More precisely, the mitochondrial DNA passes from one generation to the next by maternal inheritance."

It is important to note that approximately 85 percent of the protein components of the respiratory chain are coded in nuclear DNA and are then imported into the mitochondrion; as mentioned above, this allows for a mitochondrial disease with a mendelian pattern of inheritance rather than a maternal one. Another of the general rules of mitochondrial inheritance is exemplified by an infantile myopathy (cytochrome oxidase deficiency) that is usually fatal but may also occur in a less severe form and have a later onset.

However, certain genes are unstable, and their size, and thus function, may be altered during parentto-child transmission.

            "content": "Considerations of reproductive fitness limit the evolutionary or population emergence of homoplasmic mutations that are lethal or cause severe disease in infancy or childhood. Thus, with a number of notable exceptions (e.g., mtDNA mutations causing Leber\u2019s hereditary optic neuropathy; see below), most homoplasmic mutations are considered to be neutral markers of human evolution, which are useful and interesting in the population genetics analysis of shared maternal ancestry but which have little significance in human phenotypic variation or disease predisposition."

            "content": "As noted below, because of the complex relationship between mtDNA mutations and disease expression, sometimes this maternal inheritance is difficult to recognize at the clinical or pedigree level. However, evidence of paternal transmission can almost certainly rule out an mtDNA genetic origin of phenotypic variation or disease; conversely, a disease affecting both sexes without evidence of paternal transmission strongly suggests a heritable mtDNA disorder (Fig. 85e-2).
