PDOs are three-dimensional cultures of cells derived from patient tissues, which can be used to study disease mechanisms and test new treatments. The key question is whether these PDOs can accurately reflect the complex interactions between the patient's cells and the tumor microenvironment, leading to responses similar to those observed in the clinic.\\n\\nDocument [11] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) states that successful derivation of cultured stem cells (both embryonic and tissue stem cells) often requires the identification of necessary growth factors and culture conditions, mimicking the microenvironment or niche of the resident stem cells. This suggests that PDOs can potentially recapitulate the complex interactions between patient cells and the tumor microenvironment.\\n\\nDocument [12] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) discusses the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) for drug discovery and analysis of genetic disease. The fact that iPS cells can be generated from a small sample of a patient's own tissue and can be used to test candidate drugs in vitro implies that PDOs may also be able to recapitulate patient responses.\\n\\nDocument [13] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) mentions the use of bioprinting to create three-dimensional structures, such as organoids, which can be used to study disease mechanisms and test new treatments. This technology is closely related to PDOs and suggests that they may be able to recapitulate patient responses.\\n\\nHowever, it is also important to consider the limitations of PDOs. Document [14] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) notes that the establishment of cultured stem cells is often under dispute due to difficulties in assessing the characteristics of these cells. This suggests that PDOs may not always be able to accurately recapitulate patient responses.\\n\\nBased on the available information, the answer to the question is that PDOs may be able to recapitulate patient responses in the clinic, but with some limitations.

One possible explanation is that, while most tumors express proteins that protect them from T-cell attack, these proteins are different for different tumors. Thus, while some tumors will respond dramatically when treated with an antibody that blocks a particular immunosuppressive agent, many others will not. If true, one can foresee an era of personalized immunotherapy, in which each patient\u2019s tumor is molecularly analyzed to determine its particular mechanisms of immunosuppression. The patient would then be treated with a specific cocktail of antibodies designed to remove these blocks (see Figure 20\u201345). Cancers Evolve Resistance to Therapies"

At present, response and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors are unpredictable, and new biomarkers are needed to better tailor therapies for individual patients. This will entail the development of new diagnostic tests to gauge both the host immune response and the likely means of immune evasion in individual cancers. There is reason to believe that immune checkpoint inhibitors may be more effective if given before the patient receives chemotherapy (which is immunosuppressive) or in combination with certain targeted therapies directed against tumor cells, and many well-designed clinical trials will need to be conducted before these questions are answered. Currently available immunotherapies are effective in some cancers but not others. Thus, there is a need for development of safe adaptive therapies that are"

Once such issues were considered, it became possible to design clinical trials that could document the effects of checkpoint blockade used in combination with traditional anticancer therapies."

We have seen in this book that the immune system can suppress its own responses in an antigen-specific manner and that, by studying these endogenous regulatory events, it has been possible to devise strategies to manipulate specific responses while sparing general immune competence. New treatments, including many monoclonal antibodies, have emerged as clinically important therapies to selectively suppress the responses that lead to allergy, autoimmunity, or the rejection of grafted organs.

Moreover, because these are tumors of functional T cells, patients often suffer from symptoms related to tumor-derived inflammatory products, even when the tumor burden is relatively low. Before ending our review of lymphoid neoplasms, it is worthwhile pausing to summarize the manner in which common driver mutations in specific entities produce changes in cellular behavior that exemplify particular hallmarks of cancer ( Fig. 12.25 ). Such alterations not only highlight important pathogenic principles, but are increasingly the targets of effective therapies, such as antibodies that block PD-1 (Hodgkin lymphoma) and drugs that antagonize BCL2 (follicular lymphoma and other B cell tumors)."
