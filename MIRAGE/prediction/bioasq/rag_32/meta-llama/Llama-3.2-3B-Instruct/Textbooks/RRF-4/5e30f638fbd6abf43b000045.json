    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the relevant documents and understand the concept of teplizumab and its potential role in diabetes prevention. Teplizumab is an antibody that depletes autoreactive lymphocytes, which can be beneficial in treating autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes. However, the question is asking about its potential for diabetes prevention, not treatment. Document [4] (Pharmacology_Katzung) mentions that metformin is useful in preventing type 2 diabetes, but it does not specifically mention teplizumab. Document [4] (Immunology_Janeway) discusses teplizumab as a treatment for type 1 diabetes, but not for prevention. Document [16] (Pharmacology_Katzung) mentions that intensive glycemic control can prevent microvascular complications of diabetes, but it does not mention teplizumab. However, Document [6] (Immunology_Janeway) mentions that monoclonal antibodies can be used to prevent allograft rejection, and Document [4] (Immunology_Janeway) discusses the mechanism of teplizumab, which is related to depleting autoreactive lymphocytes. This suggests that teplizumab may have a role in preventing autoimmune diseases, including diabetes. Document [16] (Pharmacology_Katzung) mentions that intensive glucose control can prevent microvascular complications of diabetes, but it does not specifically mention teplizumab. However, Document [4] (Immunology_Janeway) discusses the Fc region of teplizumab, which can activate Fc receptors and prevent cytokine release. This suggests that teplizumab may have a role in modulating the immune system and preventing autoimmune diseases, including diabetes. Based on this analysis, teplizumab may hold promise for diabetes prevention, but more research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in preventing diabetes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Because metformin is an insulin-sparing agent and does not increase body weight or provoke hypoglycemia, it offers obvious advantages over insulin or sulfonylureas in treating hyperglycemia in such persons. The UKPDS reported that metformin therapy decreases the risk of macrovascular as well as microvascular disease; this is in contrast to the other therapies, which only modified microvascular morbidity. Biguanides are also indicated for use in combination with insulin secretagogues or thiazolidinediones in type 2 diabetics in whom oral monotherapy is inadequate. Metformin is useful in the prevention of type 2 diabetes; the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program concluded that metformin is efficacious in preventing the new onset of type 2 diabetes in middle-aged, obese persons with impaired glucose tolerance and fasting hyperglycemia.

These benefits need to be weighed against the increased prevalence of hypoglycemia. Certainly, the level of glucose control (i.e., the HbA1c level) should be evaluated for each patient. Multicenter trials have demonstrated that individuals with recently diagnosed T1DM or T2DM can have better glycemic control with less hypoglycemia. In addition, there is still long-term benefit in reducing HbA1c values from higher to lower, albeit still above recommended levels. Perhaps a reasonable therapeutic goal is the lowest HbA1c level that does not cause severe hypoglycemia and that preserves awareness of hypoglycemia."

Somewhat surprisingly, all three studies found little or no benefit of intensive glucose control to reduce macrovascular events in T2DM. In fact, the ACCORD study was ended early because of the increased mortality rate in the intensive glucose control arm. Whether iatrogenic hypoglycemia was the cause of the increased mortality risk is not known. In light of these findings, some new recommendations and paradigms have been formulated. Whereas there is little debate regarding the need to reduce hyperglycemia in the hospital, the glycemic maintenance goals have been modified to lie between 140 and 180 mg/dL. Accordingly, the benefits of insulin therapy and reduced hyperglycemia can be obtained while the prevalence of hypoglycemia is reduced."

Intensive insulin treatment (see p. 340) delays the onset and slows the progression of some long-term complications. For example, the incidence of retinopathy decreases as control of blood glucose improves and HbA1c levels decrease (Fig. 25.12). [Note: Data concerning the effect of tight control on CVD in T2D are less clear.] The benefits of tight control of blood glucose outweigh the increased risk of severe hypoglycemia in most patients.

Although guidelines for hypertension control have recommended more aggressive blood pressure targets (e.g., office or clinic blood pressure <130/80 mmHg) for patients with diabetes, CHD, chronic kidney disease, or additional cardiovascular disease risk factors, recent evidence suggests that overly aggressive targets for blood pressure control may not be advantageous, particularly in high-risk patients. For example, among hypertensive patients with diabetes and coronary heart disease, \u201ctight"

CTLA-4-lgFc fusion protein (CTLA-4-lg, abatacept) binds to CD80/86 on DC and inhibits T-cell costimulation. Alefacept inhibits activation of T cells by blocking the interaction of LFA-3 and CD2. Basiliximab and daclizumab block IL-2 from binding to the IL-2 receptor (CD25) on T cells, preventing activation; CD25 is also important for the survival of T regulatory cells. T-cell activation can be maintained or restored if CTLA-4 interaction with CD80/86 is blocked using an anti\u2013CTLA-4 antibody (ipilimumab); ipilimumab inhibits CTLA-4 signaling and prolongs activation. Pembrolizumab and nivolumab bind to PD-1, while atezolizumab binds to PD-L1. Each of these three Mabs inhibits the negative signal delivery by PD-1, also prolonging T cell activation. release of IL-1\u03b2, causing autoimmune inflammation resulting in fever, urticarial-like rash, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, and conjunctivitis."

(2) Intensive glycemic control is beneficial in all forms of DM. (3) Blood pressure control is critical, especially in type 2 DM. (4) Survival in patients with type 1 DM is improving, and diabetes-related complications are declining. (5) Not all individuals with diabetes develop diabetes-related complications. Other incompletely defined factors appear to modulate the development of complications. For example, despite long-standing DM, some individuals never develop nephropathy or retinopathy. Many of these patients have glycemic control that is indistinguishable from those who develop microvascular complications, suggesting a genetic susceptibility for developing particular complications."

Individuals with prediabetes or increased risk of diabetes should be referred to a structured program to reduce body weight and increase physical activity as well as being screened for cardiovascular disease. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) demonstrated that intensive changes in lifestyle (diet and exercise for 30 min/d five times/week) in individuals with IGT prevented or delayed the development of type 2 DM by 58% compared to placebo. This effect was seen in individuals regardless of age, sex, or ethnic group. In the same study, metformin prevented or delayed diabetes by 31% compared to placebo. The lifestyle intervention group lost 5\u20137% of their body weight during the 3 years of the study. Studies in Finnish and Chinese populations noted similar efficacy of diet and exercise in preventing or delaying type 2 DM. A number"

This large multicenter clinical trial randomized more than 1400 individuals with type 1 DM to either intensive or conventional diabetes management and prospectively evaluated the development of diabetes-related complications during a mean follow-up of 6.5 years. Individuals in the intensive diabetes management group received multiple administrations of insulin each day (injection or pump) along with extensive educational, psychological, and medical support. Individuals in the conventional diabetes management group received twice-daily insulin injections and quarterly nutritional, educational, and clinical evaluation. The goal in the former group was normoglycemia; the goal in the latter group was prevention of symptoms of diabetes. Individuals in the intensive diabetes management group achieved a substantially"
