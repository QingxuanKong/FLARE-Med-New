Autophagy is a process in which cells digest their own components, such as organelles and proteins, to recycle them for energy and nutrients. However, the key question is whether viruses exploit this process to obtain nutrients from their host cells. Documents [0] and [4] describe autophagy as a process used by cells to recycle their own components, but do not mention viruses obtaining nutrients from their hosts. Documents [24] and [25] discuss the life cycle of viruses and their need for host cell machinery, but do not mention autophagy as a means for viruses to obtain nutrients. Documents [28] and [29] describe how viruses can evade the host's immune system and replicate within the host cell, but also do not mention autophagy as a mechanism for nutrient acquisition. Therefore, the available information does not support the claim that autophagy is the process by which a virus obtains nutrients from its host.

Autophagy can be either nonselective or selective. In nonselective autophagy, a bulk portion of cytoplasm is sequestered in autophagosomes. It might occur, for example, in starvation conditions: when external nutrients are limiting, metabolites derived from the digestion of the captured cytosol might help the cell survive. In selective autophagy specific cargo is packaged into autophagosomes that tend to contain little cytosol, and their shape reflects the shape of the cargo. Selective autophagy mediates the degradation of worn out, or otherwise unwanted, mitochondria, peroxisomes, ribosomes, and ER; it can also be used to destroy invading microbes.

In the last few years, applying genetic-screening tests originally developed for yeasts, researchers uncovered several autophagy-related genes (Atg genes) in mammalian cell genome. The presence of adequate nutrients and growth factors stimulates enzymatic activity of a serine/threonine kinase known as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). High mTOR activity exerts an inhibitory effect on autophagy. The opposite is found in nutrient starvation, hypoxia, and high temperature, where lack of mTOR activity causes activation of Atg genes. This results in formation of an Atg1 proteinkinase autophagy\u2013regulatory complex that initiates process of autophagy.

In addition to facilitating the turnover of aged and defunct cellular constituents, autophagy also is used to preserve cell viability during nutrient depletion. The significance of autophagy in cell biology was recognized by the award of the 2016 Nobel Prize to Yoshinori Ohsumi for his discoveries relating to the mechanism of autophagy.

It is a survival mechanism in times of nutrient deprivation, so that the starved cell can live by eating its own contents and recycling these contents to provide nutrients and energy. In this process, intracellular organelles and portions of cytosol are first sequestered within an ER-derived autophagic vacuole, whose formation is initiated by cytosolic proteins that sense nutrient deprivation ( Fig. 2.14 ). The vacuole fuses with lysosomes to form an autophagolysosome, in which lysosomal enzymes digest the cellular components. In some circumstances, autophagy may be associated with atrophy of tissues (discussed later) and may represent an adaptation that helps cells survive lean times. If, however, the starved cell can no longer cope by devouring its contents, autophagy may eventually lead to apoptotic cell death."

Tumor cells often seem to be able to grow under marginal environmental conditions without triggering autophagy, suggesting that the pathways that induce autophagy are deranged. In keeping with this, several genes that promote autophagy are tumor suppressors. Whether autophagy is always bad from the vantage point of the tumor, however, remains a matter of active investigation and debate. For example, under conditions of severe nutrient deprivation, tumor cells may use autophagy to become \u201cdormant,\u201d a state of metabolic hibernation that allows cells to survive hard times for long periods. Such cells are believed to be resistant to therapies that kill actively dividing cells, and could therefore be responsible for therapeutic failures."
