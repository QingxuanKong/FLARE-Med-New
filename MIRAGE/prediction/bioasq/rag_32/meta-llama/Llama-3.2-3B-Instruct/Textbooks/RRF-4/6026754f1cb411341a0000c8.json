Document [1] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) suggests that minocycline, when used in combination with hydroxychloroquine, might be effective in treating CNS disease, including CNS infections. Document [11] (Title: Neurology_Adams) indicates that minocycline can be used to treat CNS infections. However, there is no specific information about its effectiveness in treating Alzheimer disease. Document [16] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) mentions that minocycline can eradicate the meningococcal carrier state, but this is not relevant to Alzheimer disease. Document [10] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) provides information on the pharmacokinetics of minocycline, but does not mention its use in treating Alzheimer disease. Document [9] (Title: Neurology_Adams) discusses the general management of patients with Alzheimer disease, but does not specifically address the use of minocycline. Document [25] (Title: Psichiatry_DSM-5) provides diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer disease, but does not mention minocycline as a treatment option. Document [26] (Title: Neurology_Adams) discusses the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, but does not mention minocycline. Document [27] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) mentions that cholinesterase inhibitors are the first line of treatment for Alzheimer disease, but does not mention minocycline. Document [30] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) discusses the use of cholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimer disease, but does not mention minocycline. Based on the available information, there is no clear evidence to support the use of minocycline for mild Alzheimer disease. Therefore, the answer is not explicitly stated in the documents.

With regard to the latter group of drugs, several large trials have demonstrated a slight prolongation of the patient\u2019s ability to sustain an independent life, but such evidence generally requires that the medications be taken for 6 to 12 months. For example, a meta-analysis of the drugs collectively demonstrated a mean improvement of 2 to 3 points on the 70-point Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale and a slight delay in progression. Despite some trials that have failed to demonstrate benefit (c.f., AD 2000 Collaborative Group), the balance of evidence probably favors the use of these medications in practice, but only in mildly or moderately affected patients."

However, there is a suggestion that incidence rates for dementia in general are declining (see Satizabal et al) and it is likely that most of the cases are due to Alzheimer disease.

            "content": "Most individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease are elderly and have multiple medical conditions that can complicate diagnosis and in\ufb02uence the clinical course. Major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease commonly co-occurs with cerebrovascular disease, which contributes to the clinical picture. When a comorbid condition contributes to the NCD in an individual with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, then NCD due to multiple etiologies should be diagnosed. A. The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. B. The disturbance has insidious onset and gradual progression. C. Either (1) or (2): 1. Behavioral variant: a. Three or more of the following behavioral symptoms: i. Behavioraldisinhibition. ii. Apathy or inertia. iii. Loss of sympathy or empathy. v. Perseverative, stereotyped or compulsive/ritualistic behavior. v. Hyperorality and dietary changes. b. Prominent decline in social cognition and/or executive abilities."

            "content": "The EEG undergoes mild diffuse slowing, but only late in the course of the illness; it is useful again, in the exclusion of alternative causes of mental decline that manifest themselves in seizure activity or changes typical of metabolic encephalopathy. The CSF is also normal, although occasionally the total protein concentration is slightly elevated. Using the constellation of clinical data, cerebral imaging in the context of the age of the patient and time course of the disease, the diagnosis of dementia of Alzheimer type is made correctly in 85 to 90 percent of cases."

            "content": "Tacrine (tetrahydroaminoacridine, THA), a long-acting cholinesterase inhibitor and muscarinic modulator, was the first drug shown to have any benefit in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Because of its hepatic toxicity, tacrine has been replaced in clinical use by newer cholinesterase inhibitors: donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine. These agents are orally active, have adequate penetration into the central nervous system, and are much less toxic than tacrine. Although evidence for the benefit of cholinesterase inhibitors (and memantine; see below) is statistically significant, the amount of benefit is modest and does not prevent the progression of the disease. The cholinesterase inhibitors cause significant adverse effects, including nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and other peripheral cholinomimetic effects. These drugs should be used with caution in patients receiving other drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes (eg, ketoconazole, quinidine; see Chapter 4). Preparations available are"

            "content": "A number of other tests that measure the degree of dementia (usually carrying the names of their originators: Roth, Pfeiffer, Blessed, Mattis) rely essentially on the points mentioned previously and a brief assessment of the patient\u2019s ability to accomplish the activities of daily living, which is lost in the later stages of disease. For serial measurement specifically for those with Alzheimer disease, a number of systems have been devised as reviewed in Chap. 38. Among the most commonly used is the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog). It is more comprehensive than the others and takes longer to administer."
