Thus, for example, the cells of a basal-cell carcinoma, derived from a keratinocyte stem cell in the skin, generally continue to synthesize cytokeratin intermediate filaments, whereas the cells of a melanoma, derived from a pigment cell in the skin, will often (but not always) continue to make pigment granules. Cancers originating from different cell types are, in general, very different diseases. Basal-cell carcinomas of the skin, for example, are only locally invasive and rarely metastasize, whereas melanomas can become much more malignant and often form metastases. Basal-cell carcinomas are readily cured by surgery or local irradiation, whereas malignant melanomas, once they have metastasized widely, are usually fatal."

A genome-wide assessment of melanomas classified into four groups based on their location and degree of exposure to the sun has confirmed that there are distinct genetic pathways in the development of melanoma. The four groups were cutaneous melanomas on skin without chronic sun-induced damage, cutaneous melanomas with chronic sun-induced damage, mucosal melanomas, and acral melanomas. Distinct patterns of DNA alterations were noted that varied with the site of origin and were independent of the histologic subtype of the tumor. Thus, although the genetic changes are diverse, the overall pattern of mutation, amplification, and loss of cancer genes indicates they have convergent effects on key biochemical pathways"

This is likely because it is ingested and presented by cells expressing MHC class II molecules. Both CD4 and CD8 T cells are likely to be important in achieving immunological control of tumors.

Patients with metastatic melanoma who were treated with ipilimumab showed an increase in the number and activity of T cells recognizing NY-ESO-1, a cancer-testis antigen expressed by melanoma. Overall only about 15% of patients exhibited a response to ipilimumab, but the treatment appeared to induce long-term remission in responding patients. One side-effect of ipilimumab in these patients seemed to be an increased risk of autoimmune phenomena, in agreement with the role of CTLA-4 in maintaining tolerance of self-reactive T cells."

DNA sequencing of familial and sporadic cases, including cases that appear to have arisen from benign nevi, has provided important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of melanoma ( Fig. 24.22 ). The initiating event appears to be an activating mutation in BRAF or (less commonly) RAS. In the vast majority of cases, this produces only a benign nevus unless other mutations are superimposed. Sequencing of nevi with \u201catypical\u201d morphologic features suggestive of melanoma as well as melanomas in the radial phase of growth (melanoma in situ) has shown that they commonly harbor mutations that activate the expression of telomerase, which is proposed to serve as an antidote to senescence (the usual fate of benign nevi). With additional mutations or epigenetic aberrations that lead to loss of"
