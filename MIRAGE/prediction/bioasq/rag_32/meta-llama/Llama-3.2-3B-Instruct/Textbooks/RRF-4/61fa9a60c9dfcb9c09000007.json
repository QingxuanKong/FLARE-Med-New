The European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer 3 (ESPAC-3) trial, which investigated the benefit of adjuvant 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (5-FU/FA) versus gemcitabine, revealed no survival difference between the two drugs. However, the toxicity profile of adjuvant gemcitabine was superior to 5-FU/FA by virtue of its lower incidence of stomatitis and diarrhea. Adjuvant radiotherapy is not commonly used in Europe based on the negative results of the ESPAC-1 study. Adjuvant 5-FU-based CRT with gemcitabine before and after radiotherapy as used in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 97-04 trial is preferred in the United States. This approach may be most beneficial in patients with bulky tumors involving the pancreatic head."

            "content": "In addition to its antitumor effects, ipilimumab\u2019s interference with normal regulatory mechanisms produced a novel spectrum of side effects that resembled autoimmunity. The most common immune-related adverse events were skin rash and diarrhea (sometimes severe, life-threatening colitis), but toxicity could involve most any organ (e.g., hypophysitis, hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, neuritis). Vigilance and early treatment with steroids that do not appear to interfere with the antitumor effects are required to manage these patients safely. Widespread use of ipilimumab has not been completely embraced by the oncology community because of the low objective response rate, significant toxicity (including death), and high cost (drug cost alone for a course of therapy is approximately $120,000 in 2013). Despite these reservations, ipilimumab\u2019s overall survival benefit (17% of patients alive at 7 years) indicates that treatment should be strongly considered for all eligible"

Alternatively, other experts recommend surgery based on tumor size, using either >1 cm or >3 cm at different centers. Pancreatoduodenal surgery is successful in removing the tumors in 80% of patients, but more than 40% of patients develop complications, including diabetes mellitus, frequent steatorrhea, early and late dumping syndromes, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. However, ~50\u201360% of patients treated surgically survive >5 years. When considering these recommendations, it is important to consider that occult metastatic disease (e.g., tumors not detected by imaging investigations) is likely to be present in a substantial proportion of these patients at the time of presentation. Inhibitors of tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs) and of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway have been reported to be effective in treating pancreatic NETs and in doubling the progression-free"

In light of the observation that in many instances tumor growth is indolent and that many individuals with metastatic disease remain relatively stable for significant periods of time, many advocate not instituting systemic tumor-targeted therapy until evidence of tumor progression or refractory symptoms not controlled with PPIs are noted. Medical approaches, including biological therapy (IFN-\u03b1, long-acting somatostatin analogues, peptide receptor radionuclides), systemic chemotherapy (streptozotocin, 5-fluorouracil, and doxorubicin), and hepatic artery embolization, may lead to significant toxicity without a substantial improvement in overall survival. 111In-pentetreotide has been used in the therapy of metastatic neuroendocrine tumors; further studies are needed. Several novel therapies are being explored, including radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation of liver lesions and use of"

In a patient with appropriate clinical and/or imaging indications of pancreatic cancer, a tissue diagnosis before performing a pancreaticoduo-denectomy is not essential. Although percutaneous CT-guided biopsy is usually safe, complications such as hemorrhage, pan-creatitis, fistula, and abscess can occur. Tumor seeding along the subcutaneous tract of the needle is uncommon. Likewise, FNA under EUS guidance is safe and well tolerated. The prob-lem with preoperative or even intraoperative biopsy is that many pancreatic cancers are not very cellular and contain a significant amount of fibrous tissue, so a biopsy may be misinterpreted as showing chronic pancreatitis if it does not contain malignant glandular cells. In the face of clinical and radiologic preoperative indications of pancreatic cancer, a negative biopsy should not preclude resection. In patients who are not candidates for resec-tion because of metastatic"
