Methylation is by methyltransferases that use S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor (Fig. 33.17).

Initial transcript is called heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). hnRNA is then modified and becomes mRNA. The following processes occur in the nucleus: Capping of 5\u2032 end (addition of 7-methylguanosine cap) Polyadenylation of 3\u2032 end (\u2248 200 As) Splicing out of introns Capped, tailed, and spliced transcript is called mRNA. mRNA is transported out of nucleus to be translated in cytosol."

            "content": "1. Shine-Dalgarno sequence: In Escherichia coli (E. coli), a purine-rich sequence of nucleotide bases, known as the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, is located six to ten bases upstream of the initiating AUG codon on the mRNA molecule (that is, near its 5\u2032-end). The 16S rRNA component of the small (30S) ribosomal subunit has a nucleotide sequence near its 3\u2032-end that is complementary to all or part of the SD sequence. Therefore, the 5\u2032-end of the mRNA and the 3\u2032-end of the 16S rRNA can form complementary base pairs, facilitating the positioning of the 30S subunit on the mRNA in close proximity to the initiating AUG codon (Fig. 32.10). 2."

            "content": "21\u201314 The segmentation of somites in vertebrate embryos is thought to depend on oscillations in the expression of the Hes7 gene. Mathematical modeling explains these oscillations in terms of the delays in production of the unstable Hes7 protein, which acts as a transcription regulator to shut off its own expression. Once Hes7 decays, with a half-life of about 20 minutes, its transcription resumes. To test this model, you decide to reduce the total delay by removing one, two, or all three of the introns from the Hes7 gene in mice. Why do you expect that intron removal would reduce the delay? What would you predict would happen to the oscillation time, and somite formation, if the model were correct?"
