Higher doses and a longer duration of therapy were associated with a higher risk of valvulopathy. It is postulated that 5HT2b-receptor stimulation leads to fibromyoblast proliferation (298). A recent cross-sectional study showed a higher rate of asymptomatic tricuspid regurgitation among cabergoline-treated patients compared to untreated patients with newly diagnosed prolactinomas as well as normal controls (299,300).

            "content": "Nelson syndrome results from adenomatous progression of ACTH-secreting cells in patients with Cushing syndrome treated by bilateral adrenalectomy. The macroadenoma that causes this syndrome produces sellar pressure symptoms of headaches, visual field disturbances, and ophthalmoplegia. Extremely high ACTH levels in Nelson syndrome are associated with severe hyper-pigmentation (melanocyte-stimulating hormone activity). The treatment is surgical removal or radiation. The offending adenomatous tissue is often resistant to complete surgical removal (173). This syndrome reportedly complicates 10% to 50% of bilateral adrenalectomy cases. Measuring pituitary MRI and ACTH plasma levels at regular intervals after bilateral adrenalectomy will allow detection of the early progression of corticotroph tumors and the possibility of cure by surgery, particularly with microadenomas (155). Nelson syndrome is less common today because bilateral adrenalectomy is less frequently used as initial treatment."

If 17\u03b1-hydroxylase deficiency is confirmed, treatment is instituted with corticosteroid replacement and estrogen. Progestogen should be added to protect the endometrium from hyperplasia. If possible, therapeutic measures are aimed at correcting the primary cause of amenorrhea: 1. Craniopharyngiomas may be resected with a transsphenoidal approach or during craniotomy, depending on the size of the tumor. Some studies show improved prognosis with radiation therapy used in combination with limited tumor removal (38,53). 2. Germinomas are highly radiosensitive, and surgery is rarely indicated (54). 3. Prolactinomas and hyperprolactinemia often may respond to dopamine agonists (bromocriptine or cabergoline) (55). 4."

            "content": "The valvular heart disease caused by the appetite-suppressant drug dexfenfluramine is histologically indistinguishable from that observed in carcinoid disease. Furthermore, ergot-containing dopamine receptor agonists used for Parkinson\u2019s disease (pergolide, cabergoline) cause valvular heart disease that closely resembles that seen in the carcinoid syndrome. Furthermore, in animal studies, the formation of valvular plaques/fibrosis occurs after prolonged treatment with serotonin as well as in animals with a deficiency of the 5-HIAA transporter gene, which results in an inability to inactivate serotonin. Metabolites of fenfluramine, as well as the dopamine receptor agonists, have high affinity for serotonin receptor subtype 5-HT2B receptors, whose activation is known to cause fibroblast mitogenesis. Serotonin receptor subtypes normally are expressed in human heart valve intersti- 5-HT1B,1D,2A,2B tial cells. High levels of 5-HT2B receptors are known to occur in heart valves and occur in"

In clinical trials, the drug lowered plasma ACTH levels, normalized 24-h urinary free cortisol levels in about 25% of patients, and resulted in up to 40% mean pituitary tumor shrinkage. Side effects include development of enlargement and increased pigmentation secondary to high ACTH 2273 levels.
