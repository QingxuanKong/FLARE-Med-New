Epidemiologic studies have not revealed a consistent relationship between serum testosterone and prostate cancer. In a landmark randomized trial, testosterone therapy of older men with low testosterone did not affect intraprostatic androgen levels or the expression of androgen-dependent prostatic genes. The suppression of circulating testosterone levels by a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist also does not affect intraprostatic androgen concentrations. Open-label trials and retrospective analyses of testosterone therapy in men with prostate cancer, who have undergone radical prostatectomy 7e-5 and have undetectable PSA levels after radical prostatectomy, have found very low rates of PSA recurrence. Even in men with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN)\u2014a group at high risk of developing prostate cancer\u2014testosterone therapy for 1 year did not increase PSA or rates of prostate cancer."

Androgen receptor signaling plays a central role in maintaining growth of normal prostate and prostate cancer. PSA levels are lower in hypogonadal men and increase after testosterone therapy.

This dependence on androgens extends to established cancers, which often regress for a time in response to surgical or chemical castration. Notably, tumors that are resistant to anti-androgen therapy often acquire androgen receptor gene amplifications or mutations that permit androgen receptors to activate the expression of their target genes despite therapy. Thus, tumors that recur in the face of anti-androgen therapies still depend on gene products regulated by androgen receptors for their growth and survival. However, while prostate cancer, like normal prostate, is dependent on androgens for its survival, there is no evidence that androgens initiate carcinogenesis, nor are androgen levels associated with prostate cancer risk."

Because of the peripheral location, prostate cancer is less likely than BPH to cause urethral obstruction in its initial stages.

PSA is a product of prostatic epithelium and is normally secreted in the semen. Although PSA screening can detect prostate cancers early in their course, studies of the natural history of the disease (so-called \u201cwatch-and-wait studies\u201d) have confirmed that many prostate cancers are clinically insignificant, requiring no treatment, sometimes for decades. Overtreatment of these indolent cancers can cause significant morbidity, particularly erectile dysfunction and incontinence. A second limitation of PSA as a biomarker is that it is not cancer-specific. BPH, prostatitis, prostatic infarcts, instrumentation of the prostate, and ejaculation all may increase serum PSA levels. Conversely, 20% to 40% of patients with organ-confined prostate cancer have PSA values below the cutoffs that are used to identify patients who are likely to have prostate cancer."

Medications that lower serum testosterone or androgen receptor blockers are able to control the disease, often for years. In addition, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radioisotope therapy at different stages of the disease increase the life expectancy of the patients or improve the quality of life. The cancer inevitably becomes resis-tant to these treatments. Nevertheless, patients with incurable prostate cancer can live many years, and a large number die of causes other than prostate cancer.Over the past few years, we have witnessed major devel-opments in the management of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). New agents that interrupt androgen synthesis (e.g., abiraterone acetate)139,140 and new modulators of androgen receptors (e.g., enzalutamide)141,142 have significantly improved the life expectancy of patients with both androgen sensitive and"
