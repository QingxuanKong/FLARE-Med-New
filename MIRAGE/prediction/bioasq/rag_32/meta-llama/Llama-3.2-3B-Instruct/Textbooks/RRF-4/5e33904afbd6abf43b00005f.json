            "content": "History of Cancer Women with a history of breast cancer have a 50% risk of developing microscopic cancer and a 20% to 25% risk of developing clinically apparent cancer in the contralateral breast, which occurs at a rate of 1% to 2% per year (16). Lobular carcinoma has a higher incidence of bilaterality than does ductal carcinoma. A history of endometrial, ovarian, or colon cancer is associated with an increased risk of subsequent breast cancer, as is a history of radiation therapy for Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, even if the patient is BRCA1 and BRCA2 negative."

There is an approximately 90% 5-year overall survival rate, approaching 100% for low-risk patients and 70% to 90% for high-riskpatients. For NHL prognosis also is related to stage. The overall3-year survival rates for B-cell, T-cell, and large cell NHL are70% to 90%."
