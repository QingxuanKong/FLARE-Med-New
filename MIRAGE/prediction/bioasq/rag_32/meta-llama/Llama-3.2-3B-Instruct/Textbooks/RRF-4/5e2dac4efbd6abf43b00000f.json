The drug has an interesting history that includes many early trials that failed to persuade neurologists of its effectiveness; Barbeau\u2019s paper on this historical subject may be consulted by the interested reader. Most patients tolerate the drug initially, experiencing few serious adverse effects and showing various degrees of improvement, sometimes dramatic, especially in hypokinesia and tremor after several days or sooner. However, the side effects and limitations of l-dopa become considerable as the drug therapy continues and the disease progresses, as discussed below."

(2) When to initiate symptomatic therapy: There is a trend toward initiating therapy at the time of diagnosis or early in the course of the disease because patients may have some disability even at an early stage, and there is the possibility that early treatment may preserve beneficial compensatory mechanisms; however, some experts recommend waiting until there is functional disability before initiating therapy.

A marked response to these drugs should, of course, suggest the diagnosis of Parkinson disease. Recently, the drug zolpidem, a gabanergic agonist of benzodiazepine receptors, has been reported to ameliorate the akinesia and rigidity of PSP (Daniele et al); however, these observations require corroboration. Benztropine or trihexyphenidyl has been somewhat helpful in reducing dystonia but botulinum injections may be a better alternative if there are focal signs. Treatments of the sleep difficulties and urinary incontinence are of great assistance to the patient and family. A feeding tube becomes necessary in advanced cases.

This may first be treated by reducing the dose of the drug. If this is not tolerated, the atypical neuroleptics olanzapine, clozapine, risperidone, or quetiapine may be given in low doses. The side effects of these drugs include sleepiness, orthostatic hypotension, and sialorrhea.

The usual daily dose of bromocriptine for parkinsonism varies between 7.5 and 30 mg. To minimize adverse effects, the dose is built up slowly over 2 or 3 months depending on response or the development of adverse reactions. Pergolide, another ergot derivative, directly stimulates both D1 and D2 receptors.

Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of the main drugs used in the treatment of Parkinson disease are understandable in the context of neurotransmitter function. To correct the basic dopamine deficiency from a loss of nigral cells that underlies Parkinson disease, attempts were at first made to administer dopamine directly. However, dopamine as such cannot cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and therefore has no therapeutic effect. But its immediate precursor, L-dopa, does cross the blood\u2013barrier and is effective in decreasing the symptoms of Parkinson disease as well as of the above-described MPTP-induced parkinsonism. This effect is enhanced by the addition of an inhibitor of dopadecarboxylase, an important enzyme in the catabolism of dopamine. The addition of an enzyme"

The standard dosage is 1 mg/d. Rasagiline is also used as adjunctive therapy at a dosage of 0.5 or 1 mg/d to prolong the effects of carbidopa-levodopa in patients with advanced disease and response fluctuations. A large double-blind, placebo-controlled, delayed-start study (the ADAGIO trial) to evaluate whether it had neuroprotective benefit (ie, slowed the disease course) yielded unclear results: a daily dose of 1 mg met all the end points of the study and did seem to slow disease progression, but a 2-mg dose failed to do so. These findings are difficult to explain and the decision to use rasagiline for neuroprotective purposes therefore remains an individual one."

Moreover, the benefits of levodopa therapy often diminish as the disease advances, and serious adverse effects may complicate longterm levodopa treatment. Nevertheless, dopaminergic therapy at a relatively early stage may be most effective in alleviating motor symptoms of parkinsonism and may also favorably affect the mortality rate due to the disease. Therefore, several strategies have evolved for optimizing dopaminergic therapy, as summarized in Figure 28\u20135. Symptomatic treatment of mild parkinsonism is probably best avoided until there is some degree of disability or functional limitation or until symptoms begin to impact the patient\u2019s lifestyle or cause significant social impairment."

The other parkinsonian syndromes are for the most part changed only slightly or only for a few weeks or months by the drug. Conversely, although some experts disagree, we have adhered to the notion that complete resistance of the symptoms to l-dopa early in the illness makes the diagnosis unlikely. Furthermore, almost all patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease eventually acquire dyskinesias in response to l-dopa and the complete absence of this sign after approximately 3 to 5 years of use of the drug also brings the diagnosis into question."

The use of the centrally acting anticholinesterase, donepezil, is being explored for a possible effect on improving gait stability but requires further study.

Other agents in this class, notably rasagiline, have given similar mixed results in brief studies including the ADAGIO trial reported by Olanow and coworker. The difficulty in assessing the benefit of these agents has to do with their mild but definite symptomatic benefit on motor function.

Although useful in the treatment of frankly psychotic patients, these drugs tend to be far less effective once dementia has supervened. The antiepileptic drug, valproate is also said to be useful in this circumstance, but it has not been as effective as clozapine and related drugs. Despite its lesser tendency to produce rigidity, olanzapine, and probably the other similar agents, in high doses may slightly worsen motor disability."

            "content": "Dopamine agonists These drugs have a direct dopaminergic effect on striatal neurons, thereby partially bypassing the depleted nigral neurons. They have found a place both as the initial treatment, replacing l-dopa in this role, and in modulating the effects of l-dopa later in the illness. However, dopamine agonists are less potent than l-dopa in managing the main features of Parkinson disease and, in higher doses and in older individuals, they produce undesirable motor and cognitive side effects (see further on). They are favored because they are associated with fewer dyskinetic motor complications, or at least, delay the need for l-dopa and its dyskinetic effects. Bromocriptine and lisuride are synthetic ergot derivatives whose action in Parkinson disease is explained by their direct stimulating effect on dopamine (D2) receptors located on striate neurons. The nonergot dopamine agonists ropinirole and pramipexole have a similar type and duration of effectiveness and are used more"
