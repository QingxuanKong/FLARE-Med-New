In eukaryotic genes, introns are non-coding regions that are removed during RNA splicing to form a mature messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. The remaining exons are the coding regions that are eventually translated into a protein. Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, can affect gene expression by altering the structure of chromatin, which is the complex of DNA and proteins that make up chromosomes. These changes can influence the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors and the initiation of transcription. In some cases, epigenetic modifications can also affect the splicing of RNA, including the removal of introns. Therefore, it is possible that the epigenetic status of introns can affect gene expression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Such changes involve posttranslational modifications of histones and DNA methylation, both of which affect gene expression. In normal, differentiated cells, the major portion of the genome is not expressed. These regions of the genome are silenced by DNA methylation and histone modifications. On the other hand, cancer cells are characterized by a global DNA hypomethylation and selective promoter-localized hypermethylation. Indeed, it has become evident during the past several years that tumor suppressor genes are sometimes silenced by hypermethylation of promoter sequences, rather than by mutation. In addition, genome-wide hypomethylation has been shown to cause chromosomal instability and can induce tumors in mice. Thus, epigenetic changes may influence carcinogenesis in many ways.

These modifications have many functions, inasmuch as they serve as recognition sites for protein domains that link specific protein complexes to different regions of chromatin.
