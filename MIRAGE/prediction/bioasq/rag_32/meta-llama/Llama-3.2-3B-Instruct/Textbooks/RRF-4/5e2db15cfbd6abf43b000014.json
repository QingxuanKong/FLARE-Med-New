While some physicians use amantadine in patients with early disease for its mild symptomatic effects, it is most widely used as an antidyskinesia agent in patients with advanced PD. Indeed, it is the only oral agent that has been demonstrated in controlled studies to reduce dyskinesia without worsening parkinsonian features, although benefits may be relatively transient. Cognitive impairment is a major concern. Other side effects include livido reticularis and weight gain.
