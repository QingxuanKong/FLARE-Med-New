The provided documents do not explicitly mention Sotatercept, but we can infer some information about its potential effectiveness based on the context of the documents. Sotatercept is a type of therapeutic lymphangiogenesis inhibitor, which is being studied for the treatment of lymphedema. However, this information is not directly relevant to PAH. On the other hand, the documents mention endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, and other medications that are used to treat PAH. Given that Sotatercept is not mentioned in the context of PAH treatment, we can conclude that it is unlikely to be effective for this condition. Therefore, the correct answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The advent of ACE inhibitors in scleroderma renal crisis had a dramatic impact on survival, increasing from <10% at 1 year in the pre\u2013ACE inhibitor era to >70% 3-year survival at the present time. Moreover, 10-year survival inSSc has improvedfrom<60%inthe 1970s to >66\u201378%inthe 1990s, a trend that reflects both earlier detection and better management of complications."

            "content": "Treatment involves general supportive care; correction of hypotension, anemia, and acidosis; and management of complications associated with asphyxia. If myocardial dysfunction is present, dopamine or dobutamine is needed. The most important therapy for PPHN is assisted ventilation. Reversible mild pulmonary hypertension may respond to conventional assisted ventilation. Patients with severe PPHN do not always respond to conventional therapy. Paralysis with a muscle relaxant may be needed to assist vigorous ventilation. Surfactant replacement seems to have no effect when PPHN is the primary diagnosis. If mechanical ventilation and supportive care are unsuccessful in improving oxygenation, inhaled nitric oxide, a selective pulmonary artery vasodilating agent, should be administered. If hypoxia persists, the patient may be a candidate for ECMO. Infants who require extremely high ventilator settings, marked by an alveolar-to-arterial oxygen gradient greater than 620 mm Hg, have a high"
