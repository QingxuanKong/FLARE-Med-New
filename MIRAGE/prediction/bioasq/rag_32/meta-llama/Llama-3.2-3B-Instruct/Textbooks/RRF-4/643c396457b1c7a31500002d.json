The provided documents do not specifically mention COVID-19, but they do discuss various infectious diseases and the medications used to prevent or treat them. However, based on general knowledge and current information, there are medications available to prevent COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bamlanivimab and etesevimab, and vaccines, such as mRNA-based vaccines, have been developed and are being used to prevent COVID-19. Additionally, antiviral medications, such as remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, have been used to treat COVID-19. However, these medications are not specifically mentioned in the provided documents. Therefore, the correct answer is not explicitly stated in the documents, but based on general knowledge, medications are available to prevent COVID-19.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Health care workers can minimize their risk of occupational HIV infection by following the CDC guidelines of July 1991, which include adherence to universal precautions, refraining from direct patient care if one has exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis, and disinfecting and sterilizing reusable devices employed in invasive procedures."

A careful exposure history must be obtained to attempt to identify the potential offending antigen and to identify the location where a patient is exposed. Once a potential antigen and location are identified, efforts should be made to modify the environment to minimize patient exposure. This may be accomplished with measures such as removal of birds, removal of molds, and improved ventilation. Personal protective equipment including respirators and ventilated helmets can be used but may not provide adequate protection for sensitized individuals. In some cases, fully avoiding specific environments may be necessary, although such a recommendation must be balanced against the effects to an individual\u2019s lifestyle or occupation.

            "content": "Nerve biopsies have variably revealed necrotizing vasculitis, inflammatory cell infiltrates, and focal nerve fiber destruction. Usually, the CSF protein is normal and there is no cellular reaction. The few times a dorsal root ganglion has been examined in autopsy material; there were infiltrates of mononuclear cells and lymphocytes and destruction of nerve cells. Treatment Corticosteroids in doses of approximately 60 mg daily of prednisone, cyclophosphamide (100 mg per day), and rituximab (1,000 mg per day, 2 weeks apart) have been used when the neuropathy is severe and are indicated when there is vasculitis involving renal and pulmonary structures. We have initially administered prednisone 60 mg daily, sometimes in tandem with intermittent plasma exchange, but with little evidence of response, before adding a second immunosuppressive agent. The review of the neurologic manifestations of Sj\u00f6gren syndrome by Lafitte and by Berkowitz and colleagues are recommended."
