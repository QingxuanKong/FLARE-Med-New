According to Document [0], salivary \u03b1-amylase initiates the digestion of dietary polysaccharides, including starch and glycogen, in the mouth. However, this enzyme is not active in honey. Document [1] does not mention diastases or amylases in honey. Document [4] describes the role of pancreatic \u03b1-amylase in the digestion of starch and glycogen, but it does not mention honey. Document [9] lists the sources of dietary carbohydrates, including fruits, but does not mention honey. Document [19] explains that \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose and miglitol, are used to slow the production of glucose from dietary carbohydrates, but it does not mention diastases or amylases in honey. Document [20] describes the role of enzymes in carbohydrate digestion, but does not mention honey. Document [29] lists the action of intestinal disaccharidases, including isomaltase, maltase, sucrase, and lactase, but does not mention diastases or amylases in honey. However, Document [5] states that fructose is found in honey, and Document [6] explains that fructose is a ketose with a furanose ring. Given this information, it is likely that honey contains diastases/amylases, as it is a source of fructose. However, the documents do not explicitly state that honey contains diastases/amylases. Therefore, the correct answer is not explicitly supported by the provided documents. However, based on the presence of fructose in honey, it is likely that honey contains diastases/amylases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

            "content": "The acinar cell is highly compartmentalized and is concerned with the secretion of pancreatic enzymes. Proteins synthesized by the rough endoplasmic reticulum are processed in the Golgi and then targeted to the appropriate site, whether that be zymogen granules, lysosomes, or other cell compartments. The zymogen granules migrate to the apical region of the acinar cell awaiting the appropriate neural or hormonal stimulatory response. The pancreas secretes amylolytic, lipolytic, and proteolytic enzymes into the duct lumen. Amylolytic enzymes, such as amylase, hydrolyze starch to oligosaccharides and to the disaccharide maltose. The lipolytic enzymes include lipase, phospholipase A2, and cholesterol esterase. Bile salts inhibit lipase in isolation, but colipase, another constituent of pancreatic secretion, binds to lipase and prevents this inhibition. Bile salts activate phospholipase A and cholesterol esterase. Proteolytic enzymes include endopeptidases (trypsin, chymotrypsin), which"

There are also mucous cells in the acinus; the granules in these cells are larger and contain the specialized glycoprotein mucin. There are three kinds of ducts in the gland that transport secretions from the acinus to the opening in the mouth and also modify the secretion: intercalated ducts drain acinar fluid into larger \u2022BOX 28.1FunctionsofSalivaandChewing"

            "content": "C. Intestinal disaccharidases The final digestive processes occur primarily at the mucosal lining of the duodenum and upper jejunum and include the action of several disaccharidases (see Fig. 7.9). For example, isomaltase cleaves the \u03b1(1\u21926) bond in isomaltose, and maltase cleaves the \u03b1(1\u21924) bond in maltose and maltotriose, each producing glucose. Sucrase cleaves the \u03b1(1\u21922) bond in sucrose, producing glucose and fructose, and lactase (\u03b2-galactosidase) cleaves the \u03b2(1\u21924) bond in lactose, producing galactose and glucose. [Note: The substrates for isomaltase are broader than its name suggests, and it hydrolyzes the majority of maltose.] Trehalose, an \u03b1(1\u21921) disaccharide of glucose found in mushrooms and other fungi, is cleaved by trehalase. These enzymes are transmembrane proteins of the brush border on the luminal (apical) surface of the enterocytes."

            "content": "remains a difficult clinical problem. One study found that serum amylase levels were elevated in patients with renal dysfunction only when creatinine clearance was <0.8 mL/s (<50 mL/min). In such patients, the serum amylase level was invariably <500 IU/L in the absence of objective evidence of acute pancreatitis. In that study, serum lipase and trypsin levels paralleled serum amylase values. With these limitations in mind, the recommended screening test for acute pancreatitis in renal disease is serum lipase."

            "content": "The pancreas is an elongated extramural digestive gland with a head nestled in the C-shaped bend of the duodenum, a body that crosses the midline of the abdomen, and a tail extending across the back of the abdomen. It is a mixed gland containing both an exocrine component and an endocrine component that have distinctive characteristics. The exocrine component is a compound tubuloacinar gland with a branching network of ducts that convey the exocrine secretions to the duodenum. These secretions consist primarily of inactive forms of potent prote-olytic enzymes, as well as amylase, lipase, nucleases, and electrolytes, particularly HCO3 . The endocrine component is isolated as highly vascularized islets of epithelioid tissue (islets of Langerhans). The islet cells secrete a va-riety of polypeptide and protein hormones, most notably insulin and glucagon, which regulate glucose metabolism throughout the other tis-sues of the body. Other hormones secreted by islet cells include"
