The voice is low-pitched and monotonous, lacking both inflection and volume (hypophonia), and trailing off in volume at the ends of sentences. Words are spoken hastily and run together in a pattern that is almost the opposite of the slowed pattern of spastic dysarthria. In advanced cases, speech is whispered and almost unintelligible. It may happen that the patient finds it impossible to talk while walking but can speak better if standing still, sitting, or lying down. In the extrapyramidal disorder of progressive supranuclear palsy, the dysarthria and dysphonia tend instead to be spastic in nature."

In patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (discussed in Chap. 38), where dystonia of the neck is combined with paralysis of vertical gaze and pseudobulbar features, unexplained unanticipated toppling is an early and prominent feature. The falls of progressive supranuclear palsy may derive from a disorder of the righting mechanism.

Toppling to one side is a feature of the lateral medullary syndrome, usually from infarction."

In Huntington\u2019s disease (Chap. 449), the unpredictable occurrence of choreic movements gives the gait a dancing quality.

Many patients in the early stages of the disease complain of fragmented and unrestful sleep, particularly in the early morning hours; some advanced cases have pathologic insomnia, and this is influenced also by medications used to treat the disease and by deep brain stimulation (see Chap. 39 for a discussion of the nonmotor effects of Parkinson disease). The loss of natural body movements and the alerting effects of l-dopa contribute to the insomnia. The directly acting dopaminergic agonist drugs used for the treatment of Parkinson disease may have the side effect of a pronounced and often rapid daytime sleepiness; however, a similar problem arises in some patients with advancing disease alone.
