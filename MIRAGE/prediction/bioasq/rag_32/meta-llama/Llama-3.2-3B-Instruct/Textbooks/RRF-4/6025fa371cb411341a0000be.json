Brachytherapy (implantation of iodine-125 or iridium-193 beads or needles) and high-dose focused radiation (stereotactic radiosurgery) have so far not significantly altered survival times but continue to be studied. They have gone through periods of popularity but are currently used only sparsely, partly because they cause local radiation necrosis."

Several equivalent methods (Gamma Knife, Cyberknife) are more accessible and have become widely used. The advantage of these radiotherapeutic methods is that tumor recurrence is rare. A disadvantage is that the radiation effect is obtained only after several months.

            "content": "Although chemotherapy has an ambiguous place in the treatment of low-grade pure astrocytomas, tumors with an oligodendroglial component respond well to combination chemotherapy used for the treatment of anaplastic oligodendroglioma. One randomized trial has shown a modest benefit in overall survival by adding chemotherapy (procarbazine, CCNU, vincristine; termed PCV) to radiation therapy of the brain (13.8 years median survival vs 7.8 years; see Buckner et al). Temozolomide has replaced PCV in many centers. The special features of astrocytomas of the pons, hypothalamus, optic nerves, and chiasm, which produce highly characteristic clinical syndromes and do not behave like a cerebral mass, are discussed further on in this chapter."

            "content": "stage I were included without exclusion criteria, whereas the Italian study excluded women with stage IA and IB grade 1 tumors, and nonendometrioid malignancies. In the Italian study, systematic nodal dissection was performed, as opposed to pelvic node sampling in the ASTEC trial (median number of lymph nodes harvested 30 vs. 12, respectively). The studies share characteristics that could lead to misinterpretation of their results. The percentage of nodal positivity is low in both studies (13% and 9%), suggesting that regardless of differences in exclusion criteria, low-risk cases were included in both studies, thus diluting possible (if any) therapeutic benefit of lymphadenectomy. Another important limitation is that nodal dissection was limited to the pelvis without any recommendation for para-aortic lymphadenectomy. It was demonstrated previously that radiotherapy limited to the pelvis does not improve survival (136). It is not surprising that pelvic lymphadenectomy alone has no"
