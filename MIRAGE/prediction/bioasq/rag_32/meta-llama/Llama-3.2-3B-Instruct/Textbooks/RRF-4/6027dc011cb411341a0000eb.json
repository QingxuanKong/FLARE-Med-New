CYLD is an inhibitor of NF-\\u00f4b kinase (NF-\\u00f4b), which plays a role in cell growth and proliferation. Inactivation of CYLD can lead to increased NF-\\u00f4b activity, which can promote cell growth and tumorigenesis. Therefore, inactivation of CYLD can help in colorectal cancer by promoting tumor progression. However, the relationship between CYLD and colorectal cancer is not as well-studied as other oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and more research is needed to fully understand its role in this type of cancer. Based on the available information, it appears that inactivation of CYLD may indeed help in colorectal cancer, but this is not a well-established fact and requires further investigation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

But different combinations of mutations and epigenetic changes are found in different types of cancer, and even in different patients with the same type of cancer, reflecting the random way in which these inherited changes arise. Nevertheless, many of the same changes are encountered repeatedly, suggesting that there are a limited number of ways to breach our defenses against cancer.

Thus, in most cases, mutations inactivating the Apc gene appear to be the first, or at least a very early step, as they are detected at the same high frequency in small benign polyps as in large malignant tumors. Changes that lead to genetic and epigenetic instability are likely also to arise early in tumor progression, since they are needed to drive the later steps. Activating mutations in the K-Ras gene occur later, as they are rare in small polyps but common in larger ones that show disturbances in cell differentiation and histological pattern."

Only one of the two copies of the involved gene is defective, so the repair system is still able to remove the inevitable DNA replication errors that occur in the patient\u2019s cells.

K-ras, a signaling molecule in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, is classified as a proto-oncogene because mutation of only one allele will perturb the cell cycle. The K-ras gene product is a G-protein involved in intracellular signal transduction. When active, K-ras binds gua-nosine triphosphate (GTP); hydrolysis of GTP to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) then inactivates the G-protein. Mutation of KRAS results in an inability to hydrolyze GTP, thus leaving the G-protein permanently in the active form. It is thought that this then leads to uncontrolled cell division. Because K-ras muta-tion results in uncontrolled downstream signaling, anti-EGFR agents are ineffective in treating K-ras mutant tumors. As such, K-ras mutation status is important in deciding when to utilize anti-EGFR therapies. Other EGFR signaling molecules such as BRAF have also been implicated in colorectal cancer"

Thus, it is excessive activity in the Wnt signaling pathway that is critical for the initiation of this cancer, rather than any single oncogene or tumor suppressor gene that the pathway contains. This being so, why is the Apc gene in particular so often the most common culprit in colorectal cancer? The Apc protein is large and it interacts not only with \u03b2-catenin but also with various other cell components, including microtubules. Loss of Apc appears to increase the frequency of mitotic spindle defects, leading to chromosome abnormalities when cells divide. This additional, independent cancer-promoting effect could explain why Apc mutations feature so prominently in the causation of colorectal cancer."

Mutation or altered expression of these genes can lead to tumor formation.OncogenesNormal cellular genes that contribute to cancer when abnormal are called oncogenes. The normal counterpart of such a gene is referred to as a proto-oncogene. Oncogenes are usually designated by three-letter abbreviations, such as myc or ras. Oncogenes are further designated by the prefix \u201cv-\u201d for virus or \u201cc-\u201d for cell or chromosome, corresponding to the origin of the oncogene when it was first detected. Proto-oncogenes can be activated (show increased activity) or overexpressed (expressed at increased"

            "content": "of human cancer cells. TGF-\u03b2 receptors and SMADs are identified as tumor suppressors. The TGF-\u03b2 signaling circuit can be disrupted in a variety of ways and in different types of human tumors. Some lose TGF-\u03b2 responsiveness through downregulation or mutations of their TGF-\u03b2 receptors. The cytoplasmic SMAD4 protein, which transduces signals from ligand-activated TGF-\u03b2 receptors to downstream targets, may be eliminated through mutation of its encoding gene. The locus encoding cell cycle inhibitor p15INK4B may be deleted. Alterna-tively, the immediate downstream target of its actions, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), may become unresponsive to the inhibitory actions of p15INK4B because of mutations that block p15INK4B binding. The resulting cyclin D/CDK4 complexes con-stitutively inactivate tumor suppressor pRb by hyperphosphory-lation. Finally, functional pRb, the end target of this pathway, may be lost through mutation of its gene. For example, in pan-creatic and colorectal cancers,"

We shall then examine their functions and the parts they play in conferring on cancer cells the properties outlined in the first part of the chapter. We shall end the section by discussing colon cancer as an extended example, showing how a succession of changes in cancer-critical genes enables a tumor to evolve from one pattern of bad behavior to another that is worse. The Identification of Gain-of-Function and Loss-of-Function Cancer Mutations has Traditionally Required Different Methods"
