Document [0] states that ACE2 is highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells of the kidneys, heart, and testes, and it functions as a carboxypeptidase that removes a single amino acid from the C-terminal of ANG I forming ANG 1-9. Document [2] also mentions ACE2 and its role in converting ANG II to ANG 1-7. However, there is no direct information about ACE2 being expressed on cell surfaces. But Document [19] mentions that ACE2 is structurally and functionally diverse, and it is a type of transmembrane adhesion protein. This implies that ACE2 is indeed expressed on cell surfaces, but the exact nature of its surface expression is not explicitly stated in the provided documents. Therefore, based on the available information, the most accurate answer is that ACE2 is expressed on cell surfaces, but the exact nature of its surface expression is not specified.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",
