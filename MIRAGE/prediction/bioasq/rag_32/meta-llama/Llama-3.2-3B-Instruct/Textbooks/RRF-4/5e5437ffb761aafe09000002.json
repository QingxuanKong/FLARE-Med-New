However, we can infer that phase III clinical trials are typically conducted after phase II trials, and phase II trials are further divided into several stages, including dose-finding studies, efficacy studies, and pharmacokinetic studies. It is also mentioned that phase II trials usually involve a modest number of patients (100-200) and are often done in special clinical centers. Given the lack of information about MLE4901, it is unlikely that it has been tested in phase III clinical trials. Therefore, the most reasonable answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\" } ``` Note that there is no information available about MLE4901 in the provided documents, so it is not possible to confirm whether it has been tested in phase III clinical trials.

Using information gathered in phases 1 and 2, phase 3 trials are designed to minimize errors caused by placebo effects, variable course of the disease, etc. Therefore, double-blind and crossover techniques are often used. Phase 3 trials are usually performed in settings similar to those anticipated for the ultimate use of the drug. Phase 3 studies can be difficult to design and execute and are usually expensive because of the large numbers of patients involved and the masses of data that must be collected and analyzed. The drug is formulated as intended for the market. The investigators are usually specialists in the disease being treated. Certain toxic effects, especially those caused by immunologic processes, may first become apparent in phase 3."

Activation of GC-C results in generation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which triggers secretion of fluid, sodium, and bicarbonate. In animal models, linaclotide accelerates GI transit and reduces visceral nociception. The analgesic action of linaclotide appears to be mediated by cGMP acting on afferent pain fibers innervating the GI tract. A phase III, double-blind, controlled trial showed that linaclotide, 290 \u03bcg given once daily, significantly improved abdominal pain, bloating, and spontaneous bowel movement. The only significant side effect was diarrhea, which occurred in 4.5% of the patients. The drug has been approved for treatment of constipation in IBS-C patients.

            "content": "Owing to thalidomide\u2019s serious toxicity profile, considerable effort has been expended in the development of analogs. Immunomodulatory derivatives of thalidomide are termed IMiDs. Some IMiDs are much more potent than thalidomide in regulating cytokines and affecting T-cell proliferation. Lenalidomide is an oral IMiD that in animal and in vitro studies has been shown to be similar to thalidomide in action, but with less toxicity, especially teratogenicity. Lenalidomide was approved by the FDA when trials showed its effectiveness in the treatment of the myelodysplastic syndrome with the chromosome 5q31 deletion. Clinical trials using lenalidomide to treat multiple myeloma showed similar efficacy, leading to approval for both primary and relapsed/refractory myeloma. Pomalidomide (originally called CC-4047) is a newer oral IMiD that is FDA approved. Like the other IMiDs, it has myriad mechanisms of actions including antiangiogenic activity, inhibition of TNF-\u03b1, and stimulation of"

It is important to note that the apo B-100 gene is also transcribed in the retina and in cardiomyocytes. Subcutaneous injections of mipomersen reduce levels of LDL and Lp(a). Mild to moderate injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms can occur. The drug is available only for use in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia through a restricted (REMS) program."

            "content": "Molecular targeted medical treatment with either an mTOR inhibitor (everolimus) or a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (sunitinib) is now approved treatment in the United States and Europe for patients with metastatic unresectable pNET, each supported by a phase III, double-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled trial. mTOR is a serine-threonine kinase that plays an important role in proliferation, cell growth, and apoptosis in both normal and neoplastic cells. Activation of the mTOR cascade is important in mediating NET cell growth, especially in pNETs. A number of mTOR inhibitors have shown promising antitumor activity in NETs including everolimus and temsirolimus, with the former undergoing a phase III trial (RADIANT-3) involving 410 patients with advance progressive pNETs. Everolimus caused significant improvement in progression-free survival (11 vs 4.6 months, p <.001) and increased by a factor of 3.7 the proportion of patients progression-free at 18 months (37% vs 9%). Everolimus"
