According to Document [6], TLR-7 is expressed by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, B cells, and eosinophils, and it recognizes single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), which is a component of healthy mammalian cells. However, in abnormal settings, TLR-7 may be activated by self-derived ssRNA. Document [12] also states that mice lacking TLR-7 have impaired immune responses to viruses such as influenza. There is no information provided in the documents that indicates a difference in the induction of interferon by TLR-7 between males and females. Therefore, we cannot make an educated guess about the relationship between sex and the induction of interferon by TLR-7. The correct answer is likely B. no, as there is no evidence to suggest a difference in the induction of interferon by TLR-7 between males and females.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

For TLR-7 and TLR-9 signaling in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, the MyD88 TIR domain recruits the IRAK1/IRAK4 complex as described above. Here, the IRAK complex carries out a distinct function beyond recruiting TRAFs that generate a signaling scaffold. In these cells, IRAK1 can also physically associate with IRF7, which is highly expressed by plasmacytoid dendritic cells. This allows IRF7 to become phosphorylated by IRAK1, leading to induction of type I interferons (see Fig. 3.16). Not all IRF factors regulate type I interferon genes; IRF5, for example, plays a role in the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines."

Thus, at least part of the immune defect in patients with inherited abnormalities in these molecules may be attributed to aberrant signaling by IL1 family members. Note also that NEMO deficiency, which impairs Bcell class switching (see Section 139), also impairs TLR and IL1 receptor family signaling through its block of normal NF\u03baB activation. Immunodeficiency associated with defects in NEMO therefore affects both adaptive and innate immune function. Interestingly, increased viral infections are not typical in patients with MyD88 mutations, despite this protein\u2019s role in signaling by each of the nucleic acidsensing TLRs except TLR3 (for example, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9). This indicates that activation of interferon regulating factors (IRFs) that induce interferon responses downstream of these TLRs remains intact despite the defects in MyD88."

Studies in animal models have shown that TLRs that recognize DNA and RNA, notably the DNA-recognizing TLR9 and the RNA-recognizing TLR7, produce signals that activate B cells specific for self nuclear antigens.

Of the nine IRF family members, IRF3 and IRF7 are particularly important for TLR signaling and expression of antiviral type I interferons. For TLR-3, expressed by macrophages and conventional dendritic cells, the cytoplasmic TIR domain interacts with the adaptor protein TRIF. TRIF interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF3, which, like TRAF6, generates a polyubiquitin scaffold. In TLR-3 signaling, this scaffold recruits a multiprotein complex containing the kinases IKK\u03b5 and TBK1, which phosphorylate IRF3 (Fig. 3.16). TLR-4 also triggers this pathway by binding TRIF, but the IRF3 response induced by TLR-4 is relatively weak compared with that induced by TLR-3, and its functional role in vivo remains elusive.

These proteins include cytokines that induce inflammation, anti-viral cytokines (interferons), and cytokines and membrane proteins that promote lymphocyte activation and even more potent immune responses. We will return to TLRs in more detail in Chapter 5, when we discuss innate immunity, the early defense against infections."

Therefore, to achieve rapid viral clearance from serum and the liver, high-dose induction therapy has been advocated. In practice, however, high-dose induction with IFN-based therapy has not yielded higher sustained response rates."

            "content": "When cells are treated with the interferons IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2, or -\u03b3, there is a marked increase in the transcription of MHC class I \u03b1-chain and \u03b22-microglobulin genes and of the proteasome, tapasin, and TAP genes. Interferons are produced early in viral infections as part of the innate immune response, as described in Chapter 3. The increase in MHC expression they produce helps all cells to process viral proteins and present the resulting virus-derived peptides on their surface (except for red blood cells). On dendritic cells, this helps to activate the appropriate T cells and initiate the adaptive immune response to the virus. The coordinated regulation of the genes encoding these components may be facilitated by the linkage of many of them in the MHC."

They can replicate only within living cells, relying on host cellular machinery to replicate and propagate themselves. As obligate intracellular pathogens, they activate intracellular PRRs that sense viral genetic material and provoke cytolytic immune responses by innate and adaptive immune cells\u2014NK cells and CD8 T cells, respectively. They also induce type I interferon responses, which activate cellintrinsic mechanisms to limit viral replication in both infected and uninfected cells. Although many cells produce type I interferons, plasmacytoid dendritic cells are innate sensor cells that are specialized for high levels of type I interferon production early in viral infections and, along with NK cells, play a central role in early antiviral host defense before the adaptive response matures. The latter involves all arms of adaptive immunity: induction of TH1 cells that provide help for production of opsonizing and"

            "content": "Certain TLRs (TLR-3, -7, -8, and -9) are involved in the recognition of RNA and DNA and usually become engaged during viral infections. Very specific susceptibility to herpes simplex encephalitis has been described in patients with a deficiency in Unc93b (a molecule associated with TLR-3, -7, -8, and -9 required for correct subcellular localization), TLR-3, or associated signaling molecules TRIF, TBK1, and TRAF3, resulting in defective type I IFN production. The fact that no other TLR deficiencies have been found\u2014despite extensive screening of patients with unexplained, recurrent infections\u2014strongly suggests that these receptors are functionally redundant. Hypomorphic mutations in NEMO/IKK-\u03b3 (a member of the NF-\u03baB complex, which is activated downstream of TLR receptors) lead to a complex, variable immunodeficiency and a number of associated features. Susceptibility to both invasive, pyogenic infections and mycobacteria may be observed in this particular setting."
