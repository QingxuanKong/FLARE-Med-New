Cell populations labeled with heavy metal-coupled antibodies are analyzed on a machine called a CyTOF\u2122, which combines liquid fluidics with a mass spectrometer. As each cell is analyzed, the quantity of each heavy metal associated with that cell, and thus the abundance of the target of each antibody, is measured. In total, this technology is estimated to have the capability to measure 100 distinct heavy metals, greatly expanding the range of analysis that is currently possible by FACS. However, with this technique, the cells are destroyed by the ionization process required for the mass spectrometry analysis, so the CyTOF cannot function as a cell sorter.

            "content": "substances transported to late endosomes are eventually degraded in lysosomes in a default process that does not require any additional signals. Because late endosomes mature into lysosomes, they are also called prelysosomes. Advances in videomicroscopy now allow researchers to observe the complex behavior of these organelles; late lysosomes may fuse with each other or with mature lysosomes."

            "content": "Figure 8\u20135 The preparative ultracentrifuge. (A) The sample is contained in tubes that are inserted into a ring of angled cylindrical holes in a metal rotor. Rapid rotation of the rotor generates enormous centrifugal forces, which cause particles in the sample to sediment against the bottom sides of the sample tubes, as shown here. The vacuum reduces friction, preventing heating of the rotor and allowing the refrigeration system to maintain the sample at 4\u00b0C. (B) Some fractionation methods require a different type of rotor called a swinging-bucket rotor. In this case, the sample tubes are placed in metal tubes on hinges that allow the tubes to swing outward when the rotor spins. Sample tubes are therefore horizontal during spinning, and samples are sedimented toward the bottom, not the sides, of the tube, providing better separation of differently sized components (see Figures 8\u20136 and 8\u20137)."
