Hemoglobin structure and function Hemoglobin is found exclusively in red blood cells (RBC), where its main function is to transport O2 from the lungs to the capillaries of the tissues. Hemoglobin A, the major hemoglobin in adults, is composed of four polypeptide chains (two \u03b1 chains and two \u03b2 chains) held together by noncovalent interactions (Fig. 3.3). Each chain (subunit) has stretches of \u03b1helical structure and a hydrophobic heme-binding pocket similar to that described for myoglobin. However, the tetrameric hemoglobin molecule is structurally and functionally more complex than myoglobin. For example, hemoglobin can transport protons (H+) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from the tissues to the lungs and can carry four molecules of O2 from the lungs to the cells of the body. Furthermore, the oxygen-binding properties of hemoglobin are regulated by interaction with allosteric effectors (see p. 29)."

However, natural history and drug therapy trials suggest that an increase in the hematocrit and feedback inhibition of reticulocytosis might be beneficial, even at the expense of increased blood viscosity. The role of adhesive reticulocytes in vasoocclusion might account for these paradoxical effects."

Thus, a hematocrit of <39% in an adult male or <35% in an adult female has only about a 25% chance of being normal.

Suspected low hemoglobin or hematocrit values are more easily interpreted if previous values for the same patient are known for comparison.

Oxygen acquisition and delivery over a relatively narrow range of oxygen tensions depend on a property inherent in the tetrameric arrangement of heme and globin subunits within the hemoglobin molecule called cooperativity or heme-heme interaction. At low oxygen tensions, the hemoglobin tetramer is fully deoxygenated (Fig. 127-2). Oxygen binding begins slowly as O2 tension rises. However, as soon as some oxygen has been bound by the tetramer, an abrupt increase occurs in the slope of the curve. Thus, hemoglobin molecules that have bound some oxygen develop a higher oxygen affinity, greatly accelerating their ability to combine with more oxygen.

            "content": "b. Mechanism of the Bohr effect: The Bohr effect reflects the fact that the deoxy form of hemoglobin has a greater affinity for H+ than does oxyhemoglobin. This is caused by ionizable groups such as specific histidine side chains that have a higher pKa (see p. 6) in deoxyhemoglobin than in oxyhemoglobin. Therefore, an increase in the concentration of H+ (resulting in a decrease in pH) causes these groups to become protonated (charged) and able to form ionic bonds (salt bridges). These bonds preferentially stabilize the deoxy form of hemoglobin, producing a decrease in oxygen affinity. [Note: Hemoglobin, then, is an important blood buffer.] The Bohr effect can be represented schematically as: where an increase in H+ (or a lower pO2) shifts the equilibrium to the right (favoring deoxyhemoglobin), whereas an increase in pO2 (or a decrease in H+) shifts the equilibrium to the left."

However, evidence is overwhelming that antimicrobial agents are vastly overprescribed in outpatient settings in the USA, and the availability of antimicrobial agents without prescription in many developing countries has\u2014by facilitating the development of resistance\u2014already severely limited therapeutic options in the treatment of life-threatening infections. Therefore, the clinician should first determine whether antimicrobial therapy is warranted for a given patient. The specific questions one should ask include the following: 1. Is an antimicrobial agent indicated on the basis of clinical findings? Or is it prudent to wait until such clinical findings become apparent? 2."

It consists of two and two chains (22). \u0081 Hemoglobin HbF accounts for less than 1% of total hemoglobin in adults. It contains two and two chains (22) and is the principal form of hemoglobin in the fetus. HbF production falls dramatically after birth; however, in some individuals HbF is produced throughout their entire lives. Although HbF persists in slightly higher percentages than normal in those with sickle cell disease and thalassemia, it does not appear to have a pathologic role. Mutations in the genes encoding the globin chains can cause disorders in hemoglobin production. An example of a mutation in the gene encoding hemoglobin is discussed in the Folder 10.3. Interestingly, more than 550 types of abnormal hemoglobin molecules have been identified, but the majority of them have no clinical significance. \u0081 FOLDER 10.2 Clinical Correlation: Hemoglobin in Patients with Diabetes"
