The key documents related to this topic are Document [0], Document [1], and Document [26].\\n\\nFrom Document [0], we can see that the cerebellum, which is related to the pontine region, is treated by resection of the mural nodule and has an excellent prognosis. However, there is no specific information about the treatment of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.\\n\\nFrom Document [1], we can see that the treatment of diffuse infiltrative type is radiation, and if increased intracranial pressure develops as a result of hydrocephalus, ventricular shunting of CSF becomes necessary. There is also a mention of gangliocytomas or mixed astrogangliocytomas, but no information about the treatment of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.\\n\\nFrom Document [26], we can see that valproic acid has been demonstrated to have antimanic effects and is now being widely used for this indication in the USA. However, there is no information about the use of valproic acid in the treatment of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.\\n\\nBased on the available information, it is not possible to determine whether the addition of valproic acid improves survival in patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. Therefore, the correct answer is not supported by the provided documents.\\n\\nHowever, considering the general context of the question and the typical treatment options for gliomas, we can make an educated guess. In general, valproic acid is used to treat various types of epilepsy and bipolar disorder, and it may have some neuroprotective effects. Some studies have suggested that valproic acid may have a role in the treatment of certain types of gliomas, such as glioblastoma. However, there is limited information about its use in the treatment of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.\\n\\nGiven the lack of specific information about the use of valproic acid in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, the most appropriate answer would be that the available evidence is insufficient to determine its effectiveness in this specific context. However, since we need to choose from the given options, the closest answer would be B. no, as there is no clear evidence to support the use of valproic acid in the treatment of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

A series of 16 patients treated by Pollack and colleagues emphasizes that the focal and exophytic brainstem tumors are almost all low-grade astrocytomas; these tumors, in contrast to the more diffuse type, usually respond well to partial resection and permit long-term survival because they recur only slowly and do not undergo malignant transformation. Gangliocytomas or mixed astrogangliocytomas are rare imitators of nodular glioma in the brainstem.

While a small, and not a randomized trial, surgical excision resulted in longer survival. Excision of part of a cerebral astrocytoma can improve survival in a good functional state for many years. Modern techniques of brain mapping have allowed larger and probably safer resections of these tumors. An example of this has been offered by Sanai and colleagues, who performed mapping of language areas in a large consecutive series of glioma patients."

Corticosteroids have little clinical effect, probably because of a paucity of vasogenic edema. Most trials suggest a benefit to radiation treatment, but the absolute prolongation of life has been only several weeks (Leibel et al). The addition of chemotherapy may confer a marginal further benefit when survival at 1 year is considered. Small series of patients treated with temozolomide suggest it may be a promising agent for this tumor but it will be difficult to conduct a randomized trial given its rarity.

            "content": "Valproic acid (valproate), discussed in detail in Chapter 24 as an antiepileptic, has been demonstrated to have antimanic effects and is now being widely used for this indication in the USA. (Gabapentin is not effective, leaving the mechanism of antimanic action of valproate unclear.) Overall, valproic acid shows efficacy equivalent to that of lithium during the early weeks of treatment. It is significant that valproic acid has been effective in some patients who have failed to respond to lithium. For example, mixed states and rapid cycling forms of bipolar disorder may be more responsive to valproate than to lithium. Moreover, its side-effect profile is such that one can rapidly increase the dosage over a few days to produce blood levels in the apparent therapeutic range, with nausea being the only limiting factor in some patients. The starting dosage is 750 mg/d, increasing rapidly to the 1500\u20132000 mg range with a recommended maximum dosage of 60 mg/kg/d."

            "content": "Despite optimal therapy, glioblastomas invariably recur. Treatment options for recurrent disease may include reoperation, carmustine wafers, and alternate chemotherapeutic regimens. Reirradiation is rarely helpful. Bevacizumab, a humanized vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody, has activity in recurrent glioblastoma, increasing progression-free survival and reducing peritumoral edema and glucocorticoid use (Fig. 118-3). Treatment decisions for patients with recurrent glioblastoma must be made on an individual basis, taking into consideration such factors as previous therapy, time to relapse, performance status, and quality of life. Whenever feasible, patients with recurrent disease should be enrolled in clinical trials. Novel therapies undergoing evaluation in patients with glioblastoma include targeted molecular agents directed at receptor tyrosine kinases and signal transduction pathways; antiangiogenic agents, especially those directed at the VEGF receptors;"

However, a significant number of patients taking levetiracetam complain of irritability, anxiety, and other psychiatric symptoms. Topiramate can be used for both focal and generalized seizures. Similar to some of the other antiepileptic drugs, topiramate can cause significant psychomotor slowing and other cognitive problems. Additionally, it should not be used in patients at risk for the development of glaucoma or renal stones. Valproic acid is an effective alternative for some patients with focal seizures, especially when the seizures generalize. Gastrointestinal side effects are fewer when using the delayed-release formulation (Depakote). Laboratory testing is required to monitor toxicity because valproic acid can rarely cause reversible bone marrow suppression and hepatotoxicity. This drug should generally be avoided in patients with"

            "content": "One trial has demonstrated a 3 month benefit for progression-free survival, but not for overall survival, with the early use of bevicizumab with temozolamide and radiation (Gilbert et al); its use is largely restricted to clinical trials. This anti-VEGF therapy improves the imaging appearance (less edema, small area of enhancement) but fails to inhibit tumor spread. In the field of experimental therapeutics, adoptive T cells (chimeric antigen receptor \u2013T-cell therapy, CAR-T), which had success with leukemia and lymphoma, has demonstrated efficacy in very few studied cases of metastatic glioblastoma (Brown et al)."
