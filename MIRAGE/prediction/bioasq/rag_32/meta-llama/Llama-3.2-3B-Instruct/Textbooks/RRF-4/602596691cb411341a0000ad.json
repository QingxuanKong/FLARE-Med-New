            "content": "Cytokines activate many aspects of the immune response, and many cytokine receptors use Janus kinases (JAKs) in signal transduction (see Section 3-16). The four JAK family members, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2, bind and phosphorylate the cytoplasmic regions of cytokine receptors and initiate the activation of different STAT transcription factors. Selective JAK inhibitors have been developed over the last decade that can block the kinase activity of one or more members of this family. Since different JAKs binds to different cytokine receptors, JAK inhibitors, or Jakinibs, can therefore exert potentially specific effects on the quality of T-cell development. Two Jakinibs are now approved for use in treating inflammatory diseases and are being investigated for their application in cancer. For example, tofacitinib inhibits JAK3, interfering with signaling by IL-2 and IL-4, and somewhat more weakly JAK1, interfering with signaling by IL-6.

Mechanism of Action: Tofacitinib is a targeted synthetic small molecule (tsDMARD) that selectively inhibits all members of the Janus kinase (JAK; see Chapter 2) family to varying degrees. At therapeutic doses, tofacitinib exerts its effect mainly by inhibiting JAK3, and to a lesser extent JAK1, hence interrupting the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. This pathway plays a major role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases including RA. The JAK3/JAK1 complex is responsible for signal transduction from the common \u03b3-chain receptor (IL2RG) for IL-2, -4, -7, -9, -15, and -21, which subsequently influences transcription of several genes that are crucial for the differentiation, proliferation, and function of NK cells and T and B lymphocytes. In addition, JAK1 (in combination with other JAKs) controls signal transduction from IL-6 and interferon receptors. RA patients receiving tofacitinib rapidly reduce C-reactive protein. 2."

SOCS proteins are induced by STAT activation, and thus inhibit receptor signaling after the cytokine has had its effect. Their importance can be seen in SOCS1-deficient mice, which develop a multiorgan inflammatory infiltrate caused by increased signaling from interferon receptors, \u03b3c-containing receptors, and TLRs. Another class of inhibitory proteins consists of the protein inhibitors of activated STAT (PIAS) proteins, which also seem to be involved in promoting the degradation of receptors and pathway components."

            "content": "Since signaling by these receptors depends on tyrosine phosphorylation, dephosphorylation of the receptor complex by tyrosine phosphatases is one way that cells can terminate signaling. A variety of tyrosine phosphatases have been implicated in the dephosphorylation of cytokine receptors, JAKs, and STATs. These include the nonreceptor tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 (encoded by PTPN6 and PTPN11), and the transmembrane receptor tyrosine phosphatase CD45, which is expressed as multiple isoforms on many hematopoietic cells. Cytokine signaling can also be terminated by negative feedback involving specific inhibitors that are induced by cytokine activation. The suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are a class of inhibitors that terminate the signaling of many cytokine and hormone receptors. SOCS proteins contain an SH2 domain that can recruit them to the phosphorylated JAK kinase or receptor, and they can inhibit JAK kinases directly, compete for the receptor, and direct"

            "content": "Nilotinib is a second-generation phenylamino-pyrimidine molecule that inhibits Bcr-Abl, c-kit, and PDGFR-\u03b2 tyrosine kinases. It has a higher binding affinity (up to 20to 50-fold) for the Abl kinase when compared with imatinib, and it overcomes imatinib resistance resulting from Bcr-Abl mutations. It was originally approved for chronic phase and accelerated phase CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy that included imatinib and was recently approved as first-line therapy of chronic phase CML. Bosutinib is a potent inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, and it retains activity in 16 of 18 imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl mutations. However, it is not effective against T315I and V299L mutations, which reside within the ATP-binding domain of the Abl tyrosine kinase. It is currently approved for the treatment of adult patients with chronic, accelerated, or blast phase Ph chromosome\u2013 positive CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy."

            "content": "Inhibition of kinase activity is effective in the treatment of a number of neoplasms. Lung cancers with mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor are highly responsive to erlotinib and gefitinib (Table 102e-2). Lung cancers with activation of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS1 by translocations respond to crizotinib, an ALK and ROS1 inhibitor. A BRAF inhibitor is highly effective in melanomas and thyroid cancers in which BRAF is mutated. Targeting a protein (MEK) downstream of BRAF also has activity against BRAF mutant melanomas. Janus kinase inhibitors are active in myeloproliferative syndromes in which JAK2 activation is a pathogenetic event. Imatinib (which targets a number of tyrosine kinases) is an effective agent in tumors that have translocations of the c-Abl and BCR gene (such as chronic myeloid leukemia), mutant c-Kit (gastrointestinal stromal cell tumors), or mutant platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR; chronic myelomonocytic leukemia);"
