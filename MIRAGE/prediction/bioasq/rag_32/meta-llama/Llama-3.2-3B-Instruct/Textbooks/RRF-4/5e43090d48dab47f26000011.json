The cells may be injected directly into the damaged organ, where they can differentiate into the desired cell type. Alternatively, stem cells may be injected systemically since they have the capacity to home in on damaged tissues by following gradients of cytokines and chemokines released by the diseased organ. A second approach involves transplantation of differentiated cells derived from stem cells. For example, pancreatic islet cells can be generated from stem cells before transplantation into diabetic patients, 90e-1 and cardiomyocytes can be generated to treat ischemic heart disease. A third approach involves stimulation of endogenous stem cells to facilitate repair. This goal might be accomplished by administration of appropriate growth factors and drugs that amplify the number of endogenous stem/progenitor cells"

Chronic kidney disease results from progressive scarring in the kidney of any cause.

However, it is often asymptomatic until the most advanced stages, when symptoms of uremia develop.

The use of chronic RBC transfusions to treat patients who have had a stroke has been very successful. Chronic RBC transfusions have also been used successfully for short time periods to prevent recurrent vasoocclusive painful events, including acute chest syndrome and priapism. Hydroxyurea, which increases hemoglobin F, decreases the number and severity of vasoocclusive events and frequency of acute chest syndrome in children as early as1 year of age. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, using a haploidentical sibling match, has cured many children with sickle cell disease. HSCT using alternative donors for children, without a suitable sibling match, is being studied. Available @ StudentConsult.com"

Trends over the past decade indicated that living related transplants remained rela-tively stable, while the number of deceased donor transplants rose. Posttransplant outcomes have continued to improve: in 2015, the 1-year graft survival rate with a living donor kidney was nearly 98%; with a deceased donor kidney, the rate was approximately 95.0%.71The advantages of a living donor kidney transplant include better posttransplant outcomes, avoidance of prolonged waiting time and dialysis, and the ability to coordinate the donor and recipient procedures in a timely fashion. Living donor kidney recipients enjoy better long-term outcomes, a low incidence of delayed graft function, and reduced risks of posttransplant complications. Furthermore, the elective nature of living donor kidney transplants provides unique opportunities for recipient desensitization treatment if the donor and recipient are"

Nonetheless, clinical trials have shown that the use of growth factor\u2013mobilized peripheral blood stem cells from HLA-matched family members leads to faster engraftment without an increase in acute GVHD. Chronic GVHD may be increased with peripheral blood stem cells, but in trials conducted so far, this has been more than balanced by reductions in relapse rates and nonrelapse mortality rates, with the use of peripheral blood stem cells resulting in improved overall survival. However, in the setting of matched unrelated donor transplantation, use of peripheral blood results in more chronic GVHD without a compensatory survival advantage, favoring the use of bone marrow"

The gap between demand (patients on the waiting list) and supply (available kidneys) continues to widen.5 Pancreas transplantation represents the most reliable way to achieve euglycemia in patients with poorly controlled diabetes.6 The results of islet transplantation continue to improve but still trail those of pancreas transplantation.7 Liver transplantation has become the standard of care for many patients with end-stage liver failure and/or liver cancer.another anatomic location). Orthotopic transplants require the removal of the diseased organ (heart, lungs, liver, or intestine); in heterotopic transplants, the diseased organ is kept in place (kidney, pancreas).According to the degree of immunologic similarity between the donor and recipient, transplants are divided into three main categories: (a) an autotransplant is the transfer of cells, tissue, or an organ from one part of the body to another part in the same"
