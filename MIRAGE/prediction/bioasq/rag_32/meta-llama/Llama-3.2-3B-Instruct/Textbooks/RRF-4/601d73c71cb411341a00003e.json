Muscle cramps, pain, and stiffness are common. Some patients have enlarged muscles. Features of slow muscle contraction and relaxation occur in 25% of patients; the relaxation phase of muscle stretch reflexes is characteristically prolonged and best observed at the ankle or biceps brachii reflexes. The serum CK level is often elevated (up to 10 times normal), even when there is minimal clinical evidence of muscle disease. EMG is typically normal. The cause of muscle enlargement has not been determined, and muscle biopsy shows no distinctive morphologic abnormalities."

In both these diseases, an otherwise healthy child, adolescent, or adult begins to complain of weakness and stiffness and sometimes pain on using the limbs. Muscle contraction and relaxation are normal when the patient is in repose, but strenuous activity, especially under conditions of ischemia, causes the muscles to shorten gradually, because of a failure of relaxation. The contracted muscles in these disorders\u2014unlike muscles in cramp, continuous muscular activity syndromes, or myotonia and other involuntary spasms\u2014no longer use energy for which reason they are almost silent electrically in the EMG. This condition is spoken of as physiologic contracture. McArdle and Tarui diseases are discussed more fully in a later section."

This condition is different from the disorders of hyperexcitable motor nerves causing stiff or rigid muscles. In stiff-person syndrome, spontaneous discharges of the motor neurons of the spinal cord cause involuntary muscle contractions mainly involving the axial (trunk) and proximal lower extremity muscles. The gait becomes stiff and labored, with hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine. Superimposed episodic muscle spasms are precipitated by sudden movements, unexpected noises, and emotional upset. The muscles relax during sleep. Serum antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase are present in approximately two-thirds of cases. In neuromyotonia (Isaacs\u2019 syndrome), there is hyper-excitability of the peripheral nerves manifesting as continuous muscle fiber activity.

A sodium channel blocker (tetrodotoxin) prevents the cold-induced depolarization. In patients with paramyotonia, but not in those with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, Subramony and colleagues observed a diminution of the compound muscle action potential in response to the cooling of muscle, largely settling the argument as to whether the two syndromes (hyperkalemic paralysis and paramyotonia) are the same or different."

Muscles may go into spasm because of an unstable depolarization of motor axons, sending volleys of impulses across neuromuscular junctions\u2014as occurs in myokymia, hypocalcemic tetany, and pseudohypoparathyroidism. In other states, the innervation of muscle is normal, but contraction persists despite attempts at relaxation (myotonia). Or, after one or a series of contractions, the muscle may be slow in decontracting, as occurs in paradoxical myotonia and hypothyroidism. In the contracture of McArdle phosphorylase deficiency and phosphofructokinase deficiency, muscle, once contracted, lacks the energy to relax.

In myxedema, for example, stiffness and slowness of contraction in a muscle such as the quadriceps may be seen on change in posture (contraction myoedema) and by direct percussion of a muscle, and there is an associated prolonged duration of the tendon reflexes. Slowness in relaxation of muscles is another feature of hypothyroidism, accounting for the complaint of uncomfortable tightness of proximal limb muscles. A curious rippling phenomenon in muscles may be the result of several processes and occurs as an inherited autosomal dominant trait. After a period of relaxation, stiffening and rippling occur in the contracting or stretched muscles."

Rigorous recent trials of acupuncture suggest that true acupuncture is not superior to sham acupuncture, but that both may offer an advantage over routine care. Whether this is due entirely to placebo effects provided even by sham acupuncture is uncertain.

Discovering a mechanical component to the pain can be useful both diagnostically and therapeutically. Painful areas should be examined for deep tenderness, noting whether this is localized to muscle, ligamentous structures, or joints. Chronic myofascial pain is very common, and, in these patients, deep palpation may reveal highly localized trigger points that are firm bands or knots in muscle. Relief of the pain following injection of local anesthetic into these trigger points supports the diagnosis. A neuropathic component to the pain is indicated by evidence of nerve damage, such as sensory impairment, exquisitely sensitive skin (allodynia), weakness, and muscle atrophy, or loss of deep tendon reflexes.

It is characterized by an increase in tonic stretch reflexes and flexor muscle spasms (ie, increased basal muscle tone) together with muscle weakness. It is often associated with spinal injury, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. The mechanisms underlying clinical spasticity appear to involve not only the stretch reflex arc itself but also higher centers in the CNS, with damage to descending pathways in the spinal cord resulting in hyperexcitability of the alpha motor neurons in the cord. The important components involved in these processes are shown in Figure 27\u20139. Pharmacologic therapy may ameliorate some of the symptoms of spasticity by modifying the stretch reflex arc or by interfering directly with skeletal muscle (ie, excitation-contraction coupling)."

There are exceptions, however. Chronic spinal motor root compression leads to fasciculations or painful spasms in the innervated muscles. Occasionally one observes a state of mild motor polyneuropathy that, upon recovery, leaves the muscles in a state variably referred to as myokymia, continuous muscular activity, and neuromyotonia as discussed in Chap. 46. The affected muscles ripple and quiver and occasionally cramp. Use of the muscles increases this activity and there is a reduction in their contractile efficiency, which the patient senses as a stiffness and heaviness. In some instances this apparently constitutes the entire neuropathic syndrome and may be relieved by carbamazepine or phenytoin."

The continuous visible and painful cramps of the above-described Satoyoshi disease may be difficult to distinguish from myokymia clinically, but they represent a different phenomenon.

            "content": "A \u201cstiff infant\u201d syndrome, observed by Dudley and colleagues in 4 families of mixed heritage, probably should be included in this general category. The condition came to medical attention because of respiratory distress as the result of a generalized muscular rigidity beginning at about 2 months of age. The rigidity spread slowly from cervical muscles to those of the trunk and limbs, and, as it persisted, slight hypertrophy developed. The use of respiratory aid and a feeding gastrostomy enabled the infants to survive. The rigidity slowly diminished in the second year of life. The clinical course was unlike that of tetanus. In fatal cases there were zones of fiber loss, with fibrosis in skeletal and cardiac muscles, and a greater than normal variation in fiber size. Altered Z lines were observed with electron microscope in some fibers. Primary Hyperexcitability of Muscle"

            "content": "This subject was introduced at the beginning of this chapter, where it is pointed out that everyone at some time or other experiences muscle cramps. Cramps often occur during the night, after a day of unusually strenuous activity; less frequently they occur during the day, either during a period of relaxation or occasionally after a strong voluntary contraction or postural adjustment. A random restless or stretching movement may induce a hard contraction of a single muscle (most frequently of the foot or leg) that cannot be voluntarily relaxed. The muscle is visibly and palpably taut and painful, and the condition is readily distinguished from an illusory cramp, in which the sensation of cramp is experienced with little or no contraction of muscle. The latter phenomenon may occur in normal persons as well as in those with peripheral nerve diseases. Massage and vigorous stretch of the cramped muscle will cause the spasm to yield, although for a time the muscle remains excitable and"

The pain of fibromyalgia, a controversial entity, is characterized by tender areas near the cranial insertion of cervical and other muscles. There are no pathologic data as to the nature of these vaguely palpable and tender regions, and it is uncertain whether the pain actually arises in them. They may represent only the deep tenderness felt in the region of referred pain or the involuntary secondary protective spasm of muscles. Massage of muscles, heat, and injection of the tender spots with local anesthetic has unpredictable effects but relieves the pain in some cases. Unilateral occipital headache is often misinterpreted as occipital neuralgia (see further on)."

            "content": "There are two painful muscle conditions of particular importance, neither of which is associated with muscle weakness. Fibromyalgia is a common, yet poorly understood, type of myofascial pain syndrome. Patients complain of severe muscle pain and tenderness and have specific painful trigger points, sleep disturbances, and easy fatigability. Serum creatine kinase (CK), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), electromyography (EMG), and muscle biopsy are normal (Chap. 396). Polymyalgia rheumatica occurs mainly in patients >50 years and is characterized by stiffness and pain in the shoulders, lower back, hips, and thighs (Chap. 385). The ESR is elevated, while serum CK, EMG, and muscle biopsy are normal. Temporal arteritis, an inflammatory FIgURE 462e-3 Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy with prominent scapular winging."

            "content": "Severe pain usually resolves within 6\u201310 weeks. More chronic severe pain might suggest the possibility of multiple myeloma or underlying metastatic disease. Chronic pain following vertebral fracture is probably not bony in origin; instead, it is related to abnormal strain on muscles, ligaments, and tendons and to secondary facet-joint arthritis associated with alterations in thoracic and/or abdominal shape. Chronic pain is difficult to treat effectively and may require analgesics, sometimes including narcotic analgesics. Frequent intermittent rest in a supine or semireclining position is often required to allow the soft tissues, which are under tension, to relax. Back-strengthening exercises (paraspinal) may be beneficial. Heat treatments help relax muscles and reduce the muscular component of discomfort. Various physical modalities, such as US and trans-cutaneous nerve stimulation, may be beneficial in some patients. Pain also occurs in the neck region, not as a result of compression"
