The ideal combination and sequence of these therapies have not been defined. Extranodal Marginal Zone B-Cell Lymphoma of MALT Type Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type (MALT lymphoma) makes up ~8% of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas. This small cell lymphoma presents in extranodal sites. It was previously considered a small lymphocytic lymphoma or sometimes a pseudolymphoma. The recognition that the gastric presentation of this lymphoma was associated with H. pylori infection was an important step in recognizing it as a separate entity. The clinical characteristics of MALT lymphoma are presented in Table 134-10."

Patients who present with lymphoma (rather than leukemia) are also highly responsive to bendamustine, and some patients will receive a combination chemotherapy regimen used in other lymphomas such as CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone) or CHOP plus rituximab.

Recent clinical studies have shown that in tumors with wild-type KRAS and NRAS, FOLFOX/FOLFIRI regimens in combination with the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab or with the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab or panitumumab result in significantly improved clinical efficacy with no worsening of the toxicities normally observed with chemotherapy. In order for patients to derive maximal benefit, they should be treated with each of these active agents in a continuum of care approach. Regorafenib and TAS102 are approved for the chemo-refractory disease setting, but unfortunately, each drug is associated with significant toxicities and only limited clinical efficacy with very low overall response rates; median progression-free survival is about 2-months. Given all of the available treatment regimens, median overall survival for metastatic CRC is now in the 28to 30-month range and, in some cases, approaches or even exceeds 3 years."

            "content": "The manner in which EBV causes B cell tumors such as Burkitt lymphoma is complex and incompletely understood, but best appreciated by considering its effects on normal B cells. EBV uses the complement receptor CD21 to attach to and infect B cells. In vitro, such infection leads to polyclonal B cell proliferation and generation of immortal B lymphoblastoid cell lines. One EBV-encoded gene, LMP1 (latent membrane protein 1), acts as an oncogene, as proven by its ability to induce B cell lymphomas in transgenic mice. LMP1 promotes B cell proliferation, mimicking"

Imatinib 400 mg orally daily, nilotinib 300 mg orally twice a day (on an empty stomach), and dasatinib 100 mg orally daily are approved for frontline therapy of CML. All three are also approved for salvage therapy (nilotinib 400 mg twice daily), in addition to bosutinib (500 mg daily) and ponatinib (45 mg daily). Imatinib, dasatinib (140 mg daily), bosutinib, and ponatinib are also approved for the treatment of CML transformation (accelerated and blastic phase), whereas nilotinib is only approved for chronic and accelerated phase. Dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib are referred to as sec-ond-generation TKIs; ponatinib is referred to as a third-generation TKI. The sixth approved agent is omacetaxine (Synribo), a protein synthesis inhibitor with presumed more selective inhibition of the synthesis of the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein. It is approved for the"

Today, the estimated 10-year survival rate with imatinib mesylate, the first BCR-ABL1 TKI approved, is 85%. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), a curative but risky treatment approach, is now offered as secondor third-line therapy after failure of TKIs."
