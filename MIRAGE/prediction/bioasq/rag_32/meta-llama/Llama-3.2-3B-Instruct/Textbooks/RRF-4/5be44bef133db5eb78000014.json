Document [1] (Title: Obstentrics_Williams) states that colostrum, which is the first form of breast milk produced after delivery, is rich in immunological components and contains more protein, much of which is globulin, but less sugar and fat. Document [2] (Title: Obstentrics_Williams) also mentions that human milk has several protective immunological substances, including secretory IgA and growth factors. Additionally, Document [9] (Title: Obstentrics_Williams) states that human milk contains several protective immunological substances, including secretory IgA and growth factors. Document [11] (Title: First_Aid_Step1) mentions that high IgA levels in colostrum provide passive immunity for the infant and protect against enteric bacteria. Document [10] (Title: Immunology_Janeway) states that IgA antibodies are secreted in breast milk and are transferred to the gut of the newborn infant, where they provide protection from newly encountered bacteria. Document [18] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) also mentions that breast milk contains IgA specific for enteroviruses and can protect humans from infection. Based on these documents, it is clear that human breast milk does contain microbes, including IgA antibodies and other immunological substances that provide protection against enteric bacteria and other pathogens.

For both mother and infant, the beneits of breastfeeding are long-term. For example, women who breastfeed have a lower risk of breast and reproductive cancer, and their children have increased adult intelligence independent of a wide range of possible confounding factors (J ong, 2012; Kramer, 2008). Breastfeeding is associated with decreased postpartum weight retention (Baker, 2008). In addition, rates of sudden-infant-death syndrome are signiicantly lower among breastfed infants.

Untreated mastitis may also progress to a breast abscess. If an abscess is diagnosed, treatment includes incision and drainage, antibiotics, and regular emptying of the breast. Nursing from the contralateral breast can be continued with a healthy infant. If maternal comfort allows, nursing can continue on the affected side. Maternal infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is considered a contraindication for breastfeeding in developed countries. When the mother has active tuberculosis, syphilis, or varicella, restarting breastfeeding may be considered after therapy is initiated. If a woman has herpetic lesions on her breast, nursing and contact with the infant on that breast should be avoided. Women with genital herpes can breastfeed.

Bilirubin levels rarely increase to more than 20 mg/dL. Interruption of breastfeeding for 1 to 2 days results in a rapid decline of bilirubin levels, which do not increase significantly after breastfeeding resumes. Breast milk may contain an inhibitor of bilirubin conjugation or may increase enterohepatic recirculation of bilirubin because of breast milk glucuronidase. Jaundice on the first day of life is always pathologic, and immediate attention is needed to establish the cause. Early onset often is a result of hemolysis, internal hemorrhage (cephalhematoma, hepatic or splenic hematoma), or infection (Table 62-1). Infection also is often associated with direct-reacting bilirubin resulting from perinatal congenital infections or from bacterial sepsis."

IgA is not the only protective antibody that a mother passes on to her baby. Maternal IgG is transported across the placenta directly into the bloodstream of the fetus during intrauterine life; human babies at birth have as high levels of plasma IgG as their mothers, and with the same range of antigen specificities. The selective transport of IgG from mother to fetus is due to an IgG transport protein in the placenta, FcRn (neonatal Fc receptor), which is closely related in structure to MHC class I molecules.
