A class-specific complication of BRAF inhibition is the development of numerous skin lesions, some of which are well-differentiated squamous cell skin cancers (seen in up to a quarter of patients). Patients should be co-managed with a dermatologist as these skin cancers will need excision. Metastases have not been reported, and treatment can be continued safely following simple excision. Long-term results following treatment with BRAF inhibitors are not yet available, but the current concern is that over time the vast majority of patients will relapse and eventually die from drug-resistant disease. There are a number of mechanisms by which resistance develops, usually via maintenance of MAP kinase signaling; however, mutations in the BRAF gene that affect binding of the inhibitor are not among them. The MEK inhibitor trametinib has activity as a single agent, but appears to be less effective than either of the BRAF inhibitors. Combined therapy with the BRAF inhibitor"

            "content": "One of the strategies for new drug development is to take advantage of so-called oncogene addiction. This situation (Fig. 102e-3) is created when a tumor cell develops an activating mutation in an oncogene that becomes a dominant pathway for survival and growth with reduced contributions from other pathways, even when there may be abnormalities in those pathways. This dependency on a single pathway creates a cell that is vulnerable to inhibitors of that oncogene pathway. For example, cells harboring mutations in BRAF are very sensitive to MEK inhibitors that inhibit downstream signaling in the BRAF pathway."

            "content": "A clue to the pathogenesis of Langerhans cell tumors lies in the discovery that the different clinical forms are frequently associated with an acquired mutation in the serine/threonine kinase BRAF, that leads to hyperactivity of the kinase. This same mutation is found in a variety of other tumors, including hairy cell leukemia (described earlier), benign nevi, malignant melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, and some colon cancers (Chapter 6). BRAF is a component of the RAS signaling pathway that drives cellular proliferation and survival, effects that likely contribute to the growth of neoplastic Langerhans cells."

            "content": "Radioiodine causes progressive destruction of thyroid cells and can be used as initial treatment or for relapses after a trial of antithyroid drugs. There is a small risk of thyrotoxic crisis (see below) after radioiodine, which can be minimized by pretreatment with antithyroid drugs for at least a month before treatment. Antecedent treatment with antithyroid drugs should be considered for all elderly patients or for those with cardiac problems to deplete thyroid hormone stores before administration of radioiodine. Carbimazole or methimazole must be stopped 3\u20135 days before radioiodine administration to achieve optimum iodine uptake. Propylthiouracil appears to have a prolonged radioprotective effect and should be stopped for a longer period before radioiodine is given, or a larger dose of radioiodine will be necessary."

            "content": "RAS mutations also occur in FTCs. In addition, a rearrangement of the thyroid developmental transcription factor PAX8 with the nuclear receptor PPAR\u03b3 is identified in a significant fraction of FTCs. Overall, about 70% of follicular cancers have mutations or genetic rearrangements. Loss of heterozygosity of 3p or 11q, consistent with deletions of tumor-suppressor genes, is also common in FTCs. Most of the mutations seen in differentiated thyroid cancers have also been detected in ATCs. BRAF mutations are seen in up to 50% of ATCs. Mutations in CTNNB1, which encodes \u03b2-catenin, occur in about two-thirds of ATCs, but not in PTC or FTC. Mutations of the tumor-suppressor P53 also play an important role in the development of ATC. Because P53 plays a role in cell cycle surveillance, DNA repair, and apoptosis, its loss may contribute to the rapid acquisition of genetic instability as well as poor treatment responses (Chap. 102e) (Table 405-13)."
