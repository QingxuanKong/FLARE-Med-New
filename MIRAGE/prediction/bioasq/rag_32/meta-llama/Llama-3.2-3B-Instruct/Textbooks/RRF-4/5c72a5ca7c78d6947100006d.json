In most cases, when such changes are evident, the diagnosis was already obvious on clinical grounds. Newer PET ligand agents that bind to amyloid, such as \u201cPittsburgh compound\u201d and tau-ligands are more sensitive in identifying and observing the course of Alzheimer disease. Their main utility may be in detecting changes before brain atrophy is evident and in identifying patients who have the earliest changes of Alzheimer disease, whose disease course may be amenable to alteration by medications. They are currently used as biomarkers in therapeutic trials of various agents that reduce or remove brain amyloid."

Depending on the ganglioside involved, these disorders are subclassified into GM1 and GM2 categories. Tay-Sachs disease, by far the most common of all gangliosidoses, is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the \u03b2 subunit of the enzyme hexosaminidase A, which is necessary for the degradation of GM2. More than 100 mutations have been described; most disrupt protein folding or intracellular transport. Tay-Sachs disease, similar to other lipid storage disorders, is most common among http://ebooksmedicine.net Ashkenazi Jews, among whom the frequency of heterozygous carriers is estimated to be 1 in 30. Heterozygote carriers can be detected by measuring the level of hexosaminidase in the serum or by DNA sequencing."

Local patterns of cerebral blood flow, oxygen uptake, and glucose utilization can also be measured by PET, and the procedure has proved to be of value in both detecting and grading brain tumors, distinguishing tumor tissue from radiation necrosis, localizing epileptic foci, and, in differentiating types of degenerative diseases. The technique has been applied to specially labeled ligands of beta-amyloid, producing images of the deposition of this protein in Alzheimer disease. This approach may become increasingly important in the study of degenerative diseases and their response to treatment. The ability of the technique to quantitate neurotransmitters and their receptors also promises to be of importance in the study of Parkinson disease and other degenerative conditions. However, this technology is costly and does not always add to the certainty of diagnosis. A representative PET of the brain is shown in Fig. 2-6."

Antioxidants have slowed the clinical progress of ALS in limited and unconfirmed trials. Masitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been tried in a number of degenerative disorders and is under investigation in ALS. Some of these claims have been confirmed in several followup studies, although again, the benefit has been marginal. Several additional agents are reported to have been effective in genetic models of ALS. Among the long list of agents that have claimed, but ultimately failed, to help ALS are guanidine hydrochloride, injections of cobra venom, gangliosides, interferons, high-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone."

The neural targets are likely to be glycoconjugates, specifically gangliosides (Table 460-2; Fig. 460-2). Gangliosides are complex glycosphingolipids that contain one or more sialic acid residues; various gangliosides participate in cell-cell interactions (including those between axons and glia), modulation of receptors, and regulation of growth. They are typically exposed on the plasma membrane of cells, rendering them susceptible to an antibody-mediated attack. Gangliosides and other glycoconjugates are present in large quantity in human nervous tissues and in key sites, such as nodes of Ranvier.

Twenty-four such cases (from 20 kindreds) were collected from the medical literature by Meek and coworkers. Ataxia and dysarthria were frequently the presenting symptoms, followed by dementia, dysphagia, spasticity, dystonia, seizures, and myoclonus. Degeneration of anterior horn cells with progressive muscular atrophy may be a feature, although this is more characteristic of the adult-onset variety (see further on). Atypical cherry-red spots are observed in some patients. The biochemical abnormality, that is, a deficiency of hexosaminidase A, is the same as in Tay-Sachs disease, but not as severe or as extensive. Progression of the disease is slow, over a period of many years."

Brain MRI and CT are of major importance in objectifying hydrocephalus, lobar atrophy, cerebrovascular disease, tumor, and subdural hematoma. Functional imaging, particularly with PET, including with the use of radioligands to amyloid, tau and other substances is assuming great importance in identifying Alzheimer, Lew body and corticobasal degeneration. Testing for syphilis, vitamin B12 deficiency, and thyroid function is also undertaken in many clinics almost as a matter of routine because the tests are simple and the dementias they cause are reversible. These are supplemented in individual circumstances by serologic testing for HIV infection, measurement of copper and ceruloplasmin levels (Wilson disease), heavy metal concentrations in serum, urine or tissues, autoantibodies including anti-Hu for"

As also commented on in Chap. 28, the rate of cerebral atrophy, specifically of the hippocampus and medial parts of the temporal lobes, is accelerated in the early stages of Alzheimer disease, and longitudinal studies by magnetic resonance imaging can identify individuals who will subsequently develop the disease (Rusinick). Nevertheless, there is not a continuous increase in the deposition of plaques and tangles, the pathologic markers of Alzheimer disease, with increasing age."

Similar to the Schwann cells in peripheral neurons, the myelin sheath created by the oligodendrocytes insulates the axons and increases the speed of signal propagation. Damage to oligodendrocytes occurs in multiple sclerosis, and thus, they are a target of drug discovery efforts. Microglia are specialized macrophages derived from the bone marrow that settle in the CNS and are the major immune defense system in the brain. The cells are actively involved in neuroinflammatory processes in many pathological states including neurodegenerative diseases."

Degeneration of the macular cells exposes the underlying red vascular choroid surrounded by a whitish gray ring of retinal cells distended with ganglioside. The resulting appearance is of the cherry-red spot with optic atrophy (Fig. 36-1). These are observed in the retinas in more than 90 percent of patients (but are also characteristic of other storage diseases\u2014see Table 36-4). In the second year, there are tonic-clonic or minor motor seizures and an increasing size of the head and diastasis of sutures with relatively normal-size ventricles; in the third year, the clinical picture is one of dementia, decerebration, and blindness. Cachexia becomes increasingly severe and death occurs at 2 to 4 years. The electroencephalogram (EEG) becomes abnormal in the early stages (paroxysmal slow waves with multiple spikes). Occasionally, one can find basophilic granules in leukocytes and vacuoles in lymphocytes. There are no visceral, skeletal, or bone marrow abnormalities"

            "content": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease, a progressive neurodegenerative brain disease characterized by the formation of amyloid plaques, affects approximately 44 million people worldwide. In Alzheimer\u2019s disease, regulated intramembrane proteolysis of amyloid \u03b2-protein precursor (APP) causes the accumulation of amyloid \u03b2-protein (A\u03b2), which forms amyloid plaques that contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. APP is a type I transmembrane protein (i.e., its spans the membrane only once). After ectodomain shedding, its sequential proteolysis by \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase produces the A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 peptides that are normally produced throughout life but accumulate in individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Missense mutations in presenilins, proteins that regulate \u03b3-secretase protease activity, enhance the production of A\u03b242, which is more hydrophobic and prone to aggregation into amyloid fibrils than is the more abundant A\u03b240 protein."
