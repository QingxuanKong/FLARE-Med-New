    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the role of enhancers in gene regulation. Enhancers are DNA sequences that can increase the rate of transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. They can be located upstream or downstream of the transcription start site, and can be far away from the promoter. The presence of an enhancer does not necessarily mean that it is active, as it can be bound by repressor proteins or other factors that prevent transcription. However, when an enhancer is bound by activator proteins, it can increase the rate of transcription initiation. Therefore, the accessibility of an enhancer is not necessarily a guarantee of its activity. We need to consider the presence of activator proteins and the overall regulatory context to determine if an enhancer is active or not.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Active chromatin contains histone proteins that have been covalently modified at their amino terminal ends by reversible methylation, acetylation, or phosphorylation (see p. 438 for a discussion of histone acetylation/deacetylation by histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase). Such modifications decrease the positive charge of these basic proteins, thereby decreasing the strength of their association with negatively charged DNA.

When first discovered in the 1960s, it was thought that these proteins might require direct access to the interior of the double helix to distinguish between one DNA sequence and another. It is now clear, however, that the outside of the double helix is studded with DNA sequence information that transcription regulators recognize: the edge of each base pair presents a distinctive pattern of hydrogen-bond donors, hydrogen-bond acceptors, and hydrophobic patches in both the major and minor grooves (Figure 7\u20137). Because the major groove is wider and displays more molecular features than does the minor groove, nearly all transcription regulators make the majority of their contacts with the major groove\u2014as we shall see."

            "content": "Figure 4\u201341 Some mechanisms of barrier action. These models are derived from experimental analyses of barrier action, and a combination of several of them may function at any one site. The tethering of a region of chromatin to a large fixed site, such as the nuclear pore complex illustrated here, can form a barrier that stops the spread of heterochromatin. The tight binding of barrier proteins to a group of nucleosomes can make this chromatin resistant to heterochromatin spreading. (C) by recruiting a group of highly active histone-modifying enzymes, barriers can erase the histone marks that are required for heterochromatin to spread. For example, a potent acetylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 will compete with lysine 9 methylation, thereby preventing the binding of the HP1 protein needed to form a major form of heterochromatin.
