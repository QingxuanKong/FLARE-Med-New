            "content": "Immune checkpoint blockade with monoclonal antibodies to the inhibitory immune receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 has shown promising clinical efficacy. An array of inhibitory receptors are upregulated during an immune response. An absolute requirement to ensure proper regulation of a normal immune response, the continued expression of inhibitory receptors during chronic infection (hepatitis, HIV) and in cancer patients denotes exhausted T cells with limited potential for proliferation, cytokine production, or cytotoxicity (Fig. 105-3). Checkpoint blockade with a monoclonal antibody results in improved T cell function with eradication of tumor cells in preclinical animal models. Ipilimumab, a fully human IgG antibody that binds CTLA-4 and blocks inhibitory signals, was the first treatment of any kind to improve survival in patients with metastatic melanoma. A full course of therapy is four IV outpatient infusions of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Although response rates were low (\u223c10%) in"

CTLA-4 and PD-1 are two important inhibitory T-cell checkpoints that can be blocked with neutralizing antibod-ies and result in an effective antigen-specific anti-tumor response.CTLA-4 is an inhibitory receptor expressed by activated T cells that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. CTLA4 is related to the T-cell costimulatory receptor, CD28, and both are bound by CD80 and CD86 (also known as B7-1 and B7-2) which are expressed on antigen-presenting cells. CTLA-4 con-veys an inhibitory signal to the T cell, whereas engagement of CD28 with ligand sends a stimulatory signal. CTLA-4 is able to outcompete CD28 for CD80 and CD86 ligands and therefore is able to dominate immune signaling in the setting of antigen recognition. CTLA-4 is also expressed by regulatory T cells, which contributes to their ability to inhibit T-cell function.154 Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a 40 kDa type 1"

Decision points include: (1) Introduction of a neuroprotective therapy: No drug has been established to have or is currently approved for neuroprotection or disease modification, but there are several agents that have this potential based on laboratory and preliminary clinical studies (e.g., rasagiline 1 mg/d, coenzyme Q10 1200 mg/d, the dopamine agonists ropinirole, and pramipexole). (2) When to initiate symptomatic therapy: There is a trend toward initiating therapy at the time of diagnosis or early in the course of the disease because patients may have some disability even at an early stage, and there is the possibility that early treatment may preserve beneficial compensatory mechanisms; however, some experts recommend waiting until there is functional disability before initiating therapy. (3) What therapy to initiate: Many experts favor starting with a monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor in"
