    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of ultraconserved noncoding sequences and their role in development. According to Document [0], ultraconserved noncoding sequences are long DNA segments (over 100 nucleotides) that are exactly the same in human, mouse, and rat, and have undergone little or no change since mammalian and bird ancestors diverged about 300 million years ago. These sequences are thought to have important functions maintained by purifying selection, but their functions are still unknown. Document [3] mentions that one such sequence, HAR1F, is produced in the human cerebral cortex at a critical time during brain development and has not yet been fully characterized. Document [7] highlights the importance of chromatin organization in regulating gene expression, including the role of enhancers in looping back to gene promoters. Given this information, it is reasonable to infer that ultraconserved enhancers are likely important for normal development, as they are conserved across species and play a role in regulating gene expression. Furthermore, Document [8] discusses the use of conserved noncoding sequences to reveal events that happened even hundreds of millions of years ago, suggesting that these sequences have functional significance. Therefore, the correct answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

            "content": "The rapid progress in understanding animal development has been one of the great success stories in biology over the last few decades, and it has important practical implications. Some 2 to 5% of all human babies are born with anatomical abnormalities, such as heart malformations, truncated limbs, cleft palate, or spina bifida. Advances in developmental biology help us understand how these defects arise, even if we cannot yet prevent or cure most of them. Less obvious, but even more important from a practical point of view, is that developmental biology provides insights into the workings of cells and tissues in the adult body. Developmental processes do not halt at birth; they continue throughout life, as tissues are maintained and repaired. The fundamental mechanisms of cell growth and division, cell\u2013cell signaling, cell memory, cell adhesion, and cell movement are involved in adult tissue maintenance and repair\u2014just as they are in embryo development."
