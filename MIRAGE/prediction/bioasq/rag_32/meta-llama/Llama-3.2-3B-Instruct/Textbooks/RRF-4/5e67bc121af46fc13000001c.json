Document [12] states that about 25% to 50% of patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) have a mutation in NF-1. Document [13] mentions that neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is associated with an increased incidence of soft tissue sarcomas, including MPNST. Document [8] states that 70% of neurofibromas are benign, but malignant degeneration to neurofibrosarcoma occurs in 25% to 30% of patients. This suggests that MPNSTs are more common in patients with NF1. Therefore, we can conclude that Spinal Intradural Primary Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNST) are not rare in neurofibromatosis patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Meningiomas and neurofibromas account for most of these, with occasional cases caused by chordoma, lipoma, dermoid, or sarcoma. Meningiomas (Fig. 456-3) are often located posterior to the thoracic cord or near the foramen magnum, although they can arise from the meninges anywhere along the spinal canal. Neurofibromas are benign tumors of the nerve sheath that typically arise from the posterior root; when multiple, neurofibromatosis is the likely etiology. Symptoms usually begin with radicular sensory symptoms followed by an asymmetric, progressive spinal cord syndrome. Therapy is surgical resection."

Plexiform neurofibromas grow diffusely within the confines of a nerve or nerve plexus.

Furthermore, certain cancers (breast, lung, melanoma, renal cell cancer) display a tendency to metastasize to nervous tissue and many others rarely do so.

Here, an extradural tumor may produce mainly sciatic and low back pain with little or no motor, sensory, reflex, or sphincteric disturbances. With intradural\u2013extramedullary lesions, the important diagnostic considerations are meningioma, neurofibroma, meningeal carcinomatosis, cholesteatoma, and teratomatous cyst, a meningomyelitic process, or adhesive arachnoiditis. Intramedullary lesions are usually gliomas, ependymomas, or vascular malformations or, in the context of a known carcinoma, intramedullary metastases. The definition of vascular malformations by means of selective spinal angiography was discussed in an earlier section. Normal protein in the CSF and negative MRI effectively exclude an intramedullary tumor."

            "content": "In the majority of patients, spots of hyperpigmentation (caf\u00e9-au-lait lesions) and cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromatous tumors are the basis of clinical diagnosis. Pigmentary changes in the skin are nearly always present at birth, but neurofibromas are infrequent at that age. Both lesions increase in number and size during late childhood and adolescence. There may be a spurt of new lesions at puberty or during pregnancy. Exceptionally, a neurofibroma of a cranial nerve or a spinal root (sometimes with compression of the cord), disclosed during imaging of the spine or a neurosurgical intervention, may be the initial manifestation of the disease. In a large series of patients with neurofibromatosis (Crowe et al), approximately one-third were found to have only the cutaneous manifestations that were noted while being examined for symptoms of some other disease; that is to say, the NF was asymptomatic. Usually these are the patients with the slightest degree of cutaneous"

            "content": "If skin tumors and caf\u00e9-au-lait spots are numerous and Lisch nodules are present in the iris, the identification of the disease as type 1 neurofibromatosis offers no difficulty. A history of the illness in antecedent and collateral family members makes diagnosis even more certain. Doubt arises most frequently in patients with bilateral acoustic neuromas or other cranial or spinal neurofibromas or schwannomas with no skin lesions or only a few random ones. The tendency for these forms of NF to have few skin lesions is well known, but differentiation of type 1 from type 2 may be uncertain unless genetic studies are undertaken. Plexiform neuromas with muscle weakness because of nerve involvement and abnormalities of underlying bone may be confused with other tumors, especially in young children, who tend to have few caf\u00e9-au-lait spots and few cutaneous tumors. Hypertrophy of a limb requires differentiation from other developmental anomalies including Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome."

Degeneration of the dorsal columns and chromatolysis of anterior horn cells are secondary to changes in the peripheral nerves and roots."

            "content": "Malignant transformation of a benign soft tissue tumor is extremely rare, with the exception that malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (neurofibrosarcoma, malignant schwannoma) can arise from neurofibromas in patients with neurofibromatosis. Several etiologic factors have been implicated in soft tissue sarcomas. Environmental Factors Trauma or previous injury is rarely involved, but sarcomas can arise in scar tissue resulting from a prior operation, burn, fracture, or foreign body implantation. Chemical carcinogens such as polycyclic hydrocarbons, asbestos, and dioxin may be involved in the pathogenesis. Iatrogenic Factors Sarcomas in bone or soft tissues occur in patients who are treated with radiation therapy. The tumor nearly always arises in the irradiated field. The risk increases with time."
