Tumor-specific antigens are proteins that are uniquely expressed by cancer cells and can be recognized by the immune system. According to the provided documents, tumor-specific antigens can originate from different sources, including known protein-coding genes, viral oncogenes, and abnormal post-translational modifications. The documents also mention that some tumor-specific antigens, such as cancer-testis antigens, are encoded by genes that are normally expressed only in male germ cells in the testis. These antigens are presented to T cells by MHC class I molecules, making them tumor-specific. On the other hand, tumor antigens derived from mutant proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes can also be recognized by the immune system and can stimulate an anti-tumor immune response. Therefore, the answer to the question is that tumor-specific antigens can originate from both known protein-coding genes and viral oncogenes, as well as other sources.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

As described in Chapter 5, precursor B and T cells rearrange their antigen receptor genes through a mechanism that ensures that each lymphocyte makes a single, unique antigen receptor. Because antigen receptor gene rearrangement virtually always precedes transformation, the daughter cells derived from a given malignant progenitor share the same antigen receptor gene configuration and synthesize identical antigen receptor proteins (either immunoglobulins or T cell receptors). Thus, analyses of antigen receptor genes and their protein products can be used to differentiate lymphoid neoplasms (which are clonal) from immune reactions (which are polyclonal)."

Tumor cells show widespread abnormalities of gene expression, including the activation of genes encoding cancer-testis antigens, such as the melanoma-associated antigens (MAGE) (see Fig. 16.17). When expressed by tumor cells, peptides derived from these \u2018germ-cell\u2019 proteins can now be presented to T cells by MHC class I molecules.

When tumor cells die they release \u201cdanger signals\u201d (damage associated molecular patterns, see Chapter 5) that stimulate innate immune cells, including resident phagocytes and antigen presenting cells.

            "content": "The explosion of information on tumor cell biology, metastasis, and tumor-host interactions (including angiogenesis and immune evasion by tumors) has ushered in a new era of rational targeted therapy for cancer. Furthermore, it has become clear that specific molecular factors detected in individual tumors (specific gene mutations, gene-expression profiles, microRNA expression, overexpression of specific proteins) can be used to tailor therapy and maximize antitumor effects. Robert G. Fenton contributed to this chapter in prior editions, and important material from those prior chapters has been included here."

The two-dimensional landscape represents the positions of the RefSeq genes along the chromosomes and the height of the peaks represents the mutation frequency. On the top map, the taller peaks represent the genes that are commonly mutated in colon cancer, while the large number of smaller hills indicates the genes that are mutated at lower frequency. On the lower map, the mutations of two individual tumors are indicated. Note that there is little overlap between the mutated genes of the two colorectal tumors shown. These differences may represent the basis for the heterogeneity in terms of behavior and responsiveness to therapy observed in human cancer.
