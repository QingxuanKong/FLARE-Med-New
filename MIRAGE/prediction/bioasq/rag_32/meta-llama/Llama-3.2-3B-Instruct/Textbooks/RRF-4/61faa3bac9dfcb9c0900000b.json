The HVTN 702 trial was a phase III trial that evaluated the efficacy of the ALVAC-HIV vaccine in preventing HIV infection. The ALVAC-HIV vaccine was a poxvirus vector vaccine that was designed to elicit immune responses against HIV. From Document [4], we know that the RV144 trial, which used a similar approach, showed a 31% protection against HIV acquisition. However, we need to look for information about the HVTN 702 trial specifically. After searching through the provided documents, I found that the HVTN 702 trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy of the ALVAC-HIV vaccine in preventing HIV infection in men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States. The trial was conducted from 2009 to 2012 and enrolled 5,397 participants. The primary endpoint of the trial was the occurrence of HIV infection. From Document [24], we know that the trial was completed in 2014, and the results were published in 2017. The results of the trial showed that the ALVAC-HIV vaccine was not effective in preventing HIV infection. Therefore, the answer to the question is\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

The effectiveness of a vaccine can, however, only be assessed in a population in which the exposure rate to the virus is high enough to assess whether vaccination protects against infection. This means that initial vaccine trials might have to be conducted in countries where the incidence of infection is very high and public health measures have not yet succeeded in reducing the spread of HIV. 13-38 Prevention and education are important in controlling the spread of HIV and AIDS."

These patients should be treated for both HIV and HBV with an HIV drug regimen that includes or is supplemented by at least two drugs active against HBV; antiretroviral therapy (ART) often contains two drugs with antiviral activity against HBV (e.g., tenofovir and emtricitabine), but if lamivudine is part of the regimen, the daily dose should be 300 mg (Chap. 226). The safety of lamivudine during pregnancy has not been established; however, the drug is not teratogenic in rodents and has been used safely in pregnant women with HIV infection and with HBV infection. Limited data even suggest that administration of lamivudine during the last months of pregnancy to mothers with"
