    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if amantadine ER is the first approved treatment for akinesia, we need to understand what amantadine ER is and its approved uses. Amantadine ER refers to the extended-release formulation of amantadine. According to the provided documents, amantadine is an antiviral agent that has been found to have antiparkinsonian effects. It is used to treat dyskinesias in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. However, the question is specifically asking about akinesia, which is a symptom of Parkinson's disease characterized by a lack of movement. The documents do not explicitly state that amantadine ER is the first approved treatment for akinesia. In fact, the documents mention that amantadine may be used as a temporary, short-term monotherapy for early in the course of the disease, but it is not clear if it is the first approved treatment for akinesia. Furthermore, the documents mention that other treatments such as levodopa, dopamine agonists, and COMT inhibitors are also used to treat akinesia. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclude that amantadine ER is the first approved treatment for akinesia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The plasma half-life is between 2 and 4 hours, with most of the drug being excreted unchanged in the urine. Amantadine is less efficacious than levodopa, and its benefits may be short-lived, often disappearing after only a few weeks of treatment. Nevertheless, during that time it may favorably influence the bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor of parkinsonism. The standard dosage is 100 mg orally two or three times daily. Amantadine may also help in reducing iatrogenic dyskinesias in patients with advanced disease. Amantadine has a number of undesirable central nervous system effects, all of which can be reversed by stopping the drug. These include restlessness, depression, irritability, insomnia, agitation, excitement, hallucinations, and confusion. Overdosage may produce an acute toxic psychosis. With doses several times higher than recommended, convulsions have occurred."

Originally introduced as an antiviral agent, it was appreciated to also have antiparkinsonian effects that are now thought to be due to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism. While some physicians use amantadine in patients with early disease for its mild symptomatic effects, it is most widely used as an antidyskinesia agent in patients with advanced PD. Indeed, it is the only oral agent that has been demonstrated in controlled studies to reduce dyskinesia without worsening parkinsonian features, although benefits may be relatively transient. Cognitive impairment is a major concern. Other side effects include livido reticularis and weight gain. Amantadine should always be discontinued gradually because patients can experience withdrawal-like symptoms."

A number of centrally acting antimuscarinic preparations are available that differ in their potency and in their efficacy in different patients. Some of these drugs were discussed in Chapter 8. These agents may improve the tremor and rigidity of parkinsonism but have little effect on bradykinesia. They are more effective than placebo.

For prophylaxis, the compounds must be administered daily for the period at risk (i.e., duration of the exposure). For therapy, amantadine or rimantadine is generally administered for 5\u20137 days."

            "content": "Amantadine (1-aminoadamantane hydrochloride) and its \u03b1-methyl derivative, rimantadine, are tricyclic amines of the adamantane family that block the M2 proton ion channel of the virus particle and inhibit uncoating of the viral RNA within infected host cells, thus preventing its replication. They are active against influenza A only. Rimantadine is four to ten times more active than amantadine in vitro. Amantadine is well absorbed and 67% protein-bound, with a plasma half-life of 12\u201318 hours that varies by creatinine clearance. Rimantadine is about 40% protein-bound and has a half-life of 24\u201336 hours. Nasal mucus concentrations of rimantadine average 50% higher than those in plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid levels are 52\u201396% of those in the serum. Amantadine is excreted unchanged in the urine, whereas rimantadine undergoes extensive metabolism by hydroxylation, conjugation, and glucuronidation before urinary excretion. Dose reductions are required for both agents in the elderly and in"
