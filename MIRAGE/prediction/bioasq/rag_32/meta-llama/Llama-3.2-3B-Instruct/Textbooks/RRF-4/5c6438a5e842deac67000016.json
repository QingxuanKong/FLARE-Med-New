However, the question asks if these variants are responsible for the majority of undiagnosed nonconsanguineous individuals.\\n\\nDocument [0] mentions that de novo mutations, including recessive coding variants, account for approximately 15-20% of cases of mild, moderate, and severe developmental delay and autism. This suggests that recessive coding variants can contribute to a significant proportion of cases, but it does not specify if they are the majority.\\n\\nDocument [4] discusses the challenges of identifying recessive disorders, including the fact that many cases may be missed due to the presence of multiple genetic alterations, lesser polymorphisms, and copy number variants.

With a few important exceptions, autosomal recessive diseases are rare and often occur in the context of parental consanguinity. The relatively high frequency of certain recessive disorders such as sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and thalassemia, is partially explained by a selective biologic advantage for the heterozygous state (see below).

When alleles at a given locus are identical, the individual is homozygous. Inheriting identical copies of a mutant allele occurs in many autosomal recessive disorders, particularly in circumstances of consanguinity or isolated populations. If the alleles are different on the maternal and the paternal copy of the gene, the individual is heterozygous at this locus (Fig. 82-10).

            "content": "Inheritance and Mosaicism in Germline Cells and in Somatic Cells Type I OI is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. However, some patients with type I OI appear to represent sporadic new mutations or a diagnosis that was missed in earlier generations. Most lethal OI is the result of sporadic mutations that occur in the germ line in one of the parents. Because of the possibility for germline mosaicism for newly generated mutations, there is about a 7% probability that a second child could inherit a severe variant of OI."
