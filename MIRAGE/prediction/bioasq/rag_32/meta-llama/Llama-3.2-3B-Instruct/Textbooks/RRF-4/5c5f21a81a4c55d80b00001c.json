    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if selenocysteine is an amino acid, let's review the information provided by the documents. Selenocysteine is described as a 21st amino acid that is synthesized from serine and selenium. It is incorporated into a growing polypeptide chain through translation recoding, where a special tRNA molecule is charged with serine and then converted to selenocysteine. The mRNAs for proteins in which selenocysteine is to be inserted carry an additional nearby nucleotide sequence that triggers this recoding event. This suggests that selenocysteine is indeed a type of amino acid. Furthermore, it is mentioned that selenocysteine is found in ~25 human proteins, including glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase, which are enzymes that play important roles in cellular function. Therefore, based on the information provided, selenocysteine appears to be a type of amino acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

In this case, other nucleotide sequence information present in an mRNA can change the meaning of the genetic code at a particular site in the mRNA molecule. The standard code allows cells to manufacture proteins using only 20 amino acids. However, bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes have available to them a twenty-first amino acid that can be incorporated directly into a growing polypeptide chain through translation recoding. Selenocysteine, which is essential for the efficient function of a variety of enzymes, contains a selenium atom in place of the sulfur atom of cysteine. Selenocysteine is enzymatically produced from a serine attached to a special tRNA molecule that base-pairs with the UGA codon, a codon normally used to signal a translation stop.

Serine is formed by hydrolysis of the phosphate ester. Serine can also be formed from glycine through transfer of a hydroxymethyl group by serine hydroxymethyltransferase using N5,N10-MTHF as the one-carbon donor (see Fig. 20.6A).

Linkage of \u226550 amino acids through peptide bonds results in an unbranched chain called a polypeptide, or protein. Each component amino acid is called a residue because it is the portion of the amino acid remaining after the atoms of water are lost in the formation of the peptide bond. When a peptide is named, all amino acid residues have their suffixes (-ine, -an, -ic, or -ate) changed to -yl, with the exception of the C-terminal amino acid. For example, a tripeptide composed of an N-terminal valine, a glycine, and a C-terminal leucine is called valylglycylleucine. 2."

BIOSYNTHESIS OF NONESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS Nonessential amino acids are synthesized from intermediates of metabolism or, as in the case of tyrosine and cysteine, from the essential amino acids phenylalanine and methionine, respectively. The synthetic reactions for the nonessential amino acids are described below and are summarized in Figure 20.15. [Note: Some amino acids found in proteins, such as hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine (see p. 45), are produced by posttranslational modification (after incorporation into a protein) of their precursor (parent) amino acids.] A.

How to translate a codon: This table can be used to translate any codon and, thus, to determine which amino acids are coded for by an mRNA sequence. For example, the codon AUG codes for methionine ([Met] see Fig. 32.2). [Note: AUG is the initiation (start) codon for translation.] Sixty-one of the 64 codons code for the 20 standard amino acids (see p. 1). 2. Termination codons: Three of the codons, UAA, UAG, and UGA, do not code for amino acids but, rather, are termination (also called stop, or nonsense) codons. When one of these codons appears in an mRNA sequence, synthesis of the polypeptide coded for by that mRNA stops. B. Characteristics"

Defects in methyl transfer or in the subsequent metabolism of homocysteine by the pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6)dependent cystathionine \u03b2-synthase increase plasma methionine levels. Homocysteine is transformed into methionine via remethylation. This occurs through methionine synthase, a reaction requiring methylcobalamin and folic acid. Deficiencies in these enzymes or lack of cofactors is associated with decreased or normal methionine levels. In an alternative pathway, homocysteine can be remethylated by betaine:homocysteine methyl transferase. 3 and 5 years of age with dislocated optic lenses and intellectual disability (in about half of cases).

Degradation signals: Because proteins have different half-lives, it is clear that protein degradation cannot be random but, rather, is influenced by some structural aspect of the protein that serves as a degradation signal, which is recognized and bound by an E3. The half-life of a protein is also influenced by the amino (N)-terminal residue, the so-called N-end rule, and ranges from minutes to hours. Destabilizing N-terminal amino acids include arginine and posttranslationally modified amino acids such as acetylated alanine. In contrast, serine is a stabilizing amino acid. Additionally, proteins rich in sequences containing proline, glutamate, serine, and threonine (called PEST sequences after the one-letter designations for these amino acids) are rapidly ubiquitinated and degraded and, therefore, have short half-lives.
