Document [1] (Title: Pathology_Robbins) mentions that Odontogenic tumors are a complex group of lesions with diverse histologic appearances and clinical behaviors. It specifically states that Ameloblastomas arise from odontogenic epithelium and are typically cystic, slow-growing, and locally invasive. However, it does not explicitly state that Ameloblastomas are common or primarily occurring in the brain. Document [0] (Title: Neurology_Adams) discusses Other Tumors of the Base of the Skull, but does not specifically mention Ameloblastoma. However, it does discuss Odontomas, which are related to odontogenic epithelium and are cured by local excision.

Some are true neoplasms, either benign or malignant, while others are thought to be hamartomas. Odontogenic tumors are derived from odontogenic epithelium, ectomesenchyme, or both. The two most common and clinically significant tumors are ameloblastoma and odontoma. Ameloblastomas arise from odontogenic epithelium. They are typically cystic, slow-growing and, despite being locally invasive, have an indolent course. The cysts are lined by palisading columnar epithelium that overlies a loose stroma with stellate cells. Odontoma, the most common type of odontogenic tumor, arises from epithelium but shows extensive deposition of enamel and dentin. Odontomas are cured by local excision.

Tumors of the CNS make up a larger propor- tion of childhood cancers, accounting for as many of 20% of all pediatric tumors. Childhood CNS tumors differ from those in adults in both histologic subtype and location. In childhood, tumors are likely to arise in the posterior fossa, whereas tumors in adults are mostly supratentorial. Tumors of the nervous system have unique characteristics that set them apart from neoplastic processes elsewhere in the body. These tumors do not have morphologically evident premalignant or in situ stages comparable to those of carcinomas.

Similarly, in a number of mass lesions\u2014such as certain cerebellar astrocytomas, bipolar astrocytomas of the pons and optic nerves, von Hippel-Lindau cerebellar cysts, and pineal teratomas\u2014a clear distinction between neoplasms and hamartomas is often not possible."
