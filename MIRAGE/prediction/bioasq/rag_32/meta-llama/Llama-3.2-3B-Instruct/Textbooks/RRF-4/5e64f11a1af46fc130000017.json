The genomes of negative-strand viruses are frequently segmented. Negative-strand RNA viral genomes are released into the cytoplasm with an associated RNA polymerase and one or more polymerase accessory proteins. The viral RNA polymerase transcribes mRNAs as well as full-length antigenome RNA, which is the template for genome RNA replication. Viral mRNAs encode the viral RNA polymerase and accessory factors as well as viral structural proteins. Except for influenza virus, which transcribes its mRNAs and antigenome RNAs in the cell nucleus, negative-strand RNA viruses replicate entirely in the cytoplasm.

Although RNA viruses typically have high mutation rates, measles virus is considered to be an antigenically monotypic virus; i.e., the surface proteins responsible for inducing protective immunity have retained their antigenic structure across time and distance. The public health significance of this stability is that measles vaccines developed decades ago from a single strain of measles virus remain protective worldwide.

            "content": "Once established on a mucosal or skin site, pathogenic microbes must replicate before causing full-blown infection and disease. Within cells, viral particles release their nucleic acids, which may be directly translated into viral proteins (positive-strand RNA viruses), transcribed from a negative strand of RNA into a complementary mRNA (negative-strand RNA viruses), or transcribed into a complementary strand of DNA (retroviruses); for DNA viruses, mRNA may be transcribed directly from viral DNA, either in the cell nucleus or in the cytoplasm. To grow, bacteria must acquire specific nutrients or synthesize them from precursors in host tissues. Many infectious processes are usually confined to specific epithelial surfaces\u2014e.g., H1 subtype influenza to the respiratory mucosa, gonorrhea to the urogenital epithelium, shigellosis to the gastrointestinal epithelium. While there are multiple reasons for this specificity, one important consideration is the ability of these pathogens to obtain"

            "content": "details are unclear, but this scaffold appears to help RIG-I and MDA-5 interact with a downstream adaptor protein called MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein). MAVS is attached to the outer mitochondrial membrane and contains a CARD domain that may bind RIG-I and MDA-5. This aggregation of CARD domains, as in the inflammasome, may initiate aggregation of MAVS. In this state, MAVS propagates signals by recruiting various TRAF family E3 ubiquitin ligases, including TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, and TRAF6. The relative importance of each E3 ligase may differ between cell types, but their further production of K63linked polyubiquitin leads to activation of TBK1 and IRF3 and production of type I interferons, as described for TLR-3 signaling (see Fig. 3.16), and also to activation of NF\u03baB. Some viruses have evolved countermeasures to thwart the protection conferred by RLRs. For example, even though the negative-sense RNA genome of influenza virus replicates in the nucleus, some viral RNA"

            "content": "We have seen in this chapter that RNA can carry genetic information in mRNAs, and we saw in Chapter 5 that the genomes of some viruses are composed solely of RNA. We have also seen that complementary base-pairing and other types of hydrogen bonds can occur between nucleotides in the same chain of RNA, causing an RNA molecule to fold up in a unique way determined by its nucleotide sequence (see, for example, Figures 6\u201350 and 6\u201367). Comparisons of many RNA structures have revealed conserved motifs, short structural elements that are used over and over again as parts of larger structures (Figure 6\u201389)."
