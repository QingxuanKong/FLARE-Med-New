However, there is no clear evidence to suggest that radiotherapy directly increases the risk of bladder cancer.\\n\\nIn fact, the documents do not mention a significant association between radiotherapy for prostate cancer and an increased risk of bladder cancer. On the other hand, there is a mention of bladder cancer in the context of urinary symptoms and complications, but this is not directly related to radiotherapy for prostate cancer.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the available information, it appears that radiotherapy for prostate cancer does not increase the risk of bladder cancer.\\n\\nThe correct answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
