JAM does not itself form a zonula occludens strand but is instead associated with claudins. It is involved in the formation of occluding junctions in endothelial cells as well as between endothelial cells and monocytes migrating from the vascular space to the connective tissue."

Integrins are heterodimeric proteins containing a \u03b2 chain, which defines the class of integrin, and an \u03b1 chain, which defines the different integrins within a class. The \u03b1 chain is larger than the \u03b2 chain and contains binding sites for divalent cations that may be important in signaling. LFa-1 (integrin \u03b1L:\u03b22) is expressed on all leukocytes. It binds ICaMs and is important in cell migration and in the interactions of T cells with antigen-presenting cells (apCs) or target cells; it is expressed at higher levels on effector T cells than on naive T cells. Lymphocyte peyer\u2019s patch adhesion molecule (LpaM-1, or integrin \u03b14:\u03b27) is expressed by a subset of naive T cells and contributes to lymphocyte entry into mucosal lymphoid tissues by supporting adhesive interactions with vascular addressin MadCaM-1. vLa-4 (integrin \u03b14:\u03b21) is expressed strongly after T-cell activation. It binds to vCaM-1 on activated endothelium and is important"

LFA-1 and CR3 normally bind their ligands only weakly, but CXCL8 (or other chemokines), bound to proteoglycans on the surface of endothelial cells, binds to specific chemokine receptors on the leukocyte and signals the cell to trigger a conformational change in LFA-1 and CR3 on the rolling leukocyte; this greatly increases the adhesive properties of the leukocyte, as discussed in Section 3-18. The cell then attaches firmly to the endothelium, and its rolling is arrested."

            "content": "Migration of naive T cells into secondary lymphoid tissues depends on their binding to high endothelial venules (HEVs) through cell\u2013cell interactions that are not antigen-specific but are governed by cell-adhesion molecules. The main classes of adhesion molecules involved in lymphocyte interactions are the selectins, the integrins, members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, and some mucin-like molecules (see Fig. 3.30). Entry of lymphocytes into lymph nodes occurs in distinct stages that include initial rolling of lymphocytes along the endothelial surface, activation of integrins, firm adhesion, and transmigration or diapedesis across the endothelial layer into the paracortical areas, the T-cell zones (Fig. 9.6). These stages are regulated by a coordinated interplay of adhesion molecules and chemokines that resembles the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation (see Chapter 3). Adhesion molecules have fairly broad roles in immune responses, being involved not only in"
