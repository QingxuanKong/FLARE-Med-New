Document [19] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) and Document [20] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) provide information about the role of Nanog in pluripotent stem cells. According to these documents, Nanog is a key regulator in embryonic stem cells and is involved in maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells. The information about Nanog in the context of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) is not explicitly mentioned, but based on the information provided about the function of Nanog in embryonic stem cells, we can infer its role in iPS cells. Given that iPS cells are derived from differentiated cells and reprogrammed to have pluripotent properties, it is likely that Nanog plays a similar role in iPS cells as it does in embryonic stem cells. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Nanog is not repressed in pluripotent stem cells, including iPS cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

For example, core networks of TFs such as Pou5f1 (Oct4), Nanog, and Sox2, govern key gene regulatory pathways/networks for the maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency of mouse and human ES cells. These TF networks are modulated by specific external factors through signal transduction pathways, such as leukemia inhibitory factor (Lif)/Stat3, mitogenactivated protein kinase 1/3 (Mapk1/3), the transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) superfamily, and Wnt/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (Gsk3b).

The development of these cells has tremendous promise for both studying disease mechanisms and testing therapeutics.

After their long sojourn in culture, the ES cells or iPS cells and their progeny can still read the signs at each branch in the highway and respond as normal embryonic cells would. If ES or iPS cells are implanted directly into an embryo at a later stage or into an adult tissue, however, they fail to receive the appropriate sequence of cues; their"

            "content": "An alternative approach that has become a method of choice is the direct conversion of terminally differentiated cells into ES-like cells (called induced pluripotent stem [iPS] cells) by overexpressing a combination of key transcription factors (TFs). The original method was to infect mouse embryonic fibroblast cells with retrovirus vectors carrying four TFs [Pou5f1 (Oct4), Sox2, Klf4, and Myc] and to identify rare ES-like cells in culture. This approach was soon adapted to human cells, followed by a more refined procedure (e.g., the use of fewer TFs, different cell types, and different gene-delivery methods). Because a clinical trial using iPS cells is imminent, the safety of iPS-based therapy is a major concern and a variety of measures are being taken to ensure the safety. For example, it has now become a standard to use footprint-free methods such as an episomal vector, Sendai virus vector, and synthetic mRNAs to deliver reprogramming factors into cells, resulting in the"

            "content": "In many cases, however, the dimers and heterodimers are held together very weakly; they exist predominantly as monomers in solution, and yet dimers are observed on the appropriate DNA sequence. Here, the proteins are said to bind to DNA cooperatively, and the curve describing their binding is sigmoidal in shape (Figure 7\u201310B). Cooperative binding means that, over a range of concentrations of the transcription regulator, binding is more of an all-or-none phenomenon than Figure 7\u20139 Transcription regulators and cis-regulatory sequences. (A) Depiction of the cis-regulatory sequence for nanog, a homeodomain family member that is a key regulator in embryonic stem cells. this \u201clogo\u201d form (see figure 6\u201312) shows that the protein can recognize a collection of closely related DnA sequences and gives the preferred nucleotide pair at each position. Cis-regulatory sequences are \u201cread\u201d as double-stranded DnA, but only one strand typically is shown in a logo."

            "content": "although these protocols are still at an early stage of development. Human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells have a very high replicative potential, but they also have the potential for rejection and tumor formation (e.g., teratomas). The more recently described amniotic fluid and placental stem cells have a high replicative potential but without an apparent propensity for tumor formation. Moreover, they have the potential to be used in an autologous manner without rejection. Adult stem cells, such as those derived from bone marrow, also have less propensity for tumor formation and, if used in an autologous manner, will not be rejected, but their replicative potential is limited, especially for endoderm and ectoderm cells."
