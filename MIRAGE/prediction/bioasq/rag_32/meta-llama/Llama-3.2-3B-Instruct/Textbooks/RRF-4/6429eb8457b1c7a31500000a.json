    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the definition of epigenetic modification. Epigenetic modifications are heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence. These modifications can include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and other types of chromatin remodeling. Adenosine methylation, on the other hand, refers to the process of adding a methyl group to adenosine nucleotides. This process is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents as a type of epigenetic modification. However, it is worth noting that adenosine is a nucleotide that can be methylated, and this process is indeed an epigenetic modification. Nonetheless, the question specifically asks about adenosine methylation, not DNA methylation. Therefore, based on the provided documents, the answer to the question is that adenosine methylation is not explicitly mentioned as an epigenetic modification, but adenosine itself can be methylated, which is an epigenetic process.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Methylation is by methyltransferases that use S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor (Fig. 33.17). Transcriptionally active genes are less methylated (hypomethylated) than their inactive counterparts, suggesting that DNA hypermethylation silences gene expression.

            "content": "DNA methylation helps to repress transcription in several ways. The methyl groups on methylated cytosines lie in the major groove of DNA and interfere directly with the binding of proteins (transcription regulators as well as the general transcription factors) required for transcription initiation. In addition, the cell contains a repertoire of proteins that bind specifically to methylated DNA.The best characterized of these associate with histone modifying enzymes, leading to a repressive chromatin state where chromatin structure and DNA methylation act synergistically (Figure 7\u201345). One reflection of the importance of DNA methylation to humans is the widespread involvement of \u201cincorrect\u201d DNA methylation patterns in cancer progression (discussed in Chapter 20).

            "content": "A. cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels are low. B. glucose and lactose are both available. C. the attenuation stem-loop is able to form. D. the CAP site is occupied. Correct answer = D. It is only when glucose is gone, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels are increased, the cAMP\u2013catabolite activator protein (CAP) complex is bound to the CAP site, and lactose is available that the operon is maximally expressed (induced). If glucose is present, the operon is off as a result of catabolite repression. The lac operon is not regulated by attenuation, a mechanism for stopping transcription in some operons such as the trp operon. 3.7. X chromosome inactivation is a process by which one of two X chromosomes in mammalian females is condensed and inactivated to prevent overexpression of X-linked genes. What would most likely be true about the degree of DNA methylation and histone acetylation on the inactivated X chromosome?"
