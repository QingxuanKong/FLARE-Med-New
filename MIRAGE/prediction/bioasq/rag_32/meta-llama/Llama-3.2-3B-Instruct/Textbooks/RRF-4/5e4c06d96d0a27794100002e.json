Document [0] (Neurology_Adams) mentions that uremia, a complication of SLE, can produce convulsions. Document [1] (Obstentrics_Williams) lists seizures as a neurological manifestation of SLE. Document [3] (InternalMed_Harrison) discusses cognitive dysfunction, headaches, and seizures as possible manifestations of CNS lupus. Document [4] (Neurology_Adams) mentions seizures as a possible neurologic manifestation of SLE. Document [7] (Neurology_Adams) also mentions seizures as a possible manifestation of CNS lupus. Document [10] (Neurology_Adams) mentions seizures as a prominent feature of bacterial meningitis, but also notes that seizures may occur in other conditions such as lupus erythematosus. Document [11] (InternalMed_Harrison) discusses seizures as a possible cause of confusion, clouding of consciousness, and garbled speech, which can be related to SLE. Document [12] (Neurology_Adams) mentions seizures as a possible finding in the CSF of patients with SLE. Document [13] (Neurology_Adams) discusses seizures as a possible manifestation of autoimmune encephalitis, which can be related to SLE. Document [19] (InternalMed_Harrison) lists seizures as a possible manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Document [23] (Neurology_Adams) mentions that myasthenia gravis and other autoimmune diseases, including SLE, can be associated with seizures. Document [25] (Neurology_Adams) discusses seizures as a possible cause of confusion, which can be related to SLE. Document [26] (Immunology_Janeway) does not specifically mention seizures, but documents [27] (Neurology_Adams) and [28] (Immunology_Janeway) discuss the role of autoantibodies in SLE and their potential to cause seizures. Document [29] (Neurology_Adams) mentions that patients with a history of seizures are at risk of having another seizure within 5 years, and that this risk is greater in patients with a family history of seizures. Document [30] (Neurology_Adams) discusses seizures as a possible cause of confusion in various medical conditions, including SLE. Based on the information provided, it appears that SLE can cause seizures, and seizures can be a manifestation of SLE. Therefore, the answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

            "content": "Uremia has a strong tendency to produce convulsions. Of interest is the relation of seizures to the development of acute anuric renal failure, generally from acute tubular necrosis but occasionally due to glomerular disease. Total anuria may be tolerated for several days without the appearance of neurologic signs, and then there is an abrupt onset of twitching, trembling, myoclonic jerks, and brief generalized motor seizures; acute hypertension probably plays a role. The entire motor constellation, one of the most dramatic in medicine, lasts several days until the patient sinks into terminal coma or recovers by dialysis. When this twitch-convulsive syndrome accompanies lupus erythematosus, seizures of undetermined cause, or generalized neoplasia, one should suspect its basis in renal failure."

Lupus nephritis can also cause renal insuiciency, which is more common if there are anti phospholipid antibodies (Moroni, 2004). Other laboratory indings include false-positive syphilis serology, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, and higher RF levels. Elevated serum D-dimer concentrations often follow a lare or infection, but unexplained persistent elevations are associated with a high risk for thrombosis (Wu, 2008).

If symptoms are related to 2129 SLE, it should be determined whether they are caused by a diffuse process (requiring immunosuppression) or vascular occlusive disease (requiring anticoagulation). The most common manifestation of diffuse CNS lupus is cognitive dysfunction, including difficulties with memory and reasoning. Headaches are also common. When excruciating, they often indicate SLE flare; when milder, they are difficult to distinguish from migraine or tension headaches. Seizures of any type may be caused by lupus; treatment often requires both antiseizure and immunosuppressive therapies. Psychosis can be the dominant manifestation of SLE; it must be distinguished from glucocorticoid-induced psychosis. The latter usually occurs in the first weeks of glucocorticoid therapy, at daily doses of \u226540 mg of prednisone or equivalent; psychosis resolves over several days after glucocorticoids are decreased or stopped.

Conversely, between 5 and 10 percent of MS patients have antinuclear or anti-double stranded DNA antibodies without signs of lupus, but the significance of this finding is not at all clear. In addition, as discussed in the introductory section, relatives of patients with MS in some series have a higher than expected incidence of autoantibodies of various types, suggesting an as yet unproved connection between systemic autoimmune disease and MS."

Fever, headache, and stiff neck provide the clues to diagnosis, and lumbar puncture yields the salient data. In endemic areas and in individuals who have traveled from these areas, cysticercosis and tuberculous granulomas of the brain are very common causes of epilepsy. Myoclonic jerking and seizures may appear early in acute herpes simplex encephalitis and other forms of viral, treponemal, and parasitic encephalitis, including those derived from HIV infection, both directly and indirectly such as toxoplasmosis and brain lymphoma; and in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Seizure(s) without fever or stiff neck may be the initial manifestation of syphilitic meningitis, a fact worth noting as this process reemerges in AIDS patients."

Often, psychiatric disease is suspected, but an EEG demonstrates the epileptic nature of the illness. If recurrent or persistent, the condition may be termed complex partial status epilepticus. The cognitive disturbance often responds to anticonvulsant therapy. The etiology may be previous small strokes or head trauma; some cases are idiopathic. It is important to recognize systemic diseases that indirectly affect the brain and produce chronic confusion or dementia. Such conditions include hypothyroidism; vasculitis; and hepatic, renal, or pulmonary disease.

            "content": "Generalized seizures, with or without twitching, occur in the advanced stages of many other illnesses, such as hypertensive encephalopathy, the posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome from various drugs (PRES, as discussed in Chap. 33), sepsis\u2014especially gram-negative septicemia with shock\u2014and hepatic coma. Usually, seizures in these circumstances can be traced to an associated metabolic abnormality and are revealed by appropriate studies of the blood. Seizures are a central feature of the eclamptic syndrome as discussed in a separate section below. In most cases of seizures caused by metabolic and withdrawal states, treatment with antiepileptic drugs is not necessary as long as the underlying disturbance is rectified. Indeed, antiepileptic drugs are usually ineffective in halting the seizures if the metabolic disorder persists. Medications and Other Drugs as Causes of Seizures"
