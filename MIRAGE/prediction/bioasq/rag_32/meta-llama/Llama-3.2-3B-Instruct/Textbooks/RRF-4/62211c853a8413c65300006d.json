CircRNA (Circular RNA) is a type of RNA that is formed by the back-splicing of exons and introns from a single gene, resulting in a circular RNA molecule. This process is also known as exon-intron back-splicing. In this process, the spliceosome assembles on the pre-mRNA and recognizes the splice sites, but instead of removing the intron, it joins the exons together to form a circular RNA molecule. This process can occur in both exons and introns, resulting in either exon circRNA or intron circRNA. Therefore, the correct answer is that circRNA can be produced by back splicing of both exon and intron, forming either exon or intron circRNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The machinery that catalyzes pre-mRNA splicing is complex, consisting of five addi-tional RNA molecules and several hundred proteins, and it hydrolyzes many ATP molecules per splicing event. This complexity ensures that splicing is accurate, while at the same time being flexible enough to deal with the enormous variety of introns found in a typical eukaryotic cell. It may seem wasteful to remove large numbers of introns by RNA splicing. In attempting to explain why it occurs, scientists have pointed out that the exon\u2013 intron arrangement would seem to facilitate the emergence of new and useful proteins over evolutionary time scales. Thus, the presence of numerous introns in DNA allows genetic recombination to readily combine the exons of different genes,"

The molecular complex that accomplishes these tasks is known as the spliceosome. A few eukaryotic primary transcripts contain no introns (for example, those from histone genes).

These signals are transcribed into RNA as the RNA polymerase II moves through them, and they are then recognized (as RNA) by a series of RNA-binding proteins and RNA-processing enzymes (Figure 6\u201335). Two multisubunit proteins, called CstF (cleavage stimulation factor) and CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor), are of special importance. intron sequences normal mRNA is formed from three exons A SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE CHANGE THAT DESTROYS A NORMAL SPLICE SITE, THEREBY CAUSING EXON SKIPPING mRNA with exon 2 missing A SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE CHANGE THAT DESTROYS A NORMAL SPLICE SITE, THEREBY ACTIVATING A CRYPTIC SPLICE SITE mRNA with extended exon 3 mRNA with extra exon inserted between exon 2 and exon 3 Figure 6\u201333 Abnormal processing of the \u03b2-globin primary RNA transcript in humans with the disease \u03b2 thalassemia."

Introns refer to the spacing regions between the exons that are spliced out of precursor RNAs during RNA processing. The gene locus also includes regions that are necessary to control its expression (Fig. 82-2). Current 427 estimates predict 20,687 protein-coding genes in the human genome with an average of about four different coding transcripts per gene. Remarkably, the exome only constitutes 1.14% of the genome. In addition, thousands of noncoding transcripts (RNAs of various length such as microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs), which function, at least in part, as transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression, have been identified. Aberrant expression of microRNAs has been found to play a pathogenic role in numerous diseases."

            "content": "What is the purpose of these rearrangements? First, they allow the splicing signals on the pre-RNA to be examined by snRNPs several times during the course of splicing. For example, the U1 snRNP initially recognizes the 5\u02b9 splice site through conventional base-pairing; as splicing proceeds, these base pairs are broken (using the energy of ATP hydrolysis) and U1 is replaced by U6 (Figure 6\u201329). This type of RNA\u2013RNA rearrangement (in which the formation of one RNA\u2013RNA interaction requires the disruption of another) occurs several times during splicing and allows the spliceosomes to check and recheck the splicing signals, thereby increasing the overall accuracy of splicing. Second, the rearrangements that take place in the spliceosome create the active sites for the two transesterification reactions. These two active sites are created, one after the other, and only after the splicing signals on the pre-mRNA have been checked several times. This orderly progression ensures that splicing"

            "content": "When the spliceosome was first discovered, it puzzled molecular biologists. Why do RNA molecules instead of proteins perform important roles in splice-site recognition and in the chemistry of splicing? Why is a lariat intermediate used rather than the apparently simpler alternative of bringing the 5\u02b9and 3\u02b9 splice sites together in a single step, followed by their direct cleavage and rejoining? The answers to these questions reflect the way in which the spliceosome has evolved."
