The answer is that the protective system is often inactivated in cancer cells by mutations in the genes that encode essential components of the blocking mechanisms, such as Arf or p53 or the proteins that help activate them. Cell proliferation is accompanied by Cell growth If cells proliferated without growing, they would get progressively smaller and there would be no net increase in total cell mass. In most proliferating cell populations, therefore, cell growth accompanies cell division. In single-celled organisms stable, active p53 such as yeasts, both cell growth and cell division require only nutrients. In animals, by contrast, both cell growth and cell proliferation depend on extracellular signal molecules, produced by other cells, which we call growth factors and mitogens, respectively."

We then turn to the important but poorly understood problem of how a proliferating cell coordinates its growth with cell division so as to maintain its appropriate size. We discuss the control of cell survival and cell death by apoptosis in Chapter 18. Unicellular organisms tend to grow and divide as fast as they can, and their rate of proliferation depends largely on the availability of nutrients in the environment. The cells of a multicellular organism, however, divide only when the organism needs more cells. Thus, for an animal cell to proliferate, it must receive stimulatory extracellular signals, in the form of mitogens, from other cells, usually its neighbors. Mitogens overcome intracellular braking mechanisms that block progress through the cell cycle."

The normal cell seems able to detect abnormal mitogenic stimulation, and it responds by preventing further division. Such responses help prevent the survival and proliferation of cells with various cancer-promoting mutations. Although it is not known how a cell detects excessive mitogenic stimulation, such stimulation often leads to the production of a cell-cycle inhibitor protein called Arf, which binds and inhibits Mdm2. As discussed earlier, Mdm2 normally promotes p53 degradation. Activation of Arf therefore causes p53 levels to increase, inducing either cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis (Figure 17\u201363)."

            "content": "Mutations in genes that regulate some or all of these cellular traits are seen in every cancer; accordingly, these traits form the basis of the following discussion of the molecular origins of cancer. Of note, by convention, gene symbols are italicized but their protein products are not (e.g., RB gene and RB protein, TP53 and p53, MYC and MYC). The self-sufficiency in growth that characterizes cancer cells generally stems from gain-of-function mutations that convert proto-oncogenes to oncogenes. Oncogenes encode proteins called oncoproteins that promote cell growth, even in the absence of normal growth-promoting signals. To appreciate how oncogenes drive inappropriate cell growth, it is helpful to review briefly the sequence of events that characterize normal cell proliferation (introduced in Chapter 1). Under physiologic conditions, cell proliferation can be readily resolved into the following steps: 1. Binding of a growth factor to its specific receptor on the cell membrane 2."
