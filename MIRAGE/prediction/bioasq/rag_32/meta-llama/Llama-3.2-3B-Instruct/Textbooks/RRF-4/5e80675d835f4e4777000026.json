Giant cells are frequently seen, and coronavirus particles have been detected in type II pneumocytes. Elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines have been detected in sera from patients with SARS. Because MERS-CoV was so recently detected, little is known at present about its pathogenesis. However, it may well be similar to that of SARS-CoV."

These frontiers were first notably explored with high-density microarrays containing spatially arrayed sequences from a phylogenetically diverse collection of viruses. Although biased toward those with homology to known viruses, novel viruses in clinical samples were successfully identified on the basis of their ability to hybridize to these prespecified sequences. This methodology famously contributed to identification of the coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Once discovered, this SARS corona-virus was rapidly sequenced: the full genome was assembled in April 2003, less than 6 months after recognition of the first case. This accomplishment illustrated the advancing power and speed of new diagnostic technologies."

Recall that the normal mammalian 5\u02b9 cap is initiated by linking a 7-methylguanosine nucleotide to the first ribose sugar of the mRNA by a 5\u02b9\u20135\u02b9 triphosphate bridge, to produce a structure called cap-0. This structure is further modified by cytoplasmic methylation of the 2\u02b9 hydroxyl groups on the first and second ribose sugars of the RNA. Methylation of the first ribose sugar produces a structure called cap-1; methylation of the second generates cap-2. IFIT1 has a high affinity for cap-0, but much lower affinity for cap-1 and cap-2. Some viruses, such as Sindbis virus (family Togaviridae), lack 2\u02b9-O-methylation, and therefore are restricted by this action of IFIT1.

Poliovirus, which causes poliomyelitis, binds to a cell-surface receptor, triggering both receptor-mediated endocytosis (see Figure 13\u201352) and a conformational change in the viral particle. The conformational change exposes a hydrophobic projection on one of the capsid proteins, which inserts into the endosomal membrane to form a pore. The viral RNA genome then enters the cytosol through the pore, leaving the capsid in the endosome (Figure 23\u201318C). Other nonenveloped viruses such as adenovirus disrupt the endosomal membrane after they are taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. One of the proteins released from the capsid lyses the endosomal membrane, releasing the remainder of the virus into the cytosol. During endosomal trafficking and subsequent transport within the cytosol, adenoviruses undergo multiple uncoating steps, which sequentially remove structural proteins"
