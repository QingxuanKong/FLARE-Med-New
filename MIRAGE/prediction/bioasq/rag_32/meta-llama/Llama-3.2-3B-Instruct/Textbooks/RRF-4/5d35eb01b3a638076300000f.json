    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the definition of enhancers and their relationship with transcription regulation. Enhancers are DNA sequences that increase the rate of transcription by RNA polymerase II. According to Document [2], enhancers can be located upstream or downstream of the transcription start site, and they contain DNA sequences called response elements that bind transcription factors. Additionally, Document [1] mentions that enhancers can also be called splicing enhancers, which are analogous to transcriptional enhancers. Given these definitions, we can analyze the relationship between enhancers and transcription regulation. In general, enhancers are associated with the activation of transcription, not repression. However, it is possible that certain regulatory elements, such as splicing enhancers, can have a role in regulating transcription in a way that is not necessarily related to the activation or repression of transcription. Therefore, we need to consider the specific context in which the term negative enhancers is being used. In some cases, certain regulatory elements may have a repressive function, but this is not typically referred to as an enhancer. Instead, these elements are often referred to as silencers or repressors. In the context of the provided documents, there is no clear indication that negative enhancers exist as a distinct class of regulatory elements. Instead, the documents focus on the role of enhancers in activating transcription and the concept of negative feedback, which is a different mechanism of regulation. Therefore, based on the information provided, the correct answer is that there are no negative enhancers.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Because rnA is flexible, the nucleotide sequences that bind these activators can be located many nucleotide pairs from the splice junctions they control, and they are often called splicing enhancers, by analogy with the transcriptional enhancers mentioned earlier in this chapter."

Enhancers are typically on the same chromosome as the gene whose transcription they stimulate (Fig. 31.13B). However, they can 1) be located upstream (to the 5\u2032-side) or downstream (to the 3\u2032-side) of the transcription start site, 2) be close to or thousands of base pairs away from the promoter (Fig. 31.14), and 3) occur on either strand of the DNA. Enhancers contain DNA sequences called response elements that bind STF. By bending or looping the DNA, STF can interact with other TF bound to a promoter and with RNA pol II, thereby stimulating transcription (see Fig. 31.13B). Mediator also binds enhancers.

However, eukaryotic genes are rarely organized along the genome according to function, and this strategy is not generally applicable for shutting off a set of genes that work together. Instead, most eukaryotic repressors work on a geneby-gene basis. Unlike bacterial repressors, eukaryotic repressors do not directly compete with the RNA polymerase for access to the DNA; rather, they use a variety of other mechanisms, some of which are illustrated in Figure 7\u201323.

            "content": "As was previously shown in Figure 7\u201337B, the master regulators needed to maintain the pluripotency of iPS cells bind to cis-regulatory sequences in their own control regions, providing examples of the type of positive feedback loop. In addition, most of these pluripotent cell regulators also activate transcription of other master regulators, resulting in a complex series of indirect feedback loops. For example, if A activates B, and B activates A, this forms a positive feedback loop where A activates its own expression, albeit indirectly. The series of direct and indirect feedback loops observed in the iPS circuit is typical of other specialized cell circuits. Such a network structure strengthens cell memory, increasing the probability that a particular pattern of gene expression is transmitted through successive generations. For example, if the level of A drops below the critical threshold to stimulate its own synthesis, regulator B can rescue it. By successive application of this"

            "content": "CT and MRI are the most important diagnostic tools. In the CT scan, the capsule of the abscess enhances and the center of the abscess and surrounding edematous white matter are hypodense. With MRI, in T1-weighted images, the capsule enhances and the interior of the abscess is hypointense and shows restricted diffusion; in T2-weighted images, the surrounding edema is apparent and the capsule is hypointense and there is variable diffusion restriction within the lesion (see Fig. 31-2, right). The abscess capsule tends to be thinner on the side directed to the lateral ventricle. Cerebritis appears as dot-sized areas of decreased density that enhance with gadolinium. Practically all abscesses larger than 1 cm produce positive scans. There is almost no likelihood of cerebral abscess if enhanced CT and MRI studies are negative. Blood cultures, sedimentation rate, and chest radiography are indispensable in the complete diagnosis of brain abscess, although it must be acknowledged that blood"
