    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the information provided in the documents. Progeria, also known as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that causes accelerated aging in children. It is caused by a mutation in the LMNA gene, which is required for the nuclear lamina, a structure that provides structural support to the nucleus. The LMNA gene is an autosomal gene, meaning it is located on one of the 22 autosomal chromosomes, not on the sex chromosomes (X or Y). Therefore, progeria is not caused by an X-linked or Y-linked gene. Additionally, progeria is not typically associated with consanguineous marriages, which are common in populations with autosomal recessive disorders. Instead, it is usually diagnosed in infancy and progresses rapidly, leading to death in the teenage years. This pattern of inheritance is more consistent with an autosomal dominant disorder, where a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the condition. However, the fact that progeria often skips generations and does not follow a clear Mendelian pattern of inheritance makes it difficult to categorize as strictly autosomal dominant. Nevertheless, based on the available information, it is more likely that progeria is caused by an autosomal dominant gene, rather than an autosomal recessive gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Some are lethal and are therefore not transmitted to successive generations; others are less harmful and may conform to one of the classic mendelian patterns. The mutation may be large and result in duplication of a major part of a chromosome or even of the entire gene (diploidy or triploidy) or a deletion (haploidy).

            "content": "genes that result in disease. Because each individual has two copies of each chromosome (one inherited from the mother and one inherited from the father), he or she can have only two alleles at a given locus. However, there can be many different alleles in the population. The normal or common allele is usually referred to as wild type. When alleles at a given locus are identical, the individual is homozygous. Inheriting identical copies of a mutant allele occurs in many autosomal recessive disorders, particularly in circumstances of consanguinity or isolated populations. If the alleles are different on the maternal and the paternal copy of the gene, the individual is heterozygous at this locus (Fig. 82-10). If two different mutant alleles are inherited at a given locus, the individual is said to be a compound heterozygote. Hemizygous is used to describe males with a mutation in an X chromosomal gene or a female with a loss of one X chromosomal locus."
