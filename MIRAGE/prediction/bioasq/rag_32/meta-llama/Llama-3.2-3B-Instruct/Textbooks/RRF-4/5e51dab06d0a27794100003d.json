A brisk lymphocytic infiltrate with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes is not uncommon in these tumors. The risk of carrying a germline mutation that predisposes to ovarian cancer depends on the number of first-or second-degree relatives (or both) with a history of epithelial ovarian carcinoma or breast cancer (or both) and on the number of malignancies that occurs at an earlier age. The degree of risk is difficult to determine precisely unless a full pedigree analysis is performed. 1.

Synthetic lethality occurs when loss of function in either of two genes alone has limited effects on cell survival but loss of function in both genes leads to cell death. Identifying genes that have a synthetic lethal relationship to tumor-suppressor pathways that have been mutated in tumor cells may allow targeting of proteins required uniquely by those cells (Fig. 102e-3). Several examples of this have been identified. For instance, cells with mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 tumor-suppressor genes (e.g., a subset of breast and ovarian cancers) are unable to repair DNA damage by homologous recombination.

The most common genetic abnormalities in sporadic gastric cancer affect the p53 and COX-2 genes. Over two-thirds of gastric cancers have deletion or suppression of the important tumor-suppressor gene p53. Additionally, approxi-mately the same proportion have overexpression of COX-2. In the colon, tumors with upregulation of this gene have suppressed apoptosis, more angiogenesis, and higher metastatic potential. Gastric tumors that overexpress COX-2 are more aggressive. Recently, a germline mutation in the CDH1 gene encoding E-cadherin was shown to be associated with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Prophylactic total gastrectomy should be consid-ered in patients with these mutations.142Premalignant Conditions of the Stomach Figure 26-52 shows the prevalence of some premalignant conditions associated with the development of early gastric cancer in a series of 1900 cases from Tokyo.

Type II endometrial cancers are estrogen-independent, aggressive, and characterized by nonendometrioid, serous or clear cell, histology, or carcinosarcoma.102 Emerging data, however, suggest that the molecular features could provide reproducible subtypes that have the potential to guide and refine treatment. The most comprehensive molecular study of endometrial cancer to date has been The Cancer Genome Atlas, which included a combination of whole genome sequencing, exome sequencing, microsatellite instability assays, copy number analysis, and proteomics.103 Molecular information was used to classify 232 endometrial cancer patients into four groups: POLE ultramutated, MSI hypermutated, copy number low, and copy number high that correlated with progression-free survival.103 Two practical pared-down classification systems to identify four molecular subgroups with distinct prognostic"

Most studies show no increase in the rate of uterine and cervical tumors, but there are rare reports of an increase of papillary serous tumors of the endometrium (83). Women on tamoxifen are at higher risk for benign endometrial lesions (e.g., polyps) and endometrial cancer. It is reasonable to consider the performance of a prophylactic hysterectomy in conjunction with salpingo-oophorectomy, but this decision should be individualized. The survival of women who have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and develop ovarian cancer is longer than that for those who do not have a mutation. In one study, the median survival for mutation carriers was 53.4 months compared with 37.8 months for those with sporadic ovarian cancer from the same institution (84). Current recommendations for management of women at high risk for ovarian cancer are summarized as follows (72,82): 1."

MYCN amplification or overexpression is a poor prognostic factor, as it is in medulloblastoma. Various acquired chromosomal deletions and gains may also have predictive importance. More provocative are findings that suggest the emergence of an aggressive tumor based on polymorphisms in chromosome 6p. Maris has provided a review of the interesting genetic aspects of the tumor. Several staging systems have evolved for neuroblastoma and The Children\u2019s Oncology Group has produced a risk-based system that includes the status of chromosomal changes (17q, 1p, 11q), but these approaches are under frequent revision."

Individuals inheriting a single copy of a mutant allele have a very high incidence of breast and ovarian cancer. Most of these women have a family history that is notable for multiple cases of breast and/or ovarian cancer, although inheritance through male members of the family can camouflage this genotype through several generations. The most common malignancy in these women is breast carcinoma, although women harboring germline BRCA1 mutations have a marked increased risk of developing ovarian malignancies in their forties and fifties with a 30\u201350% lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer. Women harboring a mutation in BRCA2 have a lower penetrance of ovarian cancer with perhaps a 20\u201340% chance of developing this malignancy, with onset typically in their fifties or sixties.

About 30% of ovarian neoplasms in postmenopausal women are malignant, whereas only about 7% of ovarian epithelial tumors in premenopausal patients are frankly malignant. The average age of patients with borderline tumors is approximately 46 years. Ovarian cancer is associated with low parity and infertility. Because parity is inversely related to the risk of ovarian cancer, having at least one child is protective for the disease, with a risk reduction of 0.3 to 0.4. Oral contraceptive use reduces the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. Women who use oral contraceptives for 5 or more years reduce their relative risk to 0.5 (i.e., there is a 50% reduction in the likelihood of development of ovarian cancer)."
