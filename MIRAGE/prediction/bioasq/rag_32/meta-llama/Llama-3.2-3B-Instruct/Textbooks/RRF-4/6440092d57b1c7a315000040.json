However, we can analyze the process of FDA approval and the information about other drugs to make an educated guess. RTA 408 is an immunosuppressive agent, and drugs in this class have received FDA approval. Given that RTA 408 is an immunosuppressant, it is possible that it has received FDA approval. However, without specific information about RTA 408, we can only make an educated guess based on the general process of FDA approval for drugs in this class.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Use of pharmaceutical industry funding to support FDA approval processes raises the possibility of conflicts of interest within the FDA. Supporters of this policy point out that chronic FDA underfunding by the government allows for few alternatives. Another important source of conflicts of interest is the dependence of the FDA on outside panels of experts who are recruited from the scientific and clinical community to advise the government agency on questions regarding drug approval or withdrawal. Such experts are often recipients of grants from the companies producing the drugs in question. The need for favorable data in the new drug application leads to phase 2 and 3 trials in which the new agent is compared only to placebo, not to older, effective drugs.

The importance of careful and complete reporting of toxicity by physicians after marketing begins can be appreciated by noting that many important drug-induced effects have an incidence of 1 in 10,000 or less and that some adverse effects may become apparent only after chronic dosing. The sample size required to disclose drug-induced events or toxicities is very large for such rare events. For example, several hundred thousand patients may have to be exposed before the first case is observed of a toxicity that occurs with an average incidence of 1 in 10,000. Therefore, low-incidence drug effects are not generally detected before phase 4 no matter how carefully phase 1, 2, and 3 studies are executed. Phase 4 has no fixed duration.

Manufacturers sponsor small and often poorly designed clinical studies after marketing approval and aid in the publication of favorable results but may retard publication of unfavorable results. The need for physicians to meet continuing medical education (CME) requirements in order to maintain their licenses encourages manufacturers to sponsor conferences and courses, often in highly attractive vacation sites, and new drugs are often featured in such courses. Finally, the common practice of distributing free samples of new drugs to practicing physicians has both positive and negative effects. The samples allow physicians to try out new drugs without incurring any cost to the patient.

            "content": "Factor VIIa has been widely used for off-label indications, including bleeding with trauma, surgery, intracerebral hemorrhage, and warfarin toxicity. A major concern of off-label use has been the possibility that thrombotic events may be increased. A recent study examined rates of thromboembolic events in 35 placebo-controlled trials where factor VIIa was administered CHAPTER 34 Drugs Used in Disorders of Coagulation 623 for nonapproved indications. This study found an increase in arterial, but not venous, thrombotic events, particularly among elderly individuals. Orphan drug status is a designation given by the FDA to promote development of therapies for rare disorders (see Chapter 1). Factor XIII is a transaminase that crosslinks fibrin within a clot, thereby stabilizing it. Congenital factor XIII deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder. Recombinant factor XIII A-subunit is FDA-approved for prevention of bleeding in patients with factor XIII deficiency."

A fourth phase of data gathering and safety monitoring is becoming increasingly important and follows after approval for marketing. Once approved, the great majority of drugs become available for use by any appropriately licensed practitioner. Highly toxic drugs that are nevertheless considered valuable in lethal diseases may be approved for restricted use by practitioners who have undergone special training in their use and who maintain detailed records."

Like the other IMiDs, it has myriad mechanisms of actions including antiangiogenic activity, inhibition of TNF-\u03b1, and stimulation of apoptosis and cytotoxic T-cell activity. Most clinical trials of pomalidomide have targeted patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, for which the FDA approved the drug in 2013. Both lenalidomide and pomalidomide have side effect profiles similar to that of thalidomide."
