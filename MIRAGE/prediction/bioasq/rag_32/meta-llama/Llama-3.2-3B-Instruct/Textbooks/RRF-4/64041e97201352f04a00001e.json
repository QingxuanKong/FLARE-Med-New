    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether daridorexant is effective for insomnia, we need to analyze the given information. Daridorexant is an orexin receptor antagonist, which is a class of drugs that block the effects of orexin, a neurotransmitter involved in regulating arousal. Orexin antagonists are used to treat insomnia. Let's look at the relevant documents to see if daridorexant is mentioned.\\n\\nDocument [17] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) mentions that orexin receptor antagonists, such as almorexant, promote sleep without impairment of performance in rats.\\n\\nDocument [22] (Title: Neurology_Adams) does not specifically mention daridorexant, but it explains that orexin receptor antagonists are a class of drugs that can be used to treat insomnia.\\n\\nDocument [17] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) also mentions that suvorexant is an orexin antagonist, which is FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia.\\n\\nSince daridorexant is an orexin receptor antagonist, it is likely to be effective for insomnia, similar to other orexin antagonists.\\n\\nHowever, we need to check if daridorexant is FDA-approved for the treatment of insomnia.\\n\\nDocument [2] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) lists suvorexant as an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of insomnia, but it does not mention daridorexant.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the available information, daridorexant is likely to be effective for insomnia, but its FDA approval status is unknown.\\n\\nHowever, considering the information from Document [17] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) and Document [22] (Title: Neurology_Adams), it can be inferred that daridorexant is effective for insomnia.\\n\\nSo, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Generally, side effects are minimal when the dose is kept low and the serum concentration is minimized during the waking hours (by using the shortest-acting effective agent). For chronic insomnia, intermittent use is recommended, unless the consequences of untreated insomnia outweigh concerns regarding chronic use."

Long-term use of hypnotics is an irrational and dangerous medical practice. Table 22\u20132 summarizes several other important clinical uses of drugs in the sedative-hypnotic class. Drugs used in the management of seizure disorders and as intravenous agents in anesthesia are discussed in Chapters 24 and 25.

For patients with depression who have insomnia and anxiety, a sedating antidepressant such as mirtazapine can be helpful. In the elderly, trazodone, beginning at 25 mg at nighttime, is an effective sleep aid at doses lower than those which cause its antidepressant effect. Zolpidem may have a decreased incidence of delirium in patients compared with traditional benzodiazepines, but this has not been clearly established. When benzodiazepines are prescribed, short-acting ones (such as lorazepam) are favored over longer-acting ones (such as diazepam). Patients who receive these medications should be observed for signs of increased confusion and delirium."

For patients who have difficulty falling asleep, a quick-acting, fairly rapidly metabolized hypnotic is useful. The most commonly used medications were the benzodiazepine receptor agonists, which act on the gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA-A receptor complex. Benzodiazepines were popular but these have been largely replaced by nonbenzodiazepines, GABA-A \u03b11-receptor agonists, with shorter half-lives and perhaps fewer side effects (e.g., zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone). Patients who do not respond to these medications may be given an intermediate-duration benzodiazepine such as temazepam.

In addition to its antidepressant effects, bupropion is energizing, making it useful for depressed patients who experience fatigue.

As a result, drugs that FIguRE 38-2 Relationship of drugs for insomnia with wake-sleep systems. The arousal system in the brain (green) includes monoaminergic, glutamatergic, and cholinergic neurons in the brainstem that activate neurons in the hypothalamus, thalamus, basal forebrain, and cerebral cortex. Orexin neurons (blue) in the hypothalamus, which are lost in narcolepsy, reinforce and stabilize arousal by activating other components of the arousal system. The sleep-promoting system (red) consists of GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area, lateral hypothalamus, and brainstem that inhibit the components of the arousal system, thus allowing sleep to occur. Drugs used to treat insomnia include those that block the effects of arousal system neurotransmitters (green and blue) and those that enhance the effects of \u03b3-aminobutyric"

Among the anorexiants, phentermine has been the most commonly prescribed; there is limited long-term data on its effectiveness. A 2002 review of six randomized, placebo-controlled trials of phentermine for weight control found that patients lost 0.6\u20136.0 additional kilograms of weight over 2\u201324 weeks of treatment. The most common side effects of the amphetamine-derived anorexiants are restlessness, insomnia, dry mouth, constipation, and increased blood pressure and heart rate."
