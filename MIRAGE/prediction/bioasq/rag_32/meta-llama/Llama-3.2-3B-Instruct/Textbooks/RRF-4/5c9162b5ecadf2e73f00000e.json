    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether ustekinumab is a polyclonal antibody, we need to understand the difference between polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Polyclonal antibodies are derived from a mixture of different B cell clones, resulting in a diverse range of antibodies with different specificities. Monoclonal antibodies, on the other hand, are derived from a single B cell clone and have the same specificity. Ustekinumab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines. Given its specific binding affinity and mechanism of action, it is clear that ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody. Therefore, the correct answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

It blocks IL-12 and IL-23 from binding to their receptors, therefore inhibiting receptor-mediated signaling in lymphocytes. Ustekinumab is indicated for adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis either alone or with methotrexate. The advantage of ustekinumab over antiTNF-\u03b1 drugs for psoriasis is faster and longer-term improvement in symptoms along with very infrequent dosing. Vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the \u03b14\u03b27 integrin in the gastrointestinal tract. It does not appear to induce systemic immunosuppression of other \u03b14\u03b27 integrin-binding antibodies such as natalizumab because it does not bind to the majority of \u03b14\u03b27 integrin on lymphocytes. It has been recommended for approval for the treatment of adults with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis."

It is an option for patients who are JC antibody positive since it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Vedolizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against \u03b14\u03b27 integrin specifically and has the ability to convey gut-selective immunosuppression. Ustekinumab, a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody, blocks the biologic activity of IL-12 and IL-23 through their common p40 subunit by inhibiting the interaction of these cytokines with their receptors on T cells, natural killer cells, and antigen presenting cells. It shows efficacy in moderate to severe CD in clinical trials."

Its bioavailability is 57% following SC injection; time to peak plasma concentration is 7\u201313.5 days and elimination half-life is 10\u2013126 days. For adults with PsA, a loading dose at 0 and 4 weeks is followed by maintenance doses once every 12 weeks. IV infusion as a 130 mg dose is available for Crohn\u2019s disease. 3. Indications: Ustekinumab is indicated for treatment of adult patients with PsA. It can be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. Other indications include plaque psoriasis and Crohn\u2019s disease. 4. Adverse Effects: Upper respiratory tract infection is the most common side effect, but rare severe infection, malignancy, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome have been reported. Ustekinumab should be discontinued at least 15 weeks before live vaccines are administered and can be resumed at least 2 weeks after. 1."

Rare cases of leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia have also been reported. The precipitating drug should be discontinued in such cases. 1. Mechanism of Action: Ustekinumab is an IL-12 and IL-23 antagonist. It is a fully human IgG monoclonal antibody to the p40 protein subunit, which is part of both IL-12 and IL-23. These two cytokines are important contributors to the chronic inflammation in psoriasis plaques, PsA, and Crohn\u2019s disease. Ustekinumab prevents the binding of the p40 subunit of both IL-12 and IL-23 to the IL-12 receptor b1 found on the surface of CD4 T cells and NK cells. This interruption interferes with IL-12 and IL-23 signal transduction and suppresses the formation of proinflammatory TH1 and TH17 cells. 2."

However, a comparative study of ustekinumab (an IL-12 and IL-23 blocker) and etanercept concluded that ustekinumab at a dose of 45 or 90 mg was superior to high-dose etanercept (50 mg twice weekly) over a 12-week period in patients with psoriasis. 1.

Both it and anti-CD20 (rituximab) have been associated with the onset of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\u2014a serious and usually fatal CNS infection caused by JC polyomavirus. Efalizumab, a humanized IgG monoclonal antibody previously approved for treatment of plaque psoriasis, has now been taken off the market due to reactivation of JC virus leading to fatal PML. Thus, use of any currently approved immunosuppressant immunotherapies should be undertaken with caution and with careful monitoring of patients according to FDA guidelines."

            "content": "With the increasing clinical use of humanized monoclonal antibodies (such as anti-TNF-\u03b1 used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis), cases of serum sickness are observed, fortunately rarely, in settings where the attempt to humanize the monoclonal antibody was not successful for selected patients because they produce uncommon Ig allotypes. In these individuals, symptoms are generally mild, and one of the most significant features of the anti-monoclonal antibody response is more rapid clearance of the antibody from the circulation, leading to reduction of its therapeutic effects."
