Unlike a newly formed DNA strand, the RNA strand does not remain hydrogen-bonded to the DNA template strand. Instead, just behind the region where the ribonucleotides are being added, the RNA chain is displaced and the DNA helix re-forms. Thus, the RNA molecules produced by transcription are released from the DNA template as single strands. In addition, because they are copied from only a limited region of the DNA, RNA molecules are much shorter than DNA molecules. A DNA molecule in a human chromosome can be up to 250 million nucleotide-pairs long; in contrast, most RNAs are no more than a few thousand nucleotides long, and many are considerably shorter."

This raises the question of why the U in RNA was replaced in DNA by T (which is 5-methyl U). We have seen that the spontaneous deamination of C converts it to U, but that this event is rendered relatively harmless by uracil DNA glycosylase.

One view is that an RNA world existed on Earth before modern cells arose (Figure 6\u201388).

Only later in evolutionary time did DNA take over as the genetic material and proteins become the major catalysts and structural components of cells.

Depending on the specific lysine residue being methylated, this alters chromatin configuration, either making it more open or tightly packed. Acetylation of histone proteins is another well-characterized mechanism that results in an open chromatin configuration, which favors active transcription. Acetylation is generally more dynamic than methylation, and many transcriptional activation complexes have histone acetylase activity, whereas repressor complexes often contain deacetylases and remove acetyl groups from histones. Other histone modifications, whose effects are incompletely characterized, include phosphorylation and sumoylation. Lastly, noncoding RNAs that bind to DNA can have a significant impact on transcriptional activity."

In the case of the Kcnq1 gene, which codes for a voltage-gated calcium channel needed for proper heart function, the lncRNA is made from the paternal allele (which is unmethylated) but it is not released by the RNA polymerase, remaining instead at its site of synthesis on the DNA template. This RNA in turn recruits histone-modifying and DNA-methylating enzymes that direct the formation of repressive chromatin, which silences the protein-coding gene associated on the paternally derived chromosome (Figure 7\u201349B). The maternally derived gene, on the other hand, is immune to these effects because the specific methylation present from imprinting blocks the synthesis of the lncRNA but allows transcription of the"

The answer to the first question came from the realization that DNA is a linear polymer of four different kinds of monomer, strung out in a defined sequence like the letters of a document written in an alphabetic script. The answer to the second question came from the double-stranded nature of the structure: because each strand of DNA contains a sequence of nucleotides that is exactly complementary to the nucleotide sequence of its partner strand, each strand can act as a template, or mold, for the synthesis of a new complementary strand.

However, cells have a way of directing DNA repair to the DNA sequences that are most urgently needed. They do this by linking RNA polymerase, the enzyme that transcribes DNA into RNA as the first step in gene expression, to the nucleotide excision repair pathway. As discussed above, this repair system can correct many different types of DNA damage. RNA polymerase stalls at DNA lesions and, through the use of coupling proteins, directs the excision repair machinery to these sites. In bacteria, where genes are relatively short, the stalled RNA polymerase can be dissociated from the DNA; the DNA is repaired, and the gene is transcribed again from the beginning. In eukaryotes, where genes can be enormously long, a more complex reaction is used to \u201cback up\u201d the RNA polymerase, repair the damage, and then restart the polymerase."

            "content": "The almost immediate release of the RNA strand from the DNA as it is synthesized means that many RNA copies can be made from the same gene in a relatively short time, with the synthesis of additional RNA molecules being started before the previous RNA molecules are completed (Figure 6\u201310). When RNA polymerase molecules follow hard on each other\u2019s heels in this way, each moving at about 50 nucleotides per second, over a thousand transcripts can be synthesized in an hour from a single gene."

            "content": "rnA editing Can Change the Meaning of the rnA Message The molecular mechanisms used by cells are a continual source of surprises. An example is the process of RNA editing, which alters the nucleotide sequences of RNA transcripts once they are synthesized and thereby changes the coded message they carry. We saw in Chapter 6 that tRNA and rRNA molecules are chemically modified after they are synthesized: here we focus on changes to mRNAs."
