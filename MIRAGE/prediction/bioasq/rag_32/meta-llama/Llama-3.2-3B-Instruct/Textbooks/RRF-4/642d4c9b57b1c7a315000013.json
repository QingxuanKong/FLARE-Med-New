Rhodopsin is a type of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is sensitive to light and plays a crucial role in visual transduction in the retina. Luminopsins, on the other hand, are a type of bioluminescent receptor that is found in certain microorganisms and is responsible for detecting light. Given that both Rhodopsin and Luminopsins are light-sensitive proteins, it is possible that they share a common ancestor or have similar structures. However, the question asks if Luminopsins are a fusion protein of luminol and Rhodopsin. Luminol is a chemical compound that is used as a reagent in biochemistry, and there is no indication that it is related to Rhodopsin or Luminopsins in terms of their structure or function. Therefore, it is unlikely that Luminopsins are a fusion protein of luminol and Rhodopsin. The correct answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Each rhodopsin molecule contains a covalently attached chromophore, 11-cis retinal, which isomerizes almost instantaneously to all-trans retinal when it absorbs a single photon. The isomerization alters the shape of the retinal, forcing a conformational change in the protein (opsin). The activated rhodopsin molecule then alters the conformation of the G protein transducin (Gt), causing the transducin \u03b1 subunit to activate cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. The phosphodiesterase then hydrolyzes cyclic GMP, so that cyclic GMP levels in the cytosol fall. This drop in cyclic GMP concentration decreases the amount of cyclic GMP bound to the plasma membrane cation channels, allowing more of these cyclic-GMP-sensitive channels to close. In this way, the signal quickly passes from the disc membrane to the plasma membrane, and a light signal is converted into an electrical one,"

These proteins function as signal transducers rather than as transporters: each responds to an extracellular signal by activating a GTP-binding protein (G protein) inside the cell and they are therefore called G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), as we discuss in Chapter 15 (see Figure 15\u20136B).

Rhodopsin, the visual pigment of the rod cells in the retina, consists of 11-cis retinal bound to the protein opsin (see Fig. 28.19). When rhodopsin, a G protein\u2013coupled receptor, is exposed to light, a series of photochemical isomerizations occurs, which results in the bleaching of rhodopsin and release of all-trans retinal and opsin. This process activates the G protein transducin, triggering a nerve impulse that is transmitted by the optic nerve to the brain. Regeneration of rhodopsin requires isomerization of all-trans retinal back to 11-cis retinal. All-trans retinal is reduced to all-trans retinol, esterified, and isomerized to 11-cis retinol that is oxidized to 11-cis retinal. The latter combines with opsin to form rhodopsin, thus completing the cycle. Similar reactions are responsible for color vision in the cone cells. 2."

Retinal is covalently linked to a lysine side chain of the bacteriorhodopsin protein.

The plasma membrane surrounding the outer segment contains cyclic-GMP-gated cation channels. Cyclic GMP bound to these channels keeps them open in the dark. Paradoxically, light causes a hyperpolarization (which inhibits synaptic signaling) rather than a depolarization of the plasma membrane (which would stimulate synaptic signaling). Hyperpolarization (that is, the membrane potential moves to a more negative value\u2014discussed in Chapter 11) results because the light-induced activation of rhodopsin molecules in the disc membrane decreases the cyclic GMP concentration and closes the cation channels in the surrounding plasma membrane (Figure 15\u201339)."

In the cone cells, the visual pigment on the membranous discs is the photopigment iodopsin. Each cone cell is specialized to respond maximally to one of three colors: red, green, or blue. Both rhodopsin and iodopsin contain a membrane-bound subunit called an opsin and a second component called a chromophore. The opsin of rods is scotopsin; the opsins of cones are photopsins.

The visual pigments in rods and cones are bleached at a similar rate; however, regeneration of the visual pigment occurs much more rapidly in cones than in rods. This difference is, at least in part, due to the cones\u2019 ability to utilize a second pathway for regeneration (see previous section). This more rapid regeneration of visual pigment prevents cones from becoming unresponsive in bright light conditions. In contrast, the slowness of the regeneration of rhodopsin molecules means that at light levels not much above those found in evening hours, essentially all of the rhodopsin molecules are bleached. Thus in bright-light conditions, only the cone system is functioning, and the retina is said to be light-adapted."

For both rods and cones, the pigment molecule consists of a chromophore, 11-cis retinal, bound to an opsin protein. The visual pigment found in the outer segments of rods is rhodopsin, or visual purple (so named because it has a purple appearance when light has been absorbed). It absorbs light best at a wavelength of 500 nm. Three variants of visual pigment, resulting from the binding of different opsins to retinal, are found in cones (in most species, each cone expresses one of the three cone pigments). The cone pigments absorb best at 419 nm (blue), at 533 nm (green), and at 564 nm (red). However, the absorption spectrum of these visual pigments is broad so that they overlap considerably ( Fig. 8.5)."

Each activated transducin molecule activates a molecule of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase, each of which hydrolyzes about 4000 molecules of cyclic GMP per second.

            "content": "Despite the chemical and functional diversity of the signal molecules that activate them, all GPCRs have a similar structure. They consist of a single polypeptide chain that threads back and forth across the lipid bilayer seven times, forming a cylindrical structure, often with a deep ligand-binding site at its center (Figure 15\u201321). In addition to their characteristic orientation in the plasma membrane, they all use G proteins to relay the signal into the cell interior. The GPCR superfamily includes rhodopsin, the light-activated protein in the vertebrate eye, as well as the large number of olfactory receptors in the vertebrate nose. Other family members are found in unicellular organisms: the receptors in yeasts that recognize secreted mating factors are an example. It is likely that the GPCRs that mediate cell\u2013cell signaling in multicellular organisms evolved from the sensory receptors in their unicellular eukaryotic ancestors."

            "content": "Negative feedback mechanisms do more than just return the rod to its resting state after a transient light flash; they also help the rod to adapt, stepping down the response when the rod is exposed to light continuously. Adaptation, as we discussed earlier, allows the receptor cell to function as a sensitive detector of changes in stimulus intensity over an enormously wide range of baseline levels of stimulation. It is why we can see faint stars in a dark sky, or a camera flash in bright sunlight. The various trimeric G proteins we have discussed in this chapter fall into four major families, as summarized in Table 15\u20133."

            "content": "Figure 15\u201339 The response of a rod photoreceptor cell to light. Rhodopsin molecules in the outer-segment discs absorb photons. Photon absorption closes cation channels in the plasma membrane, which hyperpolarizes the membrane and reduces the rate of neurotransmitter release from the synaptic region. Because the neurotransmitter inhibits many of the postsynaptic retinal neurons, illumination serves to free the neurons from inhibition and thus, in effect, excites them. The neural connections of the retina lie between the light source and the outer segment, and so the light must pass through the synapses and rod cell nucleus to reach the light sensors."
