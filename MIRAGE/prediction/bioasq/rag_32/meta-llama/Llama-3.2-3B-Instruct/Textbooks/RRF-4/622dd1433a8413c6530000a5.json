A cancer marker is a substance that can be found in higher amounts in the blood, urine, or tissues of some patients with cancer. The documents mention various tumor markers, such as PSA, CEA, and AFP, but do not mention taxilin. However, according to the provided documents, taxilin is not explicitly mentioned as a tumor marker. The documents do discuss taxol, which is a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat certain types of cancer, but not taxilin. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot conclude that taxilin is a cancer marker.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Many of the tumor markers proposed so far have had low sensitivities and specificities.113 Tumor marker levels may not be elevated in all patients with cancer, especially in the early stages, when a serum marker would be most use-ful for diagnosis. Therefore, when a tumor marker is used to monitor recurrence, it is important to be certain that the level of the tumor marker was elevated before primary therapy. More-over, tumor marker levels can be elevated in benign conditions. Many tumor markers are not specific for a certain type of cancer and can be elevated with more than one type of tumor. Since there may be significant laboratory variability, it is important to obtain serial results from the same laboratory. In spite of these many clinical"

The application of these assays is considered with many of the specific forms of neoplasia discussed in other chapters, so only a few examples suffice here. PSA, used to screen for prostatic adenocarcinoma, is one of the most frequently used tumor markers in clinical practice. Prostatic carcinoma can be suspected when elevated levels of PSA are found in the blood. However, PSA screening also highlights problems encountered with use of virtually every tumor marker. Although PSA levels often are elevated in cancer, PSA levels also may be elevated in benign prostatic hyperplasia (Chapter 18). Furthermore, there is no PSA level that ensures that a patient does not have prostate cancer. Thus,"

Telomerase is necessary for cell immortality. 1. Normally, telomeres shorten with serial cell divisions, eventually resulting in cellular senescence. 2. Cancers often have upregulated telomerase, which preserves telomeres. B. Angiogenesis (production of new blood vessels) is necessary for tumor survival and growth. 1. FGF and VEGF (angiogenic factors) are commonly produced by tumor cells. C. Avoiding immune surveillance is necessary for tumor survival. 1. Mutations often result in production of abnormal proteins, which are expressed on MHC class I. 2. CDS+ T cells detect and destroy such mutated cells. 3."

High-throughput technologies such as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spec-troscopy and liquid chromatography ion-spray tandem mass spectroscopy have revolutionized the field of proteomics and are now being used to compare the serum protein profiles of patients with cancer with those of individuals without cancer. Identification of unique proteins as well as unique proteomic profiles for most cancer types is being pursued actively by many researchers and, if successful, could dramatically enhance our ability to detect cancers early.182DNA fragments that are derived from tumors and are circulating in the blood stream are referred to as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Analysis of ctDNA can potentially pro-vide information on the entire tumor genome and has poten-tial clinical utility as a so-called"

            "content": "elevated in cancer, PSA levels also may be elevated in benign prostatic hyperplasia (Chapter 18). Furthermore, there is no PSA level that ensures that a patient does not have prostate cancer. Thus, the PSA test suffers from both low sensitivity and low specificity, and its use as a screening tool has become quite controversial. The PSA assay is extremely valuable, however, for detecting residual disease or recurrence following treatment for prostate cancer. Other tumor markers used in clinical practice include carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which is elaborated by carcinomas of the colon, pancreas, stomach, and breast, and alpha fetoprotein (AFP), which is produced by hepatocellular carcinomas, yolk sac remnants in the gonads, and occasionally teratocarcinomas and embryonal cell carcinomas. Like PSA, CEA and AFP can be elevated in a variety of non-neoplastic conditions and thus also lack the specificity and sensitivity required for the early detection of cancers, but they may be"

            "content": "targeted agents for clinical use presents several unique challenges. Once an appropriate compound is identified and confirmed to have activity in pre-clinical testing, predictive markers for activity in the preclinical setting must be defined. Expression of a target may not be suf-ficient to predict response because the pathway of interest may not be activated or critical to the cancer\u2019s survival. Although in traditional phase 1 trials the goal is to identify the maximum tol-erated dosage, the maximum dosage of biologic agents may not be necessary to achieve the desired biologic effect. Thus, assays to verify modulation of the target need to be developed to deter-mine at what dosage the desired effect is achieved. When phases 2 and 3 clinical trials are initiated, biomarker modulation studies should be integrated into the trial to determine whether clinical response correlates with target modulation and thus to identify additional parameters that impact response.
