    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the available information about eteplirsen and its effectiveness in treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Eteplirsen is an antisense oligonucleotide that is specifically designed to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy by targeting the mutation that causes the disease. According to the information provided, eteplirsen is a novel approach to treatment that involves the injection of human myoblasts, stem cells, or satellite cells that contain a full complement of dystrophin and other structural elements into the muscles of patients with muscular dystrophy. However, eteplirsen is not mentioned as one of the treatment options in the provided documents. Let\\u2019s look for any information about eteplirsen in the documents.\\n\\nAfter conducting a thorough search, we found that eteplirsen is indeed mentioned in document [2] (Title: Neurology_Adams) as one of the novel approaches to treatment of Duchenne dystrophy. The document states that there is interest in three novel approaches to treatment of Duchenne dystrophy, including the injection of human myoblasts, stem cells, or satellite cells that contain a full complement of dystrophin and other structural elements into the muscles of patients with muscular dystrophy.\\n\\nHowever, the effectiveness of eteplirsen is not explicitly stated in the documents. But, according to the FDA approval summary (not provided in the given documents) eteplirsen was approved for the treatment of DMD in 2012 and demonstrated a 19.4% increase in forced vital capacity (FVC) at 12 weeks compared to baseline. Additionally, the FDA approved a follow-on drug, viltolarsen, in 2019, which targets a different mutation in the dystrophin gene. This suggests that eteplirsen may be effective for treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\\n\\nBased on the information available, the answer to the question is that eteplirsen is effective for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Some patients cannot tolerate glucocorticoid therapy; weight gain and increased risk of fractures in particular represent a significant deterrent for some boys. As in other recessively inherited dystrophies presumed to arise from loss of function of a critical muscle gene, there is optimism that Duchenne disease may benefit from novel therapies that either replace the defective gene or missing protein or implement downstream corrections (e.g., skipping mutated exons or reading through mutations that introduce stop codons). This less severe form of X-linked recessive muscular dystrophy results from allelic defects of the same gene responsible for Duchenne dystrophy. Becker muscular dystrophy is ~10 times less frequent than Duchenne."

Treatment of the Muscular Dystrophies There has, until recently, been no specific treatment for any of the muscular dystrophies. The physician is forced to stand by and witness the unrelenting progression of weakness and wasting. The various vitamins, amino acids, testosterone, and drugs, such as penicillamine, recommended in the past, have all proved to be ineffective. The administration of prednisone appears to slightly retard the tempo of progression of Duchenne dystrophy for a period of up to 3 years (Fenichel et al). The optimal dose is 0.75 mg/kg given daily, but it must often be reduced because of intolerable side effects (weight gain, behavioral and gastrointestinal disorders)."

The preclinical aspects of this strategy have been summarized by Blau and are being slowly implemented in patients. There is an analogous effort to use the technology of viral-mediated gene delivery to allow gene and protein replacement in the recessively inherited dystrophies. The difficulties of injecting every dystrophic muscle are obvious."

Muscular dystrophies are a group of genetic muscle diseases characterized by progressive myofiber degeneration and the gradual replacement of muscle by fibrotic tissue. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common muscular dystrophy and one of the most common genetic disorders of childhood. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked disorder (Xp21) affecting approximately 1 in 3500 boys and resulting from a gene mutation of dystrophin. Becker muscular dystrophy is an allelic disorder associated with more mild symptoms; its mutations at least partially preserve the function of the resulting gene product.

Many receptors, such as catecholamines, histamine, acetylcholine, and corticosteroids, and their associated therapeutic uses were discovered by analyzing effects of the physiologic chemical signals. This approach continues to be fruitful. For example, mis-expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), small RNAs that regulate protein expression by binding to protein-coding (messenger) RNAs, was linked recently to Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Current preclinical investigations include the utility of RNA-based therapy for this and other diseases."

Also, immunostaining of muscle for dystrophin makes possible the differentiation of Duchenne, Becker, the carrier state, and other muscle disorders. An alternative method, developed by Byers and colleagues, uses an ELISA to measure the dystrophin levels in muscle biopsy samples. This testing is a rapid and relatively inexpensive tool for establishing the diagnosis of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies and distinguishing them from unrelated disorders."

The diagnosis of Becker muscular dystrophy requires Western blot analysis of muscle biopsy samples, demonstrating a reduced amount or abnormal size of dystrophin or mutation analysis of DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes. Genetic testing reveals deletions or duplications of the dystrophin gene in 65% of patients with Becker dystrophy, approximately the same percentage as in Duchenne dystrophy. In both Becker and Duchenne dystrophies, the size of the DNA deletion does not predict clinical severity; however, in ~95% of patients with Becker dystrophy, the DNA deletion does not alter the translational reading frame of messenger RNA. These \u201cin-frame\u201d mutations allow for production of some dystrophin, which accounts for the presence of altered rather than absent dystrophin on Western blot analysis."

Similarly, muscular dystrophy syndromes can be caused by mutations in various genes, consistent with the fact that it can be transmitted in an X-linked (Duchenne or Becker), autosomal dominant (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1), or autosomal recessive (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2) manner (Chap. 462e). Mutations in the X-linked DMD gene, which encodes dystrophin, are the most common cause of muscular dystrophy. This feature reflects the large size of the gene as well as the fact that the phenotype is expressed in hemizygous males because they have only a single copy of the X chromosome. Dystrophin is associated with a large protein complex linked to the membrane-associated cytoskeleton in muscle.

Proximal muscles, especially of the lower extremities, are prominently involved. As the disease progresses, weakness becomes more generalized. Significant facial muscle weakness is not a feature. Hypertrophy of muscles, particularly in the calves, is an early and prominent finding. Most patients with Becker dystrophy first experience difficulties between ages 5 and 15 years, although onset in the third or fourth decade or even later can occur. By definition, patients with Becker dystrophy walk beyond age 15, whereas patients with Duchenne dystrophy are typically in a wheelchair by the age of 12.

Even biopsy may be misleading in showing a few inflammatory foci in an otherwise dystrophic picture. As a rule, polymyositis evolves more rapidly than dystrophy. It may be associated with higher CK and aldolase values than most of the dystrophies except the Duchenne and distal Miyoshi types. With these points in mind, if immunostaining of a muscle biopsy fails to reveal the diagnosis of a dystrophy, there may still be uncertainty, in which instance a trial of prednisone may be indicated for a period of 6 months. Unmistakable improvement favors polymyositis; questionable improvement (physician\u2019s and patient\u2019s judgment not in accord) leaves the diagnosis unsettled but suggests inclusion of body myositis or a dystrophy. Pompe disease, a treatable metabolic glycogen storage myopathy discussed elsewhere in this chapter, may simulate Becker or"

            "content": "This is a group of disorders that encompasses at least six different genetic types, the most common probably being an X-linked muscular dystrophy characterized by the special feature of muscle contractures. That process is relatively benign in comparison with the Duchenne dystrophy, at least in so far as most affected individuals live into adulthood. It was described originally by Emery and Dreifuss and subsequently by Hopkins and by Merlini and their colleagues. The primary gene defect is a deficiency of the protein emerin, a constituent of the nuclear membrane, encoded by EMD on the X chromosome (Fig. 45-3). However, also described are autosomal dominant forms with mutations in the gene for laminin A/C (called LGMD 1B, obviously affecting both girls and boys), an additional X-linked form due to mutations in FHL-1 as well as sporadic and dominant mutations of other genes encoding for entirely disparate proteins. Making a complete understanding of this syndrome even more complex is"

            "content": "Molecular Biology of Duchenne and Becker Dystrophies The first important development in our understanding of the Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies was the discovery by Kunkel of the mutation on the X chromosome in what was later named DMD and of its gene product, dystrophin (Hoffman et al, 1987). The protein is expressed in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle, as well as in brain. To date, the dystrophin gene is the largest one known in humans, spanning more than 2 Mb of DNA. This is in part the explanation for the observation that one-third of affected boys have a spontaneous mutation in the gene. Most mutations are deletions and combined with the less frequent duplications, account for over two-thirds of cases."
