After a whole-genome duplication, all genes exist as duplicate copies. However, unless the duplication event occurred so recently that there has been little time for subsequent alterations in genome structure, the results of a series of segmental duplications\u2014occurring at different times\u2014 are hard to distinguish from the end product of a whole-genome duplication.

In a detailed study of spontaneous duplications in yeast, duplications of 50,000 to 250,000 nucleotide pairs were commonly observed, most of which were tandemly repeated. These appeared to result from DNA replication errors that led to the inexact repair of double-strand chromosome breaks. A comparison of the human and chimpanzee genomes reveals that, since the time that these two organisms diverged, such segmental duplications have added about 5 million nucleotide pairs to each genome every million years, with an average duplication size being about 50,000 nucleotide pairs (although there are some duplications five times larger). In fact, if one counts nucleotides, duplication events have created more differences between our two species than have single-nucleotide substitutions."

However, accidents occasionally result in the inappropriate duplication of just part of the genome, with retention of original and duplicate segments in a single cell. Once a gene has been duplicated in this way, one of the two gene copies is free to mutate and become specialized to perform a different function within the same cell. Repeated rounds of this process of duplication and divergence, over many millions of years, have enabled one gene to give rise to a family of genes that may all be found within a single genome. Analysis of the DNA sequence of prokaryotic genomes reveals many examples of such gene families: in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, for example, 47% of the genes have one or more obvious relatives (Figure 1\u201320)."

In most cases, there is presumed to be little or no selection\u2014at least initially\u2014to maintain the duplicated state since either copy can provide an equivalent function. Hence, many duplication events are likely to be followed by loss-of-function mutations in one or the other gene. This cycle would functionally restore the one-gene state that preceded the duplication. Indeed, there are many examples in contemporary genomes where one copy of a duplicated gene can be seen to have become irreversibly inactivated by multiple mutations.

Thus, if we assume that our common ancestor had a genome of human size (about 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs), mice would have lost a total of about 45% of that genome from accumulated deletions during the past 80 million years, while humans would have lost about 25%. However, substantial sequence gains from many small chromosome duplications and from the multiplication of transposons have compensated for these deletions. As a result, our genome size is thought to be practically unchanged from that of the last common ancestor of humans and mice, while the mouse genome is smaller by only about 0.3 billion nucleotides."

In fact, genome comparisons strongly suggest that both lineage-specific gene loss and horizontal gene transfer, in some cases between evolutionarily distant species, have been major factors of evolution, at least among prokaryotes. Finally, in the course of 2 or 3 billion years, some genes that were initially shared will have changed beyond recognition through mutation."

            "content": "The details of the cell cycle vary from organism to organism and at different times in an organism\u2019s life. Certain characteristics, however, are universal. At a minimum, the cell must accomplish its most fundamental task: the passing on of its genetic information to the next generation of cells. To produce two genetically identical daughter cells, the DNA in each chromosome must first be faithfully replicated to produce two complete copies. The replicated chromosomes must then be accurately distributed (segregated) to the two daughter cells, so that each receives a copy of the entire genome (Figure 17\u20131). In addition to duplicating their genome, most cells also duplicate their other organelles and macromolecules; otherwise, daughter cells would get smaller with each division. To maintain their size, dividing cells must coordinate their growth (that is, their increase in cell mass) with their division."
