    "predict": "To answer the question, we need to analyze the provided documents and look for any mention of SMOC2 during wound healing. Step 1: Review the documents for any mention of SMOC2. After reviewing the documents, we can see that there is no direct mention of SMOC2 in any of the documents. Step 2: Consider the relevance of SMOC2 to wound healing. SMOC2 is a protein that plays a role in bone formation and mineralization, but it is not directly related to wound healing. Step 3: Determine the answer based on the analysis. Given that SMOC2 is not mentioned in any of the documents and is not directly related to wound healing, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"No direct mention of SMOC2 was found in the provided documents, and it is not directly related to wound healing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

An approximate timeline of these events is depicted in Fig. 9-1. This sequence of events in most circumstances spans the time from injury to resolution of acute wounds. All wounds need to progress through this series of cellular and biochemical events that characterize the phases of healing in order to suc-cessfully reestablish tissue integrity.

Although adult wounds also produce hyaluronic acid, its synthesis is sustained only in the fetal wound. Components of amniotic fluid, most specifically fetal urine, have a unique abil-ity to stimulate hyaluronic acid production.54 Fetal fibroblasts produce more collagen than adult fibroblasts, and the increased level of hyaluronic acid may aid in the orderly organization of collagen. As a result of these findings, hyaluronic acid is used topically to enhance healing and to inhibit postoperative adhesion formation.55 The collagen pattern of fetal wounds is reticular in nature and resembles surrounding tissue, while adult patterns express large bundles of parallel collagen fibrils ori-ented perpendicular to"

Delayed primary closure, or healing by tertiary intention, represents a combination of the first two, con-sisting of the placement of sutures, allowing the wound to stay open for a few days, and the subsequent closure of the sutures (Fig. 9-6).The healing spectrum of acute wounds is broad (Fig. 9-7). In examining the acquisition of mechanical integrity and strength during healing, the normal process is characterized by a con-stant and continual increase that reaches a plateau at some point after injury. In regular wounds, the maximal wound strength is reached after about 6 weeks of healing. A fully healed wound achieves only 75% to 80% of a normal tissue. Wounds with delayed healing are characterized by decreased wound-breaking strength in comparison to wounds that heal at a normal rate; however, they eventually achieve the same integrity and strength as wounds that heal normally. Conditions such as"

Some of these cells may differentiate into cells called myofibroblasts, which contain smooth muscle actin and have increased contractile activity, and serve to close the wound by pulling its margins toward the center. Activated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts also increase their synthetic activity and produce connective tissue proteins, mainly collagen, which is the major component of the fully developed scar."

The lysis of collagen is mediated by collagenases that are secreted by various cells\u2014fibroblasts, neutrophils, and macrophages\u2014each of which can cleave the collagen molecule at different but specific locations on all three chains and break it down to characteristic three-quarter and one-quarter pieces. These collagen fragments undergo further denaturation and digestion by other proteases. There is significant remodeling of the collagen during this process. It is aligned along tension lines, and significant reabsorption of water from the collagen fibers result in a denser alignment and stronger cross-linking. The remodeling phase establishes a new equilibrium with the forma-tion of an organized scar. Several molecules, including TGF-\u03b2, which induces intracellular signaling of SMAD proteins, play an important role in the remodeling phase. Using SM 80 knockout mice and transgenic animals, a critical role of the SMAD path-way in the formation of scar has"

Any wound that does not heal for a prolonged period of time is prone to malig-nant transformation. Malignant wounds are differentiated clini-cally from nonmalignant wounds by the presence of overturned wound edges (Fig. 9-10). In patients with suspected malignant transformations, biopsy of the wound edges must be performed to rule out malignancy. Cancers arising de novo in chronic wounds include both squamous and basal cell carcinomas.Ischemic Arterial Ulcers. These wounds occur due to a lack of blood supply and are typically extremely painful in patients with pure ischemic ulcers. They"

As these growth factors exert their effects by cell-surface receptor binding, the appropriate receptor on the responding cells must be present at the time of release in order for the bio-logic effect to occur. Table 9-2 summarizes the principal growth factors found in healing wounds and their known effects on cells participating in the healing process. Growth factors have diver-gent actions on different cells; they can be chemoattractive to one cell type while stimulating replication of a different cell type. Little is known about the ratio of growth factor concentra-tions, which may be as important as the absolute concentration of individual growth factors.Growth factors act on cells via surface receptor binding. Various receptor types have been described, such as ion chan-nels, G-protein linked, or enzyme linked. The response elicited in the cell is usually one of"

Both processes involve the proliferation of various cells, and close interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM). We first discuss the general mechanisms of cellular proliferation and regeneration, and then the salient features of regeneration and healing by scar formation, and conclude with a description of cutaneous wound healing and fibrosis (scarring) in parenchymal organs as illustrations of the repair process. The regeneration of injured cells and tissues involves cell proliferation, which is driven by growth factors and is critically dependent on the integrity of the extracellular matrix, and by the development of mature cells from stem cells. Before describing examples of repair by regeneration, we discuss the control of cell proliferation in this process. The general principles of cell proliferation were summarized in Chapter 1."
