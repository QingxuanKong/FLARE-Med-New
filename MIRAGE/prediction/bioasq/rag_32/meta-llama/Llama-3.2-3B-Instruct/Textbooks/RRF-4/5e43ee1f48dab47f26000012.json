    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the role of exons in gene expression. Exons are the coding regions of a gene that are eventually spliced together to form a mature messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. The length and number of exons can affect gene expression. However, the shape or circularity of exons is not a direct factor in determining gene expression. In fact, the linear organization of exons and introns is more important for regulating gene expression. The splicing of exons and introns is a crucial step in the process of gene expression, and it allows for the creation of different isoforms of a protein from a single gene. This process is known as alternative splicing. The circular organization of exons may not provide any additional advantages in terms of gene expression. Therefore, the answer to the question is that circular exons do not necessarily increase gene expression.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

In humans, the regulatory sequences for a typical gene are spread out over tens of thousands of nucleotide pairs. As would be expected, these regulatory sequences are much more compressed in organisms with concise genomes. We discuss how regulatory DNA sequences work in Chapter 7."

Remarkably, the exome only constitutes 1.14% of the genome. In addition, thousands of noncoding transcripts (RNAs of various length such as microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs), which function, at least in part, as transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression, have been identified.

Historically, genes were identified because they conferred specific traits that are transmitted from one generation to the next. Increasingly, they are characterized based on expression in various tissues (transcriptome). The size of genes is quite broad; some genes are only a few hundred base pairs, whereas others are extraordinarily large (2 Mb). The number of genes greatly underestimates the complexity of genetic expression, because single genes can generate multiple spliced messenger RNA (mRNA) products (isoforms), which are translated into proteins that are subject to complex posttranslational modification such as phosphorylation.

It is believed that the organization of DNA coding sequences as a series of such exons separated by long introns has greatly facilitated the evolution of new proteins. The duplications necessary to form a single gene coding for a protein with repeating domains, for example, can easily occur by breaking and rejoining the DNA anywhere in the long introns on either side of an exon; without introns there would be only a few sites in the original gene at which a recombinational exchange between DNA molecules could duplicate the domain and not disrupt it. By enabling the duplication to occur by recombination at many potential sites rather than just a few, introns increase the probability of a favorable duplication event."

Affected individuals are represented by red circles for females and red squares for males. Dotted yellow symbols indicate individuals that carry the deletion but do not display the phenotype. 7\u201313 If you insert a \u03b2-galactosidase gene lacking its own transcription control region into a cluster of piRNA genes in Drosophila, you find that \u03b2-galactosidase expression from a normal copy elsewhere in the genome is strongly inhibited in the fly\u2019s germ cells. If the inactive \u03b2-galactosidase gene is inserted outside the piRNA gene cluster, the normal gene is properly expressed. What do you suppose is the basis for this observation? How would you test your hypothesis?"

            "content": "Thus far in this chapter, we have emphasized the regulation of gene transcription by proteins that associate either directly or indirectly with DNA. However, DNA itself can be covalently modified, and certain types of chromatin states appear to be inherited. In this section, we shall see how these phenomena also provide opportunities for the regulation of gene expression. At the end of this section, we discuss how, in mice and humans, an entire chromosome can be transcription-ally inactivated using such mechanisms, and how this state can be maintained through many cell divisions. patterns of DnA Methylation Can Be inherited when vertebrate Cells Divide"

These have a close sequence similarity to the functional genes but have been disabled by mutations that prevent their expression as functional proteins. The existence of such pseudogenes makes it clear that, as expected, not every DNA duplication leads to a new functional gene. genes Encoding New Proteins Can be Created by the Recombination of Exons"

DSCAM proteins have several different functions. in cells of the fly immune system, they mediate the phagocytosis of bacterial pathogens. in cells of the nervous system, DSCAM proteins are needed for proper wiring of neurons. the final mrnA contains 24 exons, four of which (denoted A, B, C, and D) are present in the Dscam gene as arrays of alternative exons. each rnA contains 1 of 12 alternatives for exon A (red), 1 of 48 alternatives for exon B (green), 1 of 33 alternatives for exon C (blue), and 1 of 2 alternatives for exon D (yellow). this figure shows only one of the many possible splicing patterns (indicated by the red line and by the mature mrnA below it). each variant DSCAM protein would fold into roughly the same structure (predominantly a series of extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains linked to a membrane-spanning region; see figure 24\u201348), but the amino acid sequence of the domains vary"
