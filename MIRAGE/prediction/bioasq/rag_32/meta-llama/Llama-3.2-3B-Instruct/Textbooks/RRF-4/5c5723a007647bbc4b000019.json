Document [0] states that the ability to study infectious proteins in yeast has clarified another remarkable feature of prions, which is that they can form several distinctively different types of amyloid fibrils from the same polypeptide chain. This suggests that yeast prions can be used to understand the mechanisms of amyloid formation and aggregation, which is a key feature of human amyloid diseases. Additionally, Document [1] mentions that the structure of an amyloid fibril is similar in yeast and humans, indicating that the basic mechanisms of amyloid formation may be conserved across species. Furthermore, Document [12] states that the current theory holds that an abnormally folded prion protein can act as a template for the conversion of normal PrP to PrPsc, which is a key mechanism underlying human prion diseases. This suggests that yeast prions can be used to study the conversion of normal proteins to abnormal forms, which is a key feature of human amyloid diseases. Finally, Document [5] mentions that all mammalian prion proteins adopt a \\u03b2-sheet-rich conformation and appear to readily oligomerize as this process becomes self-propagating, which suggests that yeast prions can be used to study the oligomerization of prion proteins, which is a key feature of human amyloid diseases. Overall, the available documents suggest that yeast prions can be an important model system for studying the basic mechanisms underlying human amyloid diseases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

For example, the amyloid plaques in kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) are filled with the PrPSc prions that have assembled into fibrils. The past three decades have witnessed an explosion of new knowledge about prions. For many years, kuru, CJD, and scrapie of sheep were thought to be caused by slow-acting viruses, but a large body of experimental evidence argues that the infectious pathogens causing these diseases are devoid of nucleic acid. Such pathogens are called prions, which are composed of host-encoded proteins that adopt alternative conformations (Chap. 453e). Prions are self-propagating by imposing their conformations on the normal, precursor protein; most prions are enriched for \u03b2-sheet and can assemble into amyloid fibrils."

The incubation times of the \u201csynthetic prions\u201d in mice were dependent on the conditions used for polymerization of the amyloid fibrils. Highly stable amyloids gave rise to stable prions with long incubation times; low-stability amyloids led to prions with short incubation times. Amyloids of intermediate stability gave rise to prions with intermediate stabilities and intermediate incubation times. Such findings are consistent with earlier studies showing that the incubation times of synthetic and naturally occurring prions are directly proportional to the stability of the prion."

Each of these neurodegenerative diseases is caused by a different protein that undergoes a conformational transformation to become a prion. Prions explain many of the features that the neurodegenerative diseases have in common: (1) incidence increases with age, (2) steady progression over years, (3) spread from one region of the CNS to another, (4) protein deposits consisting of amyloid fibrils, and (5) late onset of inherited forms of the neurodegenerative diseases. Notably, amyloid plaques containing PrPSc are a nonobligatory feature of PrP prion disease in humans and animals. Furthermore, amyloid plaques in AD do not correlate with the level of dementia; however, the level of soluble (oligomeric) A\u03b2 peptide does correlate with memory loss and other intellectual deficits."

Control of the self-propagating state of benign mammalian prions is not well understood but is critical for the well-being of the host. In contrast, pathogenic mammalian prions appear to multiply exponentially, but the mechanisms by which they cause disease are poorly defined. We do not know if prions multiply as monomers or as oligomers; notably, the ionizing radiation target size of PrPSc prions seems to suggest it is a trimer. The oligomeric states of pathogenic mammalian prions are thought to be the toxic forms, and assembly into larger polymers, such as amyloid fibrils, seems to be a mechanism for minimizing toxicity."

Some investigators argued that the biologic information carried in different prion strains could only be encoded within a nucleic acid. Subsequently, many studies demonstrated that strain-specified variation is enciphered in the conformation of PrPSc, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for the storage of biologic information remains enigmatic. The neuroanatomical patterns of prion deposition have been shown to be dependent on the particular strain of prion.

            "content": "In normal humans, the quality control mechanisms governing proteins gradually decline with age, occasionally permitting normal proteins to form pathological aggregates. The protein aggregates may be released from dead cells and accumulate as amyloid in the extracellular matrix. In extreme cases, the accumulation of such amyloid fibrils in the cell interior can kill the cells and damage tissues. Because the brain is composed of a highly organized collection of nerve cells that cannot regenerate, the brain is especially vulnerable to this sort of cumulative damage. Thus, although amyloid fibrils may form in different tissues, and are known to cause pathologies in several sites in the body, the most severe amyloid pathologies are neurodegenerative diseases. For example, the abnormal formation of highly stable amyloid fibrils is thought to play a central causative role in both Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases."

Although the mutant proteins that cause these disorders are expressed in the brains of people early in life, the diseases do not occur for many decades. Many explanations for the late onset of familial neurodegenerative diseases have been offered, but none are supported by substantial experimental evidence. The late onset might be due to a second event in which a mutant protein, after its conversion into a prion, begins to accumulate at some rather advanced age (Fig. 444e-5). Such a formulation is also consistent with data showing that the protein quality-control mechanisms diminish in efficiency with age. Thus, the prion forms of both wild-type and mutant proteins are likely to be efficiently degraded in younger people but are less well handled in older individuals.

Similar to PrP, A\u03b2, tau, \u03b1-synuclein, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), and possibly huntingtin all adopt alternative conformations that become self-propagating, and thus, each protein can become a prion and be transferred to synaptically connected neurons. Moreover, each of these prions causes a distinct constellation of"

The development of drugs designed to inhibit the conversion of the normal precursor proteins into prions or to enhance the degradation of prions focuses on the initial step in prion accumulation.

PrP amyloid Amyloid containing PrP in the brains of animals or humans with prion disease; often accumulates as plaques. The sporadic form of CJD is the most common prion disorder in humans. Sporadic CJD (sCJD) accounts for ~85% of all cases of human PrP prion disease, whereas inherited prion diseases account for 10\u201315% of all cases (Table 453e-2). Familial CJD (fCJD), GerstmannStr\u00e4ussler-Scheinker (GSS) disease, and fatal familial insomnia (FFI) are all dominantly inherited prion diseases that are caused by mutations in the PrP gene. Although infectious PrP prion diseases account for <1% of all cases and infection does not seem to play an important role in the natural history of these illnesses, the transmissibility of"

However, new experiments reveal that a large set of low complexity domains can form amyloid fibers that have functional roles in both the cell nucleus and the cell cytoplasm. These domains are normally unstructured and consist of stretches of amino acid sequence that can span hundreds of amino acids, while containing only a small subset of the 20 different amino acids. In contrast to the disease-associated amyloid in Figure 3\u201333, these newly discovered structures are held together by weaker noncovalent bonds and readily dissociate in response to signals\u2014hence their name reversible amyloids. Many proteins with such domains also contain a different set of domains that bind to specific other protein or RNA molecules. Thus, their controlled aggregation"
