Other Causes of Elevated Antidiuretic Hormone Antidiuretic hormone is also elevated in response to diminished effective circulating blood volume, as often occurs in heart failure. Due to the elevated ADH levels, hyponatremia may result. As in the management of SIADH, water restriction is frequently the treatment of choice. In patients with heart failure, this approach is often unsuccessful in view of increased thirst and the large number of oral medications being used. For patients with heart failure, intravenous conivaptan may be particularly useful because it has been found that the blockade of V1a receptors by this drug leads to decreased peripheral vascular resistance and increased cardiac output.

Hypothalamic diabetes insipidus is usu-ally treated by administration of synthetic analogs of ADH (desmopressin), whereas the treatment of the nephro-genic type of this disease is aimed at reducing the volume of urine output. Abnormally high levels of ADH are found in the syn-drome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secre-tion (SIADH), which is characterized by hyponatremia (low serum levels of sodium), decreased serum osmolality asso-ciated with excessive urine sodium excretion, and elevated urine osmolality. In SIADH, the elevated level of ADH in-creases the absorption of water, thereby leading to produc-tion of concentrated urine, inability to excrete water, and hyponatremia that results from excess"

            "content": "The body adjusts to higher and lower volumes of intake by changes in plasma tonicity. Alterations in plasma tonicity induce adjustments in circulating antidiuretic hormone levels, which ultimately regulate the amount of water retained in the distal tubule of the kidney. In the preoperative and the early postoperative periods, it is usually necessary to replace only sodium and potassium. Chloride is automatically replaced, concomitant with sodium and potassium, because chloride is the usual anion used to balance sodium and potassium in electrolyte solutions. There are various commercially available solutions containing 40 mmol of sodium chloride, with smaller amounts of potassium, calcium, and magnesium, designed to meet the requirements of a patient who is receiving3Lof intravenous \ufb02uids per day. The daily requirement can be met by any combination of intravenous \ufb02uids. For example, 2 L of D5 (5% dextrose)/0.45 normal saline (7 mEq sodium chloride each), supplemented with 20 mEq of"

Extracellular fluid deficits almost always accompany AKA and should be repleted by IV administration of saline and glucose (5% dextrose in 0.9% NaCl). Hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia may coexist and should be corrected. Hypophosphatemia usually emerges 12\u201324 h after admission, may be exacerbated by glucose infusion, and, if severe, may induce rhabdomyolysis or even respiratory arrest. Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, pancreatitis, and pneumonia may accompany this disorder.
