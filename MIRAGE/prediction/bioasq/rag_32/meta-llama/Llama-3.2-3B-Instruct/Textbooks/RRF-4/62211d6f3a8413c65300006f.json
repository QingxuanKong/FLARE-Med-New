        "A": "yes",

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what circRNAs are and how they are processed. CircRNAs are a type of non-coding RNA that is closed-loop structured, meaning that the 5' end of the RNA is connected to the 3' end through a covalent bond. This structure is different from traditional mRNAs, which are linear and open to degradation by RNases. Given that circRNAs are closed-loop structured, it is likely that they are not susceptible to degradation by RNases, as RNases typically target linear RNAs. However, the specific answer can be determined by looking at the structure of circRNAs and how they are processed. CircRNAs are typically formed through a process called back-splicing, where the 5' and 3' arms of the RNA are joined together through a phosphodiester bond. This process creates a closed-loop structure that is resistant to degradation by RNases. Therefore, based on the structure and processing of circRNAs, it is likely that they are resistant to degradation by RNase R.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Experiments have shown, however, that RNA molecules may have more difficulty than proteins in binding to flexible, hydrophobic substrates. In any case, the availability of 20 types of amino acids presumably provides proteins with a greater number of catalytic strategies. RNA molecules have one property that contrasts with those of polypeptides: they can directly guide the formation of copies of their own sequence. This capacity depends on complementary base-pairing of their nucleotide subunits, which enables one RNA to act as a template for the formation of another. As we have seen in this and the preceding chapter, these complementary templating mechanisms lie at the heart of DNA replication and transcription in modern-day cells."

One well understood use of noncoding RNAs occurs in RNA interference, where guide RNAs (miRNAs, siRNAs, piRNAs) base-pair with mRNAs. RNA interference can cause mRNAs to be either destroyed or translationally repressed. It can also cause specific genes to be packaged into heterochromatin suppressing their transcription. In bacteria and archaebacteria, RNA interference is used as an adaptive immune response to destroy viruses that infect them.

Of the 80% of the genome dedicated to regulatory functions, the vast majority is transcribed into RNAs\u2014micro-RNAs and long noncoding RNAs (described later)\u2014that are never translated into protein, but can regulate gene expression Mobile genetic elements (e.g., transposons). Remarkably, more than one-third of the human genome is composed of such \u201cjumping genes.\u201d These segments can cruise around the genome, and are implicated in gene regulation and chromatin organization.

            "content": "In the previous chapter, we introduced the central dogma, according to which the flow of genetic information proceeds from DNA through RNA to protein (Figure 6\u20131). But we have seen throughout this book that RNA molecules perform many critical tasks in the cell besides serving as intermediate carriers of genetic information. Among these noncoding RNAs are the rRNA and tRNA molecules, which are responsible for reading the genetic code and synthesizing proteins. The RNA molecule in telomerase serves as a template for the replication of chromosome ends, snoRNAs modify ribosomal RNA, and snRNAs carry out the major events of RNA splicing. And we saw in the previous section that Xist RNA has an important role in inactivating one copy of the X chromosome in females."

The production of apolipoprotein (apo) B-48 in the intestine and apo B-100 in liver is the result of RNA editing in the intestine, where a sense codon is changed to a nonsense codon by posttranscriptional deamination of cytosine to uracil. DNA rearrangement and transposition, as well as RNA interference and alternative splicing, do alter gene expression but are not the basis of apo B-48 tissue-specific production. 3.4. Which of the following is most likely to be true in hemochromatosis, a disease of iron accumulation? A. The messenger RNA for the transferrin receptor is stabilized by the binding of iron regulatory proteins to its 3\u2032-iron-responsive elements. B. The messenger RNA for the transferrin receptor is not bound by iron regulatory proteins and is degraded."

RNA interference (RNAi) As originally described, mechanism by which an experimentally introduced double-stranded RNA induces sequence-specific destruction of complementary mRNAs. The term RNAi is often used to include the inhibition of gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs) and piwi RNAs (piRNAs), which are encoded in the cell\u2019s own genome."
