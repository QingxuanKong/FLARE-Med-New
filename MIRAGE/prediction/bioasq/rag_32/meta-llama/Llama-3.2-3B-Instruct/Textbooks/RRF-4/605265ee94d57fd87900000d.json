    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if FTY720 has been considered for the treatment of stroke, let's analyze the provided documents. Document [0] mentions that Fingolimod (FTY720) is a sphingosine 1-phosphate analog that manipulates immune responses by regulating the migration of immune effector cells to the sites of a graft or of autoimmune disease. This implies that FTY720 is primarily used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. However, Document [1] describes FTY720 as a potential immunosuppressive drug for the treatment of kidney graft rejection and asthma. Although these conditions are related to immune system dysregulation, they are not directly related to stroke. Document [2] discusses the primary and secondary prevention of ischemic stroke, which includes various treatment options such as anticoagulants, thrombolytics, and antiplatelet agents. FTY720 is not mentioned in this document as a treatment for stroke. However, Document [1] mentions that FTY720 is used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and Document [2] discusses the treatment of stroke, but FTY720 is not explicitly mentioned. Document [3] discusses the risk of stroke after a TIA and mentions the use of anticoagulants, thrombolytics, and antiplatelet agents for stroke prevention, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [4] discusses the ABCs of stroke and mentions the use of aspirin and clopidogrel for stroke prevention, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [5] discusses the administration of anticoagulants and mentions that aspirin is the only antiplatelet agent proven effective for acute treatment of ischemic stroke, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [6] discusses the use of thrombolytics and mentions that most clinical trials have too few cases to evaluate the results of treatment, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [7] discusses the use of dual antiplatelet agents and mentions the POINT trial, which compared clopidogrel with aspirin for stroke prevention, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [8] discusses the use of intravenous thrombolysis and mentions that rtPA is approved for the treatment of ischemic stroke, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [9] discusses the use of IV tPA and mentions that it is a central component of primary stroke centers, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [10] discusses the use of clopidogrel for stroke prevention and mentions that it is being tested as a way to prevent stroke following TIA and minor ischemic stroke, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [11] discusses the use of ACE inhibitors and diuretics for stroke prevention and mentions that a combination of ACE inhibitors and diuretics has been reported to reduce the rate of recurrent stroke, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [12] discusses the use of aspirin for stroke prevention and mentions that aspirin does not appear to afford the same degree of protective benefit as anticoagulation for primary risk stroke reduction in atrial fibrillation, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [13] discusses the use of aspirin for acute treatment of ischemic stroke and mentions that the International Stroke Trial (IST) and the Chinese Acute Stroke Trial (CAST) found that the use of aspirin within 48 h of stroke onset reduced both stroke recurrence risk and mortality, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [14] discusses the use of statins for stroke prevention and mentions that several trials have confirmed that statin drugs reduce the risk of stroke, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [15] discusses the use of statins for stroke prevention and mentions that the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial showed benefit in secondary stroke reduction for patients with recent stroke or TIA who were prescribed atorvastatin, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [16] discusses the use of neuroprotective agents for stroke and mentions that certain agents have had erratic results in large randomized trials, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [17] discusses the use of intravenous tPA for stroke treatment and mentions that the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) study provided evidence of benefit from intravenous tPA, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [18] discusses the use of warfarin for stroke prevention and mentions that patients with severe thrombocytopenia and other intrinsic coagulopathies should be treated with warfarin cautiously, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [19] discusses the use of brain-sparing agents for stroke and mentions that certain agents have had erratic results in large randomized trials, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [20] discusses the use of novel medications for stroke and mentions that advances in neuroscience have led to the development of new treatments for stroke, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [21] discusses the importance of prevention of stroke and mentions that all physicians have a role to play in preventing stroke, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [22] discusses the use of vorapaxar for stroke prevention and mentions that vorapaxar reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke by 13%, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [23] discusses the use of clopidogrel and aspirin for stroke prevention and mentions that the ACTIVE trial found that clopidogrel plus aspirin was superior to oral anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [24] discusses the use of dipyridamole for stroke prevention and mentions that a combination capsule of extended-release dipyridamole and aspirin is approved for prevention of stroke, but FTY720 is not mentioned. Document [25] discusses the use of FTY720 for stroke treatment and mentions that FTY720 has not been considered for the treatment of stroke.

In Section 9-7, we described how emigration of lymphocytes out of the lymphoid tissues requires recognition of the lipid molecule sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) by the G-protein-coupled receptor S1PR1. Fingolimod (FTY720), a sphingosine 1-phosphate analog, is a relatively newer drug that causes the retention of effector lymphocytes in lymphoid organs, thus preventing these cells from mediating their effector activities in target tissues. Fingolimod was approved in 2010 for treatment of the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis, and has shown promise in the treatment of kidney graft rejection and asthma."

FTY720 inhibits immune responses by preventing lymphocytes from returning to the circulation, thereby sequestering them in lymphoid tissues and causing rapid onset of lymphopenia (a lack of lymphocytes in the blood). In vivo, FTY720 becomes phosphorylated and mimics S1P as an agonist at S1P receptors. Phosphorylated FTY720 may inhibit lymphocyte exit by effects on endothelial cells that increase tight junction formation and close exit portals, or by chronic activation of S1P receptors, leading to inactivation and downregulation of the receptor. 9-8 T-cell responses are initiated in secondary lymphoid organs by activated dendritic cells."

This risk can be directly estimated using the well-validated ABCD2 score (Table 446-5). Therefore, urgent evaluation and treatment are justified. Because etiologies for stroke and TIA are identical, evaluation for TIA should parallel that of stroke (Figs. 446-1 and 446-3). The improvement characteristic of TIA is a contraindication to thrombolysis. However, because the risk of subsequent stroke in the first few days after a TIA is high, the opportunity to give rtPA rapidly if a stroke occurs may justify hospital admission for most patients. The combination of aspirin and clopidogrel has been recently reported to prevent stroke following TIA better than aspirin alone in a large Chinese randomized trial and is undergoing similar evaluation in an ongoing National Institutes of Health (NIH)sponsored trial (POINT study).

The steps in the process are now dominated by rapidly determining the patient\u2019s eligibility for intravenous and intra-arterial revascularization treatment and the timing of these steps has been derived from a series of randomized clinical trials. The current practice is to use intravenous thrombolysis within 3 h if there is no intracranial hemorrhage on CT and with additional qualifications, up to 4.5 h of stroke onset (Hacke et al, 2008). If vascular imaging performed during or after intravenous thrombolysis treatment shows large vessel occlusion (distal internal carotid or proximal middle cerebral arteries), the patient is eligible for endovascular thrombectomy or thrombolysis.

The overall risk-benefit ratio for stroke reduction versus major system hemorrhage was judged to be favorable. These two antiplatelet trials enrolled patients with minor stroke or TIA that was considered to be high risk for subsequent stroke as gauged by ABCD2 score.

The short-term combination of clopidogrel with aspirin may be effective in preventing second stroke, however. A trial of 5170 Chinese patients enrolled within 24 h of TIA or minor ischemic stroke found that a clopidogrel-aspirin regimen (clopidogrel 300 mg load then 75 mg/d with aspirin 75 mg for the first 21 days) was superior to aspirin (75 mg/d) alone, with 90-day stroke risk decreased from 11.7 to 8.2% (p < .001) and no increase in major hemorrhage. An international NIH-sponsored trial of similar design is ongoing. Dipyridamole is an antiplatelet agent that inhibits the uptake of adenosine by a variety of cells, including those of the vascular endothelium. The accumulated adenosine is an inhibitor of aggregation. At least in part through"

Further analysis of the NINCDS trial revealed that patients who were treated earliest within the 3-h time frame had more benefit than those treated later; indeed, the administration of tPA in the time between 2.5 and 3 h after the stroke was of less value. One trial has suggested that a lower dose of tPA (0.6 mg/kg) is non-inferior to the standard dose in a population of predominantly Asian patients (Anderson et al 2016)."

The use of pioglitazone (an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) in patients with type 2 diabetes and previous stroke may lower risk of recurrent stroke, MI, or vascular death, but no trial sufficiently powered to definitively detect a significant reduction in stroke in the general diabetic population has yet been performed."

Telmisartan also had no effect on these outcomes. This suggests that these anti-platelet regimens are similar and also raises questions about default prescription of agents to block the angiotensin pathway in all stroke patients. The principal side effect of dipyridamole is headache. The combination capsule of extended-release dipyridamole and aspirin is approved for prevention of stroke."

Stroke, after heart disease, cancer, and accidents is among the most common cause of death in the United States. Every year there are approximately 700,000 cases of stroke in the United States\u2014roughly 600,000 ischemic lesions and 100,000 hemorrhages, intracerebral or subarachnoid\u2014with 175,000 fatalities from these causes combined. Since 1950, coincident with the introduction of effective treatment for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, there has been a substantial reduction in the frequency of stroke. Both sexes have shared in the reduced incidence. During this period, the incidence of coronary artery disease and uncontrolled hypertension also fell significantly. By contrast, there has been no change in the frequency of aneurysmal rupture. In the last two decades, according to the American Heart Association, the mortality rate from stroke has declined by 12 percent, but the"
