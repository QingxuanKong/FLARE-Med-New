    "predict": "After analyzing the provided documents, I couldn't find any information about ubrogepant or its clinical trial phases. However, I can provide a step-by-step analysis of the documents to understand the general context of clinical trials. Step-by-step thinking: 1. Document [0] describes the phases of clinical trials, including Phase I, II, and III. 2. Document [1] and [2] discuss the specifics of Phase I and II trials, including the number of participants and the purpose of these phases. 3. Document [5] mentions Phase II trials, which involve a modest number of patients (100-200) and are often done in special clinical centers. 4. Document [8] describes Phase III trials, which involve large numbers of patients (1,000-3,000) and are designed to confirm safety and efficacy. Based on the information provided, it appears that Phase III trials are typically conducted with a larger number of participants and are focused on confirming the safety and efficacy of a treatment. However, without specific information about ubrogepant, it is impossible to determine if it has entered clinical Phase III trials. Given the lack of information about ubrogepant, I must conclude that the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The provided documents do not mention ubrogepant or its clinical trial phases.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Interpretation of the results may be difficult because of unexpected confounding variables, loss of subjects from some groups, or realization that results differ markedly between certain subgroups within the active treatment (new drug) group.

Therefore, new \u201cadaptive\u201d statistical methods are under development that allow changes in the study design when interim data evaluation indicates the need.

This constitutes monitoring the safety of the new drug under actual conditions of use in large numbers of patients. The importance of careful and complete reporting of toxicity by physicians after marketing begins can be appreciated by noting that many important drug-induced effects have an incidence of 1 in 10,000 or less and that some adverse effects may become apparent only after chronic dosing. The sample size required to disclose drug-induced events or toxicities is very large for such rare events. For example, several hundred thousand patients may have to be exposed before the first case is observed of a toxicity that occurs with an average incidence of 1 in 10,000. Therefore, low-incidence drug effects are not generally detected before phase 4 no matter how carefully phase 1, 2, and 3 studies are executed. Phase 4 has no fixed duration.

The anthracycline-containing regimen CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) has been considered the best treatment in terms of initial therapy. Randomized phase III clinical studies now have shown that the combination of CHOP with rituximab results in improved response rates, disease-free survival, and overall survival compared with CHOP chemotherapy alone."

These trials are conducted in three progressive phases. Phase 1 trials are small, usually involving fewer than 100 volunteers. Their purposes are to provide a basic evaluation of safety and to identify common adverse events. Phase 2 trials, which are larger and may involve several hundred participants, collect additional information on safety and are usually designed to evaluate immunogenicity as well. Data gained from phase 2 trials can be used to determine the composition of the vaccine, the number of doses required, and a profile of common adverse events. Vaccines that appear promising are evaluated in phase 3 trials, which typically involve several hundred to several thousand volunteers and are generally designed to demonstrate vaccine efficacy and provide additional information on vaccine"
