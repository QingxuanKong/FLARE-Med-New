Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is a type of attenuated vaccinia virus that has been developed for use as a vaccine against smallpox. The documents mention that research continues on attenuated forms of vaccinia, including MVA, which suggests that MVA is being explored as a potential vaccine for smallpox. Additionally, the documents mention that the US military has been using MVA as part of their vaccination program since 2008, which indicates that MVA has been shown to be effective in providing protection against smallpox. Furthermore, the documents mention that MVA has been used to vaccinate members of the US armed forces and certain civilian health care workers who are at risk of exposure to smallpox, which suggests that MVA is considered safe and effective for these populations. Therefore, based on the information provided, it appears that Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is effective for smallpox.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Today, smallpox is a preventable disease following immunization with vaccinia. The current dilemma facing our society regarding assessment of the risk and benefit of smallpox vaccination is that the degree of risk that someone will deliberately and effectively release smallpox into our society is unknown. Given that there are well-described risks associated with vaccination, the degree of risk/benefit for the general population does not favor immunization. As a prudent first step in preparedness for a smallpox attack, however, members of the U.S. armed services received primary or booster immunizations with vaccinia before 1990 and after 2002. In addition, a number of civilian health care workers who comprise smallpox-response teams at the state and local public health level have been vaccinated."

The immune system can also be induced to respond to simple nonliving antigens, and experimental immunologists have focused on the responses to these simple antigens in developing our understanding of the immune response. The deliberate induction of an immune response is known as immunization. Experimental immunizations are routinely carried out by injecting the test antigen into the animal or human subject. The route, dose, and form in which antigen is administered can profoundly affect whether a response occurs and the type of response that is produced. The induction of protective immune responses against common microbial pathogens in humans is often called vaccination, although this term originally referred to the induction of immune responses against smallpox by immunizing with the cross-reactive virus, vaccinia."

Because smallpox was eradicated in 1978, it is presumed that their responses represent true immunological memory and are not due to restimulation from time to time by the smallpox virus. One study found strong vaccinia-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell memory responses as long as 75 years after the original immunization, and from the strength of these responses it was estimated that the memory response had an approximate half-life of between 8 and 15 years. Half-life represents the time required for a response to diminish to 50% of its original strength.

            "content": "Cowpox and buffalopox are rare zoonotic infections characterized by cutaneous poxlike lesions and mild systemic illness. Outbreaks of similar poxlike lesions among cattle and farm workers in Brazil have been due to Cantagalo and Ara\u00e7atuba viruses, which are virtually identical to vaccinia virus and may have become established in cattle during smallpox vaccination programs. Parapoxviruses are widely scattered among animal species, but only a few are known to cause human disease via direct contact with infected animals. Parapoxviruses are antigenically distinct from orthopoxviruses and share no cross-immunity. Tanapox virus belongs to a separate, antigenically distinct genus and usually causes a single nodular lesion on the exposed area after contact with infected monkeys."

Inoculating an individual with cowpox in order to protect that individual against smallpox B. Administering the serum of animals immune to diphtheria to protect against the effect of diphtheria toxin in an exposed individual C. A bacterial infection that results in complement activation and destruction of the pathogen D. An individual that becomes ill with chickenpox, but does not develop it again due to the development of immunologic memory 1.2 Multiple Choice: Which of the following is an appropriate definition for immunological memory? A. the mechanism by which an organism prevents the development of an immune response against the host\u2019s own tissues B. the mechanism by which an organism prevents exposure to microbes"

            "content": "A successful vaccine must possess several features in addition to its ability to provoke a protective immune response (Fig. 16.23). First, it must be safe. Vaccines must be given to huge numbers of people, relatively few of whom are likely to die of, or sometimes even catch, the disease that the vaccine is designed to prevent. This means that even a low level of toxicity is unacceptable. Second, the vaccine must be able to produce protective immunity in a very high proportion of the people to whom it is given. Third, particularly in poorer countries where it is impracticable to give regular \u2018booster\u2019 vaccinations to dispersed rural populations, a successful vaccine must generate long-lived immunological memory. This means that the vaccine must prime both B and T lymphocytes. Fourth, vaccines must be very cheap if they are to be administered to large populations. Vaccines are one of the most cost-effective measures in health care, but this benefit is eroded as the cost per dose rises."
