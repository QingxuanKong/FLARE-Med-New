According to Document [1], Verubecestat is an inhibitor of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE1), which reduces the production of amyloid \\u03b2. This suggests that Verubecestat may have a potential therapeutic effect on Alzheimer's disease. However, the document also mentions that Verubecestat showed safety in an early clinical trial, but the efficacy is still being evaluated in longer-term phase 3 trials. Therefore, the effectiveness of Verubecestat for Alzheimer's disease is still uncertain and needs further confirmation. Based on this information, the answer is not clear-cut, but we can say that Verubecestat is being studied for its potential efficacy in treating Alzheimer's disease. However, the current evidence is not sufficient to confirm its effectiveness.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Accumulation of tau appears to be associated with dissociation from microtubules in neurons, which has stimulated interest in drugs that inhibit microtubule disassembly, such as epothilone-D."

The annual cost of dementia in the United States is estimated at $150\u2013$215 billion annually. Both familial and sporadic forms have been identified. Early onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is associated with several gene defects, including trisomy 21 (chromosome 21), a mutation of the gene for presenilin-1 on chromosome 14, and an abnormal allele, \u03b54, for the lipid-associated protein, ApoE, on chromosome 19. Unlike the common forms (ApoE \u03b52 and \u03b53), the \u03b54 form strongly correlates with the formation of amyloid \u03b2 deposits (see below)."

            "content": "these lesions produce their effects by interrupting neural links to the frontal and other parts of the cerebral cortex. Further ambiguity arises when one considers the dementias caused by Lewy-body disease (probably second in frequency only to Alzheimer disease) and by normal-pressure hydrocephalus; here there are parkinsonism and dementing features that could be construed as both cortical and subcortical in nature."

            "content": "A number of other tests that measure the degree of dementia (usually carrying the names of their originators: Roth, Pfeiffer, Blessed, Mattis) rely essentially on the points mentioned previously and a brief assessment of the patient\u2019s ability to accomplish the activities of daily living, which is lost in the later stages of disease. For serial measurement specifically for those with Alzheimer disease, a number of systems have been devised as reviewed in Chap. 38. Among the most commonly used is the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog). It is more comprehensive than the others and takes longer to administer."

            "content": "In the advanced stages of dementia, as reviewed by Mitchell, feeding tubes are probably not a wise choice and hospice and palliative care may be employed to good benefit. The value of centrally acting cholinergic agents and glutamate antagonists in the treatment of Alzheimer disease is modest but clear and should be weighed against the need for blood testing and side effects. These medications, however, may offer psychologic benefit to the patient and family if they do not worsen behavior or increase hallucinations; they are not appropriate for advanced stages of disease. Chapter 38 discusses the use of these medications."
