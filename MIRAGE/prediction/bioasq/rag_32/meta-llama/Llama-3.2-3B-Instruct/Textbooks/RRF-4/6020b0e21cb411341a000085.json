Document [0] mentions that early clinical trial results suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as piroxicam, sulindac, and aspirin, may prevent adenoma formation or cause regression of adenomatous polyps. Document [5] also mentions that sulindac suppresses familial intestinal polyposis and may inhibit the development of colon, breast, and prostate cancer in humans. However, it is essential to note that the effect of sulindac on polyps is only temporary, and the use of NSAIDs has not been shown to reduce the risk of cancer. Document [8] states that colectomy remains the primary therapy/prevention for polyposis coli. Considering the information provided, the question is whether Eflornithine and Sulindac are effective for prevention of progression in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). While sulindac is mentioned as a suppressor of familial intestinal polyposis, there is no specific information about Eflornithine's effectiveness in this context. However, given the general information about NSAIDs, it can be inferred that neither Eflornithine nor Sulindac has been proven to be effective for the prevention of progression in FAP. The primary therapy/prevention for FAP is still colectomy. Therefore, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

This is consistent with studies showing that some NSAIDs cause polyp regression in patients with FAP in whom the rectum was left in place after colectomy. It is suspected that this effect is mediated by inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which is highly expressed in 90% of colorectal carcinomas and 40% to 90% of adenomas and is known to promote epithelial proliferation, particularly in response to injury."

The loss of the second functional APC allele in tumors from FAP families often occurs through loss of heterozygosity. However, out of these thousands of benign adenomas, several will invariably acquire further abnormalities and a subset will even develop into fully malignant cancers. APC is thus considered to be a gatekeeper for colon tumorigenesis: in the absence of mutation of this gatekeeper (or a gene acting within the same pathway), a colorectal tumor simply cannot form.

(Courtesy of Andrew Wyllie and Mark Arends.) adenomatous polyposis coli (FAP). In this syndrome, hundreds or thousands of polyps develop along the length of the colon (Figure 20\u201334). These polyps start to appear in early adult life, and if they are not removed, one or more will almost always progress to become malignant; the average time from the first detection of polyps to the diagnosis of cancer is 12 years. The disease can be traced to a deletion or inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene Apc, named after the syndrome. Individuals with FAP have inactivating mutations or deletions of one copy of the Apc gene in all their cells and show loss of heterozygosity in tumors, even"

Serrated polyps, including sessile serrated adenomas and traditional serrated adenomas, are a recently recognized, histologically distinct group of neoplastic polyps. Endoscopically they are flat lesions and frequently difficult to visualize. These lesions were long thought to be similar to hyperplastic polyps with minimal malignant potential. How-ever, it has become clear that some of these polyps will develop into invasive cancers. In addition, a familial serrated polyposis syndrome has been described. Serrated polyps should be treated like adenomatous polyps.85Hamartomatous Polyps (Juvenile Polyps). In contrast to adenomatous and serrated polyps, hamartomatous polyps (juve-nile polyps) usually are not premalignant. These lesions are the characteristic polyps of"

Alterations in APC lead to dys-regulation of several physiologic processes that govern colonic epithelial cell homeostasis, including cell-cycle progression, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. Mutations in the APC have been identified in FAP and in 80% of sporadic colorectal cancers.67 Furthermore, APC mutations are the earliest known genetic alterations in colorectal cancer progression, which emphasizes its importance in cancer initiation. The germline mutations in APC may arise from point mutations, insertions, or deletions that lead to a premature stop codon and a truncated, functionally"
