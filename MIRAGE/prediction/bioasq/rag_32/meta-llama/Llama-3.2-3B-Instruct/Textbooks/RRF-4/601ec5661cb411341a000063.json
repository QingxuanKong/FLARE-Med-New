But for mRNAs, this represents only one step in gene expression, and we are often more interested in the final level of the protein produced by the gene. As described in the first part of this chapter, mass-spectroscopy methods can be used to monitor the levels of all proteins in the cell, including modified forms of the proteins. However, if we want to understand how synthesis of proteins is controlled by the cell, we need to consider the translation step of gene expression."

In this section, we discuss yet another way that cells can initiate translation at positions distant from the 5\u02b9 end of the mRNA, using a specialized type of RNA sequence called an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). In some cases, two distinct protein-coding sequences are carried in tandem on the same eukaryotic mRNA; translation of the first occurs by the usual scanning mechanism, and translation of the second occurs through an IRES. IRESs are typically several hundred nucleotides in length and fold into specific structures that bind many, but not all, of the same proteins that are used to initiate normal 5\u02b9 cap-dependent translation (Figure 7\u201368). In fact, different IRESs require different subsets of initiation factors. However, all of them bypass the need for a 5\u02b9"

Instead, as discussed in Chapter 6, the selection of an AUG codon as a translation start site is largely determined by its proximity to the cap at the 5\u02b9 end of the mRNA molecule, which is the site at which the small ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA and begins scanning for an initiating AUG codon. In eukaryotes, translational repressors can bind to the 5\u02b9 end of the mRNA and thereby inhibit translation initiation. Other repressors recognize nucleotide sequences in the 3\u02b9 UTR of specific mRNAs and decrease translation initiation by interfering with the communication between the 5\u02b9 cap and 3\u02b9 poly-A tail, a step required for efficient translation (see Figure 6\u201370). A particularly important type of translational control in eukaryotes relies on small RNAs (termed microRNAs or miRNAs) that bind to mRNAs and reduce protein output, as described later in this chapter."

But the nucleotides immediately surrounding the AUG also influence the efficiency of translation initiation. If the recognition site is poor enough, scanning ribosomal subunits will sometimes ignore the first AUG codon in the mRNA and skip to the second or third AUG codon instead. This phenomenon, known as \u201cleaky scanning,\u201d is a strategy frequently used to produce two or more closely related proteins, differing only in their N-termini, from the same mRNA. A particularly important use of this mechanism is the production of the same protein with and without a signal sequence attached at its N-terminus.

            "content": "One important difference is that translation and transcription are temporally linked in prokaryotes, with translation starting before transcription is completed as a consequence of the lack of a nuclear membrane in prokaryotes. A. Initiation Initiation of protein synthesis involves the assembly of the components of the translation system before peptide-bond formation occurs. These components include the two ribosomal subunits, the mRNA to be translated, the aminoacyl-tRNA specified by the first codon in the message, GTP, and initiation factors that facilitate the assembly of this initiation complex (see Fig. 32.13). [Note: In prokaryotes, three initiation factors are known (IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3), whereas in eukaryotes, there are many (designated eIF to indicate eukaryotic origin). Eukaryotes also require ATP for initiation.] The following are two mechanisms by which the ribosome recognizes the nucleotide sequence (AUG) that initiates translation."
