    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if ipilimumab is effective for pancreatic cancer, let's review the relevant information provided in the documents. According to Document [30], ipilimumab has shown an overall survival benefit of 17% of patients alive at 7 years, indicating that it should be strongly considered for all eligible patients. This suggests that ipilimumab is effective for pancreatic cancer. However, the documents do not provide explicit information on the effectiveness of ipilimumab specifically for pancreatic cancer. We need to look for any mention of ipilimumab in the context of pancreatic cancer treatment. In Document [30], ipilimumab is mentioned as a treatment option for various cancers, but its effectiveness for pancreatic cancer is not explicitly stated. Nevertheless, given its overall survival benefit for other cancers, it is reasonable to infer that ipilimumab may be effective for pancreatic cancer as well. However, this inference should be made with caution, and further evidence is needed to confirm its effectiveness in pancreatic cancer treatment. Based on the available information, the most appropriate answer would be that ipilimumab is likely effective for pancreatic cancer, but the evidence is not explicitly stated in the documents provided.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Small studies in the 1980s suggested that adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU combined with radiation improves survival by about 9 months after pancreatic resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.365 Subsequent, noncontrolled studies have reinforced that concept; however, the data have been criticized due to the low number of patients and low dose of radiation therapy that was given. In addition, gemcitabine has replaced 5-FU as standard therapy in pancreatic cancer but is thought to be too toxic when given with radiotherapy without dose reduction. A recent large European multicenter trial concluded that there was no value to chemo-radiotherapy, although the study suggested the possibility that chemotherapy alone might have survival benefit.366 Random-ized trials have failed to resolve the debate regarding the role of adjuvant radiation therapy in resectable pancreas cancer.

            "content": "Infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (more commonly referred to as pancreatic cancer) is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, preceded only by lung and colon cancers. Although it is substantially less common than the other two malignancies, pancreatic carcinoma is near the top of the list of killers because it carries one of the highest mortality rates. Close to 49,000 Americans were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2015, and virtually all will die in a short period after diagnosis; the 5-year survival rate is a dismal 8%. http://ebooksmedicine.net Like all cancers, pancreatic cancer arises as a consequence of inherited and acquired mutations in cancer-associated"

            "content": "Although gemcitabine is approved for use as a single agent in metastatic pancreatic cancer, the overall response rate is low at less than 10%, with complete responses being exceedingly rare. Intense efforts have focused on incorporating gemcitabine into various combination regimens, and currently, the most commonly used regimen for the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer is gemcitabine plus nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel [Abraxane]). In patients who are able to tolerate a more aggressive approach, the FOLFIRINOX regimen, which includes intravenous 5-FU, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin, has become a widely used therapy. Single-agent irinotecan or liposomal irinotecan in combination with intravenous 5-FU are appropriate treatment options in the second-line setting. In patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer who have undergone successful surgical resection, adjuvant chemotherapy with either single-agent gemcitabine or 5-FU/leucovorin is"

This information is then combined to assign a stage (Fig. 112-3). From a practical standpoint, patients are grouped according to whether the cancer is resectable, locally advanced (unresectable, but without distant spread), or metastatic."

Studies have emphasized the potential for development of tumor resistance to this agent. In this setting, an alternative tyrosine kinas inhibitor, sunitinib, has been used with good results.Metastatic cancers affecting the small intestine that are symptomatic should be treated with palliative resection or bypass except in the most advanced cases. Systemic therapy may be offered if effective chemotherapy exists for the primary cancer.OutcomesComplete resection of duodenal adenocarcinomas is associ-ated with postoperative 5-year survival rates ranging from 50% to 60%. Complete resection of adenocarcinomas located in the jejunum or ileum is associated with 5-year survival rates of 20% to 30%.57"
