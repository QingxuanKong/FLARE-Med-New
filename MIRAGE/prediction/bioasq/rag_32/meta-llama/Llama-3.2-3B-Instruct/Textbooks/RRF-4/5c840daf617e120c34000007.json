Conversely, many of the cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms, including the antioxidant enzymes, decline in old age. The free radical theory of aging has spawned numerous studies of supplementation with antioxidants such as vitamin E to delay aging in animals and humans.

Unfortunately, among the many proposed aging interventions, only a few have reached a certain age themselves.

Experiments lasting the lifetime of animal models are prone to develop artifacts, increasing the possibilities and time windows for experimental discrepancies.

Beyond this age, verbal intelligence does decline, but very slowly\u2014by an average of less than 5 percent through the seventh decade and by less than 10 percent through the eighth decade (Schaie and Hertzog). Also, in a series of 460 community-dwelling individuals (55 to 95 years of age) studied by Smith and coworkers (1992), there was no significant decline with age in verbal memory and in registration\u2013attention; similar results were found by Petersen and colleagues in 161 normal, community-dwelling individuals 62 to 100 years of age. The most definite effects of age were in learning and memory and in problem solving\u2014cognitive impairments probably attributable to"

            "content": "Novel Interventions to Modify Aging Processes Aging is a complex process with multiple manifestations at the molecular, cellular, organ, and whole-organism level. The nature of the aging process is still not fully understood, but aging and its effects may be modulated by appropriate interventions. Dietary and genetic alterations can increase healthy life span and prevent the development of dysregulated systems and the aging phenotype in laboratory model organisms. The mechanisms responsible for life span expansion are \u201cfood\u201d sensors typically activated in situations of food shortage, such as IGF/insulin and the TOR (target of rapamycin) pathways. Accordingly, a reduction in food intake without malnutrition extends the life span by 10\u201350% in diverse organisms, from yeasts to rhesus monkeys. Mechanisms that mediate the effects of caloric restriction are under intensive study because they are potential targets for interventions aimed at counteracting the emergence of the aging phenotype"
