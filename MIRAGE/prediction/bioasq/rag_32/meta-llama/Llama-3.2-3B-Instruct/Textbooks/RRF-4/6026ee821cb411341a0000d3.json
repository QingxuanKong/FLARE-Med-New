According to Document [1], small molecules are defined as carbon-based compounds with molecular weights in the range of 100\u20131000 and containing up to 30 or so carbon atoms. Eptifibatide, which is mentioned in the same document as eptinezumab, is described as a cyclic heptapeptide, indicating that it is a small molecule. Since eptinezumab is likely to be a variant or similar to eptifibatide, it is reasonable to assume that it is also a small molecule.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Afatinib is a small molecule inhibitor of EGFR, HER2, and HER4, and it is approved for the first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 mutations. Osimertinib is approved for the treatment of metastatic EGFR T790M-mutant NSCLC following progression on or after EGFR TKI therapy. This small molecule is important as it is able to overcome the resistance that arises from the emergence of the T790M gatekeeper mutation either de novo or following previous EGFR TKI therapy.

The rate of diffusion, however, varies enormously, depending partly on the size of the molecule but mostly on its relative hydrophobicity (solubility in oil). In general, the smaller the molecule and the more hydrophobic, or nonpolar, it is, the more easily it will diffuse across a lipid bilayer. Small nonpolar molecules, such as O2 and CO2, readily dissolve in lipid bilayers and therefore diffuse rapidly across them. Small uncharged polar molecules, such as water or urea, also diffuse across a bilayer, albeit much more slowly (Figure 11\u20131 and see Movie 10.3). By contrast, lipid bilayers are essentially impermeable to charged molecules (ions), no matter how small: the charge and high degree of hydration of such molecules prevents them from entering the hydrocarbon phase of the bilayer (Figure 11\u20132)."

            "content": "The inside of a cell is very crowded (Figure 2\u201327). Nevertheless, experiments in which fluorescent dyes and other labeled molecules are injected into cells show that small organic molecules diffuse through the watery gel of the cytosol nearly Figure 2\u201325 How enzymes work. each enzyme has an active site to which one or more substrate molecules bind, forming an enzyme\u2013substrate complex. a reaction occurs at the active site, producing an enzyme\u2013product complex. The product is then released, allowing the enzyme to bind further substrate molecules. as rapidly as they do through water. A small organic molecule, for example, takes only about one-fifth of a second on average to diffuse a distance of 10 \u03bcm. Diffusion is therefore an efficient way for small molecules to move the limited distances in the cell (a typical animal cell is 15 \u03bcm in diameter)."
