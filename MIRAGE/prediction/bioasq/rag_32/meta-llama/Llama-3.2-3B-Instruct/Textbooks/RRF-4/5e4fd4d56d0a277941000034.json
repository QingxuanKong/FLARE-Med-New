    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the provided documents to determine if impetigo is a viral infection that affects the skin.\\n\\nFirst, let's look at the definition of impetigo. According to Document [0], impetigo is a superficial bacterial infection of the skin, primarily caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.\\n\\nNext, we need to examine the causes of impetigo. As stated in Document [1], impetigo is caused primarily by GAS and occasionally by other streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus. This confirms that impetigo is a bacterial infection.\\n\\nFurthermore, Document [2] describes the typical presentation of impetigo, which includes honey-colored crusts and erythematous weeping erosions, and notes that lesions are more localized than SSSS and usually present with honey-colored crusts. This further supports the fact that impetigo is a bacterial infection.\\n\\nIn addition, Document [4] states that impetigo contagiosa is caused by S. pyogenes, and bullous impetigo is due to S. aureus. This confirms that impetigo is indeed caused by bacteria.\\n\\nNow, let's look at the treatment of impetigo. Document [26] recommends treating impetigo with topical 2% mupirocin or oral antistaphylococcal antibiotics, which is a clear indication that impetigo is a bacterial infection that requires antibiotic treatment.\\n\\nFinally, Document [30] mentions that streptococcal impetigo is associated with increased risk of postinfectious glomerulonephritis, but notes that antibiotic treatment does not decrease the risk of postinfectious glomerulonephritis but decreases possible spread of nephritogenic strains to close contacts. This further supports the fact that impetigo is a bacterial infection.\\n\\nIn conclusion, based on the analysis of the provided documents, impetigo is not a viral infection but rather a bacterial infection of the skin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

The causative organism is usually Staphylococcus aureus or, less commonly, Streptococcus pyogenes, and is typically acquired through direct contact with a source. Impetigo often begins as a single small macule, usually on the extremities or the face near the nose or the mouth, which rapidly evolves into a larger lesion ( Fig. 24.6 ), often with a honey-colored crust of dried serum. Individuals who are colonized by S. aureus or S. pyogenes (usually nasal or anal) are more likely to be affected.

Impetigo is seen most often in young children, tends to occur during warmer months, and is more common in semitropical or tropical climates than in cooler regions. Infection is more common among children living under conditions of poor hygiene. Prospective studies have shown that colonization of unbroken skin with GAS precedes clinical infection. Minor trauma, such as a scratch or an insect bite, may then serve to inoculate organisms into the skin. Impetigo is best prevented, therefore, by attention to adequate hygiene. The usual sites of involvement are the face (particularly around the nose and mouth) and the legs, although lesions may occur at other locations.

This is the same toxin responsible for staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome, often resulting in dramatic loss of the superficial epidermis due to blistering.

            "content": "An acute dermatitis that is pink and scaly. Its etiology is unknown, but it has been hypothesized to represent a reaction to a viral infection with human herpesvirus (HHV) 6 or 7 because it tends to occur in mini-epidemics among young adults. \u25a0The initial lesion is a herald patch that is several centimeters in diameter and erythematous with a peripheral scale. Days to weeks later, a 2\u00b0 exanthem appears, presenting with multiple tiny, symmetric papules with a fine \u201ccigarette paper\u201d scale (see Figure 2.2-14). Papules are arranged along skin lines, giving a classic \u201cChristmas tree pattern\u201d on the patient\u2019s back. Patients are generally asymptomatic, although the disease may be more extensive, pruritic, and chronic among African-Americans. Diagnosed by clinical impression and confirmed by KOH exam to rule out fungus (the herald patch may be mistaken for tinea corporis). The differential also includes 2\u00b0 syphilis (RPR should be ordered), guttate psoriasis, and drug eruptions."

            "content": "Recommended treatment for nonbullous impetigo is topical 2% mupirocin or oral antistaphylococcal antibiotics. Extensive or disseminated lesions, bullous impetigo, lesions around the eyes, or lesions otherwise not amenable to topical therapy are best treated with oral antibiotics. Streptococcal impetigo is associated with increased risk of postinfectious glomerulonephritis but not acute rheumatic fever (see Chapter 163). Antibiotic treatment does not decrease the risk of postinfectious glomerulonephritis but decreases possible spread of nephritogenic strains to close contacts. Children with impetigo should remain out of school or day care until 24 hours of antibiotic therapy have been completed. Available @ StudentConsult.com"

            "content": "Children with acute GN commonly present with hematuria (gross or microscopic) along with other cardinal features of glomerular injury (proteinuria, hypertension, edema, oliguria, renal insufficiency). PSGN occurs most frequently in children 2 to 12 years of age and is more common in boys. Manifestations of PSGN are typical of acute GN listed previously and develop 5 to 21 days (average 10 days) after streptococcal pharyngitis infections and 4 to 6 weeks after impetigo. Acute postinfectious GN presents in the same manner as PSGN and can occur following infections with other bacterial and viral pathogens. PSGN can develop regardless of whether the child was treated with antibiotics at the time of infection. Special attention must be paid to the blood pressure because hypertension may be severe enough to lead to complications such as heart failure, seizures, and encephalopathy."

            "content": "Retapamulin (Altabax) is a semisynthetic pleromutilin derivative effective in the treatment of uncomplicated superficial skin infection caused by group A \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci and S aureus, excluding MRSA. Topical retapamulin 1% ointment is indicated for use in adult and pediatric patients, 9 months or older, for the treatment of impetigo. Recommended treatment regimen is twice-daily application for 5 days. Retapamulin is well tolerated with only occasional local irritation of the treatment site. Although uncommon, allergic contact dermatitis has been reported."
