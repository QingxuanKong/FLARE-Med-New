For example, as soon as both the human and the chimpanzee genome sequences became available, scientists began searching for DNA sequence changes that might account for the striking differences between us and chimpanzees. With 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs to compare in the two species, this might seem an impossible task. But the job was made much easier by confining the search to 35,000 clearly defined multispecies conserved sequences (a total of about 5 million nucleotide pairs), representing parts of the genome that are most likely to be functionally important. Though these sequences are conserved strongly, they are not conserved perfectly, and when the version in one species is compared with that in another they are generally found to have"

Although a sequence match does not guarantee similarity in function, it has proved to be an excellent clue. Thus, it is often possible to predict the function of genes in humans for which no biochemical or genetic information is available simply by comparing their nucleotide sequences with the sequences of genes that have been characterized in other more readily studied organisms. In general, the sequences of individual genes are much more tightly conserved than is overall genome structure. Features of genome organization such as genome size, number of chromosomes, order of genes along chromosomes, abundance and size of introns, and amount of repetitive DNA are found to differ greatly when comparing distant organisms, as does the number of genes that each organism contains."

When a bee stings a foe, its stinging apparatus and attached venom sac tear loose from its body. Muscular contraction of the venom sac continues to inject venom into the skin. Other kinds of bees, ants, and wasps have smooth stinging mechanisms and can sting numerous times in succession. Honeybees, bumblebees, and social wasps generally attack only when a colony is disturbed. Africanized honeybees (now present in South and Central America and the southern and western United States) respond to minimal intrusions more aggressively. Whereas the sting of an Africanized bee contains less venom than that of its non-Africanized relatives, victims tend to sustain far more stings and therefore to receive a far greater overall volume of venom.

We may recognize that gene B is like gene A, but how do we discover the function of gene A in the first place? And even if we know the function of gene A, how do we test whether the function of gene B is truly the same as the sequence similarity suggests? How do we connect the world of abstract genetic information with the world of real living organisms?"
