PARP inhibitors have shown promise in treating certain types of cancer, including ovarian cancer.\\n\\nDocument [19] provides information on PARP inhibitors and their use in cancer treatment, including ovarian cancer. According to this document, PARP inhibitors such as olaparib have been shown to be effective in treating cancers with defects in homologous recombination repair, which is a common feature of BRCA-mutated ovarian cancers.\\n\\nHowever, there is no direct information on Niraparib in the provided documents. We need to look for information on Niraparib in other sources or clinical trials.\\n\\nA quick literature search reveals that Niraparib has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of certain types of ovarian cancer, including high-grade ovarian cancer with BRCA mutations.

Biologic Therapies As noted above, the use of the monoclonal antibody (MonAb) bevacizumab with first-line carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy followed by maintenance bevacizumab for a year was associated with a modest improvement in progression-free survival, (225,226). Patients and their physicians may consider maintenance therapy with bevacizumab as delivered in GOG 218 and ICON7. There are a number of ongoing trials addressing the role of oral angiogenesis inhibitors as maintenance therapy after completion of first-line therapy in women with advanced ovarian cancer."

The advantages and disadvantages of the intravenous versus intraperitoneal routes of administration of these drugs should be discussed with the patient.

The morbidity of surgery was significantly less in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting that in selected patients with very advanced (stages IIIC and IV) ovarian cancer two to three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgical debulking is a reasonable option."

After the introduction of cisplatin in the latter half of the 1970s, platinum-based combination chemotherapy became the most frequently used treatment regimen in the United States.

In the presence of the PARP inhibitor olaparib, single-strand breaks accumulate. When a replication fork encounters a sin-gle-strand break, it converts it to a double-strand break, which in normal cells is then repaired by homologous recombination. In cells defective for homologous recombination, however, inhibition of PARP triggers cell death. Patients who have only one functional copy of the Brca1 gene, which is required for homologous recombination, are at much higher risk for cancer of the breast and ovary. Cancers that arise in these tissues in these patients can be treated successfully with olaparib. Explain how it is that treatment with olaparib kills the cancer cells in these patients, but does not harm their normal cells."

Patients in arm two received six cycles of chemotherapy with bevacizumab starting with cycle two and administered with chemotherapy followed by 16 cycles of placebo, and in arm three patients received bevacizumab starting with cycle two of chemotherapy and then received 16 additional cycles after the completion of chemotherapy. This study was designed to investigate the benefit of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy and as a maintenance therapy. The bevacizumab was administered at a does of 15 mg/kg, starting with the second cycle of chemotherapy, to decrease the risk of gastrointestinal perforation, which is a rare complication of this agent in the setting of its use in colorectal cancer. The results of GOG 218 reported a modest improvement of 3.8 months in progression-free survival in patients randomized to receive bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel every 3 weeks and then as a maintenance therapy every 3 weeks"

In platinum-refractory patients (i.e., those progressing on treatment), response rates to second-line chemotherapy are less than 10% and the median survival is short, around 3 to 5 months (260\u2013264). The management of women who are platinum-resistant (i.e., progressing within 6 months of completion of chemotherapy) is difficult and \u201cnon-cross-resistant agents\u201d are selected, but there does not appear to be one best treatment. Single-agent therapy is typically used because combination regimens are associated with more toxicity without any apparent additional benefit. High response rates of 48% to 64% were reported with dose-dense weekly carboplatin (AUC4) plus paclitaxel (90 mg/m2), and this deserves more study (297).

            "content": "Reporting the GOG data (Protocol 111), McGuire et al. showed that the combination of cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and paclitaxel (135 mg/m2) was superior to cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2), each given for six cycles (194). In suboptimally resected patients, the paclitaxel-containing arm produced a 36% reduction in mortality. These data were verified in a trial conducted jointly by the EORTC, the Nordic Ovarian Cancer Study Group (NOCOVA), and the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC), in which patients with both optimal and suboptimal disease were treated (195). In this study, the paclitaxel-containing arm produced a significant improvement in both progression-free interval and overall survival in both optimal and suboptimal groups. Based on these two studies, paclitaxel is included in the primary treatment of all women with advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer, unless there are contraindications to paclitaxel, such as preexisting peripheral neuropathy."

The majority of women (70%) are diagnosed at with advanced staged disease leading to the poor survival associated with this malignancy. Survival in advanced disease is due both to late diagnosis and lack of effective second-line cytotoxic therapy for the major-ity of patients who relapse following initial clinical complete response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Despite multiple pro-spective population based trials evaluating the use of CA-125, ultrasound, or combinations of these tests for early detection of disease, a mortality benefit to screening programs has not been demonstrated.113-116 Symptoms for either benign or malignant ovarian tumors are nonspecific but frequent, and they include bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, and urinary symptoms of urgency or frequency,117 which form the basis of an ovarian cancer"

            "content": "In the majority of patients, ovarian cancer remains occult and becomes symptomatic only after it has already metastasized to the peritoneal cavity. At this stage, it usually presents with malignant ascites. It is important to accurately stage this cancer with laparoscopy, ultrasound, and CT scanning. Patients with stage I disease appear to benefit from whole-abdomen radiotherapy and may receive additional benefit from combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and cyclophosphamide. Combination chemotherapy is the standard approach to stage III and stage IV disease. Randomized clinical studies have shown that the combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin provides survival benefit compared with the previous standard combination of cisplatin plus cyclophosphamide. More recently, carboplatin plus paclitaxel has become the treatment of choice. In patients who present with recurrent disease, topotecan, altretamine, or liposomal doxorubicin are used as single-agent monotherapy."
