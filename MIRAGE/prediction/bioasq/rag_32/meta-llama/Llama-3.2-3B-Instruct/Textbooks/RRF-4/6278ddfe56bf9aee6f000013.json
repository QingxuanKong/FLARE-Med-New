The disease is characterized by the absence or significant reduction of dystrophin protein, which is essential for muscle function and integrity.\\n\\nFunctional tests, such as muscle biopsy, electromyography (EMG), and muscle imaging, can provide valuable information about muscle function and pathology. However, these tests are not specific to DMD and can also be abnormal in other muscle disorders.\\n\\nIn DMD, functional tests can help identify muscle damage and degeneration, but they may not be sensitive or specific enough to diagnose the disease. For example, EMG can show myopathic changes, but these can also be seen in other muscle disorders. Muscle biopsy can show dystrophin deficiency, but it is not always possible to distinguish between DMD and other dystrophinopathies.\\n\\nTherefore, while functional tests can provide useful information about muscle function and pathology, they are not a definitive biomarker for DMD. A combination of clinical evaluation, genetic testing, and other diagnostic tools, such as serum biomarkers, is necessary for an accurate diagnosis.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the answer to the question is that functional tests are not a good biomarker for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The diagnosis of Becker muscular dystrophy requires Western blot analysis of muscle biopsy samples, demonstrating a reduced amount or abnormal size of dystrophin or mutation analysis of DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes. Genetic testing reveals deletions or duplications of the dystrophin gene in 65% of patients with Becker dystrophy, approximately the same percentage as in Duchenne dystrophy. In both Becker and Duchenne dystrophies, the size of the DNA deletion does not predict clinical severity; however, in ~95% of patients with Becker dystrophy, the DNA deletion does not alter the translational reading frame of messenger RNA. These \u201cin-frame\u201d mutations allow for production of some dystrophin, which accounts for the presence of altered rather than absent dystrophin on Western blot analysis."

The diagnosis of muscular dystrophy in a child who has just begun to walk or in whom walking is delayed. Tests of peak power on command cannot be used with reliability in small children. The most helpful points in identifying Duchenne dystrophy are (1) unusual difficulty in climbing stairs or arising from a crouch or from a recumbent position on the floor, showing greater weakness at the hips and knees than at the ankles; (2) unusually large, firm calves; (3) male sex; (4) high serum CK, aldolase, and myoglobin levels; (5) myopathic EMG; (6) biopsy findings; and (7) special methods of testing for dystrophin protein (see previous discussion)."

In 1955, Becker and Keiner proposed that the latter be separated as a distinct entity, now called Becker muscular dystrophy. The incidence is difficult to ascertain, but it has been estimated as 3 to 6 per 100,000 male births. Like the Duchenne form, it is an X-linked disorder, practically limited to males and transmitted by females. It causes weakness and hypertrophy in the same muscles as Duchenne dystrophy, but the onset is much later (mean age: 12 years; range: 5 to 45 years).

The entrance of calcium is speculated to activate proteases and to increase protein degradation.

An additional layer of complexity stems from the fact that there is not a simple one-to-one correspondence between genotypes and phenotypes. Instead mutations in several different genes can, for example, present as autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy; conversely different mutations in a single gene (such as dystrophin) can lead to very different clinical phenotypes, as illustrated by Duchenne and Becker types of muscular dystrophy."

Isolated cases of muscular dystrophy had been described earlier, but no distinction was made between neuropathic and myopathic disease.

However, it was not until the second edition of his monograph in 1861 that the \u201chypertrophic paraplegia of infancy\u201d was recognized as a distinct syndrome. By 1868, he was able to write a comprehensive description of 13 cases and recognized that the disease was muscular in origin and restricted to males. Gowers in 1879 gave a masterful account of 21 personally observed cases and called attention to the characteristic way in which such patients arose from the floor (Gowers sign).

As in other recessively inherited dystrophies presumed to arise from loss of function of a critical muscle gene, there is optimism that Duchenne disease may benefit from novel therapies that either replace the defective gene or missing protein or implement downstream corrections (e.g., skipping mutated exons or reading through mutations that introduce stop codons).

The most common gene mutation is a deletion. The size varies but does not correlate with disease severity. Deletions are not uniformly distributed over the gene but rather are most common near the beginning (5\u2032 end) and middle of the gene.

            "content": "In recent years, there has been interest in three novel approaches to treatment of Duchenne dystrophy in particular. One is the injection of human myoblasts, stem cells, or satellite cells that contain a full complement of dystrophin and other structural elements into the muscles of patients with muscular dystrophy. The preclinical aspects of this strategy have been summarized by Blau and are being slowly implemented in patients. There is an analogous effort to use the technology of viral-mediated gene delivery to allow gene and protein replacement in the recessively inherited dystrophies. The difficulties of injecting every dystrophic muscle are obvious."

            "content": "Molecular Biology of Duchenne and Becker Dystrophies The first important development in our understanding of the Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies was the discovery by Kunkel of the mutation on the X chromosome in what was later named DMD and of its gene product, dystrophin (Hoffman et al, 1987). The protein is expressed in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle, as well as in brain. To date, the dystrophin gene is the largest one known in humans, spanning more than 2 Mb of DNA. This is in part the explanation for the observation that one-third of affected boys have a spontaneous mutation in the gene. Most mutations are deletions and combined with the less frequent duplications, account for over two-thirds of cases."

Inflammatory disorder of skeletal muscle B. Resembles dermatomyositis clinically, but skin is not involved; endomysial inflammation (CDS+ T cells) with necrotic muscle fibers is seen on biopsy. III. X-LINKED MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY A. Degenerative disorder characterized by muscle wasting and replacement of skeletal muscle by adipose tissue B. Due to defects of dystrophin gene 1. Dystrophin is important for anchoring the muscle cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. 2. Mutations are often spontaneous; large gene size predisposes to high rate of mutation. C. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is due to deletion of dystrophin. 1. Presents as proximal muscle weakness at 1 year of age; progresses to involve distal muscles i. Calf pseudohypertrophy is a characteristic finding."
