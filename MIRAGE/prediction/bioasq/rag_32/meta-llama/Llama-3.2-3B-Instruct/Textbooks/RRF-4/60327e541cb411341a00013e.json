According to Document [3] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison), Hunter syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder. This means it is caused by a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome, which affects males more severely than females. In Document [24] (Title: Pathology_Robbins), it is mentioned that Hunter syndrome is an X-linked disorder, and in Document [23] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison), it is stated that the basic abnormality in Hunter syndrome is a deficiency of iduronate sulfate sulfatase, which is a gene located on the X chromosome. Therefore, we can conclude that Hunter's disease is indeed associated with the X chromosome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

A son inherits the Y chromosome from his father and one maternal X chromosome. Thus, the characteristic features of X-linked inheritance are (1) the absence of father-to-son transmission, and (2) the fact that all daughters of an affected male are obligate carriers of the mutant allele (Fig. 82-13C). The risk of developing disease due to a mutant X-chromosomal gene differs in the two sexes. Because males have only one X chromosome, they are hemizygous for the mutant allele; thus, they are more likely to develop the mutant phenotype, regardless of whether the mutation is dominant or recessive. A female may be either heterozygous or homozygous for the mutant allele, which may be dominant or recessive. The terms X-linked dominant or X-linked recessive are therefore only applicable to expression of the mutant"

However, even if the abnormal X chromosome is not widely expressed, the female carrier may still exhibit minor abnormalities. In the latter case, sex-linked inheritance becomes difficult to distinguish from dominant inheritance. Also, sex linkage is deceptive when a disease is lethal to one sex. In contrast to autosomal recessive mutations, the abnormality has more often been one of a basic protein than an enzyme deficiency."

Indeed, phenotypically normal males with two and even three Y chromosomes have been identified. Such extreme karyotypic deviations are not encountered with the autosomes. In large part, this latitude relates to two factors: lyonization of X chromosomes and the small amount of genetic information carried by the Y chromosome. The consideration of lyonization must begin with Mary Lyon, who in 1962 proposed that in females, only one X chromosome is genetically active. X inactivation occurs early in fetal life, about 16 days after conception. Either the paternal or the maternal X chromosome is randomly inactivated in each cell of the developing embryo. Once inactivated, the same X chromosome remains inactive in all of the progeny of these cells. Moreover, all but one X chromosome is inactivated, and so a 48,XXXX female has only one active X chromosome. This phenomenon"

Most important, the initial presumption that all of the genes on the inactive X are \u201cswitched off\u201d has been revised, as roughly 21% of genes on Xp, and a smaller number (3%) on Xq, escape X inactivation. This observation has implications for monosomic X chromosome disorders, or Turner syndrome, as discussed later. Extra Y chromosomes are readily tolerated because the only information known to be carried on the Y chromosome seems to relate to male differentiation. Of note, whatever the number of X chromosomes, the presence of a Y invariably dictates the male phenotype. The gene for male differentiation (SRY, sex-determining region of Y chromosome) is located on the short arm of the Y. Described briefly next are two disorders, Klinefelter syndrome and Turner syndrome, that result from aberrations of sex chromosomes."

Most X-linked diseases are recessive. Common examples include color blindness, hemophilia A and B, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. Males with an X-linked recessive gene are usually afected by the disease it causes, because they lack a second X chromosome to express the normal dominant gene. A male with an X-linked disease cannot have afected sons because they cannot receive his X chromosome. When a woman carries a gene causing an X-linked recessive condition, each of her sons has a 50-percent risk of being afected, and each daughter has a 50-percent chance of being a carrier."

There are, however, important exceptions to this rule. X-inactivation prevents the expression of most genes on one of the two X chromosomes in every cell of a female. Gene inactivation through genomic imprinting occurs on selected chromosomal regions of autosomes and leads to inheritable preferential expression of one of the parental alleles. It is of pathophysiologic importance in disorders where the transmission of disease is dependent on the sex of the transmitting parent and, thus, plays an important role in the expression of certain genetic disorders. Two classic examples are the Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman\u2019s syndrome (Chap. 83e). Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by diminished fetal activity, obesity, hypotonia, mental retardation, short stature, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism."

The majority of lysosomal enzyme deficiencies result from point mutations or genetic rearrangements at a locus that encodes a single lysosomal hydrolase. However, some mutations cause deficiencies of several different lysosomal hydrolases by alteration of the enzymes/proteins involved in targeting, active site modifications, or macromolecular association or trafficking. All LSDs are inherited as autosomal recessive disorders except for Hunter (mucopolysaccharidosis type II), Danon, and Fabry diseases, which are X-linked. Substrate accumulation leads to lysosomal distortion, which has significant pathologic consequences. In addition, abnormal amounts of metabolites may also have pharmacologic effects important to disease pathophysiology and propagation."

Before the advent of antibiotics, most individuals with inherited immune defects died in infancy or early childhood because of their susceptibility to particular classes of pathogens. Such cases were not easily identified, because many normal infants also died of infection. Most of the gene defects that cause inherited immunodeficiencies are recessive, and many are caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome. As males have only one X chromosome, all males who inherit an X chromosome carrying a defective gene will be affected by the disease. In contrast, female carriers with one defective X chromosome are usually healthy. Gene knockout techniques in mice (see Appendix I, Section A35) have created many immunodeficient states that are adding rapidly to our knowledge of the contribution of individual proteins to normal immune function.

            "content": "As to the genetic mechanisms involved in the inheritance of intelligence, a limited amount is known. There is an excess of males with what was previously called mental retardation, and now less pejoratively \u201cdevelopmental delay,\u201d and there are several well-characterized syndromes in which the inheritance of mental retardation is X-linked as described in Chaps. 27 and 37. Also notable are the somewhat different patterns of performance between males and females on subtests of the various intelligence tests (males perform better in spatial ability and certain mathematical tasks). Males are more likely to be affected by advantageous or by aberrant genes on their single X chromosome, whereas females benefit from the mosaic provided by two X chromosomes. In some families, high intelligence segregates to certain individuals through an X-linked pattern. Further study will determine the validity of these views and of what will certainly prove to be a polygenic inheritance of intelligence and"

            "content": "same X chromosome remains inactive in all of the progeny of these cells. Moreover, all but one X chromosome is inactivated, and so a 48,XXXX female has only one active X chromosome. This phenomenon explains why normal females do not have a double dose (compared with males) of phenotypic attributes encoded on the X chromosome. The Lyon hypothesis also explains why normal females are in reality mosaics, containing two cell populations: one with an active maternal X, the other with an active paternal X. The molecular basis of X inactivation involves a long non\u2013coding RNA that is encoded by the XIST gene. This non\u2013coding RNA is retained in the nucleus, where it \u201ccoats\u201d the X chromosome that it is transcribed from and silences the genes on that chromosome. The other XIST allele is switched off in the active X, allowing genes encoded one one X chromosome to be expressed."
