CGRP8-37 has been used extensively to investigate the actions of CGRP but displays affinity for other related receptors including those for adrenomedullin (see below). Nonpeptide CGRP receptor antagonists target the interface between CLR and RAMP1 and thereby make them more selective for the CGRP receptor. Examples are olcegepant and telcagepant. Evidence is accumulating that release of CGRP from trigeminal nerves plays a central role in the pathophysiology of migraine. The peptide is released during migraine attacks, and successful treatment of migraine with a selective serotonin agonist normalizes cranial CGRP levels. Clinical trials showed olcegepant to be effective in treating migraine, but because of its low bioavailability, it has to be administered by intravenous injection. Telcagepant is also effective and is orally active but has exhibited liver toxicity in a small number of patients."

Substance P and neurokinin A may also be involved. Extravasation of plasma and plasma proteins into the perivascular space appears to be a common feature of animal migraine models and is found in biopsy specimens from migraine patients. This effect probably reflects the action of the neuropeptides on the vessels. The mechanical stretching caused by this perivascular edema may be the immediate cause of activation of pain nerve endings in the dura. The onset of headache is sometimes associated with a marked increase in amplitude of temporal artery pulsations, and relief of pain by administration of effective therapy is sometimes accompanied by diminution of these pulsations."

The selection of the optimal regimen for a given patient depends on a number of factors, the most important of which is the severity of the attack. Mild migraine attacks can usually be managed by oral agents; the average efficacy rate is 50\u201370%. Severe migraine attacks may require parenteral therapy. Most drugs effective in the treatment of migraine are members of one of three major pharmacologic classes: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 5-HT receptor agonists, and dopamine receptor antagonists."

In general, a preventive medication should be considered in the subset of patients with four or more attacks a month. Significant side effects are associated with the use of many of these agents; furthermore, determination of dose can be difficult because the recommended doses have been derived for conditions other than migraine. The mechanism of action of these drugs is unclear; it seems likely that the brain sensitivity that underlies migraine is modified. Patients are usually started on a low dose of a chosen treatment; the dose is then gradually increased, up to a reasonable maximum, to achieve clinical benefit."

Serotonin is discharged from platelets at the onset of headache and the headache is reduced by the injection of 5-HT. This led to the development by Humphrey of sumatriptan, which acted selectively on 5-HT1B/D receptors so as to reduce side effects. This was the forerunner of the large group of \u201ctriptans.\u201d More recently, nitric oxide generated by endothelial cells has been implicated as the cause of the pain of migraine headache, but the reason for its release and the relationship to changes in blood flow is unclear."

However, the effectiveness of these agents in migraine is usually less than optimal in moderate or severe migraine attacks. The combination of acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine has been approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mild to moderate migraine. The combination of aspirin and metoclopramide has been shown to be comparable to a single dose of oral sumatriptan. Important side effects of NSAIDs include dyspepsia and gastrointestinal irritation.

This is based on the innervation of extracranial and intracranial vessels by small unmyelinated fibers of the trigeminal nerve that subserve both pain and autonomic functions (the \u201ctrigeminovascular\u201d complex). This model provides an explanation for migraine pain as originating in the trigeminal ganglion. Activation of these fibers releases substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and other peptides into the vessel wall, which serves to sensitize the trigeminal system to the pulsatility of cranial vessels, and to increase their permeability, thereby promoting an inflammatory response. The small molecules released from nerve endings adjacent to the cortex would then incite spreading depression in this model.

The hypotensive action of CGRP results from the potent vasodilator action of the peptide; indeed, CGRP is the most potent vasodilator yet discovered. It dilates multiple vascular beds, but the coronary circulation is particularly sensitive. The vasodilation is mediated via a nonendothelial mechanism through activation of adenylyl cyclase. The actions of CGRP are mediated via a single receptor type. This heterodimeric receptor consists of the G protein-coupled calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) combined with the receptor activity-modifying protein RAMP1."

As mentioned above, if the pain does not abate in 12 to 24 h, corticosteroids in any of several regimens may be added and continued for several days. Based on the action of certain peptides in the trigeminovascular complex, novel antagonists of CGRP have been investigated, and while symptomatically equivalent to triptans (Olesen and colleagues and also Ho et al), they have been largely abandoned because of liver toxicity with frequent use. Drugs of this type as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitors and receptor blockers that work by a different mechanism than do the serotonin agonists may be alternatives in the future."

In the cardiovascular system, CGRP-containing neuronal fibers are more abundant around arteries than around veins and in atria than in ventricles.

            "content": "The vasoconstriction induced by ergotamine is long-lasting and cumulative when the drug is taken repeatedly, as in a severe migraine attack. Therefore, patients must be carefully informed that no more than 6 mg of the oral preparation may be taken for each attack and no more than 10 mg per week. For very severe attacks, ergotamine tartrate, 0.25\u20130.5 mg, may be given intravenously or intramuscularly. Dihydroergotamine, 0.5\u20131 mg intravenously, is favored by some clinicians for treatment of intractable migraine. Intranasal dihydroergotamine may also be effective. Methysergide, which was used for migraine prophylaxis in the past, was withdrawn because of toxicity, see below. B. Hyperprolactinemia"

            "content": "Drugs that have the capacity to stabilize migraine are listed in Table 447-6. Drugs must be taken daily, and there is usually a lag of between 2 to 12 weeks before an effect is seen. The drugs that have been approved by the FDA for the prophylactic treatment of migraine include propranolol, timolol, sodium valproate, topiramate, and methysergide (not available). In addition, a number of other drugs appear to display prophylactic efficacy. This group includes amitriptyline, nortriptyline, flunarizine, phenelzine, gabapentin, and cyproheptadine. Placebo-controlled trials of onabotulinum toxin type A in episodic migraine were negative, whereas, overall, placebo-controlled trials in chronic migraine were positive. Phenelzine and methysergide are usually reserved for recalcitrant cases because of their serious potential side effects. Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI); therefore, tyramine-containing foods, decongestants, and meperidine are contraindicated. Methysergide may"
