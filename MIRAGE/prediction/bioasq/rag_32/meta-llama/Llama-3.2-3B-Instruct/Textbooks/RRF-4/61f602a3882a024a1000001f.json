However, the question is asking about its effectiveness in HIV prevention.\\n\\nUpon reviewing the documents, we find that there is no specific information about Cabotegravir being used for HIV prevention. The documents do discuss the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV treatment, but they do not mention Cabotegravir specifically for prevention.\\n\\nHowever, we do find information about a medication called PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis), which is a daily pill taken by individuals at high risk of contracting HIV to prevent infection. The documents mention that two reverse transcriptase inhibitors have shown efficacy in trials, and combined daily use of both drugs taken orally has demonstrated an over 90% reduction in the risk of HIV infection.\\n\\nWhile Cabotegravir is not mentioned in the context of HIV prevention, it is part of a combination regimen called Biktarvy, which is approved for use in treatment-experienced adults and adolescents 12 years and older with HIV-1 infection. This suggests that Cabotegravir may be used in the treatment of HIV, but there is no information about its use in HIV prevention.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer to the question is that Cabotegravir is not specifically mentioned as being effective for HIV prevention.\\n\\nHowever, considering the context of the provided information and the lack of explicit information about Cabotegravir for prevention, it is possible that the answer could be inferred as \\\"no\\\", but this is not a definitive conclusion based solely on the provided documents.\\n\\nGiven the lack of explicit information about Cabotegravir for HIV prevention, the most accurate answer based on the provided documents is not explicitly stated.

Cessation of HAART therefore leads to a rapid rebound of virus multiplication, so that patients require treatment indefinitely. This, coupled with the sideeffects and high cost of HAART, have stimulated investigation into other targets to block viral replication (Fig. 13.39) as well as ways of eliminating viral reservoirs to eradicate infection permanently. New classes of antiHIV replication drugs include viral entry inhibitors, which block the binding of gp120 to CCR5 or block viral fusion by inhibiting gp41; and viral integrase inhibitors, which block the insertion of the reversetranscribed viral genome into the host DNA. Another approach under development is to enhance the activity of HIV restriction factors, including APOBEC (see Section 1327) and TRIM 5\u03b1. APOBEC causes"

Enfuvirtide is a small peptide derived from HIV gp41 that acts before cell infection by preventing a conformational change required for initial fusion of the virus with the cell membrane. Raltegravir is an integrase inhibitor that is approved for use with other anti-HIV drugs. Amantadine and rimantadine inhibit the influenza M2 protein, preventing release of viral RNA early during infection, whereas zanamivir and oseltamivir inhibit the influenza neuraminidase, which is necessary for the efficient release of mature virions from infected cells."

Adefovir has been used successfully to treat chronic hepatitis B in HBV-HIV co-infected patients but is no longer considered a first-line agent for HBV. Entecavir has low-level activity against HIV and can result in selection of HIV resistance; therefore, it should be avoided in HBV-HIV co-infection.

The decision regarding choice of drugs not only will affect the immediate response to therapy but also will have implications regarding options for future therapeutic regimens. The initial regimen is usually the most effective insofar as the virus has yet to develop significant resistance. HIV is capable of rapidly developing resistance to any single agent, and therapy must be given as a multidrug combination. Given that patients can be infected with viruses that harbor drug resistance mutations, it is recommended that a viral genotype be done prior to the initiation of therapy to optimize the selection of antiretroviral agents.

The NRTIs act by competitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase; incorporation into the growing viral DNA chain causes premature chain termination due to inhibition of binding with the incoming nucleotide (Figure 49\u20133).

Following the initiation of widespread use of cART in the United States in 1995\u20131996, marked declines were noted in the incidence of most AIDS-defining conditions (Fig. 226-33). Suppression of HIV replication is an important component in prolonging life as well as in improving the quality of life in patients with HIV infection. Adequate suppression requires www.aidsinfo.nih.gov AIDSinfo, a service of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, posts federally approved treatment guidelines for HIV and AIDS; provides information on federally funded and privately funded clinical trials and CDC publications and data www.cdcnpin.org Updates on epidemiologic data and prevention information from the CDC Abbreviation: CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."

            "content": "Combination therapies may reduce the development of resistance. The optimal duration of therapy remains unknown. Several anti-HBV agents have anti-HIV activity as well, including tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide, lamivudine, and adefovir dipivoxil. Emtricitabine, an NRTI used in HIV infection, has resulted in excellent biochemical, virologic, and histologic improvement in patients with chronic HBV infection, although it is not approved for this indication. Although agents with dual HBV and HIV activity are particularly useful as part of a first-line regimen in co-infected patients, it is important to note that acute exacerbation of hepatitis may occur upon discontinuation or interruption of these agents; this may be severe or even fatal."

            "content": "Antiretroviral therapy dramatically reduces plasma viremia in most HIV-infected individuals (see \u201cTreatment,\u201d below) and is associated with a reduction in risk of transmission. In a large study of serodiscordant couples, earlier treatment of the HIV-infected partner with among monogamous, heterosexual, HIV-serodiscordant couples in Uganda. (From RH Gray et al: Lancet 357:1149, 2001.) antiretroviral therapy rather than treatment delayed until the CD4+ T cells count fell below 250 cells per \u03bcL was associated with a 96% reduction in HIV transmission to the uninfected partner. This approach has been widely referred to as treatment as prevention or TasP. Several studies also have suggested a beneficial effect of antiretroviral treatment at the community level."

            "content": "Despite impressive advances in our understanding and treatment of HIV infection, the long-term prognosis of patients with AIDS remains a concern. Although with effective drug therapy the mortality rate has declined in the United States, the treated patients still carry viral DNA in their lymphoid tissues. Truly curative therapy remains elusive. Similarly, although considerable effort has been mounted to develop a protective vaccine, many hurdles remain before this becomes a reality. Molecular analyses have revealed an alarming degree of variation in viral isolates from patients; this renders the task of producing a vaccine extremely difficult. Recent efforts have focused on producing broadly neutralizing antibodies against relatively invariant portions of HIV proteins. At present, therefore, prevention, public health measures, and anti-retroviral drugs remain the mainstays in the fight against AIDS. Progression of disease. HIVinfectionprogressesthroughphases."
