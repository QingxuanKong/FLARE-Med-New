According to the provided documents, approximately 20% of genes on the X chromosome escape X-inactivation. However, the documents do not specifically mention CXorf21 as one of the genes that escape X-inactivation. Furthermore, the documents mention that the genes on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp) usually are phenotypically similar to individuals with Turner syndrome, and many genes on Xp escape X-inactivation and act similarly to genes on autosomes. However, this does not necessarily imply that all genes on Xp escape X-inactivation. Since CXorf21 is located on the short arm of the X chromosome, it is possible that it may escape X-inactivation. Nevertheless, without direct evidence or a specific reference to CXorf21, we can only make an educated guess based on the general information provided.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

X-chromosome inactivation begins with the synthesis of Xist (X-inactivation specific transcript) rnA from the XiC (X-inactivation center) locus and moves outward to the chromosome ends. According to the model depicted here, the long (\u224820,000 nucleotides) Xist rnA has many low-affinity binding sites for the structural components of chromosomes and spreads by releasing its hold on one portion of the chromosome while grasping another. the continued synthesis of Xist from the center of the chromosome drives it to the ends. As shown, Xist rnA does not move linearly along the chromosomal DnA, but, instead, moves first across the base of chromosome loops. it has been proposed that the portions of chromosomal DnA at the tips of long loops contain the 10% of genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation."

X-chromosome inactivation is initiated and spreads from a single site near the middle of the X chromosome, the X-inactivation center (XIC). Within the XIC is a transcribed 20,000-nucleotide lncRNA (called Xist), which is expressed solely from the inactive X chromosome. Xist RNA spreads from the XIC over the entire chromosome and directs gene silencing. Although we do not know exactly how this is accomplished, it likely involves recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes and other proteins to form a repressive form of chromatin analogous to that of Figure 7\u201345. Curiously, about 10% of the genes on the X chromosome (including Xist itself) escape this silencing and remain active."

In a given cell, the choice of which chromosome is inactivated occurs randomly in humans. But once the maternal or paternal X chromosome is inactivated, it will remain inactive, and this information is transmitted with each cell division. The X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) gene encodes a large noncoding RNA that mediates the silencing of the X chromosome from which it is transcribed by coating it with Xist RNA.

Of note, whatever the number of X chromosomes, the presence of a Y invariably dictates the male phenotype. The gene for male differentiation (SRY, sex-determining region of Y chromosome) is located on the short arm of the Y.

Gene inactivation through genomic imprinting occurs on selected chromosomal regions of autosomes and leads to inheritable preferential expression of one of the parental alleles.

            "content": "The chromosomal fragility appears to be due to a heritable, unstable CGG repeating sequence in the X chromosome. Affected individuals have over 230 repeats and carriers have 60 to 230 repeats. The prolonged sequence inactivates a gene (FMR1) that codes for an RNA-binding protein of as yet an unknown connection to brain function. The genetics of this and other retardations was reviewed by Nokelainen and Flint. Rousseau and colleagues described a simple and sensitive test using DNA analysis for the diagnosis of the syndrome both prenatally and after birth. Because of mosaicism, the length of the triplet repeat does not directly relate to the degree of expression of cognitive impairment, and the fragile X alteration occasionally turns up in cognitively normal males; in some instances, the male children of their daughters have the disease. In some of the cases we have observed, the cognitive impairment has been mild in degree and the main abnormalities have taken the form of troublesome"

            "content": "During embryonic development, females randomly inactivate one of their two X chromosomes. Because BTK is required for Blymphocyte development, only cells in which the normal allele of BTK is active develop into mature B cells. Thus, in all B cells in female carriers of a mutant BTK gene, the active X chromosome is the normal one and the abnormal X chromosome is inactivated. This fact allowed female carriers of XLA to be identified even before the nature of the BTK protein was known. In contrast, the active X chromosomes in the T cells and macrophages of carriers are an equal mixture of normal and BTK mutant X chromosomes. Nonrandom Xinactivation only in B cells shows conclusively that the BTK gene is required for the development of B cells but not the other cell types, and that BTK must act in the B cells themselves rather than in stromal or other cells required for Bcell development (Fig. 13.4)."
