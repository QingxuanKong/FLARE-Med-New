MYC primarily functions by activating the transcription of other genes. Genes activated by MYC include several growth-promoting genes, including cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), whose products drive cells into the cell cycle (discussed next), and genes that control pathways that produce the building blocks (e.g., amino acids, lipids, nucleotides) that are needed for cell growth and division. As mentioned earlier (see Fig. 6.14 ), dysregulation of MYC results from a (8;14) translocation in Burkitt lymphoma, a highly aggressive B-cell tumor. MYC also is amplified in breast, colon, lung, and many other cancers, while the related NMYC and LMYC genes are amplified in neuroblastomas and small cell cancers of lung, respectively."

However, statistical approaches made possible by detailed analysis of cancer cells suggest (as might be expected) that aneuploidy tends to increase the copy number of key oncogenes and decrease the copy number of potent tumor suppressors. For example, chromosome 8, which almost never is lost and often is present in increased copies in tumor cells, is where the MYC oncogene is located. By contrast, portions of chromosome 17, where the TP53 gene is located, are often lost and are infrequently gained. Thus, tumor development and progression may be molded by changes in chromosome numbers that enhance the dosage of oncogenes while restricting the activity of tumor suppressor genes."

Of note, by convention, gene symbols are italicized but their protein products are not (e.g., RB gene and RB protein, TP53 and p53, MYC and MYC). The self-sufficiency in growth that characterizes cancer cells generally stems from gain-of-function mutations that convert proto-oncogenes to oncogenes. Oncogenes encode proteins called oncoproteins that promote cell growth, even in the absence of normal growth-promoting signals. To appreciate how oncogenes drive inappropriate cell growth, it is helpful to review briefly the sequence of events that characterize normal cell proliferation (introduced in Chapter 1). Under physiologic conditions, cell proliferation can be readily resolved into the following steps: 1. Binding of a growth factor to its specific receptor on the cell membrane 2."

With loss of APC function, \u03b2-catenin accumulates and translocates to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of genes, such as those encoding MYC and cyclin D1, that promote proliferation. This is followed by additional mutations, including activating mutations in KRAS, which also promote growth and prevent apoptosis. The conclusion that mutation of KRAS is a late event is supported by the observations that mutations are present in fewer than 10% of adenomas less than 1 cm in diameter, 50% of adenomas greater than 1 cm in diameter, and 50% of invasive adenocarcinomas.

One major pathway acts through the monomeric GTPase Ras, which leads to the activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) cascade (see Figure 15\u201349). This leads to an increase in the production of transcription regulatory proteins, including Myc. Myc is thought to promote cell-cycle entry by several mechanisms, one of which is to increase the expression of genes encoding G1 cyclins (D cyclins), thereby increasing G1-Cdk (cyclin D\u2013Cdk4) activity.

The normal cell seems able to detect abnormal mitogenic stimulation, and it responds by preventing further division. Such responses help prevent the survival and proliferation of cells with various cancer-promoting mutations. Although it is not known how a cell detects excessive mitogenic stimulation, such stimulation often leads to the production of a cell-cycle inhibitor protein called Arf, which binds and inhibits Mdm2. As discussed earlier, Mdm2 normally promotes p53 degradation. Activation of Arf therefore causes p53 levels to increase, inducing either cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis (Figure 17\u201363)."

For example, downregulation or deletion of certain miRNAs in some leukemias and lymphomas results in increased expression of BCL2, an anti-apoptotic gene. Thus, by negatively regulating BCL2, such miRNAs behave as tumor suppressor genes. Dysregulation of other miRNAs that control the expression of the RAS and MYC oncogenes also has been detected in lung tumors and in certain B-cell leukemias, respectively."

It is inducedin normal cells by exposure to growth factors and becomesfixed in cancer cells due to the action of certain drivermutations. Many oncoproteins (RAS, MYC, mutated growth factor receptors) induce or contribute to Warburg metabolism, and manytumor suppressors (PTEN, NF1, p53) oppose it. Stress may induce cells to consume their components in aprocess called autophagy. Cancer cells may accumulate mutations to avoid autophagy, or may corrupt the process toprovide nutrients for continued growth and survival. Some oncoproteins such as mutated IDH act by causing theformation of high levels of \u201concometabolites\u201d that alter theepigenome, thereby leading to changes in gene expression thatare oncogenic."
