The documents do not provide direct information about the specific effects of raspberries on type 2 diabetes. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the general information provided.\\n\\nRaspberries are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which may help reduce inflammation. Chronic inflammation is a known contributor to the development of type 2 diabetes, so it is possible that raspberries may have a beneficial effect on chronic inflammation.\\n\\nHowever, there is no information in the documents about the effects of raspberries on postprandial glucose levels. Postprandial glucose refers to the increase in blood glucose levels after a meal, and this is a key factor in the development of type 2 diabetes. Without information about the specific effects of raspberries on postprandial glucose, we cannot conclude that raspberries improve postprandial glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nBased on the available information, we can conclude that raspberries may have anti-inflammatory effects, but there is no evidence to suggest that they improve postprandial glucose levels in adults with type 2 diabetes.

Consumption of foods with a low glycemic index appears to reduce postprandial glucose excursions and improve glycemic control. Reduced-calorie and nonnutritive sweeteners are useful.

In contrast, the production by adipocytes of adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing peptide, is reduced in obesity, and this may contribute to hepatic insulin resistance. Adipocyte products and adipokines also produce an inflammatory state and may explain why markers of inflammation such as IL-6 and C-reactive protein are often elevated in type 2 DM.

            "content": "Endocrine function: White adipose tissue, once thought to be a passive reservoir of TAG, is now known to play an active role in body weight regulatory systems. For example, the adipocyte is an endocrine cell that secretes a number of protein regulators (adipokines), such as the hormones leptin and adiponectin. Leptin regulates appetite as well as metabolism (see p. 352). Adiponectin reduces FFA levels in the blood (by increasing FA oxidation in muscles) and has been associated with improved lipid profiles, increased insulin sensitivity resulting in better glycemic control, and reduced inflammation in patients with diabetes. [Note: Adiponectin levels decrease as body weight increases, whereas leptin levels increase.] 2."
