    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the provided documents and look for information related to the use of whole genome sequencing in the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease. From Document [0], we know that whole genome sequencing is expected to dramatically improve the clinical genetic diagnostic evaluation of mitochondrial diseases. Additionally, Document [7] states that for some mitochondrial diseases, it is possible to obtain an accurate diagnosis with a simple molecular genetic screen, and whole genome sequencing is one of the methods that can be used for this purpose. Document [2] mentions that whole-exome sequencing is commercially available and may be more widely used in the future. Although it is not specifically mentioned as a method for diagnosing mitochondrial disease, it is a related technology that can be used to identify mutations in the nuclear genome, which can be related to mitochondrial function. From Document [11], we know that mitochondrial diseases can be caused by mutations in the mitochondrial genome or in nuclear genes that code for components of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes. Whole genome sequencing can be used to identify mutations in both types of genes. Document [12] lists over 200 different disease-causing mtDNA mutations and notes that a number of clinical clues can increase the index of suspicion for a heteroplasmic mtDNA mutation as an etiology of a heritable trait or disease. Based on this information, it appears that whole genome sequencing can be used for the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease, as it can identify mutations in both the mitochondrial genome and nuclear genes that are related to mitochondrial function. Therefore, the correct answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Several syndromic disorders arising from mutations in the mitochondrial genome are known in humans and they affect both protein-coding and tRNA genes (Chap. 85e). The broad clinical spectrum often involves (cardio) myopathies and encephalopathies because of the high dependence of these tissues on oxidative phosphorylation.

This makes it feasible to look for disease-causing sequence variations in individual patients with the possibility of identifying rare variants that cause disease.

            "content": "the coding regions, negative results need to be interpreted with caution. The advent of more comprehensive sequencing technologies greatly facilitates concomitant mutational analyses of several genes after targeted enrichment, or even mutational analysis of the whole exome or genome. However, comprehensive sequencing can result in significant diagnostic challenges because the detection of a sequence alteration alone is not always sufficient to establish that it has a causal role."

            "content": "the unusual mechanisms of mtDNA transmission, which replicates independently from nuclear DNA. During cell replication, the proportion of wild-type and mutant mitochondria can drift among different cells and tissues. The resulting heterogeneity in the proportion of mitochondria with and without a mutation is referred to as heteroplasmia and underlies the phenotypic variability that is characteristic of mitochondrial diseases."
