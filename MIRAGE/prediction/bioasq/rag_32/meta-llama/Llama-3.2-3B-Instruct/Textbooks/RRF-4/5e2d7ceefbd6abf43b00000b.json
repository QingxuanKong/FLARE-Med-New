Parkinsonism is a clinical syndrome characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and instability. These types of motor disturbances may be seen in a range of diseases that damage dopaminergic neurons, which project from the substantia nigra to the striatum and are involved in control of motor activity. Parkinson-ism can be induced by drugs such as dopamine antagonists or toxins that selectively injure dopaminergic neurons. Among the neurodegenerative diseases, most cases of parkinsonism are caused by PD, which is associated with characteristic neuronal inclusions containing \u03b1-synuclein."

As discussed earlier, several sites are implicated in the familial forms of Parkinson disease, some related to the gene that codes for synuclein, the main component of the Lewy body. Although there is no current treatment that clearly halts or reverses the neuronal degeneration underlying Parkinson disease, methods are now available that afford considerable relief from symptoms. Treatment can be medical or surgical, although reliance is placed mainly on drugs, particularly on l-dopa (Table 38-4). The following sections are necessarily detailed so as to give the clinician a full comprehension of the use and side effects and interactions of these drugs."

However, no such toxin has yet been identified. It also suggested a successful means of producing an experimental model of Parkinson\u2019s disease in animals, especially nonhuman primates. This model is useful in the development of new antiparkinson-ism drugs. Pretreatment of exposed animals with a monoamine oxidase B inhibitor such as selegiline prevents the conversion of MPTP to MPP+ and thus protects against the occurrence of par-kinsonism.

These findings partly explain the high incidence of dementia in patients with Parkinson disease (see further on). As also mentioned, with the advance of Alzheimer disease, extrapyramidal features may emerge. In such cases, Burns and colleagues found changes in the substantia nigra including accumulation of synuclein and tau representative of Lewy bodies. Another association between the 2 diseases is apparent in the Guamanian Parkinson\u2013dementia complex, which is also discussed below.

Obeso PARKINSON\u2019S DISEASE AND RELATED DISORDERS Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second commonest neurodegenerative 449 disease, exceeded only by Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Its cardinal clinical features were first described by the English physician James Parkinson in 1817. It is noteworthy that James Parkinson was a general physician who captured the essence of this condition based on a visual inspection of a mere handful of patients. It is estimated that approximately 1 million persons in the United States, 1 million in Western Europe, and 5 million worldwide suffer from this disorder. PD affects men and women of all races, all occupations, and all countries. The mean age of onset is about 60 years. The frequency of PD increases with aging, but cases can be seen in patients in their 20s and even younger. Based on the aging of the population and projected demographics, it is estimated that"

            "content": "The special feature of this juvenile dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome is the dramatic response of both the dystonic and parkinsonian symptoms to treatment with l-dopa. As little as 20-200 mg/d may eliminate the movement disorder and permit normal functioning. Unlike idiopathic Parkinson disease, the medication can be continued indefinitely without the development of tolerance, wearing-off effects, or dyskinesias. Segawa disease accounts for some cases that had in the past been reported as juvenile Parkinson disease. Another feature is the disappearance or marked subsidence of the symptoms after a period of sleep and worsening as the day progresses. This diurnal variation is shared with many of the inherited (and sporadic) forms of Parkinson disease listed in Table 38-3. Fluctuations of symptoms with exercise and menses and in the first month of pregnancy have been observed in some cases. Torticollis and Other Restricted Dyskinesias and Dystonias (See Chap. 4)"
