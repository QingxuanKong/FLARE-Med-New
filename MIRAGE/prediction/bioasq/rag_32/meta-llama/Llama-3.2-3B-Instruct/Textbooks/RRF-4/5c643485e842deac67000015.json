For instance, many identified mutations are in genes that encode proteins involved in synaptic function and early transcriptional regulation (Table 465e-1) and have a clear relationship to activity-dependent neural responses that can affect the development of neural systems underlying cognition and social behaviors. Mutations in these genes may be detrimental by altering the balance of excitatory versus inhibitory synaptic signaling in local and extended circuits and by altering mechanisms that control brain growth. Some mutations affect genes (e.g., PTEN, TSC1, and TSC2) that negatively regulate signaling from several types of extracellular stimuli, including those transduced by receptor tyrosine kinases. Their dysregulation can alter neuronal growth as well as synaptic development and function."

For example, a number of different loss-of-function mutations, each individually rare, have been found to increase greatly the predisposition to autism and schizophrenia. Many of these are de novo mutations, which arose spontaneously in the germ-line cells of one or the other parent. The fact that these mutations arise spontaneously with some frequency could help explain why these common disorders\u2014each observed in about 1% of the population\u2014remain with us, even though the affected individuals leave few or no descendants. These rare mutations may arise in any one of hundreds of different genes, which could explain much of the clinical variability of autism and schizophrenia. Because they are kept rare by natural selection, most such variants with a large effect on risk would be missed by genome-wide association studies."

The relatively novel concept of duplication or deletion of portions of genes, copy number variation, emerged as explanatory of some proportion of diseases such as autism as discussed further on. What is interesting about copy number variation is that they may give rise to several phenotypes of similar disorder, quite unlike conventional mendelian mutations. This indicates that copy number variants, like SNPs, probably are not usually directly causative of a condition but instead modulate other functions that express proteins. This is the situation for many of the forms of developmental abnormalities such as generic cognitive developmental delay, autism, and certain psychiatric diseases."

As an example, significant progress has been made in the genetics of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), which are a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental diseases that share clinical features of impaired reciprocal social communication and interaction and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior. ASDs are highly heritable; concordance rates in monozygotic twins (~60\u201390%) are roughly 10-fold higher than in dizygotic twins and siblings, whereas first-degree relatives show about 50-fold increased risk compared with the general population. ASDs are also genetically heterogeneous. More than 100 known"
