Thus, the lifetime risk after exposure does not diminish over time (unlike with smoking, in which the risk decreases after cessation). It has been hypothesized that asbestos fibers preferentially gather near the mesothelial cell layer, where they generate reactive oxygen species that cause DNA damage and mutations. Sequencing of mesothelioma genomes has revealed multiple driver mutations, many of which cluster in pathways involved in DNA repair, cell cycle control, and growth factor signaling. Of interest, one of the most commonly mutated genes in sporadic mesothelioma, BAP1, encodes a tumor suppressor involved in DNA repair that also is affected by germ line mutations in families showing a high incidence of mesothelioma."

These drugs work by targeting bcr-abland c-kit (imatinib) and HER2 and BRAF, respectively. For example, a phase 3 randomized trial demonstrated that, compared with dacarbazine, standard of care chemotherapy option for patients with metastatic melanoma with a V600E BRAF mutation, the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib led to significantly higher response rates (48% vs. 5%).147 At 6 months, overall survival was 84% (95% CI, 78\u201389) in the vemurafenib group and 64% (95% CI, 56\u201373) in the dacarba-zine group. The hazard ratio for tumor progression in the vemu-rafenib group was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.20\u20130.33; P<0.001). The estimated median progression-free survival was 5.3 months in the vemurafenib"

Lenalidomide added to MP followed by lenalidomide maintenance also prolonged progression-free survival compared with MP alone. These combinations of novel agents with MP also achieve high complete response rates (MPT, ~15%; MP plus bortezomib, ~30%; MP plus lenalidomide, ~20%; and MP, ~2\u20134%). Although combinations of MP with newer agents are an alternative in these patients, most studies favor continuous therapy with nonMP-containing regimens (e.g., lenalidomide plus dexamethasone) due to longer term safety profile and efficacy."

Mesothelioma can be easily identified ultrastructurally, but it has historically been difficult to differentiate from adenocarcinoma through morphology and immunohistochemical staining. Several markers in the last few years have proven to be more helpful including CK5/6, calretinin, and Wilms tumor gene-1 (WT-1), all of which show positivity in mesothelioma."
