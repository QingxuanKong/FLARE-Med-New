Chromatin remodelers are enzymes that can alter the structure of chromatin, making it more accessible to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. They can reposition, remove, or replace nucleosomes, thereby changing the accessibility of DNA. The Zelda transcription factor, on the other hand, is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences and interacting with other proteins. While it plays a role in transcriptional regulation, its primary function is not to alter chromatin structure directly. Therefore, we need to look for evidence that Zelda is involved in chromatin remodeling to conclude that it is a chromatin remodeler.\" \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",

If one transcription regulator binds its cis-regulatory sequence and attracts a chromatin remodeling complex, the localized action of the remodeling complex can allow a second transcription regulator to efficiently bind nearby. Moreover, we have discussed how transcription regulators can work together in pairs; in reality, larger numbers often cooperate by repeated use of the same principles. A highly cooperative binding of transcription regulators to DNA probably explains why many sites in eukaryotic genomes that are bound by transcription regulators are \u201cnucleosome free.\u201d"

Transcriptionally active, decondensed chromatin (euchromatin) differs from the more condensed, inactive form (heterochromatin) in a number of ways. Active chromatin contains histone proteins that have been covalently modified at their amino terminal ends by reversible methylation, acetylation, or phosphorylation (see p. 438 for a discussion of histone acetylation/deacetylation by histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase). Such modifications decrease the positive charge of these basic proteins, thereby decreasing the strength of their association with negatively charged DNA. This relaxes the nucleosome (see p. 425), allowing transcription factors access to specific regions on the DNA. Nucleosomes can also be repositioned, an ATP-requiring process that is part of chromatin remodeling. Another difference between transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin"

In some cases, as soon as the transcription regulator dissociates from DNA, the chromatin modifications are rapidly reversed, restoring the gene to its pre-activated state. This rapid reversal is especially important for genes that the cell must quickly switch on and off in response to external signals. In other cases, the altered chromatin structure persists, even after the transcription regulator that directed its establishment has dissociated from DNA. In principle, this memory can extend into the next cell generation because, as discussed in Chapter 4, chromatin structure can be self-renewing (see Figure 4\u201344). The fact that different histone modifications persist for different times provides the cell with a mechanism that makes possible both longerand shorter-term memory of gene expression patterns."
