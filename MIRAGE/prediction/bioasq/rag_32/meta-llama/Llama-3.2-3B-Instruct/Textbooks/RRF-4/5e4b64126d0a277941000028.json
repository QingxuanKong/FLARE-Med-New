However, we can infer information about Figitumumab from the context of other documents. Figitumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), similar to cetuximab and panitumumab. These antibodies are effective in treating stage IV colorectal cancer (wild-type KRAS) and head and neck cancer. Given that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a type of cancer that can be treated with EGFR inhibitors, it is plausible that Figitumumab could be effective in treating NSCLC. However, without explicit information about Figitumumab in the provided documents, the answer cannot be definitively confirmed. Nonetheless, based on the context of other EGFR inhibitors, the answer is likely to be affirmative.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) makes up about 75\u201380% of all cases of lung cancer, and this group includes adenocarcinoma, squamous cell cancer, and large cell cancer, while small cell lung cancer (SCLC) makes up the remaining 20\u201325%. When NSCLC is diagnosed in an advanced stage with metastatic disease, the prognosis is extremely poor, with a median survival of about 8 months. It is clear that prevention (primarily through avoidance of cigarette smoking) and early detection remain the most important means of control. When diagnosed at an early stage, surgical resection results in patient cure. Moreover, recent studies have shown that adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy provides a survival benefit in patients with pathologic stage IB, II, and IIIA disease. However, in most cases, distant metastases have occurred at the time of diagnosis. In certain instances, radiation therapy can be"

            "content": "Necitumumab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against EGFR. Like cetuximab and panitumumab, it works through inhibition of the EGFR signaling pathway. However, as with cetuximab, necitumumab is of the G1 isotype, and as such, its antitumor activity may also be mediated, at least in part, through immunologically mediated mechanisms. It is approved for use in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy for the treatment of squamous NSCLC. The main adverse effects are what have been previously described for other anti-EGFR antibodies, and both venothrombolic and arterioembolic events have also been described."
