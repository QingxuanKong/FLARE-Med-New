The signals are complex, but a key part is played by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The regulation of blood vessel growth to match the needs of the tissue depends on the control of VEGF production, through changes in the stability of its mRNA and in its rate of transcription. The latter control is relatively well understood. A shortage of oxygen, in practically any type of cell, causes an increase in the intracellular level of a transcription factor called hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1). HIF1\u03b1 stimulates transcription of Vegf (and of other genes whose products are needed when oxygen is in short supply). The VEGF protein is secreted, diffuses through the tissue, and acts on nearby endothelial cells, stimulating them to proliferate, to produce proteases to help them digest their way through the basal lamina of the parent capillary or venule, and to form"

Overexpression of VEGF in invasive breast cancer is cor-related with increased microvessel density and recurrence in node-negative breast cancer. An angiogenesis index has been developed in which microvessel density (CD31 expression) is combined with expression of thrombospondin (a negative modulator of angiogenesis) and p53 expression. Both VEGF expression and the angiogenesis index may have prognostic and predictive significance in breast cancer.193 Bevacizumab (a monoclonal antibody to VEGF) was approved by the FDA for use in metastatic breast cancer in combination with pacli-taxel chemotherapy. This approval was based on results from a phase 3 trial by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. The group\u2019s E2100 trial showed that when bevacizumab was"
