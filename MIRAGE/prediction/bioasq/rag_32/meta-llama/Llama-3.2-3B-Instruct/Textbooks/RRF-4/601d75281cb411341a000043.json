Remarkably, the most widely used cancer therapies seem to work by exploiting these abnormalities, although this was not known by the scientists who first developed the treatments. Ionizing radiation and most anticancer drugs damage DNA or interfere with chromosome segregation at mitosis, and they preferentially kill cancer cells because cancer cells have a diminished ability to survive the damage. Normal cells treated with radiation, for example, arrest their cell cycle until they have repaired the damage to their DNA, thanks to the cell-cycle checkpoint responses discussed in Chapter 17.

            "content": "Cancer. Viruses, such as HBV and HCV, and bacteria, such as H. pylori, that are not known to carry or to activate oncogenes are associated with cancers, presumably because these microbes trigger chronic inflammation with subsequent tissue regeneration, which provides fertile ground for the development of cancer (Chapter 6). Diseases caused by microbes involve an interplay of microbialvirulence and host responses. Infectious agents can cause cell death or dysfunction by directlyinteracting with the cell. Injury may be due to local or systemic release of bacterialproducts, including endotoxins (LPS), exotoxins, or superantigens, combined with the immune response. Absence of an immune response may reduce the damageinduced by some infections; conversely, immunocompromisecan allow uncontrolled expansion of opportunistic infectionsthat can directly cause injury. Chronic immunological and inflammatory diseases and cancerhave been associated with specific microorgansims."

            "content": "Additional tumor cell vulnerabilities are likely to be detected when we learn more about how normal cells respond to \u201cstop\u201d signals from their environment and why and how tumor cells fail to heed such signals. IS IN VITRO SENESCENCE RELEVANT TO CARCINOGENESIS? When normal cells are placed in culture in vitro, most are not capable of sustained growth. Fibroblasts are an exception to this rule. When they are cultured, fibroblasts may divide 30\u201350 times and then they undergo what has been termed a \u201ccrisis\u201d during which the majority of cells stop dividing (usually due to an increase in p21 expression, a CDK inhibitor), many die, and a small fraction emerge that have acquired genetic changes that permit their uncontrolled growth. The cessation of growth of normal cells in culture has been termed \u201csenescence,\u201d and whether this phenomenon is relevant to any physiologic event in vivo is debated."

We shall then examine their functions and the parts they play in conferring on cancer cells the properties outlined in the first part of the chapter. We shall end the section by discussing colon cancer as an extended example, showing how a succession of changes in cancer-critical genes enables a tumor to evolve from one pattern of bad behavior to another that is worse. The Identification of Gain-of-Function and Loss-of-Function Cancer Mutations has Traditionally Required Different Methods"
