Sinusitis-associated empyema has a striking predilection for young males, possibly reflecting sex-related differences in sinus anatomy and development. It has been suggested that SDE may complicate 1\u20132% of cases of frontal sinusitis severe enough to require hospitalization. As a consequence of this epidemiology, SDE shows an ~3:1 male/female predominance, with 70% of cases occurring in the second and third decades of life. SDE may also develop as a complication of head trauma or neurosurgery. Secondary infection of a subdural effusion may also result in empyema, although secondary infection of hematomas, in the absence of a prior neurosurgical procedure, is rare."

In infants and children, and infrequently in adults, there may be a spread from meningitis and the collection is then often sterile. The term subdural abscess, among others, had been applied to this condition but the proper name is empyema, indicating suppuration in a preformed space.

Therapy in these complicated forms of infection must be individualized. As a rule, the best plan is to institute antibiotic treatment of the intracranial disease and to decide, after it has been brought under control, whether surgery on the offending ear or sinus is necessary. To operate on the primary focus before medical treatment has been discouraged. In cases complicated by bacterial meningitis, treatment of the latter usually takes precedence over the surgical treatment of complications, such as brain abscess and subdural empyema."

Subdural empyema is a rapidly progres-sive pyogenic infection. The subdural space lacks significant barriers to the spread of the infection, such as compartmental-ization or septations. Subdural empyemas usually occur over the cerebral convexities. Potential infectious sources include sinus disease, penetrating trauma, and otitis.

The resolution (or lack thereof) of the empyema can be readily followed by repeated imaging of the brain (Leys et al). This condition is usually associated with osteomyelitis in a cranial bone and originates from an infection in the ear or paranasal sinuses, or it is from a surgical procedure, particularly if the frontal sinus or mastoid had been opened or a foreign device inserted. Rarely, the infection is from a remote source or spreads outward from a dural sinus thrombophlebitis.

The surgical procedure should be coupled with appropriate antibiotic therapy, generally a third- generation cephalosporin and metronidazole. Bacteriologic findings or an unusual presumed source may dictate a change to different drugs, particularly to later-generation cephalosporins. Without such antimicrobial therapy and surgery, some patients will die, usually within 7 to 14 days.

Rarely, the subdural infection is the result of hematogenous spread from lung infection. Occasionally it extends from a brain abscess. It is currently predominantly the result of surgical procedures on the sinuses and cranium. In cases originating after cranial surgery, staphylococcus is involved. Streptococci (nonhemolytic and viridans) are the most common organisms if the sinuses are the origin of infection, followed by facultative anaerobic streptococci (often Streptococcus milleri) or Bacteroides.

Tyler Acute infections of the nervous system are among the most important problems in medicine because early recognition, efficient decision making, and rapid institution of therapy can be lifesaving. These distinct clinical syndromes include acute bacterial meningitis, viral meningitis, encephalitis, focal infections such as brain abscess and subdural empyema, and infectious thrombophlebitis. Each may present with a nonspecific prodrome of fever and headache, which in a previously healthy individual may initially be thought to be benign, until (with the exception of viral meningitis) altered consciousness, focal neurologic signs, or seizures appear. Key goals of early management are to emergently distinguish between these conditions, identify the responsible pathogen, and initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy. APPROACH TO THE PATIENT:"
