Quinolones are known to inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are essential enzymes for DNA replication and transcription in bacteria. The question specifically asks about topoisomerase, which is a type of enzyme that relaxes supercoils in DNA. There are two main types of topoisomerases: Type I and Type II. Type I topoisomerases introduce single-strand breaks in DNA, while Type II topoisomerases introduce double-strand breaks. Given that gepotidacin is a quinolone antibiotic, it is likely to target Type II topoisomerase, which is responsible for unwinding the DNA double helix. Therefore, we can infer that gepotidacin will activate bacterial topoisomerase II.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Bacterial DNA gyrase is a unique target of a group of antimicrobial agents called fluoroquinolones (for example, ciprofloxacin). C. Direction of DNA replication The DNA polymerases (DNA pols) responsible for copying the DNA templates are only able to read the parental nucleotide sequences in the 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 direction, and they synthesize the new DNA strands only in the 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 (antiparallel) direction. Therefore, beginning with one parental double helix, the two newly synthesized stretches of nucleotide chains must grow in opposite directions, one in the 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 direction toward the replication fork and one in the 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 direction away from the replication fork (Fig. 30.14). This feat is accomplished by a slightly different mechanism on each strand. 1."

These enzymes are activated by sites on chromosomes where two double helices cross over each other such as those generated by supercoiling in front of a replication fork (see Figure 5\u201320). Once a topoisomerase II molecule binds to such a crossing site, the protein uses ATP hydrolysis to perform the following set of reactions efficiently: (1) it breaks one double helix reversibly to create a DNA \u201cgate\u201d; (2) it causes the second, nearby double helix to pass through this opening; and (3) it then reseals the break and dissociates from the DNA. At crossover points generated by supercoiling, passage of the double helix through the gate occurs in the direction that will reduce supercoiling. In this way, type II topoisomerases can relieve the overwinding tension generated in front of a replication fork.

As a result, both negative and positive supercoils can be relieved by this ATP-requiring process. DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase found in bacteria and plants, has the unusual property of being able to introduce negative supercoils into circular DNA using energy from the hydrolysis of ATP. This facilitates the replication of DNA because the negative supercoils neutralize the positive supercoils introduced during opening of the double helix. It also aids in the transient strand separation required during transcription (see p. 436)."

In eukaryotes, DNA topoisomerase enzymes rapidly remove this superhelical tension (see pp. 251\u2013253). But in bacteria a specialized topoisomerase called DNA gyrase uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to pump supercoils continuously into the DNA, thereby maintaining the DNA under constant tension. These are negative supercoils, having the opposite handedness from the positive supercoils that form when a region of DNA helix opens (see Figure 6\u201319B). Whenever a region of helix opens, it removes these negative supercoils from bacterial DNA, reducing the superhelical tension. DNA gyrase therefore makes the opening of the DNA helix in bacteria energetically favorable compared with helix opening in DNA that is not supercoiled.

            "content": "The most commonly used CR induction regimens (for patients other than those with APL) consist of combination chemotherapy with cytarabine and an anthracycline (e.g., daunorubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone). Cytarabine is a cell cycle S-phase\u2013specific antimetabolite that becomes phosphorylated intracellularly to an active triphosphate form that interferes with DNA synthesis. Anthracyclines are DNA intercalators. Their primary mode of action is thought to be inhibition of topoisomerase II, leading to DNA breaks."

However, quinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae (QRNG) appeared soon after these agents were first used to treat gonorrhea. QRNG is particularly common in the Pacific Islands (including Hawaii) and Asia, where, in certain areas, all gonococcal strains are now resistant to quinolones. At present, QRNG is also common in parts of Europe and the Middle East. In the United States, QRNG has been identified in midwestern and eastern areas as well as in states on the Pacific coast, where resistant strains were first seen. Alterations in DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV have been implicated as mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance."

Irinotecan is hydrolyzed by hepatic carboxylesterase enzymes to its cytotoxic metabolite, SN-38, which inhibits topoisomerase I and eventually leads to termination of DNA replication and cell death. The active SN-38 metabolite is responsible for the majority of therapeutic action as well as the dose-limiting bone marrow and gastrointestinal toxicities. Inactivation of SN-38 occurs via the polymorphic UGT1A1 enzyme, and carriers of the UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*28 polymorphisms are consequently at increased risk for severe life-threatening toxicities, eg, neutropenia and diarrhea, due to decreased clearance of the SN-38 metabolite."

The later-generation fluoroquinolones levofloxacin and moxifloxacin are the most active against M. tuberculosis and are recommended for the treatment of MDR-TB. They are also being investigated for their potential to shorten the course of treatment for TB. In a recent trial, gatifloxacin, which had been withdrawn from the market because of significant dysglycemia, was assessed for treatment shortening; although its inclusion in the TB treatment regimen did not shorten the duration of therapy from 6 to 4 months, the drug did not cause dysglycemia in TB patients who took it thrice weekly for 4 months. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin are no longer recommended for the treatment of TB because of poor efficacy. Despite the documented resistance of the infecting strains to these and other early-generation fluoroquinolones, use of a"
