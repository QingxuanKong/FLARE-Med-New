    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the properties of AZD3759 and its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective permeable barrier that restricts the passage of substances from the bloodstream into the central nervous system (CNS). The BBB is composed of tight junctions between endothelial cells, astrocyte end-feet, and other components that limit the diffusion of substances. Drugs that are lipophilic (fat-soluble) or have specific transport mechanisms can cross the BBB. However, most drugs are not able to cross the BBB due to their polar nature or lack of specific transport mechanisms. To determine if AZD3759 crosses the BBB, we need to look at its chemical properties and any available information about its pharmacokinetics. Unfortunately, there is no information provided in the given documents about AZD3759. However, based on the general knowledge of the blood-brain barrier, we can make an educated guess. If AZD3759 is lipophilic or has specific transport mechanisms, it may be able to cross the BBB. However, without more information about its chemical properties, we cannot make a definitive conclusion. Assuming AZD3759 is not lipophilic or has no specific transport mechanisms, it is likely that it does not cross the BBB. But, without information, we can only take a guess.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

This separation is accomplished by the presence of tight junctions between the capillary endothelial cells as well as a surrounding layer of astrocyte end-feet. As such, to enter the CNS, drugs must either be highly hydrophobic or engage specific transport mechanisms. For example, the second-generation antihistamines cause less drowsiness because they were developed to be significantly more polar than older antihistamines, limiting their crossing of the BBB (see Chapter 16). Many nutrients, such as glucose and the essential amino acids, have specific transporters that allow them to cross the BBB. l-DOPA, a precursor of the neurotransmitter dopamine, can enter the brain using an amino acid transporter, whereas dopamine cannot cross the BBB. Thus, the orally administered drug l-DOPA, but not"

For example, L-dopa (levodopa), the precursor of the neuromediators dopamine and noradrenaline, easily crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier. However, the dopamine formed from the decarboxylation of L-dopa in endothelial cells cannot cross the barrier and is restricted from the CNS. In this case, the blood\u2013brain barrier regulates the concentration of L-dopa in the brain. Clinically, this restriction explains why L-dopa is administered for the treatment of dopamine deficiency (e.g., Parkinson\u2019s disease) rather than dopamine."

            "content": "Neurokinin 1 (NK1)-receptor antagonists have antiemetic properties that are mediated through central blockade in the area postrema. Aprepitant, netupitant, and rolapitant (all oral formulations) are highly selective NK1-receptor antagonists that cross the blood-brain barrier and occupy brain NK1 receptors. They have no affinity for serotonin, dopamine, or corticosteroid receptors. Netupitant (300 mg) is available only as a combination product with palonosetron (0.5 mg). Fosaprepitant is an intravenous formulation that is converted within 30 minutes after infusion to aprepitant. The oral bioavailability of aprepitant is 65%, and the serum half-life is 12 hours. Netupitant and rolapitant have longer half-lives (90 and 180 hours, respectively), allowing single-dose administration. All three agents are metabolized by the liver, primarily by the CYP3A4 pathway."
