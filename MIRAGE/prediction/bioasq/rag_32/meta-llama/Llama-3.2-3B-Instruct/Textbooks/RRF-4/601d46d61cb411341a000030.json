    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what Kabuki syndrome type 1 (KS1) is and the role of KMT2D in this condition. KS1 is a genetic disorder characterized by distinct physical features, developmental delays, and various medical problems. It is caused by mutations in the KMT2D gene, which encodes the histone methyltransferase KMT2D. The KMT2D protein is involved in histone modification and plays a crucial role in embryonic development. Mutations in this gene have been identified as the primary cause of KS1. The specific question asks about exon 38 or 39 KMT2D missense variants causing KS1. Missense variants refer to point mutations that result in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the resulting protein. Exons 38 and 39 of the KMT2D gene are critical for the proper functioning of the KMT2D protein. Mutations in these exons can lead to the production of a dysfunctional KMT2D protein, which can cause KS1. Therefore, based on the information available, we can conclude that exon 38 or 39 KMT2D missense variants do indeed cause Kabuki syndrome type 1 (KS1).\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Patients with splice variants, exon skipping, or missense mutations of \u03b1-helical glycines generally deteriorate after the age of 30 (adult form) with mild or late deafness. Early severe deafness, lenticonus, or proteinuria suggests a poorer prognosis. Usually females from X-linked pedigrees have only microhematuria, but up to 25% of carrier females have been reported to have more severe renal manifestations. Pedigrees with the autosomal recessive form of the disease have severe early disease in both females and males with asymptomatic parents."

An increase in the severity of the disease phenotype in successive generations (genetic anticipation) is accompanied by an increase in the number of trinucleotide repeats. A similar type of mutation has been identified in fragile X syndrome (Chap. 451e). The unstable triplet repeat in myotonic dystrophy can be used for prenatal diagnosis.

These \u201cframeshift\u201d mutations lead to an entirely altered carboxy terminus. Mutations in intronic sequences or in exon junctions may destroy or create splice donor or splice acceptor sites.

Alternative splicing represents a powerful mechanism for generation of complexity and variation, and this mechanism appears to be highly prevalent in the nervous system, affecting key processes such as neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels. Numerous diseases are already known to result from abnormalities in alternative splicing. Increased inclusion of exon 10\u2013containing transcripts of MAPT can cause frontotemporal dementia.

Rather than one disease, CMT is a syndrome of several genetically distinct disorders (Table 459-4). The various subtypes of CMT are classified according to the nerve conduction velocities and predominant pathology (e.g., demyelination or axonal degeneration), inheritance pattern (autosomal dominant, recessive, or X-linked), and the specific mutated genes. Type 1 CMT (or CMT1) refers to inherited demyelinating sensorimotor neuropathies, whereas the axonal sensory neuropathies are classified as CMT2. By definition, motor conduction velocities in the arms are slowed to less than 38 m/s in CMT1 and are greater than 38 m/s in CMT2. However, most cases of CMT1 actually have motor nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) between 20 and 25 m/s. CMT1 and CMT2 usually begin in childhood or early adult life; however, onset later in life can occur, particularly in CMT2. Both are associated with autosomal dominant"

The efficiency of fibroblast reprogramming was typically low (0.01%), in part because large numbers of retroviruses must integrate to bring about reprogramming and each integration event carries with it the risk of inappropriately disrupting or activating a critical gene. In what other ways, or other forms, do you suppose you might deliver the OSKM transcription regulators so as to avoid these problems? percent of \u02dc cellsexpressing HPAP number of colonies cells (problem 22\u20139)."

In one family we followed, there were 29 affected members in three generations and inheritance followed an autosomal dominant pattern. At the present, several genes have been identified, particularly KRIT1, as possibly causative in individual families. One interesting characteristic of this group, as pointed out by Labauge and colleagues, is the appearance over time of new lesions in one-third of patients. The followup of some of our patients has affirmed this. The diagnosis is based on clinical manifestations and MRI, which discloses a cluster of vessels surrounded by a zone of hypodense ferritin in the T1-weighted images (Fig. 33-32), the product of previous small episodes of bleeding. An uncertain number is associated with adjacent deep venous anomaly visualized by imaging studies and these are discussed in a separate section below."

            "content": "There has also been emphasis on mutations on 1 of 12 exons in the so-called Park2 gene, which codes for the protein parkin (see Table 38-3). The most common types are point mutations or deletions in exon 7, but abnormalities of the other exons evince similar syndromes. Homozygous mutations generally give rise to early-onset disease, but certain hemizygous changes (in exon 7) are associated with a later onset. The resultant syndromes have been termed parkin disease to distinguish them from the idiopathic variety. It has been estimated by Khan and colleagues that 50 percent of families that display an early onset of Parkinson disease and 18 percent of sporadic cases with early onset (before age 40 years) harbor mutations in this gene. Perhaps of greater clinical interest is finding that up to 2 percent of late-onset cases are associated with parkin mutations, and 1 percent due to changes in the aforementioned LRRK2 gene. Sequencing of these genes is now available in commercial"
