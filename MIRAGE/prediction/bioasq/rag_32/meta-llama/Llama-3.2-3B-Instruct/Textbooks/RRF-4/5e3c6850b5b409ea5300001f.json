    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor, we need to analyze the given documents and look for evidence that links bortezomib to the proteasome. According to Document [1] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison), bortezomib is an inhibitor of the proteasome, the multisubunit assembly of protease activities responsible for the selective degradation of proteins important in regulating activation of transcription factors, including nuclear factor-\\\\u00b1B (NF-\\\\u00b1B) and proteins regulating cell cycle progression. This suggests that bortezomib indeed targets the proteasome. Additionally, Document [2] (Title: Pharmacology_Katzung) states that bortezomib exerts its main cytotoxic effects through inhibition of the 26S proteosome, resulting in downregulation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\\\\u00b1B) signaling pathway. This further confirms that bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor. Based on the evidence from these documents, we can conclude that bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

As discussed in Chapter 2, misfolded proteins activate apoptotic pathways, and myeloma cells are prone to the accumulation of misfolded, unpaired immunoglobulin chains. Proteasome inhibitors likely induce myeloma cell death by exacerbating this inherent tendency.

The general degradative functions of the proteasome have been co-opted for antigen presentation, so that MHC molecules have evolved to work with the peptides that the proteasome can produce."

            "content": "Evidence of antibody-mediated injury is present when endothelial injury and deposition of complement component c4d is detected by fluorescence labeling. This is usually accompanied by detection of the antibody in the recipient blood. The prognosis is poor, and aggressive use of plasmapheresis, immunoglobulin infusions, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) to target B lymphocytes, bortezomib to target antibody-producing plasma cells, and eculizumab to inhibit complement is indicated. The typical times after transplantation when the most common opportunistic infections occur are shown in Table 337-4. Prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is given for 6\u201312 months after transplantation."
