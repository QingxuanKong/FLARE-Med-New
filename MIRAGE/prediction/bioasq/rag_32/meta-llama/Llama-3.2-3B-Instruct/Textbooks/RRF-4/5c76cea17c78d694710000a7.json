    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification (PTM), we need to understand what ADP-ribosylation is. ADP-ribosylation is a biochemical process where an ADP-ribose moiety is transferred from NAD+ to a protein. This process can alter the function of the target protein, often leading to its activation or inactivation. The key aspect of PTMs is that they involve the covalent attachment of a group to a protein, which can alter its structure, location, or function. Given that ADP-ribosylation involves the covalent attachment of an ADP-ribose moiety to a protein, it meets the criteria for a PTM. Therefore, ADP-ribosylation is indeed a PTM.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The ADP-ribosylated G protein upregulates the activity of adenylate cyclase; the result is the intracellular accumulation of high levels of cyclic AMP.

They are formed by enzymes known as glycosyltransferases that use nucleotide sugars (activated sugars) such as uridine diphosphate glucose as substrates. Glycosidic bonds between sugars are named according to the numbers of the connected carbons and with regard to the position of the anomeric hydroxyl group of the first sugar involved in the bond. If this anomeric hydroxyl is in the \u03b1 configuration, then the linkage is an \u03b1-bond. If it is in the \u03b2 configuration, then the linkage is a \u03b2-bond. Lactose, for example, is synthesized by forming a glycosidic bond between carbon 1 of \u03b2-galactose and carbon 4 of glucose. Therefore, the linkage is a \u03b2(1\u21924) glycosidic bond (see Fig. 7.3). [Note: Because the anomeric end of the glucose residue is not involved in the glycosidic linkage, it (and, therefore, lactose) remains a reducing sugar.] F. Carbohydrate linkage to noncarbohydrates"

            "content": "Vibrio organisms are noninvasive but cause disease by producing a toxin that interferes with the absorptive function of enterocytes. Flagellar proteins, which are involved in motility and attachment, are necessary for efficient bacterial colonization, and a secreted metalloproteinase that also has hemagglutinin activity is important for bacterial detachment and shedding in the stool. However, it is the preformed enterotoxin, cholera toxin, which causes disease. The toxin, which is composed of five B subunits that direct endocytosis and a single active A subunit, is delivered to the endoplasmic reticulum by retrograde transport. A fragment of the A subunit is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum lumen into the cytosol, where it interacts with cytosolic ADP ribosylation factors to ribosylate and activate the G protein Gs\u03b1. This stimulates adenylate cyclase, and the resulting increases in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) open the cystic fibrosis transmembrane"
