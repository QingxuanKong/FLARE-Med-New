Vasospasm can be detected by either transcranial Doppler assessment or cerebral angiography; it is typically treated with the calcium channel blocker nimodipine, aggressive IV fluid administration, and therapy aimed at increasing blood pressure, typically with vasoactive drugs such as phenylephrine. The IV fluids and vasoactive drugs (hypertensive hypervolemic therapy) are used to overcome the cerebral vasospasm. Early surgical clipping or endovascular coiling of aneurysms is advocated to prevent complications related to re-bleeding.

When the use of dual antiplatelet agents was extended to larger, non-Asian, populations, the POINT trial (Johnston et al), there was an excess of major systemic hemorrhages (not cerebral hemorrhages) compared to aspirin alone and somewhat less reduction in rates of stroke compared to the CHANCE trial but treatment was nevertheless effective in reducing 90-day recurrent stroke risk. The overall risk-benefit ratio for stroke reduction versus major system hemorrhage was judged to be favorable. These two antiplatelet trials enrolled patients with minor stroke or TIA that was considered to be high risk for subsequent stroke as gauged by ABCD2 score. Therefore, it applies to patients who are not planned to have thrombolysis, thrombectomy or anticoagulation. One consideration in the understanding hemorrhage rates is that the first trial used dual antiplatelet drugs for only 3 weeks, whereas the latter trial"

Debate also continues regarding optimal care for unruptured intracranial aneurysms, with a recent large-scale study showing no clear benefit to open surgical vs. endovascu-lar approaches.65SAH patients often require 1 to 3 weeks of ICU care after aneurysm occlusion for medical complications that accompany neurologic injury. In addition to routine ICU concerns, SAH patients are also at risk for cerebral vasospasm. In vasospasm, cerebral arteries constrict pathologically and can cause isch-emia or stroke from 4 to 21 days after SAH. Current vasospasm prophylaxis includes maintenance of optimal perfusion with hypertension and mild hypervolemia, as well as administration of nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker that may decrease the"

Cerebral vasospasm and infarct following subarachnoid hemorrhage\u2014Nimodipine, a member of the dihydropyridine group of calcium channel blockers, has a high affinity for cerebral blood vessels and appears to reduce morbidity after a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Nimodipine was approved for use in patients who have had a hemorrhagic stroke, but it has been withdrawn. Nicardipine has similar effects and is used by intravenous and intracerebral arterial infusion to prevent cerebral vasospasm associated with stroke. Verapamil, despite its lack of vasoselectivity, is also used\u2014by the intra-arterial route\u2014in stroke. Some evidence suggests that calcium channel blockers may also reduce cerebral damage after thromboembolic stroke. 5."
