Based on these combined results, the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) III explored the safety and efficacy of rtPA in the 3to 4.5-h time window. Unlike the NINDS study, patients older than 80 years of age and diabetic patients with a previous stroke were excluded.

Hypertension must be managed carefully, since abrupt reductions in blood pressure may be associated with further brain ischemia and injury. Acute ischemic stroke treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has an improved neurologic outcome when treatment is given within 3 h of onset of symptoms. The mortality rate is not reduced when tPA is compared with placebo, despite the improved neurologic outcome. The risk of cerebral hemorrhage is significantly higher in patients given tPA. No benefit is seen when tPA therapy is given beyond 3 h after symptom onset. Heparin has not been convincingly shown to improve outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

The first goal is to prevent or reverse brain injury. Attend to the patient\u2019s airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs), and treat hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia if identified. Perform an emergency noncontrast head CT scan to differentiate between ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke; there are no reliable clinical findings that conclusively separate ischemia from hemorrhage, although a more depressed level of consciousness, higher initial blood pressure, or worsening of symptoms after onset favor hemorrhage, and a deficit that is maximal at onset, or remits, suggests ischemia. Treatments designed to reverse or lessen the amount of tissue infarction and improve clinical outcome fall within six categories: (1) medical support, (2) IV thrombolysis, (3) endovascular revascularization, (4) antithrombotic treatment, (5) neuroprotection, and (6) stroke centers and"

When the use of dual antiplatelet agents was extended to larger, non-Asian, populations, the POINT trial (Johnston et al), there was an excess of major systemic hemorrhages (not cerebral hemorrhages) compared to aspirin alone and somewhat less reduction in rates of stroke compared to the CHANCE trial but treatment was nevertheless effective in reducing 90-day recurrent stroke risk. The overall risk-benefit ratio for stroke reduction versus major system hemorrhage was judged to be favorable. These two antiplatelet trials enrolled patients with minor stroke or TIA that was considered to be high risk for subsequent stroke as gauged by ABCD2 score. Therefore, it applies to patients who are not planned to have thrombolysis, thrombectomy or anticoagulation. One consideration in the understanding hemorrhage rates is that the first trial used dual antiplatelet drugs for only 3 weeks, whereas the latter trial"

In a limited trial, there was no increase in the frequency of hemorrhagic transformation of the ischemic region when compared to placebo treatment (Kay et al). Because the outcome measures in this study were coarse (death or dependence 6 months after stroke), further investigations of this approach need to be carried out. We can only infer that the use of low-molecular-weight heparins appears to be safe but there is no compelling evidence supporting their use in acute ischemic stroke.

The ECST reported similar stroke risk reduc-tion for patients with severe symptomatic carotid stenosis and no benefit in patients with mild stenosis when carotid endarter-ectomy was performed versus medical therapy.21The optimal timing of carotid intervention after acute stroke, however, remains debatable. Earlier studies showed an increased rate of postoperative stroke exacerbation and conver-sion of a bland to hemorrhagic infarction when carotid endarter-ectomy was carried out within 5 to 6 weeks after acute stroke. The dismal outcome reported in the early experience was likely related to poor patient selection. The rate of stroke"
