Enzymes that catalyze antioxidant reactions Reduced glutathione (GSH), a tripeptide-thiol (\u03b3-glutamylcysteinylglycine) present in most cells, can chemically detoxify H2O2 (Fig. 13.5B). This reaction, catalyzed by the selenoprotein (see p. 407) glutathione peroxidase, forms oxidized glutathione (G-S-S-G), which no longer has protective properties. The cell regenerates G-SH in a reaction catalyzed by glutathione reductase, using NADPH as a source of reducing equivalents. Thus, NADPH indirectly provides electrons for the reduction of H2O2 (Fig. 13.6). Additional enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, catalyze the conversion of other ROS to harmless products (see Fig. 13.5B). As a group, these enzymes serve as a defense system to guard against the toxic effects of ROS. glutathione."

The selenium-containing enzyme glutathione peroxidase reduces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, a reactive oxygen species) to water as glutathionine is oxidized (G-S-S-G). Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)requiring glutathionine reductase regenerates G-SH from G-S-S-G (see Figure A). The NADPH is supplied by the oxidative reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway (see Figure B), which is regulated by the availability of NADPH at the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-catalyzed step (the first step). Deficiency of G6PD occurs in all cells, but the effects are seen in red blood cells where the pentose phosphate pathway is the only source of NADPH. The pathway involves two irreversible oxidative reactions, each of which generates NADPH. The NADPH is used in reductive processes such as fatty acid synthesis (not oxidation) as well as steroid hormone and cholesterol synthesis."

From phosphatidic acid and an alcohol: The phosphate group on PA can be esterified to a compound containing an alcohol group (see Fig. 17.1). For example: 2."

Reperfusion injury is due to damage by free radicals. Pale infarct Occurs in solid organs with a single (endarterial) blood supply (eg, heart, kidney B ). Free radical injury Free radicals damage cells via membrane lipid peroxidation, protein modification, DNA breakage. Initiated via radiation exposure (eg, cancer therapy), metabolism of drugs (phase I), redox reactions, nitric oxide (eg, inflammation), transition metals, WBC (eg, neutrophils, macrophages) oxidative burst. Free radicals can be eliminated by scavenging enzymes (eg, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase), spontaneous decay, antioxidants (eg, vitamins A, C, E), and certain metal carrier proteins (eg, transferrin, ceruloplasmin).

Gangliosides are derived from ceramides, lipids with a sphingosine backbone. Prostaglandins of the 2 series (such as PGI2) are derived from the 20 carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid. Sphingomyelin is a sphingophospholipid derived from ceramide. Vitamin D is derived from an intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway for the sterol cholesterol. RQ2.Answer = A. Statins inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, thereby preventing the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent reduction of HMG CoA to mevalonate and decreasing cholesterol biosynthesis (see figure below). The decrease in cholesterol content caused by statins results in movement of the sterol regulatory element\u2013binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) in complex with SREBP cleavage\u2013 activating protein (SCAP) from the endoplasmic"

Essentially all cells except mature erythrocytes can synthesize phospholipids, whereas TAG synthesis occurs essentially only in the liver, adipose tissue, lactating mammary glands, and intestinal mucosal cells.
