Document [0] (Neurology_Adams) discusses the treatment of traumatic unresponsiveness and mentions that amantadine accelerated slightly the emergence from the vegetative or minimally conscious state. However, it does not specifically mention diazepam. Document [1] (Pharmacology_Katzung) provides information on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of benzodiazepines, including diazepam, which is used to treat anxiety, insomnia, and muscle spasm. Document [4] (Neurology_Adams) discusses the treatment of raised intracranial pressure and mentions that benzodiazepines, including diazepam, are used to reduce muscle tone and spasticity. Document [5] (Pharmacology_Katzung) states that diazepam is effective in reducing spasticity and muscle pain. Document [6] (Neurology_Adams) describes the management of raised intracranial pressure and mentions that benzodiazepines, including diazepam, are used to reduce muscle tone and spasticity. Document [9] (Neurology_Adams) discusses the use of benzodiazepines, including diazepam, in the treatment of status epilepticus and muscle spasm. Document [10] (Neurology_Adams) mentions that benzodiazepines, including diazepam, are effective in prophylactically suppressing seizures. Document [16] (Neurology_Adams) describes the management of raised intracranial pressure and mentions that benzodiazepines, including diazepam, are used to reduce muscle tone and spasticity. Document [21] (Neurology_Adams) discusses the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and mentions that benzodiazepines, including diazepam, are used to reduce muscle tone and spasticity.

The effects were less evident by 6 weeks but this and other activating agents seems like a promising approach that has gone in and out of favor over the years. In cases of longer standing, deep brain stimulation of thalamic nuclei has been explored in past decades and has had some successes. Claims for other types of behavioral activation programs have not been validated."

Lorazepam is less lipophilic than diazepam (logP values of 2.4 and 2.8, respectively) and does not undergo as rapid redistribution from brain to peripheral tissues as does diazepam. Clinically effective diazepam concentrations in the brain following an intravenous bolus fall rapidly as the drug exits the central compartment into peripheral fat. Lorazepam has less extensive peripheral tissue uptake, allowing clinically effective concentrations to remain in the central compartment for much longer. Although lorazepam is now used more frequently than diazepam because of the perceived pharmacokinetic advantage, recent appraisals of the clinical data have not found evidence to favor lorazepam. In the prehospital setting, rectal diazepam, intranasal midazolam, or buccal midazolam are acceptable alternative first"

            "content": "The many investigations of the biochemical changes that underlie spasticity and the mechanisms of action of antispasticity drugs have been reviewed by Davidoff. Because glutamic acid is the neurotransmitter of the corticospinal tracts, one would expect its action on inhibitory interneurons to be lost. As mentioned earlier, GABA and glycine are the major inhibitory transmitters in the spinal cord; GABA functions as a presynaptic inhibitor, suppressing sensory signals from muscle and cutaneous receptors. Baclofen, a derivative of GABA, is thought to act by reducing the release of excitatory transmitters from the presynaptic terminals of primary afferent terminals. Diazepam and other benzodiazepines have a similar effect but by a different mechanism of potentiating postsynaptic GABA receptors. Actually, none of these agents is entirely satisfactory in the treatment of spasticity when administered orally; the administration of baclofen intrathecally at times has a more beneficial effect."

Diazepam acts at GABAA synapses, and its action in reducing spasticity is at least partly mediated in the spinal cord because it is somewhat effective in patients with cord transection. Although diazepam can be used in patients with muscle spasm of almost any origin (including local muscle trauma), it also produces sedation at the doses required to reduce muscle tone. The initial dosage is 4 mg/d, and it is gradually increased to a maximum of 60 mg/d. Other benzodiazepines have been used as spasmolytics (eg, midazolam), but clinical experience with them is limited."

At issue has been the precise pressure at which damage occurs, whether lowering ICP improves outcome, which treatments are best, and the role of monitoring in guiding treatment. Certainly there are many biologic processes in neurons and astrocytes that greatly influence outcome after traumatic brain injury, many set in motion at the time of impact and not referable to raised ICP. At times, these overwhelm the changes induced by ICP but they are not particularly remediable, producing an emphasis on reducing ICP as a means of preventing secondary brain damage. An approach to ICP treatment is given here and also addressed in Chap. 16 on coma and Chap. 30 on brain tumors."

In keeping with the presumed autoimmune mechanism of most cases, plasma exchange, high-dose corticosteroids, or intravenous gamma globulin are helpful in some patients, albeit for only several weeks or months before another infusion is required. Several of our patients have required intravenous gamma globulin for several years at intervals of 6 to 12 weeks but nevertheless became disabled if the dose of diazepam was reduced below 100 mg/d. A small randomized trial of intravenous immune globulin conducted by Dalakas and colleagues has demonstrated the efficacy of this treatment; in their study, the benefits varied in duration from 6 weeks to 1 year. The typical dose is 0.4 mg/kg daily for 4 or 5 consecutive days. Immunosuppression with rituximab is being used increasingly, on the basis of case reports and small"

When the patient is first seen, an initial assessment of cardiorespiratory function is made and an oral airway established. As summarized by Bleck, a large-bore intravenous line is inserted; blood is drawn for glucose, BUN, electrolytes, and a metabolic and drug screen. A normal saline infusion is begun and a bolus of glucose is given (with thiamine if malnutrition and alcoholism are potential factors). To rapidly suppress the seizures, we generally use diazepam intravenously at a rate of about 2 mg/min until the seizures stop or a total of 20 mg has been given; alternatively, lorazepam, 0.1 mg/kg given by intravenous push at a rate not to exceed 2 mg/min, is now favored, being marginally more effective than diazepam because of its clinically longer duration of action (see Table 15-8)."

The benzodiazepines possess anticonvulsant properties, and the intravenous use of diazepam, lorazepam, and midazolam is an effective means of controlling status epilepticus, as described in Chap. 15. Diazepam in massive doses has been used with considerable success in the management of muscle spasm in tetanus and in the \u201cstiff man\u201d syndrome (see Chap. 45). Alprazolam may have a place in the treatment of panic attacks and other anxiety states, and as an adjunct in some depressive illnesses.

An ICP below 15 or 20 mm Hg is often given as a therapeutic target, as the elastance curve becomes steep beyond this level and small increments in cerebral volume may cause large elevations in pressure. However, guiding treatment by the direct measurement of ICP has not yielded beneficial results, as typified by the BEST-TRIP trial (Chesnut et al) and\u2014after several decades of popularity\u2014the advantage of such devices over clinical and imaging signs of increasing mass effect is less certain.

A similar effect has been attained by the nasal or buccal (transmucosal) administration of midazolam, which is absorbed from these sites (5 mg/mL, 0.2 mg/kg nasally; 2 mL to 10 mg buccally). Midazolam may be preferred among the diazepines for transmucosal use because it produces somewhat less respiratory depression than the others in the class and has been more effective at controlling seizures according to a study by McIntyre and colleagues. Still, only half were controlled. These approaches have found their main use in children with frequent seizures who live in supervised environments, where a nurse or parent is available to administer the medication."

In one study, patients receiving phenytoin developed fewer seizures at the end of the first year than a placebo group, but a year after medication was discontinued, the incidence was the same (and quite low) in the two groups. An extensive randomized study by Temkin and colleagues demonstrated that when administered within a day of injury and continuing for 2 years, phenytoin reduced the incidence of seizures in the first week, but not thereafter. Also, in a study of a large number of patients with penetrating head injuries, the prophylactic use of antiepileptic medications was ineffective in preventing early seizures (Rish and Caveness), and this is reflected in current guidelines (Chang and Lowenstein). Subsequent studies have come to much the same conclusion."

There is little to choose among the primary sedative drugs in respect to their therapeutic efficacy. More importantly, there are few data to indicate that any one of them can prevent hallucinosis or delirium tremens, or shorten the duration, or alter the mortality rate of the latter disorder (Kaim et al). A contemporary summary of the medication management of withdrawal has been given by Kosten and O\u2019Connor.

In this respect, alcohol acts on nerve cells in a manner akin to the general anesthetics and can cause coma. Unlike the anesthetics, however, the margin between the dose of alcohol that produces surgical anesthesia and that which dangerously depresses respiration is a narrow one, a fact that adds an element of urgency to the diagnosis and treatment of alcoholic coma. One must also be alert to the possibility that other sedative-hypnotic drugs may have potentiated the depressant effects of alcohol. Another treacherous situation is that of traumatic brain injury that is complicated by intoxication, a circumstance that is prone to misinterpretation because of uncertainty as to the main cause of stupor or coma."

Studies have confirmed that intrathecal catheter administration of baclofen can control severe spasticity and muscle pain that is not responsive to medication by other routes of administration. Owing to the poor egress of baclofen from the spinal cord, peripheral symptoms are rare. Therefore, higher central concentrations of the drug may be tolerated. Partial tolerance to the effect of the drug may occur after several months of therapy, but can be overcome by upward dosage adjustments to maintain the beneficial effect.

            "content": "Long-acting drugs such as chlordiazepoxide and diazepam and, to a lesser extent, phenobarbital are administered in progressively decreasing doses to patients during withdrawal from physiologic dependence on ethanol or other sedative-hypnotics. Parenteral lorazepam is used to suppress the symptoms of delirium tremens. Meprobamate and the benzodiazepines have frequently been used as central muscle relaxants, though evidence for general efficacy without accompanying sedation is lacking. A possible exception is diazepam, which has useful relaxant effects in skeletal muscle spasticity of central origin (see Chapter 27). Psychiatric uses of benzodiazepines other than treatment of anxiety states include the initial management of mania and the control of drug-induced hyperexcitability states (eg, phencyclidine intoxication). Sedative-hypnotics are also used occasionally as diagnostic aids in neurology and psychiatry."

            "content": "Treatment of Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy Treatment is directed initially to the prevention of further hypoxic injury. A clear airway is secured, cardiopulmonary resuscitation is initiated, and every second counts in their prompt utilization. Supplemental oxygen may be of value during the first hours but is probably of little use after the blood becomes well oxygenated. Once cardiac and pulmonary function are restored, there is experimental and clinical evidence that reducing cerebral metabolic requirements by inducing hypothermia has a beneficial effect on outcome and may prevent the delayed worsening referred to above. The use of high-dose barbiturates has not met with the same success."

            "content": "While quite safe in the recommended dosages, they are far from ideal. They frequently cause unsteadiness of gait and drowsiness and at times syncope, confusion, and impairment of memory, especially in the elderly. If taken in large doses, the benzodiazepines can depress the state of consciousness, resembling that of other sedative-hypnotic drugs, but with less respiratory suppression and hypotension. Flumazenil, a specific pharmacologic antagonist of the CNS effects of benzodiazepines, rapidly but briefly reverses most of the symptoms and signs of benzodiazepine overdose (see Krisanda). It acts by binding to CNS diazepine receptors and thereby blocking the activation of inhibitory GABA-ergic synapses. Flumazenil also may be diagnostically useful in cases of coma of unknown etiology and in hepatic encephalopathy."
