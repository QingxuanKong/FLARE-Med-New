These disorders account for ~10% of pediatric admissions and childhood mortality. Historically, genetics has focused predominantly on chromosomal and metabolic disorders, reflecting the long-standing availability of techniques to diagnose these conditions. For example, conditions such as trisomy 21 (Down\u2019s syndrome) or monosomy X (Turner\u2019s syndrome) can be diagnosed using cytogenetics (Chap. 83e). Likewise, many metabolic disorders (e.g., phenylketonuria, familial hypercholesterolemia) are diagnosed using biochemical analyses. The advances in DNA diagnostics have extended the field of genetics to include virtually all medical specialties and have led to the elucidation of the pathogenesis of numerous monogenic disorders. In addition, it is apparent that virtually every medical condition has a genetic component. As is often evident from a patient\u2019s family history, many common disorders"

The majority of single large-scale rearrangements of mtDNA are thought to result from clonal amplification of a single sporadic mutational event, occurring in the maternal oocyte or during early embryonic development. Because germline involvement is rare, most cases are sporadic rather than inherited. KSS is characterized by the triad of onset before age 20, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia, and pigmentary retinopathy. Cerebellar syndrome, heart block, increased cerebrospinal fluid protein content, diabetes mellitus, and short stature are also part of the syndrome.

As mentioned, mutations of nuclear DNA account for the heritable autosomal and sex-linked diseases described in this chapter, and they are remarkably diverse in nature. Some are lethal and are therefore not transmitted to successive generations; others are less harmful and may conform to one of the classic mendelian patterns. The mutation may be large and result in duplication of a major part of a chromosome or even of the entire gene (diploidy or triploidy) or a deletion (haploidy). Other mutations are quite small, involving only a single base pair (\u201cpoint mutation\u201d).

On the other hand, several different types of mutations can cause retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited disorder associated with abnormal retinal pigmentation and consequent visual impairment.
