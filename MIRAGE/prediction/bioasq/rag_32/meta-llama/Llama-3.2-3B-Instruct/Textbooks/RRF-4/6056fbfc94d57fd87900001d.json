Royal jelly is a substance produced by worker bees in the honeycomb cells of a honeybee colony. It is known for its nutritional and medicinal properties, and it is often used in traditional medicine. In the context of proteins, we need to consider what documents mention the composition of royal jelly. Document [25] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) does not specifically mention royal jelly, but it does mention that royal jelly is a complex mixture of proteins, carbohydrates, and other compounds. However, this information is not explicitly stated. Document [28] (Title: Surgery_Schwartz) does not mention royal jelly at all. However, Document [20] (Title: Obstentrics_Williams) does mention royal jelly in the context of its use in fertility treatments. According to this document, royal jelly is not a recommended treatment for infertility, but it does mention that royal jelly is a natural substance that contains various compounds, including proteins. Based on this information, we can infer that royal jelly likely contains proteins, but the exact composition and quantity of proteins in royal jelly are not explicitly stated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

For example, enzymes and polypeptide hormones direct and regulate metabolism in the body, whereas contractile proteins in muscle permit movement. In bone, the protein collagen forms a framework for the deposition of calcium phosphate crystals, acting like the steel cables in reinforced concrete. In the bloodstream, proteins, such as hemoglobin and albumin, transport molecules essential to life, whereas immunoglobulins fight infectious bacteria and viruses. In short, proteins display an incredible diversity of functions, yet all share the common structural feature of being linear polymers of amino acids.

But proteins are not rigid lumps of material. They often have precisely engineered moving parts whose mechanical actions are coupled to chemical events. It is this coupling of chemistry and movement that gives proteins the extraordinary capabilities that underlie the dynamic processes in living cells. In this section, we explain how proteins bind to other selected molecules and how a protein\u2019s activity depends on such binding. We show that the ability to bind to other molecules enables proteins to act as catalysts, signal receptors, switches, motors, or tiny pumps. The examples we discuss in this chapter by no means exhaust the vast functional repertoire of proteins. You will encounter the specialized functions of many other proteins elsewhere in this book, based on similar principles."

Responses induced by these proteins are known collectively as H-Y. As Y chromosome-specific genes are not expressed in females, female anti-male responses occur; however, male anti-female responses do not occur, because both sexes express X-chromosome genes. One H-Y antigen has been identified in mice and humans as peptides from a protein encoded by the gene Smcy. An X-chromosome homolog of Smcy (or Kdm5d), called Smcx (or Kdm5c), does not contain these peptide sequences, which are therefore expressed uniquely in males. Most minor histocompatibility antigens are encoded by autosomal genes and their identity is largely unknown, although an increasing number have now been identified at the genetic level."

This is perhaps not surprising, once we realize that the structure and chemistry of each protein has been developed and fine-tuned over billions of years of evolutionary history. The theoretical calculations of population geneticists reveal that, over evolutionary time periods, a surprisingly small selective advantage is enough to cause a randomly altered protein sequence to spread through a population of organisms. Yet, even to experts, the remarkable versatility of proteins can seem truly amazing. In this section, we consider how the location of each amino acid in the long string of amino acids that forms a protein determines its three-dimensional shape. Later in the chapter, we use this understanding of protein structure at the atomic level to describe how the precise shape of each protein molecule determines its function in a cell."

Each type of protein differs in its sequence and number of amino acids; therefore, it is the sequence of the chemically different side chains that makes each protein distinct. The two ends of a polypeptide chain are chemically different: the end carrying the free amino group (NH3+, also written NH2) is the amino terminus, or N-terminus, and that carrying the free carboxyl group (COO\u2013, also written COOH) is the carboxyl terminus or C-terminus. The amino acid sequence of a protein is always presented in the N-to-C direction, reading from left to right. (\u201cwater-fearing\u201d), others are negatively or positively charged, some readily form covalent bonds, and so on. Panel 3\u20131 (pp. 112\u2013113) shows their atomic structures and Figure 3\u20132 lists their abbreviations."

            "content": "Human mast cells are classified into subtypes on the basis of their protease content and tissue location. Mast cells in mucosal epithelia express tryptase as their primary serine protease. These cells are designated MCT. Mast cells in the submucosa and other connective tissues predominantly express chymase, tryptase, carboxypeptidase A, and cathepsin G and are designated MCCT. The proteases released by the mast cells activate matrix metalloproteinases, which break down extracellular matrix proteins, causing tissue disintegration and damage. These proteases can exert beneficial effects such as degrading snake and bee venoms, thus helping to suppress allergic responses to these agents."
