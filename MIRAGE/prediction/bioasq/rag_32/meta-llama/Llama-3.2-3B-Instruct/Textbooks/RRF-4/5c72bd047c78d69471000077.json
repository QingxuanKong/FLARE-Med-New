Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a genetic disorder that predisposes individuals to develop certain types of tumors, including hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinomas, pheochromocytomas, and pancreatic islet cell tumors. Pazopanib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets various receptors, including VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-kit. Given that pazopanib's mechanism of action involves inhibiting angiogenesis, which is a key process in tumor growth and metastasis, it is reasonable to consider its potential use in treating von Hippel-Lindau disease. However, we need to look for any specific indications or contraindications related to pazopanib and von Hippel-Lindau disease in the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

These trials separately evaluated two orally administered antiangiogenic agents, sorafenib and sunitinib, that inhibited receptor tyrosine kinase signaling through the VEGF and PDGF receptors. Both showed efficacy as second-line treatment following progression during cytokine treatment, resulting in approval by regulatory authorities for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. A randomized phase III trial comparing sunitinib to IFN-\u03b1 showed superior efficacy for sunitinib with an acceptable safety profile. The trial resulted in a change in the standard first-line treatment from IFN to sunitinib. Sunitinib is usually given orally at a dose of 50 mg/d for 4 out of 6 weeks.

Other inhibitors of VEGFR approved for the treatment of RCC include axitinib and pazopanib.

Recently, a phase 1b and random-ized phase 2 study of olaratumab and doxorubicin versus doxo-rubicin alone has demonstrated improvements in both objective response rates (18.2% vs. 11.9%, P = 0.34) and median over-all survival (26.5 vs. 14.7 months [stratified hazard ratio 0.46, 0.30\u20130.71, P = 0.0003]).

            "content": "Patients with advanced NSCLC should have molecular testing of their tumor. Patients whose tumors contain an actionable mutation should then receive a targeted therapy. For example, first-line therapy with erlotinib significantly improves outcomes in advanced NSCLC patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations, which include exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations. Afatinib is a small molecule inhibitor of EGFR, HER2, and HER4, and it is approved for the first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 mutations. Osimertinib is approved for the treatment of metastatic EGFR T790M-mutant NSCLC following progression on or after EGFR TKI therapy. This small molecule is important as it is able to overcome the resistance that arises from the emergence of the T790M gatekeeper mutation either de novo or following previous EGFR TKI therapy. In NSCLC that is ALK-positive, three new small molecules have been developed: crizotinib,"

Parafibromin is also referred to as cell division cycle protein 73 (CDC73) and has a role in transcription. Genetic testing in families helps to identify mutation carriers who should be periodically screened for the development of tumors (Table 408-5).

Figure 77-18 illustrates a diagnostic algorithm for the evaluation of suspected erythrocytosis. Assay for JAK2 mutations in the presence of a normal arterial oxygen saturation provides an alternative diagnostic approach to erythrocytosis when red cell mass and plasma volume determinations are not available; a normal serum erythropoietin level does not exclude the presence of PV, but an elevated erythropoietin level is more consistent with a secondary cause for the erythrocytosis."
