The International Surgical Trial in Intracerebral Haemorrhage (STICH) randomized patients with supratentorial ICH to either early surgical evacuation or initial medical management. No benefit was found in the early surgery arm, although analysis was complicated by the fact that 26% of patients in the initial medical management group ultimately had surgery for neurologic deterioration. The follow-up study STICH-II found that surgery within 24 h of lobar, supratentorial hemorrhage did not improve overall outcome, but might have a role in select severely affected patients. Therefore, existing data do not support routine surgical evacuation of supratentorial hemorrhages in stable patients. However, many centers still consider surgery for patients deemed salvageable and who are having progressive neurologic deterioration due to herniation.

The natural trend is for the blood pressure to diminish over several days; therefore active treatment in the acute stages has been a matter of controversy. Rapid reduction of moderately elevated blood pressure (between 140 and 160 mm Hg systolic), in the hope of reducing further bleeding, is not recommended, because it risks compromising cerebral perfusion in cases of raised intracranial pressure. On the other hand, sustained mean blood pressures of greater than 110 mm Hg (generally above 160 mm Hg systolic) may exaggerate cerebral edema and perhaps enhance the risk extension of the clot. It is at approximately this level of acute hypertension that the use of beta-blocking drugs (esmolol, labetalol) or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is recommended.

Acute reactive hypertension, far exceeding the patient\u2019s chronic hypertensive level, is a feature that, in the context of a stroke, suggests hemorrhage; it is seen particularly with moderate and large clots situated in deep regions. Vomiting at the onset of intracerebral hemorrhage occurs much more frequently than with infarction and likewise suggests bleeding as the cause of an acute hemiparesis. Severe headache is generally considered to be an accompaniment of intracerebral hemorrhage and in many cases it is, but in almost half of cases it has been absent or mild. Nuchal rigidity is infrequent. If there is stiffness of the neck, it characteristically disappears as coma deepens. Or, the patient may be alert and responding accurately when first seen. Only if bleeding into the ventricles is massive or there is substantial distortion of the midbrain, does coma result."

For the other subtypes, for type 3 disease, and for major procedures requiring longer periods of normal hemostasis, VWF replacement can be given. Virally inactivated VWF-containing factor concentrates are safer than cryoprecipitate as the replacement product. Antifibrinolytic therapy using either \u03b5-aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid is an important therapy, either alone or in an Disorders of Platelets and Vessel Wall 732 adjunctive capacity, particularly for the prevention or treatment of mucosal bleeding. These agents are particularly useful in prophylaxis for dental procedures, with DDAVP for dental extractions and tonsillectomy, menorrhagia, and prostate procedures. It is contraindicated in the setting of upper urinary tract bleeding, due to the risk of ureteral obstruction."

Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; ICH, intracerebral hemorrhage. Sources: JC Hemphill et al: Stroke 32:891, 2001; JC Hemphill et al: Neurology 73:1088, 2009. Hematomas may expand for several hours following the initial hemorrhage, even in patients without coagulopathy. However, the precise mechanism is unclear. A phase 3 trial of treatment with recombinant factor VIIa reduced hematoma expansion; however, clinical outcomes were not improved, so use of this drug cannot be advocated at present. The theoretical risk of acutely elevated blood pressure on hematoma expansion forms the basis of the consideration for recently completed and ongoing clinical trials of acute blood pressure lowering."

            "content": "Bleeding symptoms or prevention of bleeding in patients with severe platelet dysfunction frequently requires platelet transfusion. Care is taken to limit the risk of alloimmunization by limiting exposure, using HLA-matched leuko-depleted platelet concentrates for transfusion. Platelet disorders associated with milder bleeding symptoms frequently respond to desmopressin (1-deamino-8-Darginine vasopressin [DDAVP]). DDAVP increases plasma VWF and factor VIII levels; it may also have a direct effect on platelet function. Particularly for mucosal bleeding symptoms, antifibrinolytic therapy (\u03b5-aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid) is used alone or in conjunction with DDAVP or platelet therapy."

The ICH Score (Table 446-7) is a validated clinical grading scale that is useful for stratification of mortality risk and clinical outcome. Any identified coagulopathy should be corrected as soon as possible. For patients taking VKAs, rapid correction of coagulopathy can be achieved by infusing prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC), which can be administered quickly, with vitamin K administered concurrently. Fresh frozen plasma is an alternative but generally requires larger fluid volumes and longer time to achieve adequate reversal than PCC. There is no effective antidote to ICH associated with oral thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, although FEIBA (factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity) and recombinant factor VIIa have been tried in individual cases. PCC may partially reverse the effects of oral factor Xa inhibitors and are reasonable to"
