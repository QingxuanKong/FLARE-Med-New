    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what Copy Number Variants (CNVs) are and their relationship with regions of low mappability. CNVs are relatively large genomic regions that have been duplicated or deleted, and they can be found throughout the genome. Regions of low mappability refer to areas of the genome that are difficult to sequence accurately due to various factors such as repetitive DNA sequences, repetitive elements, or complex genomic structures. Considering the nature of CNVs and regions of low mappability, it is possible that CNVs might be depleted in regions of low mappability because these regions are often challenging to sequence accurately. However, the relationship between CNVs and regions of low mappability is not straightforward, and there is evidence to suggest that CNVs can occur in both mappable and non-mappable regions of the genome. Therefore, the answer to this question is not a simple yes or no, but rather a nuanced understanding of the complex relationship between CNVs and regions of low mappability.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Another source, perhaps even more important but missed for many years, lies in the many duplications and deletions of large blocks of human DNA. When one compares any individual human with the standard reference genome in the database, one will generally find roughly 100 differences involving gain or loss of long sequence blocks, totaling perhaps 3 million nucleotide pairs. Some of these copy number variations (CNVs) will be very common, presumably reflecting relatively ancient origins, while others will be present in only a small minority of people (Figure 4\u201380). On average, nearly half of the CNVs contain known genes. CNVs have been implicated in many human traits, including color blindness, infertility, hypertension, and a wide variety of disease susceptibilities. In retrospect, this type of variation is not surprising, given the prominent role of DNA addition and DNA loss"

Most of these variations are common and relatively harmless. When two sequence variants coexist in the population and both are common, the variants are called polymorphisms. The majority of polymorphisms are due to the substitution of a single nucleotide, called single-nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs (Figure 8\u201350). The rest are due largely to insertions or deletions\u2014called indels when the change is small, or copy number variations (CNVs) when it is large. Although these common variants can be found throughout the genome, they are not scattered randomly\u2014or even independently. Instead, they tend to travel in groups called haplotype blocks\u2014combinations of polymorphisms that are inherited as a unit."

The relatively novel concept of duplication or deletion of portions of genes, copy number variation, emerged as explanatory of some proportion of diseases such as autism as discussed further on. What is interesting about copy number variation is that they may give rise to several phenotypes of similar disorder, quite unlike conventional mendelian mutations. This indicates that copy number variants, like SNPs, probably are not usually directly causative of a condition but instead modulate other functions that express proteins. This is the situation for many of the forms of developmental abnormalities such as generic cognitive developmental delay, autism, and certain psychiatric diseases."

DNA or RNA probes are hybridized to the chip, and a scanner detects the relative amounts of complementary binding. Used to profile gene expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously to study certain diseases and treatments. Able to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs) for a variety of applications including genotyping, clinical genetic testing, forensic analysis, cancer mutations, and genetic linkage analysis."

            "content": "In addition to alterations in DNA sequence, coding genes also can undergo structural variations, such as copy number changes\u2014amplifications or deletions\u2014or translocations that result in aberrant gain or loss of protein function. As with mutations, structural changes may occur in the germline, or be acquired in somatic tissues. In many instances, pathogenic germline alterations involve a contiguous portion of a chromosome rather than a single gene, such as in the 22q microdeletion syndrome, discussed later. With the widespread availability of next-generation sequencing technology for assessing DNA copy number variation at very high resolution genome wide, pathogenic structural alterations have now been discovered in common disorders such as autism. Cancers often contain somatically acquired structural alterations, including amplifications, deletions, and translocations.

Genome-wide arrays are typically used in research settings, for example, to identiY novel microdeletion syndromes in individuals with intellectual disability (Slavotinek, 200S). Targeted arrays are generally preferred prenatally because the likelihood of detecting a copy number variant of uncertain clinical signiicance is lower.
