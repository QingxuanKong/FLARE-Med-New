PPARG (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) is a gene involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. Research has shown that variants in the PPARG gene are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, but the relationship between PPARG variants and type 1 diabetes is not well established. However, some studies have found that certain variants in the PPARG gene may also be associated with an increased risk of autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes. Despite this, the evidence is not conclusive, and more research is needed to fully understand the link between PPARG variants and type 1 diabetes. Therefore, the answer to this question is not definitively proven, but there is some evidence suggesting a possible link between PPARG variants and type 1 diabetes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Genome-wide association studies have identified over 20 susceptibility loci for type 1 diabetes. Of these, the strongest association is with class II MHC (HLA-DR) genes. Between 90% and 95% of white patients with type 1 diabetes have HLA-DR3, or DR4, or both, in contrast with about 40% of normal subjects, and 40% to 50% of patients are DR3/DR4 heterozygotes, in contrast with 5% of normal subjects.

For example, the association between type 1 diabetes and the DR3 and DR4 alleles is now known to be due to their tight genetic linkage to DQ\u03b2 alleles that confer susceptibility to the disease. Indeed, susceptibility is most closely associated with polymorphisms at a particular position in the DQ\u03b2 amino acid sequence that affect the peptide-binding cleft of MHC class II (Fig. 15.40).

Most exploration of human disease has been, until recently, based on the \u201ccommon disease\u2013common variant\u201d model, in which a disease is attributable to limited number variants that exist in more than 1 to 5 percent of a population. For example, five polymorphisms are each responsible for doubling or tripling the risk of macular degeneration. However, most of these variants are probably not themselves responsible for the disease."

It is accompanied by CFTR mutations in 47% of patients, however, suggesting that the presence of pancreas divisum together with mutational events may increase the susceptibility to pancreatitis.134Chronic Inflammatory PancreatitisChronic inflammatory pancreatitis is characterized by diffuse fibrosis and a loss of acinar elements with a predominant mono-nuclear cell infiltration throughout the gland.A variant of chronic pancreatitis is a nonobstructive, diffusely infiltrative disease associated with fibrosis, a mono-nuclear cell (lymphocyte, plasma cell, or eosinophil) infiltrate, and an increased titer of one or more autoantibodies.135 This type, referred to as autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), is associated with a variety of illnesses with suspected or proven autoimmune etiology, such as Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and monogenic diabetes are subtypes of DM characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, early onset of hyperglycemia (usually <25 years; sometimes in neonatal period), and impaired insulin secretion (discussed below). Mutations in the insulin receptor cause a group of rare disorders characterized by severe insulin resistance."

Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are genetically complex, and despite the associations with multiple susceptibility loci, no single-gene defect (mutation) can account for predisposition to these diseases.
