LSG15, a multidrug chemotherapy program developed in Japan, induces complete responses in about one-third of patients, about half of whom survive more than 2 years; however, but the median survival time is about 13 months. A pilot trial suggested that mogamulizumab, an antibody to CCR4 (a receptor for a number of chemokines, including RANTES and TARC), improved response rates when added to chemotherapy. An experimental approach using an yttrium 90\u2013labeled or toxin-conjugated antibody to the IL-2 receptor appears promising but is not widely available. Patients with the chronic or smoldering form of ATL may be managed with an expectant approach: treat any infections, and watch and wait for signs of progression to acute disease."

Indeed, manipulation of the CTLA4 axis was the first demonstration that purely immunoregulatory antibody strategies directed at T cell physiology could be safe and effective in the treatment of cancer, although it acts at a very early stage in T cell activation and can be considered somewhat nonspecific in its basis for T cell stimulation. Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD ligand blocking agent was also approved for melanoma, with a similar spectrum of potential adverse events, but acting in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, prominent activation of autoimmune hepatic, endocrine, cutaneous, neurologic, and gastrointestinal"

Patients are frequently wasted and sometimes present with intestinal perforation. The prognosis is poor. Hepatosplenic \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell lymphoma is a systemic illness that presents with sinusoidal infiltration of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow by malignant T cells. Tumor masses generally do not occur. The disease is associated with systemic symptoms and is often difficult to diagnose. Treatment outcome is poor. Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma is a rare disorder that is often confused with panniculitis. Patients present with multiple subcutaneous nodules, which progress and can ulcerate. Hemophagocytic syndrome is common. Response to therapy is poor. The development of the hemophagocytic syndrome (profound anemia, ingestion of erythrocytes by monocytes and macrophages, elevated ferritin levels) in the course of any peripheral T-cell lymphoma is"
