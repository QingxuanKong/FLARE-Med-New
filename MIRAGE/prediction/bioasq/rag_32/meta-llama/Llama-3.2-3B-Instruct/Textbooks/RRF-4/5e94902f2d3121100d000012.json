Autophagy is a cellular process that involves the degradation of cellular components, such as proteins and organelles, by lysosomal proteases. The documents mention that autophagy can be categorized into different types, including macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy. However, there is no mention of 'aggrephagy' in the provided documents. Therefore, we need to determine if 'aggrephagy' is a recognized term in the context of autophagy. After reviewing the documents, we can see that 'aggrephagy' is not a term mentioned in the context of autophagy. Hence, we can conclude that aggrephagy is not a variant of autophagy.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

There is increasing evidence that autophagy plays an important role in degradation of protein aggregates in the neurodegenerative diseases, and it is impaired in AD, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Huntington\u2019s disease. Autophagy is particularly important to the health of neurons, and failure of autophagy contributes to cell death. In Huntington\u2019s disease, a failure of cargo recognition occurs, contributing to protein aggregates and cell death.

Autophagy can be either nonselective or selective. In nonselective autophagy, a bulk portion of cytoplasm is sequestered in autophagosomes. It might occur, for example, in starvation conditions: when external nutrients are limiting, metabolites derived from the digestion of the captured cytosol might help the cell survive. In selective autophagy specific cargo is packaged into autophagosomes that tend to contain little cytosol, and their shape reflects the shape of the cargo. Selective autophagy mediates the degradation of worn out, or otherwise unwanted, mitochondria, peroxisomes, ribosomes, and ER; it can also be used to destroy invading microbes.

Through poorly understood mechanisms, obsolete organelles are corralled by a double membrane derived from the ER; the membrane progressively expands to encircle a collection of structures and forms an autophagosome, which then fuses with lysosomes where the contents are catabolized. In addition to facilitating the turnover of aged and defunct cellular constituents, autophagy also is used to preserve cell viability during nutrient depletion. The significance of autophagy in cell biology was recognized by the award of the 2016 Nobel Prize to Yoshinori Ohsumi for his discoveries relating to the mechanism of autophagy.
