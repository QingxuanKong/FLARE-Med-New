    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step reasoning for the question: Document [28] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) mentions that WNT4 may be involved in uterine development, but it does not mention HOXA11. However, Document [30] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) does not mention HOXA11 at all. But, Document [28] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) does mention HOXA13, which is altered in hand\u2013foot\u2013genital syndrome, and Document [28] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) also mentions that HOXA13 is involved in uterine development. Document [28] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) does not mention HOXA11. However, Document [31] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) does mention a deletion of a portion of the X chromosome, and mentions that the Xq21-28 region is critical, and that several genes in this region are identified as the cause of early ovarian insufficiency in humans. One of the genes mentioned is POF1B, but it is not associated with endometrial disease. However, Document [31] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) does not mention HOXA11. But, Document [31] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) does mention a mutation of the BMP15 gene located at Xp11.2, which is associated with premature ovarian failure. However, Document [31] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) does not mention HOXA11. After carefully reviewing the documents, I was unable to find any mention of HOXA11. However, Document [28] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) does mention HOXA13, which is involved in uterine development. But, since I could not find any direct mention of HOXA11 in the provided documents, I will choose the answer based on the fact that HOXA13 is mentioned. Therefore, my output is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After reviewing the provided documents, I could not find any direct mention of HOXA11, but HOXA13 is mentioned as being involved in uterine development.

The endometrioid type accounts for 80% of cases of endometrial carcinomas. These tumors are designated as endometrioid because of their histologic similarity to normal endometrial glands. Risk factors for this type of carcinoma include (1) obesity, (2) diabetes, (3) hypertension, (4) infertility, and (5) exposure to unopposed estrogen. Many of these risk factors result in increased estrogenic stimulation of the endometrium and are associated with endometrial hyperplasia. In fact, it is well recognized that prolonged estrogen replacement therapy and estrogen-secreting ovarian tumors increase the risk of the endometrioid type of endometrial carcinoma.

Two genetic models were described in the development of familial endometrial cancer: HNPCC or Lynch II syndrome and a predisposition for endometrial cancer alone; both are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion (42). The majority of studies focused on the increased incidence of endometrial cancer associated with Lynch II syndrome, a highly penetrant disorder (80% to 85%) (43). HNPCC or Lynch II syndrome is caused by an inherited mutation in one of the following mismatch repair genes: hMSH2, hMLH1, PMS1, PMS2, or hMSH6 (44\u201347). The disorder is characterized by early age (average age younger than 45 years) at onset of neoplastic lesions in a variety of tissues, including the colon, uterus, stomach, ureters, ovaries, and skin (43,48,49). The lifetime risk of endometrial cancer in women with Lynch II syndrome is 32% to 60% and the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is 10% to 12% (50,51)."

Relative overexposure to this class of hormones is a risk factor for the subsequent development of endometrioid tumors. In contrast, progestins drive glandular maturation and are protective.

            "content": "Inactivation of the PTEN tumor-suppressor gene is one of the earliest aberrations observed in endometrial cancer precursors and is the most common genetic defect in type I cancers, observed in up to 83% of tumors (206). Tumors with PTEN mutations tend to be well differentiated and minimally invasive (220\u2013222). Approximately 20% of sporadic endometrioid cancers demonstrate a molecular phenotype referred to as microsatellite instability (MSI) (223\u2013225). Microsatellites are short segments of repetitive DNA bases scattered throughout the genome. MSI describes the accumulation of sequence changes in these DNA segments that occur because of the inactivation of intranuclear proteins that comprise the mismatch repair system (226). Inactivation of MLH1, a component of the mismatch repair system, is a common event in type I endometrial cancer. This alteration occurs through hypermethylation of CpG islands in the gene promoter, a process known as epigenetic silencing (227). This is in contrast"

Several genes in this region are identified as the cause of early ovarian insufficiency in humans. Examples include the POF1B gene located at Xq21, the DIAPH2 gene located at distal Xq21, and the XPNPEP2 gene located at Xq25 (89,90). The specific functions of these genes require further investigation. In addition, a mutation of the BMP15 gene located at Xp11.2 is identified in patients with premature ovarian failure (91)."
