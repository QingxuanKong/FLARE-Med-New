Nitrates, such as nesiritide, have been used to treat acute decompensated heart failure, but their effectiveness in ischemic stroke is not well established. According to the provided documents, vasodilators including intravenous nitrates, nitroprusside, and nesiritide have been advocated for upstream therapy in an effort to stabilize ADHF (Acute Decompensated Heart Failure), but there is no mention of their effectiveness in ischemic stroke. In fact, the document on Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide in Decompensated Heart Failure (ASCEND-HF) study suggests that nesiritide was not associated with an increase or a decrease in the rates of death and rehospitalization and had a clinically insignificant benefit on outcomes in patients with ADHF. Therefore, based on the available information, it can be concluded that nesiritide is not effective for ischemic stroke.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Recent guidelines encourage LDL concentrations of less than 70 mg/dL for secondary stroke prevention. Early anticoagulation after an acute stroke carries an uncertain risk of hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic infarct.

One currently favored approach, based in part on the WARSS trial, is to simply administer aspirin in all cases of acute stroke. This approach is further endorsed by the WASID trial comparing aspirin (1,300 mg/d) to warfarin for treatment of intracranial arterial stenosis on the basis that warfarin was no better at preventing strokes while aspirin was associated with fewer gastrointestinal hemorrhages and a lower overall death rate.

Consequently, not every 40or 50-year-old should be advised to take aspirin regularly because the risk of atherothrombotic stroke is extremely low and is outweighed by the risk of adverse side effects. Conversely, every patient who has experienced an atherothrombotic stroke or TIA and has no contraindication should be taking an antiplatelet agent regularly because the average annual risk of another stroke is 8\u201310%; another few percent will experience an MI or vascular death.

            "content": "ANTITHROMBOTIC TREATMENT Platelet Inhibition Aspirin is the only antiplatelet agent that has been proven effective for the acute treatment of ischemic stroke; there are several antiplatelet agents proven for the secondary prevention of stroke (see below). Two large trials, the International Stroke Trial (IST) and the Chinese Acute Stroke Trial (CAST), found that the use of aspirin within 48 h of stroke onset reduced both stroke recurrence risk and mortality minimally. Among 19,435 patients in IST, those allocated to aspirin, 300 mg/d, had slightly fewer deaths within 14 days (9.0 vs 9.4%), significantly fewer recurrent ischemic strokes (2.8 vs 3.9%), no excess of hemorrhagic strokes (0.9 vs 0.8%), and a trend toward a reduction in death or dependence at 6 months (61.2 vs 63.5%). In CAST, 21,106 patients with ischemic stroke received 160 mg/d of aspirin or a placebo for up to 4 weeks. There were very small reductions in the aspirin group in early mortality (3.3 vs 3.9%), recurrent"

            "content": "Excitotoxicity refers to neuronal cell death caused by activation of excitatory amino acid receptors (Fig. 444e-4). Compelling evidence for a role of excitotoxicity, especially in ischemic neuronal injury, is derived from experiments in animal models. Experimental models of stroke are associated with increased extracellular concentrations of the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter glutamate, and neuronal damage is attenuated by denervation of glutamate-containing neurons or the administration of glutamate receptor antagonists. The distribution of cells sensitive to ischemia corresponds closely with that of N-methyld-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (except for cerebellar Purkinje cells, which are vulnerable to hypoxia-ischemia but lack NMDA receptors); and competitive and noncompetitive NMDA antagonists are effective in preventing focal ischemia. In global cerebral ischemia, non-NMDA receptors (kainic acid and \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate [AMPA]) are activated, and"

            "content": "Neuroprotection is the concept of providing a treatment that prolongs the brain\u2019s tolerance to ischemia. Drugs that block the excitatory amino acid pathways have been shown to protect neurons and glia in animals, but despite multiple human trials, they have not yet been proven to be beneficial. Hypothermia is a powerful neuroprotective treatment in patients with cardiac arrest (Chap. 330) and is neuroprotective in animal models of stroke, but it has not been adequately studied in patients with ischemic stroke and is associated with an increase in pneumonia rates that could adversely impact stroke outcomes."

A number of medical and surgical interventions, as well as lifestyle modifications, are available for preventing stroke. Some of these can be widely applied because of their low cost and minimal risk; others are expensive and carry substantial risk but may be valuable for selected high-risk patients. Identification and control of modifiable risk factors, and especially hypertension, is the best strategy to reduce the burden of stroke, and the total number of strokes could be reduced substantially by these means (Table 446-4)."
