TET proteins are a family of enzymes that play a crucial role in DNA demethylation and are involved in various cellular processes, including immune responses. However, there is no direct mention of TET proteins in the provided documents related to iNKT cells. The documents mainly discuss the development, function, and characteristics of iNKT cells, but do not specifically mention TET proteins. Nevertheless, we can consider the broader context of immune responses and epigenetic regulation to make an educated guess. Some research has shown that TET proteins can influence the expression of immune-related genes, but this is not directly related to iNKT cells. Given the lack of direct information, the answer is not explicitly stated in the provided documents. However, based on the general knowledge of immune biology, we can consider the possibility that TET proteins might have an indirect role in iNKT cell fate, but this is speculative and not supported by the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Natural killer (NK) cells have been known the longest, but in the past several years other distinct groups of such cells have been identified. Collectively, these are now called innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and include NK cells (Fig. 3.37).

Expression of the transcription factor Id2 (inhibitor of DNA binding 2) in the CLP represses Band T-cell fates, and is required for the development of all ILCs.

Thus, Treg cells are involved in limiting the immune response and preventing autoimmunity. Two main subsets of regulatory T cells are currently recognized. One subset becomes committed to a regulatory fate while still in the thymus, and is known as natural, or thymically derived, T cells (nT and tT , respectively; see Section 8-26). The other subset of T cells differenti ates from naive CD4 T cells in the periphery under the influence of particular environmental conditions.

Discovered as a T cell growth factor, IL-2 also promotes CD8+ T cell and natural killer cell cytolytic activity and modulates T cell differentiation pro-grams in response to antigen. Thus, IL-2 promotes naive CD4+ T cell differentiation into T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 (Th2) cells while inhibiting T helper 17 (Th17) and T follicular helper (Tfh) cell differentiation. Moreover, IL-2 is essential for the development and maintenance of T regulatory (Treg) cells and for activation-induced cell death, thereby mediating tolerance and limiting inappropriate immune reactions.

Although \u03b3:\u03b4 T cells arise from the same progenitors as \u03b1:\u03b2 T cells, most mature \u03b3:\u03b4 T cells are components of the innate rather than the adaptive immune system. When their maturation in the thymus is complete, the cells have acquired a defined effector function that can be rapidly elicited following their activation. After emigration from the thymus, most \u03b3:\u03b4T cells home to mucosal and epithelial sites in the body, and take up stable residence in these locations."

The ILC subgroups identified so far appear to be highly parallel in structure to the subsets of effector CD8 and CD4 T cells that were defined over the last three decades. The transcription factors that control the development of different ILC subsets seem, for now at least, to be the same as those that control the corresponding T-cell subsets. Because of these similarities, we will postpone a detailed description of ILC development until Chapter 9, where we will cover this topic along with the development of T-cell subsets. 3-24 NK cells are activated by type I interferon and macrophage-derived cytokines."

These findings suggest that these invariant and unconventional T cells operate somewhere between innate and adaptive immunity. In this part of the chapter, we will discuss the ligands they recognize and what is known about how they are generated or expressed."

When a na\u00efve or memory T or B cell is activated by antigen and co-stimulatory signals, how does it decide whether to become an effector cell or memory cell? Are there cells that are pre-committed to becoming either effector or memory cells, for example, or is the decision determined solely by extracellular signals? Why do some of us make Ige antibodies against harmless antigens and thereby develop hay fever and allergic asthma, while most of us do not, and why is the proportion of such allergic individuals increasing? how does a cytotoxic T cell (or NK cell) avoid being killed by the perforin and granzymes that it secretes to kill a target cell?"
