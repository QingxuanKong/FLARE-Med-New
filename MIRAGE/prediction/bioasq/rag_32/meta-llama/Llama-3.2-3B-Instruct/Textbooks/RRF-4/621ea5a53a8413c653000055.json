According to document [0], CYP hydroxylases (CYP3A, 4A, 4F) convert arachidonic acid to 20-HETE. Additionally, document [2] states that the CYP epoxygenase (2J, 2C) facilitates the generation of hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) from arachidonic acid. Furthermore, document [12] mentions that the 5-LOX converts arachidonic acid to 5-hydroperoxy-6,8,11,14 eicosatetraenoic acid ([5-HPETE], which is then converted to EETs. Therefore, it can be concluded that EETs are indeed synthesized by cytochrome P450 epoxygenases from arachidonic acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The products are 20-HETE, generated by the CYP hydroxylases (CYP3A, 4A, 4F) and the 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which arise from the CYP epoxygenase (2J, 2C). Their biosynthesis can be altered by pharmacologic, nutritional, and genetic factors that affect P450 expression. The biologic actions of the EETs are reduced by their conversion to the corresponding, and biologically less active, dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) through the action of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Unlike the prostaglandins, the EETs can be esterified into phospholipids, which then act as storage sites. Intracellular fatty acid-binding proteins promote EET uptake into cells, incorporation into phospholipids, and availability to sEH.

Among factors determining the type of eicosanoid synthesized are (1) the substrate lipid species, (2) the cell type, and (3) the cell stimulus. Distinct but related products can be formed from precursors other than AA.

The first double bond in AA occurs at 6 carbons from the methyl end, defining AA as an omega-6 fatty acid.

COX metabolism of eicosapentaenoic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) yields TXA3, which is relatively inactive. 3-Series prostaglandins, such as prostaglandin E3 (PGE3), can also act as partial agonists or antagonists, thereby having reduced activity in comparison to their AA-derived 2-series counterparts. The hypothesis that dietary eicosapentaenoate (omega-3 fatty acid) substitution for arachidonate could reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease and cancer is an area of intense study."

Arachidonic acid is referred to as an \u03c9-6 fatty acid because the terminal double bond is six bonds from the \u03c9 end (Fig. 16.5A). [Note: The equivalent designation of n-6 may also be used (Fig. 16.5B).] Another \u03c9-6 fatty acid is the essential linoleic acid 18:2(9,12). In contrast, \u03b1-linolenic acid, 18:3(9,12,15), is an essential \u03c9-3 fatty acid."

This pathway is of great interest because it is associated with asthma, anaphylactic shock, and cardiovascular disease. Stimulation of these cells elevates intracellular Ca2+ and releases FIGURE 18\u20132 Prostanoid biosynthesis. Compound names are enclosed in boxes."

NSAID inhibit cyclooxygenase but not lipoxygenase, so any arachidonic acid available is used for the synthesis of bronchoconstricting leukotrienes. NSAID have no effect on the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator protein, defects in which are the cause of CF. Steroids, not NSAID, inhibit phospholipase A2.

Statins inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, thereby preventing the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent reduction of HMG CoA to mevalonate and decreasing cholesterol biosynthesis (see figure below).
