Because KIT and PDGFR-\u03b1 remain drivers of GIST after resistance to imatinib and sunitinib, a multicenter, single-stage phase 2 trial examined regorafenib in patients with advanced GIST after failure of at least imatinib and sunitinib.221 Thirty-four patients were enrolled from February to December 2010 and given regorafenib orally, 160 mg daily, on days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle. Clinical benefit was noted in 79% of patients with a median progression-free survival of 10 months. This trial was then followed by a phase 3, international, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of regorafenib for metastatic GIST after failure of imatinib and sunitinib.222 Patients with"

The histologic grade of glioblastoma may vary from site to site within a tumor and it is common for sites of low-grade astrocytoma and glioblastoma to coexist; in some high-grade tumors there are even sites of well-differentiated astrocytoma. This relates to a problem that arises in interpreting single small biopsy samples taken for diagnosis. It is a fair statement that the most aggressive component determines the tumor\u2019s behavior."
