            "content": "Codeine is biotransformed by CYP2D6 to the potent active metabolite morphine, so its effects are blunted in PMs and exaggerated in ultra-rapid metabolizers. In the case of drugs with beta-blocking properties metabolized by CYP2D6, greater signs of beta blockade (e.g., bronchospasm, bradycardia) are seen in PM subjects than in EMs. This can be seen not only with orally administered beta blockers such as metoprolol and carvedilol, but also with ophthalmic timolol and with the sodium channel\u2013blocking antiarrhythmic propafenone, a CYP2D6 substrate with beta-blocking properties. Ultra-rapid metabolizers may require very high dosages of tricyclic antidepressants to achieve a therapeutic effect and, with codeine, may display transient euphoria and nausea due to very rapid generation of morphine. Tamoxifen undergoes CYP2D6-mediated biotransformation to an active metabolite, so its efficacy may be in part related to this polymorphism. In addition, the widespread use of selective serotonin"

Combination of a known CYP2D6 inhibitor and a TCA in a patient who is a slow metabolizer may result in markedly increased effects. Such an interaction has been implicated, though rarely, in cases of TCA toxicity.

Citalopram, sertraline, and fluvoxamine are only weak inhibitors of CYP2D6, but fluvoxamine inhibits CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 and thus can inhibit the metabolism of antidepressants metabolized by these enzymes. Sympathomimetics: [P] Increased pressor response to norepinephrine, epinephrine, and phenylephrine. Terbinafine: [P] Decreased antidepressant metabolism. Antivirals: [P] Decreased metabolism of amprenavir, atazanavir, boceprevir, daclatasvir, darunavir, delavirdine, etravirine, fosamprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, maraviroc, nelfinavir, rilpivirine, ritonavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir."

Thus, PMs of mephenytoin show signs of profound sedation and ataxia after doses of the drug that are well tolerated by normal metabolizers. Two defective CYP2C19 variant alleles (CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3), the latter predominant in Asians, are largely responsible for the PM genotype. The molecular bases include splicing defects resulting in a truncated, nonfunctional protein. CYP2C19 is responsible for the metabolism of various clinically relevant drugs (Table 4\u20134). Thus, it is clinically important to recognize that the safety of each of these drugs may be severely reduced in persons with the PM phenotype. On the other hand, the PM phenotype can notably increase the therapeutic efficacy of omeprazole, a proton-pump inhibitor, in gastric ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux diseases (see Chapter 5 for additional discussion of the CYP2C19 polymorphism)."

            "content": "Cimetidine interferes with several important hepatic cytochrome P450 drug metabolism pathways, including those catalyzed by CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 (see Chapter 4). Hence, the half-lives of drugs metabolized by these pathways may be prolonged. Ranitidine binds 4\u201310 times less avidly than cimetidine to cytochrome P450. Negligible CYP interaction occurs with nizatidine and famotidine. H2 antagonists compete with creatinine and certain drugs (eg, procainamide) for renal tubular secretion. All of these agents except famotidine inhibit gastric first-pass metabolism of ethanol, especially in women. Although the importance of this is debated, increased bioavailability of ethanol could lead to increased blood ethanol levels. Since their introduction in the late 1980s, these efficacious acid inhibitory agents have assumed the major role for the treatment of acid-peptic disorders. PPIs are now among the most widely prescribed drugs worldwide."

The genes encoding the CYP-dependent oxidative steps are polymorphic, and carriers of specific alleles of the CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 loci have increased platelet aggregability. Increased platelet activity has also been specifically associated with the CYP2C19*2 allele, which causes loss of platelet function in select patients. Because these are common genetic variants, this observation has been shown to be clinically relevant in large studies. In summary, although the loss-of-function polymorphisms in CYP2C19 is the strongest individual variable affecting pharmacokinetics and antiplatelet response to clopidogrel, it only"

As a result, most are dosed once daily at night because of their sedating effects. TCAs undergo extensive metabolism via demethylation, aromatic hydroxylation, and glucuronide conjugation. Only about 5% of TCAs are excreted unchanged in the urine. The TCAs are substrates of the CYP2D6 system, and the serum levels of these agents tend to be substantially influenced by concurrent administration of drugs such as fluoxetine. In addition, genetic polymorphism for CYP2D6 may result in low or extensive metabolism of the TCAs. The secondary amine TCAs, including desipramine and nortriptyline, lack active metabolites and have fairly linear kinetics. These TCAs have a wide therapeutic window, and serum levels are reliable in predicting response and toxicity. C. 5-HT Receptor Modulators"

In contrast, fluvoxamine is an inhibitor of CYP3A4, whereas citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline have more modest CYP interactions. B. Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors 1. Selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors\u2014Venlafaxine is extensively metabolized in the liver via the CYP2D6 isoenzyme to O-desmethylvenlafaxine (desvenlafaxine). Both have similar half-lives of about 8\u201311 hours. Despite the relatively short half-lives, both drugs are available in formulations that allow once-daily dosing. Venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine have the lowest protein binding of all antidepressants (27\u201330%). Unlike most antidepressants, desvenlafaxine is conjugated and does not undergo extensive oxidative metabolism. At least 45% of desvenlafaxine is excreted unchanged in the urine compared with 4\u20138% of venlafaxine."
