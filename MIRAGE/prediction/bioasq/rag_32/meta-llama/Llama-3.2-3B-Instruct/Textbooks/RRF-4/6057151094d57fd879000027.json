    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if there are antimicrobial proteins in royal jelly, we need to consider the sources of antimicrobial proteins and their characteristics. Antimicrobial proteins are produced by epithelial cells and phagocytes, and they can be categorized into different classes such as defensins, cathelicidins, and histatins. These proteins are typically produced in response to an infection or as part of a constitutive defense mechanism. Royal jelly is a substance produced by honeybees to feed their larvae, and it is not directly related to human physiology or immunology. However, considering the general context of antimicrobial proteins, we can look for any information that might link royal jelly to antimicrobial activity. According to the provided documents, antimicrobial peptides are produced by epithelial cells and phagocytes, and they are not specifically mentioned in the context of royal jelly. Therefore, we can conclude that there is no information available in the provided documents that suggests the presence of antimicrobial proteins in royal jelly. Hence, the answer is likely no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Mucus is also slippery in nature, meaning that trapped materials can then be expelled easily by normal peristaltic movements. In the intestine, there are two layers of mucus, an outer loose layer and a much denser inner layer, found mostly in the large intestine. Although bacteria can penetrate the loose layer of mucus, they are normally kept away from the surface of the epithelial cells by the inner dense layer, and defects in this structure compromise antimicrobial defense.

The proteases of the complement system are synthesized as inactive pro-enzymes, or zymogens, which become enzymatically active only after proteolytic cleavage, usually by another complement protein. The complement pathways are triggered by proteins that act as pattern recognition receptors to detect the presence of pathogens. This detection activates an initial zymogen, triggering a cascade of proteolysis in which complement zymogens are activated sequentially, each becoming an active protease that cleaves and activates many molecules of the next zymogen in the pathway, amplifying the signal as the cascade proceeds.

The mammalian immune response to invading organisms proceeds in three phases, beginning with immediate innate defenses, then the induced innate defenses, and finally adaptive immunity. The first phase of host defense consists of those mechanisms that are present and ready to resist an invader at any time. Epithelial surfaces provide a physical barrier against pathogen entry, but they also have other more specialized strategies. Mucosal surfaces have a protective barrier of mucus. Through particular cell-surface interactions, highly differentiated epithelia protect against both microbial colonization and invasion. Defense mechanisms of epithelia include the prevention of pathogen adherence, secretion of antimicrobial enzymes and bactericidal peptides, and the flow caused by the actions of cilia. Antimicrobial peptides and the bactericidal lectins of the RegIII family are made as inactive proproteins that require"

            "content": "The epithelial cells that line internal organs such as the respiratory and digestive tracts also secrete slimy mucus, which sticks to the epithelial surface and makes it difficult for pathogens to adhere. The beating of cilia on the surface of the epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract and the peristaltic action of the intestine also discourage the adherence of pathogens. Moreover, as we discuss in Chapter 23, healthy skin and gut are populated by enormous numbers of harmless (and often helpful) commensal microbes, collectively called the normal flora, which compete for nutrients with pathogens; some also produce antimicrobial peptides that actively inhibit pathogen proliferation. pattern recognition receptors (prrs) recognize conserved Features of pathogens"

Second, various chemical and enzymatic systems, including complement, act as an immediate antimicrobial barrier near these epithelia. If epithelia are breached, nearby various innate lymphoid cells can coordinate a rapid cell-mediated defense. If the pathogen overcomes these barriers, the slower-acting defenses of the adaptive immune system are brought to bear. Target tissues Production of antimicrobial proteins Induction of intracellular antiviral proteins Killing of infected cells Mediators Cytokines, cytotoxicity In\u02dcammatory inducers Bacterial lipopolysaccharides, ATP, urate crystals Sensor cells Macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells Fig. 1.6 Cell-mediated immunity proceeds in a series of steps."
