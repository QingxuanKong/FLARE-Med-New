    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to look for information about MK-1602 in the provided documents. Unfortunately, none of the documents mention MK-1602 explicitly. However, we can try to infer its potential relationship to CGRP antagonists by looking at the information about CGRP antagonists in the documents. According to Document [8], telcagepant and olcegepant are CGRP antagonists. Document [6] mentions NEUROTENSIN ANTAGONISTS and CALCITONIN GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE ANTAGONISTS, but does not specifically mention MK-1602. However, Document [6] does mention that MK-0557 is a selective antagonist of the Y5 receptor, which is a different class of receptors from CGRP receptors. Despite the lack of explicit mention of MK-1602, we can infer that it may not be a CGRP antagonist based on the information provided.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

            "content": "Peptide and nonpeptide antagonists of the CGRP receptor have been developed. CGRP8-37 has been used extensively to investigate the actions of CGRP but displays affinity for other related receptors including those for adrenomedullin (see below). Nonpeptide CGRP receptor antagonists target the interface between CLR and RAMP1 and thereby make them more selective for the CGRP receptor. Examples are olcegepant and telcagepant. Evidence is accumulating that release of CGRP from trigeminal nerves plays a central role in the pathophysiology of migraine. The peptide is released during migraine attacks, and successful treatment of migraine with a selective serotonin agonist normalizes cranial CGRP levels. Clinical trials showed olcegepant to be effective in treating migraine, but because of its low bioavailability, it has to be administered by intravenous injection. Telcagepant is also effective and is orally active but has exhibited liver toxicity in a small number of patients."

            "content": "When CGRP is injected into the central nervous system, it produces a variety of effects, including hypertension and suppression of feeding. When injected into the systemic circulation, the peptide causes hypotension and tachycardia. The hypotensive action of CGRP results from the potent vasodilator action of the peptide; indeed, CGRP is the most potent vasodilator yet discovered. It dilates multiple vascular beds, but the coronary circulation is particularly sensitive. The vasodilation is mediated via a nonendothelial mechanism through activation of adenylyl cyclase. The actions of CGRP are mediated via a single receptor type. This heterodimeric receptor consists of the G protein-coupled calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) combined with the receptor activity-modifying protein RAMP1."

            "content": "If, in an individual attack, all of the foregoing measures fail, it may be reasonable to resort briefly to narcotics, which usually give the patient a restful, pain-free sleep. Halfway measures at this point are usually futile. However, the use of narcotics as the mainstay of acute or prophylactic therapy is to be avoided. As mentioned above, if the pain does not abate in 12 to 24 h, corticosteroids in any of several regimens may be added and continued for several days. Based on the action of certain peptides in the trigeminovascular complex, novel antagonists of CGRP have been investigated, and while symptomatically equivalent to triptans (Olesen and colleagues and also Ho et al), they have been largely abandoned because of liver toxicity with frequent use. Drugs of this type as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitors and receptor blockers that work by a different mechanism than do the serotonin agonists may be alternatives in the future."

Two different mRNA molecules are transcribed from the \u03b1 gene; one is translated into the precursor for calcitonin, and the other message is translated into an alternative product, CGRP. CGRP is synthesized wherever the calcitonin mRNA is expressed (e.g., in medullary carcinoma of the thyroid). The \u03b2, or CGRP-2, gene is transcribed into the mRNA for CGRP in the central nervous system (CNS); this gene does not produce calcitonin, however.

The hypotension in turn causes reflex increases in heart rate and cardiac output. These responses also occur during intravenous infusion of the peptide in healthy human subjects. AM also acts on the kidneys to increase sodium excretion and renin release, and it exerts other endocrine effects including inhibition of aldosterone and insulin secretion. It acts on the central nervous system to increase sympathetic outflow. The diverse actions of AM are mediated by a receptor closely related to the CGRP receptor (see above). CLR co-assembles with RAMP subtypes 2 and 3, thus forming the AM receptor. Binding of AM to CLR activates Gs and triggers cAMP formation in vascular smooth muscle cells, and increases nitric oxide production in endothelial cells. Other signaling pathways are also involved."

Phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine are noncompetitive inhibitors of the NMDA receptor that exacerbate both cognitive impairment and psychosis in patients with schizophrenia. PCP and a related drug, MK-801, increase locomotor activity and, acutely or chronically, a variety of cognitive impairments in rodents and primates. These effects are widely employed as a means to develop novel antipsychotic and cognitive-enhancing drugs. Selective 5-HT2A antagonists, as well as atypical antipsychotic drugs, are much more potent than D2 antagonists in blocking these effects of PCP and MK-801. This was the starting point for the hypothesis that hypofunction of NMDA receptors, located on GABAergic interneurons, leading to diminished inhibitory influences on neuronal function, contributed to schizophrenia.

In humans, CGRP exists in two forms termed \u03b1-CGRP and \u03b2-CGRP, which are derived from separate genes and differ by three amino acids but exhibit similar biological activity. Like calcitonin, CGRP is present in large quantities in the C cells of the thyroid gland. It is also distributed widely in the central and peripheral nervous systems, cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and gastrointestinal tract. In the cardiovascular system, CGRP-containing neuronal fibers are more abundant around arteries than around veins and in atria than in ventricles.

The interactions, however, are not simply a one-to-one synergism or antagonism at a particular synapse because of the differing temporal and spatial profiles of the action of peptides versus classic transmitters.

            "content": "The hypocalcemic activity of calcitonin is accounted for primarily by inhibition of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and secondarily by stimulation of renal calcium clearance. These effects are mediated by receptors on osteoclasts and renal tubular cells. Calcitonin exerts additional effects through receptors present in the brain, the gastrointestinal tract, and the immune system. The hormone, for example, exerts analgesic effects directly on cells in the hypothalamus and related structures, possibly by interacting with receptors for related peptide hormones such as calcitonin gene\u2013related peptide (CGRP) or amylin. Both of these ligands have specific high-affinity receptors that share considerable structural similarity with the PTH1R and can also bind to and activate calcitonin receptors. The calcitonin receptor shares considerable structural similarity with the PTH1R."

The importance of this cellular influx is shown by the ability of glucocorticoid medications to block the late-phase response through their inhibition of cell recruitment, whereas glucocorticoids do not block the immediate response. A late-phase reaction can also occur after aerosol exposure to allergen, and is characterized by a second phase of airway narrowing with sustained edema and cellular infiltration into the peribronchial spaces (see Fig. 14.11, left panel)."

            "content": "CHAPTER 7 The Somatosensory System transduction proteins leads to a generator potential that causes spiking of the afferent, which transmits information to the CNS. In addition, activation of nociceptors also leads to local release of various chemical compounds, including tachykinins (substance P [SP]) and calcitonin gene\u2013related protein (CGRP). These substances and others released from the damaged cells cause neurogenic inflammation (edema and redness of the surrounding skin)."

            "content": "Although there are no known harmful effects on the fetus, H2 antagonists cross the placenta. Therefore, they should not be administered to pregnant women unless absolutely necessary. The H2 antagonists are secreted into breast milk and may therefore affect nursing infants. H2 antagonists may rarely cause blood dyscrasias. Blockade of cardiac H2 receptors may cause bradycardia, but this is rarely of clinical significance. Rapid intravenous infusion may cause Drugs Used in the Treatment of Gastrointestinal Diseases 1091 bradycardia and hypotension through blockade of cardiac H2 receptors; therefore, intravenous infusions should be given over 30 minutes. H2 antagonists rarely cause reversible abnormalities in liver chemistry."

            "content": "An alternative, but not necessarily exclusive hypothesis links the aura and the painful phase of migraine through a neural mechanism originating in the trigeminal nerve as proposed by Moskowitz. This is based on the innervation of extracranial and intracranial vessels by small unmyelinated fibers of the trigeminal nerve that subserve both pain and autonomic functions (the \u201ctrigeminovascular\u201d complex). This model provides an explanation for migraine pain as originating in the trigeminal ganglion. Activation of these fibers releases substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and other peptides into the vessel wall, which serves to sensitize the trigeminal system to the pulsatility of cranial vessels, and to increase their permeability, thereby promoting an inflammatory response. The small molecules released from nerve endings adjacent to the cortex would then incite spreading depression in this model. Against this hypothesis is the occurrence of headache as often as not on the"
