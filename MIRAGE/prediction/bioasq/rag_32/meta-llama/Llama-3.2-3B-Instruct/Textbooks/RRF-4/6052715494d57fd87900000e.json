Fingolimod is mentioned in Document [0] (Immunology_Janeway) as a sphingosine 1-phosphate analog that inhibits immune responses by preventing lymphocytes from returning to the circulation, thereby sequestering them in lymphoid tissues. It is also mentioned in Document [1] (Immunology_Janeway) as a drug that manipulates immune responses by regulating the migration of immune effector cells to the sites of a graft or of autoimmune disease. However, the question is whether FTY720 is FDA approved. According to Document [3] (Pharmacology_Katzung), Fingolimod (FTY720) was approved by the FDA in 2010 for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.

FTY720 inhibits immune responses by preventing lymphocytes from returning to the circulation, thereby sequestering them in lymphoid tissues and causing rapid onset of lymphopenia (a lack of lymphocytes in the blood). In vivo, FTY720 becomes phosphorylated and mimics S1P as an agonist at S1P receptors. Phosphorylated FTY720 may inhibit lymphocyte exit by effects on endothelial cells that increase tight junction formation and close exit portals, or by chronic activation of S1P receptors, leading to inactivation and downregulation of the receptor. 9-8 T-cell responses are initiated in secondary lymphoid organs by activated dendritic cells."

In Section 9-7, we described how emigration of lymphocytes out of the lymphoid tissues requires recognition of the lipid molecule sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) by the G-protein-coupled receptor S1PR1. Fingolimod (FTY720), a sphingosine 1-phosphate analog, is a relatively newer drug that causes the retention of effector lymphocytes in lymphoid organs, thus preventing these cells from mediating their effector activities in target tissues. Fingolimod was approved in 2010 for treatment of the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis, and has shown promise in the treatment of kidney graft rejection and asthma."

Use of pharmaceutical industry funding to support FDA approval processes raises the possibility of conflicts of interest within the FDA. Supporters of this policy point out that chronic FDA underfunding by the government allows for few alternatives. Another important source of conflicts of interest is the dependence of the FDA on outside panels of experts who are recruited from the scientific and clinical community to advise the government agency on questions regarding drug approval or withdrawal. Such experts are often recipients of grants from the companies producing the drugs in question. The need for favorable data in the new drug application leads to phase 2 and 3 trials in which the new agent is compared only to placebo, not to older, effective drugs.
