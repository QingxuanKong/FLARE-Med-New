    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the relevant information provided in the documents. According to Document [3] (Title: Pathology_Robbins), Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can be transmitted to the infant through cervical or vaginal secretions at birth, or later through the breast milk of a mother with an active infection (perinatal CMV infection). Similarly, Document [10] (Title: Obstentrics_Williams) states that breast milk contains IgA, which provides passive immunity for the infant and protects against enteric bacteria. Document [1] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) mentions that HIV can be transmitted to infants through breast milk. Document [5] (Title: Immunology_Janeway) also states that HIV is transmitted through the exchange of contaminated needles or blood products, but not through casual contact or saliva. Document [18] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) notes that secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) blocks HIV infection in several cell culture systems and is found in saliva, but there is no evidence of HIV transmission through saliva. Document [20] (Title: Obstentrics_Williams) does not mention SARS-CoV-2 transmission through breast milk. Document [27] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) also does not mention SARS-CoV-2. However, Document [25] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) states that SARS-CoV, the precursor to SARS-CoV-2, can be transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact with infected secretions. Given the close relationship between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 is also transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact with infected secretions. However, the specific question of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through breast milk is not directly addressed in the documents. However, considering the close relationship between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and the fact that SARS-CoV was transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact with infected secretions, it is reasonable to infer that SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted through breast milk, although this is not explicitly stated in the documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

The outbreak apparently began in southern China and eventually resulted in 8096 recognized cases in 28 countries in Asia, Europe, and North and South America; ~90% of cases occurred in China and Hong Kong. The natural reservoir of SARS-CoV appeared to be the horseshoe bat, and the outbreak may have originated from human contact with infected semidomesticated animals such as the palm civet. In most cases, however, the infection was transmitted from human to human. Case\u2013fatality rates varied among outbreaks, with an overall figure of ~9.5%. The disease appeared to be somewhat milder in cases in the United States and was clearly less severe among children. The outbreak ceased in 2003; 17 cases were detected in 2004, mostly in laboratory-associated settings, and no cases have been reported subsequently."

Infection with HIV occurs after the transfer of body fluids from an infected person to an uninfected one. HIV infection is most commonly spread by sexual intercourse. Transmission by the exchange of contaminated needles used for intravenous drug delivery or by the therapeutic use of infected blood or blood products also occurs, although the latter route of transmission has largely been eliminated in countries where blood products are routinely screened for HIV. An important route of virus transmission is from an infected mother to child, which can occur in utero, during birth, or through breast milk. Rates of transmission from an untreated infected mother to her child vary (from about 15% to 45%), depending on the viral load in the mother and whether the mother breastfeeds the child, as breastfeeding increases the risk of transmission."

In this regard, higher salivary levels of SLPI in breast-fed infants were associated with a decreased risk of HIV transmission through breast milk. It has also been suggested that submandibular saliva reduces HIV infectivity by stripping gp120 from the surface of virions, and that saliva-mediated disruption and lysis of HIV-infected cells occurs because of the hypotonicity of oral secretions. There have been outlier cases of suspected transmission by saliva, but these have probably been blood-to-blood transmissions. Transmission of HIV by a human bite can occur but is a rare event.

It also has more protein, much of which is globulin, but less sugar and fat. Secretion persists for 5 days to 2 weeks, with gradual conversion from \"transitional\" to mature milk by 4 to 6 weeks. The colostrum content of immunoglobulin A (IgA) ofers the newborn protection against enteric pathogens. Other host resistance factors found in colostrum and milk include complement, macrophages, lymphocytes, lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase, and lysozymes."

It rapidly spread throughout Asia, Europe, and North and South America. he case-fatality rate approached 10 percent in the nonpregnant population and was as high as 25 percent in pregnant women (Lam, 2004; Wong, 2004). Although no addi tional cases have been conirmed since 2004, the CDC (2013b) now lists SARS-Co V as a \"select agent\" that has the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety. Another novel regional coronavirus with a high case-fatality coronavirus eMERS-Co ) (Arabi, 2017). Although experience with MERS-Co V is sparse in pregnancy, infection has been reported to cause maternal and perinatal deaths (Assiri, 2016). A member of the RNA Filoviridae family, the Ebola virus is transmitted by direct person-to-person contact (Kuhn, 2015)."

For SARS, basic infection-control measures helped to keep the worldwide case and death counts at ~8000 and ~800, respectively, although the virus was unforgiving of lapses in protocol adherence or laboratory biosafety. The epidemiology of SARS\u2014spread largely in households once patients were ill or in hospitals\u2014contrasts markedly with that of influenza (Chap. 224), which is often contagious a day before symptom onset; can spread rapidly in the community among nonimmune persons; and, even in its seasonal variety, kills as many as 35,000 persons each year in the United States."
