    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what PRP-40 regulation of microexons is and how it relates to conservation across different species. PRP-40, also known as PRP or prion protein, is a protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including protein folding and aggregation. Microexons are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences and modulating transcription. The question asks whether the regulation of microexons by PRP-40 is a conserved phenomenon, meaning it is present and functional across different species.\\n\\nTo answer this question, we need to look at the available documents and see if there is any evidence of PRP-40 regulation of microexons in different species.\\n\\nFrom Document [19], we know that microRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to specific mRNAs. While there is no direct mention of PRP-40 regulation of microexons, miRNAs are known to regulate gene expression, and it is possible that PRP-40 may interact with miRNAs to regulate microexons.\\n\\nFrom Document [28], we know that noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs, are widespread in the genome and play important roles in regulating gene expression. However, there is no specific mention of PRP-40 regulation of microexons.\\n\\nFrom Document [22], we know that microRNAs are conserved across different species and play important roles in regulating gene expression. However, there is no evidence of PRP-40 regulation of microexons in different species.\\n\\nFrom Document [31], we know that conserved regions in the genome include regulatory DNA sequences and DNA sequences with unknown functions. While there is no direct mention of PRP-40 regulation of microexons, it is possible that PRP-40 may interact with conserved regulatory sequences to regulate microexons.\\n\\nBased on the available information, it is difficult to say whether PRP-40 regulation of microexons is a conserved phenomenon across different species. However, it is possible that PRP-40 may interact with microRNAs or conserved regulatory sequences to regulate microexons in different species.\\n\\nTherefore, the most likely answer is B. no, PRP-40 regulation of microexons is not a conserved phenomenon across different species, but it may be present in some species.\\n\\nHowever, considering the information provided by Document [19] that miRNAs are conserved across different species and play a role in regulating gene expression, and Document [22] that microRNAs are conserved across different species and play a role in regulating gene expression, we can infer that PRP-40 regulation of microexons may be a conserved phenomenon across different species.\\n\\nHence, the answer is A. yes, PRP-40 regulation of microexons is a conserved phenomenon across different species.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

The amino acid sequence of PrP encodes the species of the prion, and the prion derives its PrPSc sequence from the last mammal in which it was passaged. While the primary structure of PrP is likely to be the most important or even sole determinant of the tertiary structure of PrPC, PrPSc seems to function as a template in determining the tertiary structure of nascent PrPSc molecules as they are formed from PrPC. In turn, prion diversity appears to be enciphered in the conformation of PrPSc, and thus prion strains seem to represent different conformers of PrPSc."

Conserved regulatory elements that originated early in vertebrate evolution\u2014that is, more than about 300 million years ago, which is when the mammalian lineage split from the lineage leading to birds and reptiles\u2014seem to be mostly associated with genes that code for transcription regulator proteins and for proteins with roles in organizing embryonic development. Then came an era when the regulatory DNA innovations arose next to genes coding for receptors for extracellular signals. Finally, over the course of the past 100 million years, the"

As discussed in this chapter, a maintenance methylase can propagate specific patterns of cytosine methylation (see figure 7\u201344). As discussed in Chapter 4, a histone modifying enzyme that replicates the same modification that attracts it to chromatin can result in the modification being self-propagating (see figure 4\u201344). (B) epigenetic mechanisms that act in trans. positive feedback loops, formed by transcriptional regulators are found in all species and are probably the most common form of cell memory. As discussed in Chapter 3, some proteins can form self-propagating prions (figure 3\u201333). if these proteins are involved in gene expression, they can transmit patterns of gene expression to daughter cells."

In addition to revealing those DNA sequences that encode functionally important exons and RNA molecules, these conserved regions will include regulatory DNA sequences as well as DNA sequences with functions that are not yet known. In contrast, most nonconserved regions will reflect DNA whose sequence is much less likely to be critical for function."
