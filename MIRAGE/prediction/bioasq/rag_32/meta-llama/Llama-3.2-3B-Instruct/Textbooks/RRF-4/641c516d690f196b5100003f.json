They may damage motor neurons through mechanisms of altered protein degradation. The SOD1 mutation, the first to be found in familial ALS, codes for the cytosolic enzyme Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1; Rosen et al); it has also been implicated in a small proportion of sporadic cases. There are yet other mutations in this group that have associations, not necessarily causal, with small numbers of both sporadic and inherited cases (Table 38-7). As already alluded to, all 3 of the aforementioned genes have also been implicated in degenerative frontotemporal dementia and in the combination of this dementia with ALS."

Linkage studies have detected loci at chromosomes 3q13 (ETM-1), 2p22-25 (ETM-2), and 6p23 (ETM-3), but no causative genes have been identified to date. GWAS demonstrated an association with the LINGO1 gene, which is involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, particularly in patients with young-onset ET. Recently, a nonsense mutation in the fused in sarcoma (FUS) gene was implicated as a cause of ET in a multigenerational family from Canada; this finding is of particular interest because different mutations in FUS are a known cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Chap. 452). It is likely that there are many other undiscovered genes for ET.

The genetic discovery in relation to this disease that opened a new chapter in understanding the disease was the discovery of the mutation in the superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene in familial cases of motor neuron disease.

Genetic studies have identified mutations in multiple genes, including those encoding the protein C9orf 72 (open reading frame 72 on chromosome 9), cytosolic enzyme SOD1 (superoxide dismutase), the RNA binding proteins TDP43 (encoded by the TAR DNA binding protein gene), and FUS/TLS (fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma), as the most common causes of FALS. Mutations in C9orf72 account for ~45\u201350% of FALS and perhaps 4\u20135% of sporadic ALS cases. Mutations in SOD1 explain another 20% of cases of FALS, whereas TDP43 and FUS/TLS each represent about 5% of familial cases. It has recently been reported that ~1\u20132% of cases are caused by mutations in genes encoding the proteins optineuron and profilin-1 as well."

Thus, one infrequently encounters otherwise typical ALS patients with a parkinsonian movement disorder or frontotemporal dementia, particularly in instances of C9orf72 mutations, which strongly suggests that the simultaneous occurrence of two disorders is a direct consequence of the gene mutation. As another example, prominent amyotrophy has been described as a dominantly inherited disorder in individuals with bizarre behavior and a movement disorder suggestive of parkinsonism; many such cases have now been ascribed to mutations that alter the expression of tau protein in brain (Chap. 448). In other cases, ALS develops simultaneously with a striking frontotemporal dementia. An ALS-like disorder has also been described in some individuals with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, associated with deposition of TDP43 and neurofibrillary tangles in motor neurons."

These genetic and molecular influences are summarized by Brown and Al-Chalabi. They are inherited mainly in an autosomal dominant pattern (Table 38-6). Of these forms with a known family history, approximately 40 percent are associated with a hexanucleotide expansion in the C9orf 72 gene. Provocatively, 5 to 10 percent of presumably sporadic cases also have mutations in the gene, however, these numbers are derived from studies that excluded nonmotor manifestations in family members, namely frontotemporal dementia; therefore, the number of sporadic cases of ALS explained by the mutation is probably less than the 5 to 10 percent given above. The mechanism of motor neuron death that results from this mutation is not known but may be associated with mishandling of RNA-binding proteins."

A striking additional finding in neurodegenerative disorders is that miscreant proteins arising from gene defects in familial forms of these diseases are often implicated in sporadic forms of the same disorder. For example, germline mutations in the genes encoding \u03b2-amyloid and \u03b1-synuclein cause familial forms of Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases, and posttranslational, noninherited abnormalities in these proteins are also central to sporadic Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases.

The most common cause of familial ALS is hexanucleotide repeat expansion in a gene with the rather cumbersome name C9orf72, which is also frequently expanded in frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The protein encoded by C9orf72 associates with RNA binding proteins; notably, two other genes that when mutated may cause ALS, TDP43 (also associated with FTLD) and FUS, encode RNA binding proteins. This convergence suggests that an abnormality of RNA processing directly or indirectly contributes to the pathogenesis of ALS, but it is uncertain how mutations in SOD1 fit into this picture, and much remains to be discovered. As expected from the genetic overlap, there is some clinical overlap between ALS and FTLD, such as cognitive impairment."

How mutations in FUS/TLS provoke motor neuron cell death is not clear, although this may represent loss of function of FUS/TLS in the nucleus or an acquired, toxic function of the mutant proteins in the cytosol. In the third group of ALS genes, the primary problem is defective axonal cytoskeleton and transport (dynactin, profilin-1). It is striking that variants in other genes (e.g., EphA4) influence survival in ALS but not ALS susceptibility. Beyond the upstream, primary defects, it is also evident that the ultimate neuronal cell death process is complex involving multiple cellular processes that accelerate cell death. These include but are not limited to excitotoxicity, impairment of axonal transport, oxidative stress, activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the unfolded protein response, and mitochondrial dysfunction."

            "content": "The cause of sporadic ALS is not well defined. Several mechanisms that impair motor neuron viability have been elucidated in mice and rats induced to develop motor neuron disease by SOD1 transgenes with ALS-associated mutations. One may loosely group the genetic causes of ALS into three categories. In one group, the primarily problem is inherent instability of the mutant proteins, with subsequent perturbations in protein degradation (SOD1, ubiquilin-1 and -2, p62). In the second, most rapidly growing category, the causative mutant genes perturb RNA processing, transport, and metabolism (C9orf73, TDP43, FUS). In the case of C9orf72, the molecular pathology is an expansion of an intronic hexanucleotide repeat (-GGGGCC-) beyond an upper normal of 30 repeats to hundreds or more repeats. As observed in other intronic repeat disorders such as myotonic dystrophy (Chap. 462e) and spinocerebellar atrophy type 8 (Chap. 450), data suggest that the expanded intronic repeats generate expanded RNA"

            "content": "No treatment arrests the underlying pathologic process in ALS. The drug riluzole (100 mg/d) was approved for ALS because it produces a modest lengthening of survival. In one trial, the survival rate at 18 months with riluzole was similar to placebo at 15 months. The mechanism of this effect is not known with certainty; riluzole may reduce excitotoxicity by diminishing glutamate release. Riluzole is generally well tolerated; nausea, dizziness, weight loss, and elevated liver enzymes occur occasionally. Pathophysiologic studies of mutant SOD1\u2013related ALS in mice have disclosed diverse targets for therapy; consequently, multiple therapies are presently in clinical trials for ALS including experimental trials of small molecules, mesenchymal stem cells, and immunosuppression. Interventions such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) that diminish expression of mutant SOD1 protein prolong survival in transgenic ALS mice and rats and are also nearing trial now for SOD1-mediated ALS."
