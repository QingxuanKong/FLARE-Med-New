According to Document [1] (Title: Immunology_Janeway), Bcl-2 family members are induced by stimuli that promote cell survival, and MCL-1 is a member of this family. In Document [2] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison), it is mentioned that anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, including MCL-1, associate with the mitochondrial outer membrane via their carboxyl termini, exposing a hydrophobic binding pocket composed of Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains 1, 2, and 3 that is crucial for their activity. This suggests that MCL-1 has anti-apoptotic properties. Additionally, in Document [6] (Title: Pathology_Robbins), it is stated that upregulation of anti-apoptotic factors such as BCL2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1 can result in reduced egress of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which is a key step in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. This further supports the anti-apoptotic role of MCL-1. Therefore, based on the information provided, MCL-1 is indeed anti-apoptotic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Activation of this pathway leads to permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane and release of molecules, such as cytochrome c, that initiate apoptosis. The integrity of the mitochondrial outer membrane is determined by a delicate balancing act between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members of the BCL2 protein family. The pro-apoptotic proteins BAX and BAK are required for apoptosis and directly promote mitochondrial permeabilization. Their action is inhibited by the anti-apoptotic members of this family, which are exemplified by BCL2, BCL-XL, and MCL1. A third set of proteins, the so-called \u201cBH3-only proteins,\u201d which include BAD, BID, and PUMA, shift the balance between the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic family members by neutralizing the actions of anti-apoptotic proteins like BCL2 and BCL-XL, thereby promoting apoptosis.

The Bcl2 gene was first identified as an oncogene in a B-cell lymphoma, and its overexpression in tumors makes the cells more resistant to apoptotic stimuli and thus more likely to progress to an invasive cancer. Other members of the inhibitory family include Bcl-XL and Bcl-W. Anti-apoptotic proteins function by binding to the mitochondrial membrane to block the release of cytochrome c. The precise mechanism of inhibition is not clear, but they may function by directly blocking the function of the pro-apoptotic family members."

Once phosphorylated, Bad releases the inhibitory proteins, which now can block apoptosis and thereby promote cell survival. As shown, the phosphorylated Bad binds to a ubiquitous cytosolic protein called 14-3-3, which keeps Bad out of action."

Fragments of the apoptotic cells then break off, giving the appearance that is responsible for the name (apoptosis, \u201cfalling off\u201d). The plasma membrane of the apoptotic cell remains intact, but the membrane is altered in such a way that the fragments, called apoptotic bodies, become highly \u201cedible,\u201d leading to their rapid consumption by phagocytes. The dead cell and its fragments are cleared with little leakage of cellular contents, so apoptotic cell death does not elicit an inflammatory reaction. Thus, apoptosis differs in many respects from necrosis ( Table 2.1 Causes of Apoptosis Apoptosis occurs in many normal situations and serves to eliminate potentially harmful cells and cells that have http://ebooksmedicine.net"
