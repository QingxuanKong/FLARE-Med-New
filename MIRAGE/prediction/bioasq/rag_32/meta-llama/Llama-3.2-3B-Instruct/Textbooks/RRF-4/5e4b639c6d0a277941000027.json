Patient education about the benefits of smoking cessation, clear advice to quit smoking, and physician support improve smoking cessation rates, although 95% of smokers who successfully quit do so on their own. Self-help materials are available from the National Cancer Institute, and community-based support groups and local chapters of the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association. The combination of counseling and medication (nicotine and nonnicotine options) is more effective than either used alone, and Clinical Practice Guidelines on treating tobacco use and dependence from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services provide recommendations (48)."

Thus, all patients with COPD should be strongly urged to quit smoking and educated about the benefits of quitting. An emerging body of evidence demonstrates that combining phar macotherapy with traditional supportive approaches considerably enhances the chances of successful smoking cessation. There are three principal pharmacologic approaches to the problem: bupropion; nicotine replacement therapy available as gum, transdermal patch, lozenge, inhaler, and nasal spray; and varenicline, a nicotinic acid receptor agonist/antagonist. Current recommendations from the U.S. Surgeon General are that all adult, nonpregnant smokers considering quitting be offered pharmacotherapy, in the absence of any"

Advice from a physician to quit smoking, particularly at the time of an acute illness, is a powerful trigger for cessation attempts, with up to half of patients who are advised to quit making a cessation effort. Other triggers include the cost of cigarettes, media campaigns, and changes in rules to restrict smoking in the workplace."
