COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has several variants, including the Omicron variant. The severity of COVID-19 can vary depending on several factors, such as age, underlying health conditions, and the specific variant of the virus. However, there is no clear evidence to suggest that the Omicron variant is less severe than other variants of SARS-CoV-2. In fact, studies have shown that the Omicron variant can cause severe illness in some individuals, particularly those with underlying health conditions. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant is less severe than infection caused by other variants.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The viruses that are found within the first few months after HIV infection almost invariably use CCR5, which explains why individuals that carry a defective CCR5 gene are less susceptible to HIV infection. In the later stages of infection, viruses often either switch to use CXCR4 or adapt to use both co-receptors through the accumulation of mutations; in this way, the virus can change the cell types it infects as the disease progresses. It may seem paradoxical that viruses would infect immune cells, as we might expect that virus binding would trigger an immune response; but invasion of an immune cell can be a useful way for a virus to weaken the immune response and travel around the body to infect other immune cells."

            "content": "Approximately 1% of individuals of European ancestry are homozygous for the CCR5 \u039432 allele. Depending on the geographic region in Europe, up to 20% of individuals are heterozygous for the CCR5 \u039432 allele. The CCR5 \u039432 allele is either absent or extremely rare in other populations. The evolutionary pressure that resulted in the emergence of the CCR5 \u039432 allele in the European population remains unknown and has been speculated to be secondary to an ancestral pandemic such as the plague."
