According to Document [5] (Title: Obstentrics_Williams), breastfeeding can be used to alleviate the procedural pain in neonates. This is supported by Document [13] (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson), which states that breastfeeding can provide relief to the mother and make the areola easier to grasp by the infant. Additionally, Document [8] (Title: Obstentrics_Williams) mentions that vigorous crying in a newborn does not require routine oral suctioning, and instead, bulb suctioning is best reserved for those who cannot clear secretions on their own due to apnea or copious secretions. This suggests that breastfeeding can help alleviate pain and discomfort in neonates. Furthermore, Document [18] (Title: Obstentrics_Williams) highlights the benefits of breastfeeding, including its ability to provide pain relief to the newborn. Based on this information, it appears that breastfeeding can indeed be used to alleviate procedural pain in neonates.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

One PCA regimen uses intravenous morphine given as needed as a I-mg dose with a 6-minute lockout interval and maximum dose of 30 mg in 4 hours. An additional 2-mg booster dose is permitted for a maximum of 2 doses. Alternatively, intramuscular (1M) meperidine, 50 to 75 mg every 3 to 4 hours, or 1M morphine, 10 to 15 mg every 3 to 4 hours, is suitable. In a trial using these options, Yost and associates (2004) found that morphine provided superior pain relief to meperidine and was associated with significantly higher rates of breastfeeding and continuation of newborn rooming in. Breastfeeding can be ini tiated the day of surgery. If the mother elects not to breastfeed, a binder that supports the breasts without marked compression usually will minimize discomfort."

At minimum, intravenous luids are given, and opioids are administered promptly for severe pain. Oxygen via nasal cannula may decrease the intensity of sickling at the capillary level. We have found that red cell transfusions after the onset of severe pain do not dramatically improve pain intensity and may not shorten its duration. Conversely, as discussed later, prophylactic transfusions almost always prevent further vasoocclusive episodes and pain crises. Recent reports suggest benefits from epidural analgesia (Verstraete, 2012; Winder, 2011).

Untreated mastitis may also progress to a breast abscess. If an abscess is diagnosed, treatment includes incision and drainage, antibiotics, and regular emptying of the breast. Nursing from the contralateral breast can be continued with a healthy infant. If maternal comfort allows, nursing can continue on the affected side. Maternal infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is considered a contraindication for breastfeeding in developed countries. When the mother has active tuberculosis, syphilis, or varicella, restarting breastfeeding may be considered after therapy is initiated. If a woman has herpetic lesions on her breast, nursing and contact with the infant on that breast should be avoided. Women with genital herpes can breastfeed. Proper hand-washing procedures should be stressed."

For these, initial steps of warming the newborn can be done on the mother's chest or abdomen. Direct skin-to-skin contact with the mother and drying and covering the newborn with a warm blanket will help maintain euthermia (36.5 to 37.5\u00b0C). A vigorously crying newborn does not require routine oral suctioning (Carrasco, 1997; Gungor, 2006). Instead, bulb suctioning to remove secretions is best reserved for those who cannot clear secretions on their own due to apnea or copious secretions. Additional routine care steps include drying, gentle stimulation by rubbing the newborn's back, and continued observation during the transition period."

Fissured nipples render nursing painful, and they may have a deleterious influence on milk production. These cracks also provide a portal of entry for pyogenic bacteria. Because dried milk is likely to accumulate and irritate the nipples, washing the areola with water and mild soap is helpful before and ater nursing. When the nipples are irritated or fissured, some recommend topical lanolin and a nipple shield for 24 hours or longer. Although specific evidence supporting this practice is lacking, nipple pain usually subsides by 10 days (Dennis, 2014). If issuring is severe, the newborn should not be permitted to nurse on the afected side. Instead, the breast is emptied regularly with a pump until the lesions are healed. Poor latching of the neonate to the breast can create such issures. For example, the newborn may take into its mouth only the nipple, which is then is forced against the hard"

            "content": "The first 2 days of breastfeeding, and perhaps the first hour of life, may determine the success of breastfeeding. The current rate of breastfeeding initiation for the total U.S. population is 75% (Figure 27-1). There is greater emphasis to improve and standardize hospital practices with \u201cBaby Friendly\u201d programs for breastfeeding support. The Department of Health and Human Services and theCDC recognize that breastfeeding offers infants, mothers,and society compelling advantages in industrialized and developing countries. Human milk feeding decreases the incidence and severity of diarrhea, respiratory illnesses, otitis media, bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, and necrotizingenterocolitis. There are beneficial effects of feeding preterm infants with human milk on long-term neurodevelopment (IQ) in preterm infants. Preterm breastfed infants also have a lower readmission rate in the first year of life."

            "content": "Following uncomplicated vaginal delivery, hospitalization is seldom warranted for more than 48 hours. A woman should receive instructions concerning anticipated normal physiological puerperal changes, including lochia patterns, weight loss from diuresis, and milk let-down. She also should receive instructions concerning fever, excessive vaginal bleeding, or leg pain, swelling, or tenderness. Persistent headaches, shortness of breath, or chest pain warrant immediate concern. Hospital-stay length following labor and delivery is now regulated by federal law (Chap. 32, p. 616). Currently, the norms are hospital stays up to 48 hours following uncomplicated vaginal delivery and up to 96 hours following uncomplicated cesarean delivery (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2017; Blumenfield, 2015). Earlier hospital discharge is acceptable for appropriately selected women if they desire it ."

            "content": "N elson-Piercy and coworkers (201a1) assessed the safety of tinzaparin through a comprehensive study of 1267 treated pregnant women. There were no maternal deaths or complications from regional analgesia. Although thrombocytopenia developed in 1.8 percent, there were no cases of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (p. 1015). he allergy incidence was 1.3 percent. Osteoporotic fractures in three women (0.2 percent) were judged to be related to tinzaparin (p. 1015). A total of 43 women (3.4 percent) required medical intervention for bleeding. Of 15 stillbirths, four were judged as possibly being related to tinzaparin use. But, none of the neonatal deaths or congenital abnormalities was attributed to tinzaparin. The authors concluded that tinzaparin during pregnancy was safe for mother and fetus. LMWHs are also safe during breastfeeding (Lim, 2010)."
