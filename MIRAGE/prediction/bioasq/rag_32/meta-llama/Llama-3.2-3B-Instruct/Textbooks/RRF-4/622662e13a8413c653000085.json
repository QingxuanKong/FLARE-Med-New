    "question": "Can METTL3 methylate long noncoding RNAs?",
    "options": {
        "A": "yes",
        "B": "no"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Based on the provided documents, I'll analyze the information step by step to arrive at a conclusion. Step 1: Understanding the role of METTL3 METTL3 (methyltransferase-like 3) is an enzyme involved in the methylation of mRNAs, specifically at the 5' cap. It adds a 7-methylguanosine cap to the 5' end of mRNAs. Step 2: Understanding the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) lncRNAs are RNA molecules longer than 200 nucleotides that do not code for proteins. They can regulate gene expression and have various functions, including acting as scaffolds, guiding proteins to specific sequences, and influencing chromatin structure. Step 3: Examining the relationship between METTL3 and lncRNAs There is no direct information in the provided documents that explicitly states whether METTL3 can methylate lncRNAs. However, we know that METTL3 is involved in the methylation of mRNAs, and lncRNAs are also subject to methylation. Step 4: Considering the possibility of METTL3 acting on lncRNAs Given that lncRNAs are not translated into proteins and are often spliced and processed similarly to mRNAs, it is possible that METTL3 could methylate lncRNAs, although this is not explicitly stated in the documents. Step 5: Drawing a conclusion Based on the available information, it is not clear whether METTL3 can methylate lncRNAs. However, considering the similarity in processing and regulation between mRNAs and lncRNAs, it is plausible that METTL3 could methylate lncRNAs. Therefore, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Although there is no direct information stating that METTL3 can methylate lncRNAs, considering the similarity in processing and regulation between mRNAs and lncRNAs, it is plausible that METTL3 could methylate lncRNAs. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Although we have encountered noncoding RNAs in other chapters (tRNAs, rRNAs, snoRNAs, for example), the sheer number of noncoding RNAs produced by cells has surprised scientists. One well understood use of noncoding RNAs occurs in RNA interference, where guide RNAs (miRNAs, siRNAs, piRNAs) base-pair with mRNAs. RNA interference can cause mRNAs to be either destroyed or translationally repressed. It can also cause specific genes to be packaged into heterochromatin suppressing their transcription. In bacteria and archaebacteria, RNA interference is used as an adaptive immune response to destroy viruses that infect them.

As methods have improved for determining the nucleotide sequences of all the RNA molecules produced by a cell line or tissue, the sheer number of lncRNAs (an estimated 8000 for the human genome, for example) came as a surprise to scientists. Most lncRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II and have 5\u02b9 caps and poly-A tails, and, in many cases, they are spliced. It has been difficult to annotate lncRNAs because low levels of RNA are now known to be made from 75% of the human genome.

But it is uncertain how much of the conserved noncoding DNA can be accounted for in these ways, and the function of most of it remains a mystery.

MicroRNAs are short (average 22 nucleotides in length) RNA molecules that silence gene expression after transcription by binding and inhibiting the translation or promoting the degradation of mRNA transcripts. It is estimated that more than 1000 microRNAs are encoded in the human genome. Each tissue has a distinctive repertoire of microRNA expression, and this pattern is altered in specific ways in cancers. However, specific correlations between microRNA expression and tumor biology and clinical behavior are just now emerging. Therapies targeting microRNAs are not currently at hand but represent a novel area of treatment development. lncRNAs are longer than 200 nucleotides and compose the largest group of noncoding RNAs.

We discuss lncRNAs broadly at the end of this chapter; here, we focus on the role of a specific lncRNA in imprinting. In the case of the Kcnq1 gene, which codes for a voltage-gated calcium channel needed for proper heart function, the lncRNA is made from the paternal allele (which is unmethylated) but it is not released by the RNA polymerase, remaining instead at its site of synthesis on the DNA template. This RNA in turn recruits histone-modifying and DNA-methylating enzymes that direct the formation of repressive chromatin, which silences the protein-coding gene associated on the paternally derived chromosome (Figure 7\u201349B). The maternally derived gene, on the other hand, is immune to these effects because the specific methylation present from imprinting blocks the synthesis of the lncRNA but allows transcription of the"

Acetylation of histone proteins is another well-characterized mechanism that results in an open chromatin configuration, which favors active transcription. Acetylation is generally more dynamic than methylation, and many transcriptional activation complexes have histone acetylase activity, whereas repressor complexes often contain deacetylases and remove acetyl groups from histones. Other histone modifications, whose effects are incompletely characterized, include phosphorylation and sumoylation.

Introns refer to the spacing regions between the exons that are spliced out of precursor RNAs during RNA processing. The gene locus also includes regions that are necessary to control its expression (Fig. 82-2). Current 427 estimates predict 20,687 protein-coding genes in the human genome with an average of about four different coding transcripts per gene. Remarkably, the exome only constitutes 1.14% of the genome. In addition, thousands of noncoding transcripts (RNAs of various length such as microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs), which function, at least in part, as transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression, have been identified. Aberrant expression of microRNAs has been found to play a pathogenic role in numerous diseases."
