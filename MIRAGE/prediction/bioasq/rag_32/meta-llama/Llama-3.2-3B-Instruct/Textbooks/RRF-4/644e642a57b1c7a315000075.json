Defects in methyl transfer or in the subsequent metabolism of homocysteine by the pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6)dependent cystathionine \u03b2-synthase increase plasma methionine levels. Homocysteine is transformed into methionine via remethylation. This occurs through methionine synthase, a reaction requiring methylcobalamin and folic acid. Deficiencies in these enzymes or lack of cofactors is associated with decreased or normal methionine levels. In an alternative pathway, homocysteine can be remethylated by betaine:homocysteine methyl transferase. 3 and 5 years of age with dislocated optic lenses and intellectual disability (in about half of cases).

C. Branched-chain amino acids are catabolized primarily in the liver. D. Cysteine is essential for individuals consuming a diet severely limited in methionine. Correct answer = D. Methionine is the precursor of cysteine, which becomes essential if methionine is severely restricted. Alanine is a key glucogenic amino acid. Acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) cannot be used for the net synthesis of glucose. Amino acids catabolized to acetyl CoA are ketogenic. Branched-chain amino acids are catabolized primarily in skeletal muscle. 0.6. In an individual with the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3)-deficient form of maple syrup urine disease, why would lactic acidosis be an expected finding?"
