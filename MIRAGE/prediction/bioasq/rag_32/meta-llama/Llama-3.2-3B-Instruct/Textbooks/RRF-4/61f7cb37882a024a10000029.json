It is typically due to viral infection (often with concurrent myocarditis), http://ebooksmedicine.net although bacteria, fungi, or parasites may also be involved. In most cases, pericarditis is secondary to acute MI or cardiac surgery (so-called \u201cDressler\u2019s syndrome\u201d), radiation to the mediastinum, or processes involving other thoracic structures (e.g., pneumonia or pleuritis). Uremia is the most common systemic disorder associated with pericarditis. Less common secondary causes include rheumatic fever, systemic lupus erythematosus, and metastatic malignancies. Pericarditis can (1) cause immediate hemodynamic complications if it elicits a large effusion (resulting in cardiac tamponade), (2) resolve without significant sequelae, or 3) progress to a chronic fibrosing process."

If it occurs within a few days or weeks of an AMI, a chest blow, a cardiac perforation, or a cardiac operation, it may be justified to conclude that the two are probably related. It is important to distinguish pericarditis due to collagen vascular disease from acute idiopathic pericarditis. Most important in the differential diagnosis is the pericarditis due to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; Chap. 378) or drug-induced (procainamide or hydralazine) lupus. When pericarditis occurs in the absence of any obvious underlying disorder, the diagnosis of SLE may be suggested by a rise in the titer of antinuclear antibodies. Acute pericarditis is an occasional complication of rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and polyarteritis nodosa, and other evidence of these diseases is usually obvious."

Classic electrocardiographic abnormalities include PR-interval depression and diffuse ST-segment elevation. Pericarditis can be accompanied by pericardial effusion that is seen on echocardiography and can rarely lead to tamponade. However, the pericardial effusion can be asymptomatic, and pericarditis can be seen without significant effusion."

Arrhythmia is the most common complication and cause of death following acute MI; lethal arrhythmia is the most common cause of death following acute MI. Less common complications include reinfarction, left ventricular wall rupture, VSD, pericarditis, papillary muscle rupture (with mitral regurgitation), left ventricular aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm, and mural thrombi. Dressler\u2019s syndrome, an autoimmune process occurring 2\u201310 weeks post-MI, presents with fever, pericarditis, pleural effusion, leukocytosis, and \u2191 ESR. A timeline of common post-MI complications is as follows: First day: Heart failure (treat with nitroglycerin and diuretics). 2\u20134 days: Arrhythmia, pericarditis (diffuse ST elevation with PR depression)."

            "content": "Viral or idiopathic acute pericarditis occurs at all ages but is more common in young adults and is often associated with pleural effusions and pneumonitis. The almost simultaneous development of fever and precordial pain, often 10\u201312 days after a presumed viral illness, constitutes an important feature in the differentiation of acute pericarditis from AMI, in which chest pain precedes fever. The constitutional symptoms are usually mild to moderate, and a pericardial friction rub is often audible. The disease ordinarily runs its course in a few days to 4 weeks. The ST-segment alterations in the ECG usually disappear after 1 or more weeks, but the abnormal T waves may persist for several years and be a source of confusion in persons without a clear history of pericarditis. Pleuritis and pneumonitis frequently accompany viral or idiopathic acute pericarditis. Accumulation of some pericardial fluid is common, and both tamponade and constrictive pericarditis are possible, but infrequent,"

            "content": "The differentiation of AMI from acute pericarditis may become perplexing when, with acute pericarditis, serum biomarkers of myocardial damage such as troponin and creatine kinase-MB rise, presumably because of concomitant involvement of the epicardium in the inflammatory process (an epi-myocarditis) with resulting myocyte necrosis. However, these elevations, if they occur, are quite modest given the extensive electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation in pericarditis. This dissociation is useful in differentiating between these conditions. 2. A pericardial friction rub is audible at some point in about 85% of patients with acute pericarditis, may have up to three components per cardiac cycle, is high-pitched, and is described as rasping, scratching, or grating (Chap. 267). It is heard most frequently at end expiration with the patient upright and leaning forward. 3."

The latter gradually contracts and forms a firm scar encasing the heart, which may be calcified. In developing nations where the condition is prevalent, a high percentage of cases are of tuberculous origin, but this is now an uncommon cause in North America. Chronic constrictive pericarditis may follow acute or relapsing viral or idiopathic pericarditis, trauma with organized blood clot, or cardiac surgery of any type or result from mediastinal irradiation, purulent infection, histoplasmosis, neoplastic disease (especially breast cancer, lung cancer, and lymphoma), rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, or chronic renal failure treated by chronic dialysis.
