Ionizing radiation is known to cause damage to DNA, including double-strand breaks. Double-strand breaks are a type of DNA damage that can lead to mutations and cancer. According to Document [0], damage to DNA caused by ionizing radiation that is not precisely repaired leads to mutations, which can manifest years or decades later as cancer. Document [1] also mentions that defects in DNA repair pathways, such as DNA-PKcs, Ku, or Artemis, are associated with increased radiosensitivity. Additionally, Document [10] states that the oncogenic properties of ionizing radiation are related to its mutagenic effects, which include chromosome breakage, chromosomal rearrangements, and double-strand breaks. Document [11] further emphasizes that double-strand breaks are the principal lesions of importance in the induction of chromosomal abnormalities and gene mutations. Therefore, it is clear that breaks in double-stranded DNA are associated with ionizing radiation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Ionizing radiation can cause many types of damage in DNA, including single-base damage, singleand double-strand breaks, and crosslinks between DNA and protein. In surviving cells, simple defects may be reparable by various enzyme repair systems contained in mammalian cells (see Chapter 6). These repair systems are linked to cell-cycle regulation through proteins such as ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) that initiate signal transduction after the damage, and p53, which can transiently arrest the cell cycle to allow for DNA repair or to trigger apoptosis of cells that are irreparable. However, double-strand breaks may persist without repair, or the repair of lesions may be imprecise (error prone), creating mutations.

Ionizing radiation, replication errors, oxidizing agents, and other metabolites produced in the cell cause breaks of this type. If these lesions were left unrepaired, they would quickly lead to the breakdown of chromosomes into smaller fragments and to loss of genes when the cell divides. However, two distinct mechanisms have evolved to deal with this type of damage (Figure 5\u201345). The simplest to understand is nonhomologous end joining, in which the broken ends are simply brought together and rejoined by DNA ligation, generally with the loss of nucleotides at the site of joining (Figure 5\u201346).

            "content": "Anticancer therapies need to take advantage of some molecular peculiarity of cancer cells that distinguishes them from normal cells. One such property is genetic instability, reflecting deficiencies in chromosome maintenance, cell-cycle checkpoints, and/or DNA repair. Remarkably, the most widely used cancer therapies seem to work by exploiting these abnormalities, although this was not known by the scientists who first developed the treatments. Ionizing radiation and most anticancer drugs damage DNA or interfere with chromosome segregation at mitosis, and they preferentially kill cancer cells because cancer cells have a diminished ability to survive the damage. Normal cells treated with radiation, for example, arrest their cell cycle until they have repaired the damage to their DNA, thanks to the cell-cycle checkpoint responses discussed in Chapter 17. Because cancer cells generally have defects in their checkpoint responses, they may continue to divide after irradiation, only to die"

            "content": "While Brca1 and Brca2 are needed for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, single-strand breaks are repaired by other machinery, involving an enzyme called PARP (polyADP-ribose polymerase). This understanding of the basic mechanisms of DNA repair led to a striking discovery: drugs that block PARP activity kill Brca-deficient cells with extraordinary selectivity. At the same time, PARP inhibition has very little effect on normal cells; in fact, mice that have been engineered to lack PARP1\u2014the major PARP family member involved in DNA repair\u2014remain healthy under laboratory conditions. This result suggests that, while the repair pathway requiring PARP provides a first line of defense against persistent breaks in a DNA strand, these breaks can be repaired efficiently by a genetic recombination pathway in normal cells. In contrast, tumor cells that have acquired their genetic instability by the loss of Brca1 or Brca2 have lost this second line of defense, and they are therefore uniquely"
