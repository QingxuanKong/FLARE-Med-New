The SNOT-22 is a standardized questionnaire that assesses the impact of nasal symptoms on a patient's quality of life. It is commonly used in otolaryngology to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for nasal and sinus conditions, including CRS. A review of the documents does not explicitly state that the SNOT-22 is used to measure HRQOL in CRS, but it is widely used to assess the impact of nasal symptoms on a patient's quality of life. Therefore, we can infer that the SNOT-22 is indeed a widely used measure for HRQOL associated with CRS.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Rhi-nosinusitis is preferred over sinusitis because sinusitis almost always is accompanied by inflammation of the contiguous nasal mucosa. Rhinosinusitis is a significant health burden, affect-ing nearly 12% of the population.17 Rhinosinusitis is the fifth most common diagnosis responsible for antibiotic prescription and accounts for more than 20% of all antibiotics prescribed to adults. Rhinosinusitis may be broadly classified based on duration of symptomatology. Symptoms lasting <4 weeks may be classified as acute rhinosinusitis (ARS), while symptoms lasting >12 weeks may be classified as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

            "content": "Episodic Nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia Choanal atresia CSF, Cerebrospinal fluid. The hallmarks of allergic rhinitis are clear: thin rhinorrhea; nasal congestion; paroxysms of sneezing; and pruritus of the eyes, nose, ears, and palate. Postnasal drip may result in frequent attempts to clear the throat, nocturnal cough, and hoarseness. It is important to correlate the onset, duration, and severity of symptoms with seasonal or perennial exposures, changes in the home or school environment, and exposure to nonspecific irritants, such as tobacco smoke."

            "content": "The common cold is a viral infection with prominent symptoms of rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction, absent or mild fever, and no systemic manifestations. It is often referred to as rhinitis but usually involves the sinus mucosa and is more correctly termed rhinosinusitis. The viruses primarily associated with colds are rhinoviruses and, less commonly, coronaviruses. Other viruses that cause common cold symptoms include respiratory syncytial virus and, less commonly, influenza, parainfluenza, and adenoviruses. Viral infection of nasal epithelium causes an acute inflammatory response with mucosal infiltration by inflammatory cells and release of cytokines. The inflammatory response is partly responsible for many of the symptoms."

            "content": "Approximately 60% of children with allergic rhinitis have symptoms of reactive airways disease/asthma (see Chapter 78). Chronic allergic inflammation leads to chronic cough from postnasal drip; eustachian tube dysfunction and otitis media; sinusitis; and tonsillar and adenoid hypertrophy, which may lead to obstructive sleep apnea. Children with allergic rhinitis may experience sleep disturbances, limitations of activity, irritability, and mood and cognitive disorders that adversely affect their performance at school and their sense of well-being. Seasonal allergic rhinitis is a common and prominent condition that may not improve as children grow older. Patients become more adept at self-management. Perennial allergic rhinitis improves with allergen control of indoor allergens."
