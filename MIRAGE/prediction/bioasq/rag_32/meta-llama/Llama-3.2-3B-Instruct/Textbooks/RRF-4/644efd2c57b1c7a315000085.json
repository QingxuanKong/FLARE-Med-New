In normal, differentiated cells, the major portion of the genome is not expressed. These regions of the genome are silenced by DNA methylation and histone modifications. On the other hand, cancer cells are characterized by a global DNA hypomethylation and selective promoter-localized hypermethylation. Indeed, it has become evident during the past several years that tumor suppressor genes are sometimes silenced by hypermethylation of promoter sequences, rather than by mutation. In addition, genome-wide hypomethylation has been shown to cause chromosomal instability and can induce tumors in mice. Thus, epigenetic changes may influence carcinogenesis in many ways.

Mechanisms of this type have a variety of important functions in cells. Most strikingly, certain types of chromatin structure can be inherited; that is, the structure can be directly passed down from a cell to its descendants. Because the cell memory that results is based on an inherited chromatin structure rather than on a change in DNA sequence, this is a form of epigenetic inheritance. The prefix epi is Greek for \u201con\u201d; this is appropriate, because epigenetics represents a form of inheritance that is superimposed on the genetic inheritance based on DNA."

When their gene expression, histone modification, and DNA methylation patterns are compared, however, many differences are observed. Because these differences are roughly correlated not only with age but also with the time that the twins have spent apart from each other, it has been proposed that some of these differences are heritable from cell to cell and are the result of environmental factors. Although these studies are in early stages, the idea that environmental events can be permanently registered as epigenetic changes in our cells is a fascinating one that presents an important challenge to the next generation of biological scientists."

            "content": "In cancer, the epigenome is characterized by simultaneous losses and gains of DNA methylation in different genomic regions, as well as repressive histone modifications. Hyperand hypomethylation are associated with mutations in genes that control DNA methylation. Hypomethylation is thought to remove normal control mechanisms that prevent expression of repressed DNA regions. It is also associated with genomic instability. Hypermethylation, in contrast, results in the silencing of CpG islands in promoter regions of genes, including tumor-suppressor genes. Epigenetic alterations are considered to be more easily reversible compared to genetic changes, and modification of the epigenome with demethylating agents and histone deacetylases is being explored in clinical trials. Several organisms have been studied extensively as genetic models, including M. musculus (mouse), D. melanogaster (fruit fly),"
