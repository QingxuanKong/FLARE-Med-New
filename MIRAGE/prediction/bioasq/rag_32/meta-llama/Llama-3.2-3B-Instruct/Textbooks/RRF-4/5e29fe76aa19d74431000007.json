In animal studies, the therapeutic index is usually defined as the ratio of the TD50 to the ED50 for some therapeutically relevant effect. The precision possible in animal experiments may make it useful to use such a therapeutic index to estimate the potential benefit of a drug in humans. Of course, the therapeutic index of a drug in humans is almost never known with real precision; instead, drug trials and accumulated clinical experience often reveal a range of usually effective doses and a different (but sometimes overlapping) range of possibly toxic doses.

There were some early removals in 9% to 18% of subjects for failure to tolerate symptoms, early deflations without migration in 6%, and gastric ulcers in 10%. The precise role for these devices is yet to be determined, and they must be paired with a diet and exercise plan to maximize effectiveness. Repeat or sequential balloon therapy may be effective in enhancing and sustaining weight loss, and it is being studied in Europe. Finally, ensuring proper follow-up is important to"

            "content": "cancer, although many such multiparameter tests are under development, few have reached the large-scale valida-tion stage.113 In 2007, ASCO guidelines suggested that one of these, the Oncotype DX assay, can be used to predict recurrence in women with node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer who are treated with tamoxifen.111 Oncotype DX is a quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test that used paraffin-fixed tissue. A 21-gene recurrence score (RS) is generated based on the expression of 16 cancer genes and 5 reference genes. The levels of expression are used to derive an RS that ranges from 0 to 100, using a prospectively defined mathematical algorithm. This novel quantitative approach to the evaluation of the best-known molecular pathways in breast cancer has produced impressive results. Use of this multigene assay to predict recurrence was validated in the National Surgi-cal Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-14 trial, in which ER-positive,"

            "content": "Mipomersen is an antisense oligonucleotide that targets apo B-100, mainly in the liver. It is important to note that the apo B-100 gene is also transcribed in the retina and in cardiomyocytes. Subcutaneous injections of mipomersen reduce levels of LDL and Lp(a). Mild to moderate injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms can occur. The drug is available only for use in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia through a restricted (REMS) program."

            "content": "Similar consideration should be given in determining the need, if any, to test the patient and family members for thrombophilias. Careful history taking and clinical examination are essential components in the assessment of bleeding and thrombotic risk. The use of laboratory tests of coagulation complement, but cannot substitute for, clinical assessment. No test exists that provides a global assessment of hemostasis. The bleeding time has been used to assess bleeding risk; however, it does not predict bleeding risk with surgery and it is not recommended for this indication. The PFA-100, an instrument that measures platelet-dependent coagulation under flow conditions, is more sensitive and specific for VWD than the bleeding time; however, it is not sensitive enough to rule out mild bleeding disorders. PFA-100 closure times are prolonged in patients with some, but not all, inherited platelet disorders. Also, its utility in predicting bleeding risk has not been determined."
