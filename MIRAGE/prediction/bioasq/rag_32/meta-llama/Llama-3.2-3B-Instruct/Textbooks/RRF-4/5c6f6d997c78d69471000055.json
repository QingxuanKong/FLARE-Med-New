Medications such as levodopa that treat the symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease can also exacerbate psychotic symptoms. Likewise, antipsychotics that can treat the psychotic symptoms can significantly worsen the other symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease. In 2016, a new type of antipsychotic was approved for the treatment of psychosis in Parkinson\u2019s disease. Pimavanserin is a selective serotonin inverse agonist. As such, it has no dopamine antagonist properties and is not associated with EPS. Pimavanserin is currently being investigated as an adjunctive treatment in schizophrenia. B.

Such adverse effects are more common in patients taking levodopa in combination with a decarboxylase inhibitor rather than levodopa alone, presumably because higher levels are reached in the brain. They may be precipitated by intercurrent illness or surgery. It may be necessary to reduce or withdraw the medication. Several atypical antipsychotic agents that have low affinity for dopamine D2 receptors (clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone; see Chapter 29) are now available and may be particularly helpful in counteracting such behavioral complications.

If orthostatic hypotension or wide swings in blood pressure supervene, the picture becomes even more complicated. For the blood pressure changes, midodrine is often prescribed; we have had less success with mineralocorticoids. At least one randomized trial has described benefit from the anticholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine, in reducing delusions, hallucinations, and anxiety (McKeith and colleagues, 2000). Pimavanserin, a selective serotonin 5-HT2A inverse agonist used to treat psychosis in Parkinson disease, has shown some modest benefit for psychosis and hallucinations in a trial in Lewy body dementia without worsening motor symptoms (see Cummings et al). Antipsychotic drugs such as quetiapine and clozapine are also used but are limited by their risks and side effects."

Confusion and outright psychosis (hallucinations and delusions) are seen in advanced cases of Parkinson disease when high doses of l-dopa are required and the disease has been present for many years. This may first be treated by reducing the dose of the drug. If this is not tolerated, the atypical neuroleptics olanzapine, clozapine, risperidone, or quetiapine may be given in low doses. The side effects of these drugs include sleepiness, orthostatic hypotension, and sialorrhea. As noted above, clozapine has been said to provide an additional benefit of suppressing dyskinesias in advanced Parkinson disease, but its hematologic risks have led to limited use.

Moreover, the benefits of levodopa therapy often diminish as the disease advances, and serious adverse effects may complicate longterm levodopa treatment. Nevertheless, dopaminergic therapy at a relatively early stage may be most effective in alleviating motor symptoms of parkinsonism and may also favorably affect the mortality rate due to the disease. Therefore, several strategies have evolved for optimizing dopaminergic therapy, as summarized in Figure 28\u20135. Symptomatic treatment of mild parkinsonism is probably best avoided until there is some degree of disability or functional limitation or until symptoms begin to impact the patient\u2019s lifestyle or cause significant social impairment."

They have found a place both as the initial treatment, replacing l-dopa in this role, and in modulating the effects of l-dopa later in the illness. However, dopamine agonists are less potent than l-dopa in managing the main features of Parkinson disease and, in higher doses and in older individuals, they produce undesirable motor and cognitive side effects (see further on). They are favored because they are associated with fewer dyskinetic motor complications, or at least, delay the need for l-dopa and its dyskinetic effects. Bromocriptine and lisuride are synthetic ergot derivatives whose action in Parkinson disease is explained by their direct stimulating effect on dopamine (D2) receptors located on striate neurons.

Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of the main drugs used in the treatment of Parkinson disease are understandable in the context of neurotransmitter function. To correct the basic dopamine deficiency from a loss of nigral cells that underlies Parkinson disease, attempts were at first made to administer dopamine directly. However, dopamine as such cannot cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and therefore has no therapeutic effect. But its immediate precursor, L-dopa, does cross the blood\u2013barrier and is effective in decreasing the symptoms of Parkinson disease as well as of the above-described MPTP-induced parkinsonism. This effect is enhanced by the addition of an inhibitor of dopadecarboxylase, an important enzyme in the catabolism of dopamine. The addition of an enzyme"

For this reason, they are particularly favored in controlling the confusion and psychosis of parkinsonian patients.

This view has been validated in clinical practice in that one observes a beneficial effect on parkinsonian symptoms after the administration of anticholinergic agents. The use of drugs that enhance dopamine synthesis or its release, or that directly stimulate dopaminergic receptors in the striatum (e.g., pramipexole), represents another more direct method of treating Parkinson disease as outlined in Chap. 38."

Originally introduced as an antiviral agent, it was appreciated to also have antiparkinsonian effects that are now thought to be due to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism. While some physicians use amantadine in patients with early disease for its mild symptomatic effects, it is most widely used as an antidyskinesia agent in patients with advanced PD. Indeed, it is the only oral agent that has been demonstrated in controlled studies to reduce dyskinesia without worsening parkinsonian features, although benefits may be relatively transient. Cognitive impairment is a major concern. Other side effects include livido reticularis and weight gain. Amantadine should always be discontinued gradually because patients can experience withdrawal-like symptoms."
