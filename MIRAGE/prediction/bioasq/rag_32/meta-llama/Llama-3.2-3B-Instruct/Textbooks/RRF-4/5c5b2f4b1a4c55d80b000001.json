Strengthening synaptic connections among this network serves to establish the memory. This may occur through long-term potentiation, as the work of Kandel has shown in experimental models. It is not clear if a hippocampal neuron is the trigger to the memory ensemble or the entirety of hippocampal system serves a generic role in cohering all memories. These cellular mechanisms involved in learning and the formation of memories are only beginning to be understood. Whether physiologic phenomena such as long-term potentiation or anatomic changes in the dendritic structure of neurons are at the center of memory storage is not known; certainly both are"

To make matters more complex, neural circuitry is continuously sculpted in response to experience, modified as we learn and store memories, and irreversibly altered by the gradual loss of neurons and their connections as we age. How can a system so complex be subject to such change and yet continue to function stably? One emerging theory suggests that individual neurons are self-tuning devices, constantly adjusting the expression of ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors in order to maintain a stable function.

In a mammal\u2019s brain, the region called the hippocampus has a special role in learning. When it is destroyed on both sides of the brain, the ability to form new memories is largely lost, although previous long-established memories remain. Some synapses in the hippocampus show a striking form of synaptic plasticity with repeated use: whereas occasional single action potentials in the presynaptic cells leave no lasting trace, a short burst of repetitive firing causes long-term potentiation (LTP), such that subsequent single action potentials in the presynaptic cells evoke a greatly enhanced response in the postsynaptic cells. The effect lasts hours, days, or weeks, according to the number and intensity of the bursts of repetitive firing. Only the synapses that were activated exhibit LTP; synapses that have remained quiet on the same postsynaptic cell are not affected. However, while"

The importance assigned to the hippocampal formations and medial thalamic nuclei in memory function does not mean that the mechanisms governing this function are confined to these structures or that these parts of the brain form a \u201cmemory center.\u201d It informs us only that these are the sites where the smallest lesions have the most devastating effects on memory and learning.

Thus, a lesion of the dominant temporal lobe impairs the ability to remember words (loss of explicit semantic memory), and a lesion of the inferior parietal lobule undermines the recognition of written or printed words as well as the ability to relearn them (alexia). The dominant parietal lobe is related to recollection of geometric figures and numbers; the nondominant parietal lobe, to visuospatial relations; the inferoposterior temporal lobes, to the recognition of faces; and the dominant posterofrontal region, to acquiring and remembering motor skills and their affective associations.

Many families of transcription factors, each comprising multiple individual components, are expressed in the nervous system. Elucidation of these signaling pathways has already begun to provide insights into the cause of a variety of neurologic disorders, including inherited disorders of cognition such as X-linked mental retardation. This problem affects ~1 in 500 males, and linkage studies in different families suggest that as many as 60 different X-chromosome-encoded genes may be responsible.

The enzyme maintains this activity until a protein phosphatase removes the autophosphorylation and shuts the kinase off. CaM-kinase II activation can thereby serve as a memory trace of a prior Ca2+ pulse, and it seems to have a role in some types of memory and learning in the vertebrate nervous system.

Another noteworthy fact is that long-standing social habits, automatic motor skills, and memory for words (language) and visual impressions (visual or pictorial attributes of persons, objects, and places) are unimpaired.

            "content": "The amnesic state As indicated in Chap. 20, the core of the amnesic disorder is a defect in learning (anterograde amnesia) and a loss of past memories (retrograde amnesia). The defect in learning can be remarkably severe. The patient may be incapable, for example, of committing to memory the simplest of facts (such as the examiner\u2019s name, the date, and the time of day) despite countless attempts; the patient can repeat each fact as it is presented, indicating that he understands what is wanted of him and that \u201cregistration\u201d is intact, but by the time the third fact is repeated, the first may have been forgotten. However, certain nonverbal learning may take place; for example, with repeated trials, the patient may learn complex tasks such as mirror writing or how to negotiate a maze, despite no recollection of ever having been confronted with these tasks."
