Viral infection induces the production of interferons, originally named because of their ability to interfere with viral replication in previously uninfected tissue culture cells. Interferons have a similar role in vivo, blocking the spread of viruses to uninfected cells. There are numerous genes encoding antiviral, or type I, interferons. Best understood are the IFN-\u03b1 family of 12 closely related human genes and IFN-\u03b2, the product of a single gene; less well studied are IFN-\u03ba, IFN-\u03b5, and IFN-\u03c9.

Cytokines and products of complement activation, as well as other mediators, are produced during innate immune reactions and trigger the vascular and cellular components of inflammation. The recruited leukocytes destroy pathogens and ingest and eliminate damaged cells. This reaction was described in Chapter 3. Anti-viral defense. Type I interferons produced in response to viruses act on infected and uninfected cells and activate enzymes that degrade viral nucleic acids and inhibit viral replication. In addition to these defensive functions, the innate immune system generates signals that stimulate the subsequent, more powerful adaptive immune response. Some of these signals are described later."

The type I interferons help block viral replication in multiple ways. They activate a latent ribonuclease that nonspecifically degrades single-stranded RNA. They also indirectly activate a protein kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the protein synthesis initiation factor eIF2 (discussed in Chapter 6), thereby shutting down most protein synthesis in the infected host cell. Apparently, by destroying most of its own RNA and transiently halting most of its protein synthesis, the host cell inhibits viral replication without killing itself. If these measures fail, the cell takes an even more extreme step to prevent the virus from replicating: it kills itself by undergoing apoptosis, often with the help of immune killer cells, as we discuss next.

            "content": "As discussed earlier, cells of the innate immune system use PRRs to distinguish microbial molecules from self molecules made by the host. The adaptive immune system has the far more difficult recognition task of responding specifically to an almost unlimited number of foreign molecules while not responding to the large number of self molecules. How does it accomplish this feat? It helps that self molecules normally do not induce the innate immune reactions required to activate adaptive immune responses. But even when an infection or tissue injury triggers innate reactions, the vast majority of self molecules normally still fail to induce an adaptive immune response. Why?"

The net result is that the NK cells are activated and the infected or stressed cells are killed and eliminated. NK cells also secrete cytokines such as interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), which activates macrophages to destroy ingested microbes, and thus NK cells provide early defense against intracellular microbial infections."

            "content": "Innate immune cells express several receptor systems that recognize microbes and induce rapid defenses as well as delayed cellular responses. Several scavenger and lectin-like receptors on neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells help rapidly eliminate microbes through phagocytosis. G-protein-coupled receptors for C5a (which can be produced by activation of the complement system\u2019s innate pathogen-recognition ability) and for the bacterial peptide fMLF synergize with phagocytic receptors in activating the NADPH oxidase in phagosomes to generate antimicrobial reactive oxygen intermediates. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the cell surface and in the membranes of endosomes detect microbes outside the cell and activate several host defense signaling pathways. The NF\u03baB and IRF pathways downstream of these receptors induce pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, and antiviral cytokines including type I interferons. Other receptor families detect microbial infection"
