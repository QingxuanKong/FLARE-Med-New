For small, localized papillary tumors that are not high-grade, transurethral resection is both diagnostic and therapeutically sufficient. Patients with tumors that are at high risk for recurrence or progression typically receive topical immunotherapy consisting of intravesical instillation of an attenuated strain of the tuberculosis bacillus called Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), sometimes followed by intravesical chemotherapy. BCG elicits a granulomatous reaction that also triggers an effective local anti-tumor immune response. Patients are closely monitored for tumor recurrence with periodic cystoscopy and urine cytologic studies. Radical cystectomy is reserved for (1) tumor invading the muscularis propria; (2) CIS or high-grade papillary cancer refractory to BCG; and (3) CIS extending into the prostatic urethra and down the prostatic ducts, where BCG cannot come in contact"

Bladder tumors may spread through the bladder wall and invade local structures, including the rectum, uterus (in women), and lateral walls of the pelvic cavity. Prostatic involvement is not uncommon in male patients. The disease spreads via the internal iliac lymph nodes. Spread to distant metastatic sites rarely includes the lung.

Glucocorticoids are an important part of treatment for most vasculitides but are associated with substantial toxicities. Monitoring and prevention of glucocorticoid-induced bone loss are important in all patients. With the use of daily cyclophosphamide, strategies are particularly important and are directed toward minimization of bladder toxicity and prevention of leukopenia. Instructing the patient to take cyclophosphamide all at once in the morning with a large amount of fluid throughout the day in order to maintain a dilute urine can reduce the risk of bladder injury. Bladder cancer can occur several years after discontinuation of cyclophosphamide therapy;"

            "content": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy refers to the use of chemotherapy in patients who present with localized cancer for which alternative local therapies, such as surgery, exist but which have been shown to be less than completely effective. At present, neoadjuvant therapy is most often administered in the treatment of anal cancer, bladder cancer, breast cancer, gastroesophageal cancer, laryngeal cancer, locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), osteogenic sarcoma, and locally advanced rectal cancer. For diseases such as anal cancer, gastroesophageal cancer, laryngeal cancer, NSCLC, and rectal cancer, optimal clinical benefit is derived when chemotherapy is administered with radiation therapy either concurrently or sequentially. The goal of the neoadjuvant approach is to reduce the size of the primary tumor so that surgical resection can be made easier and more effective. In addition, with rectal cancer and laryngeal cancer, the administration of combined modality ther apy prior to"

Motzer Transitional cell epithelium lines the urinary tract from the renal pelvis to the ureter, urinary bladder, and the proximal two-thirds of the urethra. Cancers can occur at any point: 90% of malignancies develop in the bladder, 8% in the renal pelvis, and 2% in the ureter or urethra. Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men and the thirteenth in women, with an estimated 72,570 new cases and 15,210 deaths in the United States predicted for the year 2013. The almost 5:1 ratio of incidence to mortality reflects the higher frequency of the less lethal superficial variants compared to the more lethal invasive and metastatic variants. The incidence is roughly four times higher in men than in women and twofold higher in white men than in black men, with a median age of 65 years."

Bladder cancer can occur several years after discontinuation of cyclophosphamide therapy; therefore, monitoring for bladder cancer should continue indefinitely in patients who have received cyclophosphamide. Bone marrow suppression is an important toxicity of cyclophosphamide and can be observed during glucocorticoid tapering or over time, even after periods of stable measurements. Monitoring of the complete bloodcountevery1\u20132weeks foraslong asthepatient receives cyclophosphamide can effectively prevent cytopenias. Maintaining the white blood cell (WBC) count at >3000/\u03bcL and the neutrophil count at >1500/\u03bcL is essential to reduce the risk of life-threatening infections."

            "content": "Mitomycin (mitomycin C) is an antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces caespitosus. It undergoes metabolic activation through an enzyme-mediated reduction to generate an alkylating agent that cross-links DNA. Hypoxic tumor stem cells of solid tumors exist in an environment conducive to reductive reactions and are more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of mitomycin than normal cells and oxygenated tumor cells. This agent is active in all phases of the cell cycle and is the best available drug for use in combination with radiation therapy to attack hypoxic tumor cells. Its clinical use is mainly limited to the treatment of squamous cell cancer of the anus in combination with 5-FU and radiation therapy. One special application of mitomycin has been in the intravesical treatment of superficial bladder cancer. Because virtually none of the agent is absorbed, there is little to no systemic toxicity when used in this way."
