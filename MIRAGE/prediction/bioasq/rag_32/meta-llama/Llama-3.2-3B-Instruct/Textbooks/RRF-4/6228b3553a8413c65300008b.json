Let's review the documents and look for relevant information.\\n\\nFirst, let's consider the definition of circular RNAs. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that are formed by the circularization of linear RNAs through a process called backsplicing. They are known to play various roles in regulating gene expression, including post-transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes.\\n\\nNext, let's examine the documents for information on circRNAs and eye diseases.\\n\\nDocument [0] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) mentions that crRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that are the effectors of CRISPR-mediated immunity in bacteria. However, there is no mention of circRNAs and eye diseases.\\n\\nDocument [6] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) defines cryptochrome, a plant flavoprotein sensitive to blue light, but does not mention circRNAs or eye diseases.\\n\\nDocument [7] (Title: Neurology_Adams) discusses optic neuritis and its effects on vision, but does not mention circRNAs or eye diseases.\\n\\nDocument [8] (Title: Pathology_Robbins) discusses mitochondrial diseases and their effects on various organs, including the eye, but does not mention circRNAs.\\n\\nDocument [9] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) mentions that lncRNAs, including Xist RNA, have various roles in regulating gene expression, but does not specifically mention circRNAs or eye diseases.\\n\\nDocument [10] (Title: Pathology_Robbins) discusses long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their role in diseases, but does not mention circRNAs.\\n\\nDocument [21] (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco) discusses RNA editing and its role in producing apolipoprotein B-48 and B-100, but does not mention circRNAs or eye diseases.\\n\\nAfter reviewing the documents, I could not find any information that directly links circular RNAs to diseases of the eye.

Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) consists of a double-strand, circular molecule comprising 16,569 base pairs. It codes for 22 transfer RNAs, 2 ribosomal RNAs, and 13 polypeptides 462e-15 of the respiratory chain enzymes. The genetics of mitochondrial diseases differ from the genetics of chromosomal disorders. The DNA of mitochondria is directly inherited from the cytoplasm of the gametes, mainly from the oocyte. The sperm contributes very little of its mitochondria to the offspring at the time of fertilization. Thus, mitochondrial genes are derived almost exclusively from the mother, accounting for maternal inheritance of some mitochondrial disorders."

The work on Neurospora showed that most genes correspond to a region of the genome that directs the synthesis of a single enzyme. This led to the hypothesis that one gene encodes one polypeptide chain. The hypothesis proved fruitful for subsequent research; as more was learned about the mechanism of gene expression in the 1960s, a gene became identified as that stretch of DNA that was transcribed into the RNA coding for a single polypeptide chain (or a single structural RNA such as a tRNA or an rRNA molecule). The discovery of split genes and introns in the late 1970s could be readily accommodated by the original definition of a gene, provided that a single polypeptide chain was specified by the RNA transcribed from any one DNA sequence."

Involved in energy production used to run the cell, mtDNA codes for a few respiratory chain proteins (most mitochondrial proteins are coded on nuclear DNA) and for a set of transfer RNAs unique to mitochondrial protein synthesis. Virtually all mitochondria are supplied by the oocyte, which means that mtDNA is maternally derived. A woman with a mutation in mtDNA passes this mutation to all of her children. More than one population of mitochondria may be present in the oocyte, a phenomenon called heteroplasmy. The mtDNA mutation may be present in a few or many mitochondria. When the fertilized egg divides, mitochondria are distributed randomly. The presence of symptoms in the offspring, and their severity, depends on the ratio of mutant to wild-type mtDNA present in a particular tissue. If an abundance of mutant mitochondria exists in tissue that has high energy requirements"

            "content": "It is unrealistic (and even undesirable) to condense the vast and fascinating field of cell biology into a single chapter. Consequently, rather than attempting a comprehensive review, the goal here is to survey basic principles and highlight recent advances that are relevant to the mechanisms of disease that are emphasized throughout the rest of the book. The sequencing of the human genome at the beginning of the 21st century represented a landmark achievement of biomedical science. Since then, the rapidly dropping cost of sequencing and the computational capacity to analyze vast amounts of data promise to revolutionize our understanding of health and disease. At the same time, the emerging information has also revealed a breathtaking level of complexity far beyond the linear sequencing of the genome. The potential for these new powerful tools to expand our understanding of pathogenesis and drive therapeutic innovation excites and inspires scientists and the lay public alike."

            "content": "It is increasingly recognized that not all genetic diseases or predispositions are caused by simple changes in the linear nucleotide sequence of genes. Disease-causative mutations also occur commonly in rosis (ALS). This mutation is the most common cause of both familial and sporadic ALS identified thus far. It was shown to be associated with TDP-43 (tar DNA binding protein-43) inclusions in both hippocampal and cerebral neurons. Interestingly, despite the absence of a start codon, the three alternate dipeptide sequences consisting of two amino acids are translated and found in postmortem brain tissue of affected patients. Three potential pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed, including (1) haploinsufficiency, (2) repeat RNA-mediated toxicity, and (3) dipeptide protein toxicity. The possibility of RNA toxicity is supported by the finding of intranuclear RNA foci containing C9orf 72 hexanucleotide repeats and specific RNA-binding proteins. The C9orf 72 mRNA forms quadruplexes of DNA"
