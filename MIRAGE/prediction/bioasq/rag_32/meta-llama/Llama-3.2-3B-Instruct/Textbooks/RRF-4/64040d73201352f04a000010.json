After reviewing the documents, I found no information about Efgartigimod or its use in treating myasthenia gravis. This means that we cannot determine if Efgartigimod can be used for myasthenia gravis based on the provided documents. However, I can tell you that Efgartigimod is a medication used to treat multiple sclerosis, not myasthenia gravis. It is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator that is used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Therefore, the correct answer is B. no, because Efgartigimod is not used to treat myasthenia gravis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Patients with ocular myasthenia may be treated with cholinesterase inhibitors alone (Figure 7\u20134B). Patients having more widespread muscle weakness are also treated with immunosuppressant drugs (steroids, cyclosporine, and azathioprine). In some patients, the thymus gland is removed; very severely affected patients may benefit from administration of immunoglobulins and from plasmapheresis. Edrophonium is sometimes used as a diagnostic test for myasthenia. A 2 mg dose is injected intravenously after baseline muscle strength has been measured. If no reaction occurs after 45 seconds, an additional 8 mg may be injected. If the patient has myasthenia gravis, an improvement in muscle strength that lasts about 5 minutes can usually be observed."

Adverse reactions are generally not serious but may include headache, fluid overload, and rarely aseptic meningitis or renal failure. IVIg should rarely be used as a long-term treatment in place of rationally managed immunosuppressive therapy. Unfortunately, there is a tendency for physicians unfamiliar with immunosuppressive treatments to rely on repeated IVIg infusions, which usually produce only intermittent benefit, do not reduce the underlying autoimmune response, and are very costly. The intermediate and long-term treatment of myasthenic patients requires other methods of therapy outlined earlier in this chapter."

It is thought that the thymus plays a role in breaking self-tolerance and generating T cells that recognize the acetylcholine receptor as a foreign antigen. Although patients with thymoma and myasthenia gravis are less likely to have a remission in the myasthenia as a consequence of thymectomy than are patients with thymic abnormalities other than thymoma, the course of myasthenia gravis is not significantly different in patients with or without thymoma. Thymectomy produces at least some symptomatic improvement in ~65% of patients with myasthenia gravis. In one large series, thymoma patients with myasthenia gravis had a better long-term survival from thymoma resection than did those without myasthenia gravis."

The antibodies are believed to drive internalization and degradation of the receptor (Fig. 15.22). Fig. 15.22 Autoantibodies inhibit receptor function in myasthenia gravis. In normal circumstances, acetylcholine released from stimulated motor neurons at the neuromuscular junction binds to acetylcholine receptors on skeletal muscle cells, triggering muscle contraction (upper panel). Myasthenia gravis is caused by autoantibodies against the \u03b1 subunit of the receptor for acetylcholine. These autoantibodies bind to the receptor without activating it and also cause receptor internalization and degradation (lower panel). As the number of receptors on the muscle is decreased, the muscle becomes less responsive to acetylcholine."

These drugs are relatively short-acting and therefore require frequent dosing (every 6 hours for pyridostigmine and every 4 hours for neostigmine; Table 7\u20134). Sustained-release preparations are available but should be used only at night and if needed. Longer-acting cholinesterase inhibitors such as the organophosphate agents are not used, because the dose requirement in this disease changes too rapidly to permit smooth control of symptoms with long-acting drugs. If muscarinic effects of such therapy are prominent, they can be controlled by the administration of antimuscarinic drugs such as atropine.

            "content": "Myasthenia is manageable but not curable. Oral pyridostigmine is the first-line treatment. Thymectomy is recommended but postponed until ater pregnancy (Sanders, 2016). Anticholinesterase medications improve symptoms by impeding acetylcholine degradation but seldom produce normal muscle function. Ironically, overdose is manifest by increased weness-cholinergic crisisthat may be diicult to diferentiate from myasthenic symptoms. Most of those refractory to anticholinesterase therapy respond to immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids, azathioprine, or cyclosporine in pregnancy. When short-term, rapid clinical improvement is needed-such as for a surgical procedure or a myasthenic crisis-high-dose IVIG or plasma exchange is usually efective (Barth, 2011; Cortese, 2011; Sanders, 2016)."

            "content": "Although the evidence that an autoimmune mechanism is responsible for the functional disorder of muscle in myasthenia gravis is incontrovertible, the source of the autoimmune response has not been established. Because most patients with myasthenia have thymic abnormalities and a salutary response to thymectomy, it is logical to implicate the lymphoid reaction in this gland in the pathogenesis of the disease. Both T and B cells from the myasthenic thymus are particularly responsive to the AChR, more so than analogous cells from peripheral blood. Moreover, the thymus contains \u201cmyoid\u201d cells (resembling striated muscle) that bear surface AChR. It is not known with certainty that thymic myoid cells are the source of immunologic stimulation in myasthenia gravis. The most obvious objection is that such cells are even more abundant in the normal than in the myasthenic thymus (according to Schluep et al). Another suggested pathogenesis, yet unconfirmed, is that a virus with a tropism for"
