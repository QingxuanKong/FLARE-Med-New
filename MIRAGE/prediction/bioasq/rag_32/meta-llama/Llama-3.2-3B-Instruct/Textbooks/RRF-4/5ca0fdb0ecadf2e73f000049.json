Actin is a cytoskeletal protein that is present in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, but its role and distribution in the nucleus are not clearly defined in the provided documents. However, we can look for any indirect references to actin in the nucleus or any information about actin's interaction with nuclear structures. According to document [8], SUN and KASH proteins bind to each other within the lumen of the nuclear envelope, forming a bridge that connects the nuclear and cytoplasmic cytoskeletons. However, there is no direct mention of actin in the nucleus. Therefore, based on the provided information, it appears that actin is not present in the nucleus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Each actin subunit, sometimes called globular or G-actin, is a 375-amino-acid polypeptide carrying a tightly associated molecule of ATP or ADP (Figure 16\u201311A). Actin is extraordinarily well conserved among eukaryotes. The amino acid sequences of actins from different eukaryotic species are usually about 90% identical. Small variations in actin amino acid sequence can cause significant functional differences: In vertebrates, for example, there are three isoforms of actin, termed \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3, that differ slightly in their amino acid sequences and have distinct functions. \u03b1-Actin is expressed only in muscle cells, while \u03b2and \u03b3-actins are found together in almost all non-muscle cells.

Actin filaments are polarized and can undergo treadmilling when a filament assembles at the plus end while simultaneously depolymerizing at the minus end. In cells, actin filament dynamics are regulated at every step, and the varied forms and functions of actin depend on a versatile repertoire of accessory proteins. Approximately half of the actin is kept in a monomeric form through association with sequestering proteins such as thymosin.

Proteins targeted to the nucleus, mitochondria, or peroxisomes are synthesized on free ribosomes and then released into the cytosol. In the absence of a signal sequence, proteins that are synthesized on free ribosomes remain in the cytosol. Cytoplasmic basophilia is associated with cells that produce large amounts of protein that will remain in the cell. Such cells and their products include developing red blood cells (hemoglobin), developing muscle cells (the contractile proteins actin and myosin), nerve cells (neurofilaments), and keratinocytes of the skin (keratin). In addition, most enzymes of the mitochondrion are synthesized by free polysomes and transferred into that organelle."

In each case, the actin filaments have been labeled with fluorescent phalloidin. (A) Serum-starved fibroblasts have actin filaments primarily in the cortex, and relatively few stress fibers. (B) Microinjection of a constitutively activated form of Cdc42 causes the protrusion of many long filopodia at the cell periphery. (C) Microinjection of a constitutively activated form of Rac, a closely related monomeric GTPase, causes the formation of an enormous lamellipodium that extends from the entire circumference of the cell. (D) Microinjection of a constitutively activated form of Rho causes the rapid assembly of many prominent stress fibers. (From A. Hall, Science 279:509\u2013514, 1998. With permission from AAAS.)"
