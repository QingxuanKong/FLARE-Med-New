Additionally, the documents mention that bevacizumab is approved for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme that has progressed after prior treatment.

Some of the earliest cancer gene therapy trials focused on local delivery of a prodrug or a suicide gene that would increase sensitivity of tumor cells to cytotoxic drugs. A frequently used strategy has been intratumoral injection of an adenoviral vector expressing the thymidine kinase (TK) gene. Cells that take up and express the TK gene can be killed after the administration of ganciclovir, which is phosphorylated to a toxic nucleoside by TK. Because cell division is required for the toxic nucleoside to affect cell viability, this strategy was initially used in aggressive brain tumors (glioblastoma multiforme) where the cycling tumor cells were affected but the nondividing normal neurons were not. More recently, this approach has been explored for locally recurrent prostate, breast, and colon tumors, among others."

            "content": "The tumor has a variegated appearance, being a mottled gray, red, orange, or brown, depending on the degree of necrosis and presence of hemorrhage, recent or old. The characteristic histologic findings of glioblastoma are hypercellularity with pleomorphism of cells and nuclear atypia; identifiable astrocytes with fibrils in combination with primitive forms in many cases; tumor giant cells and cells in mitosis; hyperplasia of endothelial cells of small vessels; and necrosis, hemorrhage, and thrombosis of vessels. This variegated appearance distinguishes glioblastoma from the anaplastic astrocytomas, which show frequent mitoses and atypical cytogenic features but no grossly necrotic or hemorrhagic areas. The vasculature and fibroblasts can undergo a sarcomatous transformation giving the tumor a mixed appearance that is termed gliosarcoma. The histologic grade of glioblastoma may vary from site to site within a tumor and it is common for sites of low-grade astrocytoma and glioblastoma to"

            "content": "The CSF is usually normal but an increase in CSF protein (more than 100 mg/dL in many cases), as well as a pleocytosis of 10 to 100 cells or more, mostly lymphocytes, may result from a tumor extending to the meningeal surface or the ventricular wall. Malignant cells, carried in the CSF, rarely may form distant foci on spinal roots or cause widespread meningeal gliomatosis. Extraneural metastases, involving bone and lymph nodes, are very rare; usually they occur only after a craniotomy has been performed. Approximately 50 percent of glioblastomas occupy more than one lobe of a hemisphere; between 3 and 6 percent show multicentric foci of growth and thereby simulate metastatic cancer. A legitimate question is whether these tumors can have a multicentric origin or become multifocal as a result of spread via CSF pathways. We have the impression that the first configuration does exist but is not common."
