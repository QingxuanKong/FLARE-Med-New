    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the information provided in the documents about the structure and function of yeast DNA and its replication. According to Document [5], yeast DNA is linear, and Document [6] states that yeast lacks a special nuclear compartment and carries its genes on a single circular DNA molecule. This suggests that yeast DNA is circular, not linear. However, the question asks about LTR (Long Terminal Repeat) elements, which are typically found in retroviruses, not yeast. Document [20] mentions that yeast has mobile pieces of DNA called transposable elements, but it does not mention LTR elements. Therefore, we can conclude that yeast LTR do not give rise to circular DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Would that not help to ensure that the chromosome did not get left behind at mitosis? 4\u201313 Look at the two yeast colonies in Figure Q4\u20133. Each of these colonies contains about 100,000 cells descended from a single yeast cell, originally somewhere in the middle of the clump. A white colony arises when the Ade2 gene is expressed from its normal chromosomal location. When the Ade2 gene is moved to a location near a telomere, it is packed into heterochromatin and inactivated in most cells, giving rise to colonies that are mostly red. In these largely red colonies, white sectors fan out from the middle of the colony.

Although telomere sequences are fairly simple and short in all eukaryotes, the DNA sequences that form centromeres and replication origins in more complex organisms are much longer than their yeast counterparts. For example, experiments suggest that a human centromere can contain up to a million nucleotide pairs and that it may not require a stretch of DNA with a defined nucleotide sequence. Instead, as we shall discuss later in this chapter, a human centromere is thought to consist of a large, regularly repeating protein\u2013nucleic acid structure that can be inherited when a chromosome replicates.

The answer to the first question came from the realization that DNA is a linear polymer of four different kinds of monomer, strung out in a defined sequence like the letters of a document written in an alphabetic script. The answer to the second question came from the double-stranded nature of the structure: because each strand of DNA contains a sequence of nucleotides that is exactly complementary to the nucleotide sequence of its partner strand, each strand can act as a template, or mold, for the synthesis of a new complementary strand.

They generally account for only a minor fraction of the total host bacterial cell DNA, but owing to their small size, they can easily be separated from the much larger chromosomal DNA molecules, which precipitate as a pellet upon centrifugation. For use as cloning vectors, the purified plasmid DNA circles are first cut with a restriction nuclease to create linear DNA molecules. The DNA to be cloned is added to the cut plasmid and then covalently joined using the enzyme DNA ligase (Figure 8\u201327 and Figure 8\u201328).

However, during the course of the subsequent asexual, vegetative growth, the mitochondria become distributed more or less randomly to daughter cells. After a few generations, the mitochondria of any given cell contain only the DNA from one or the other parent cell, because only a small sample of the mitochondrial DNA passes from the mother cell to the bud of the daughter cell.

The different replication origins in these eukaryotic chromosomes are activated in a sequence, determined in part by the structure of the chromatin, with the most condensed regions of chromatin typically beginning their replication last.

            "content": "Telomerase Replicates the Ends of Chromosomes We saw earlier that synthesis of the lagging strand at a replication fork must occur discontinuously through a backstitching mechanism that produces short DNA fragments. This mechanism encounters a special problem when the replication fork reaches an end of a linear chromosome. The final RNA primer synthesized on the lagging-strand template cannot be replaced by DNA because there is no 3\u02b9-OH end available for the repair polymerase. Without a mechanism to deal with this problem, DNA would be lost from the ends of all chromosomes each time a cell divides."

As discussed in Chapter 5, this enzyme is used by the cell to stitch together the Okazaki fragments produced during DNA replication. The recombinant DNA circle is introduced back into bacterial cells that have been made transiently permeable to DNA. As the cells grow and divide, doubling in number every 30 minutes, the recombinant plasmids also replicate to produce an"
