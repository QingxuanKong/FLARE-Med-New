Identiication of a structural chromosomal abnormality raises two primary questions. First, what phenotypic abnormalities or later developmental abnormalities are associated with this finding? Second, is evaluation of parental karyotype indicated-speciically, are the parents at increased risk of carrying this abnormality? If so, what is their risk of having future afected ofspring?"

The most common is deletion of the short arm, resulting in the formation of an isochromosome of the long arm, 46,X,i(X) (q10). The net effect of the associated structural abnormalities is to produce partial monosomy of the X chromosome. Combinations of deletions and mosaicism also occur. It is important to appreciate the karyotypic heterogeneity associated with Turner syndrome because it is responsible for significant variations in the phenotype. In contrast with the patients with monosomy X, those who are mosaics or have deletion variants may have an almost normal appearance and may present only with primary amenorrhea."

Two genes that modify microtubular function have been identified: LIS1 and \u201cdoublecortin\u201d or DCX. Large chromosomal deletions that span LIS1 cause Miller-Dieker syndrome, in which lissencephaly is associated with distinctive facial abnormalities; small defects in the same gene cause only lissencephaly. Lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia is caused by mutations in the human \u201creelin\u201d gene (RELN), the analogue of the defective gene in reelin mice (which have a reeling gait and abnormal cortical neuronal lamination). Defects in the transcription factor ARX are associated with X-linked lissencephaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and hypogonadism. Periventricular nodular heterotopia is caused by another gene defect, filamin A gene on the X chromosome. Some cases of holoprosencephaly have been traced to mutations in the sonic hedgehog gene."

Some specific examples of diseases involving changes in the karyotype are presented next. Three autosomal trisomies (21, 18, and 13) and one deletion syndrome (cri du chat syndrome), which results from partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5, were the first chromosomal abnormalities identified. More recently, several additional trisomies and deletion syndromes (such as those affecting 22q) have been described.

When CMA is used, the region of DNA that is missing or duplicated is termed a genomic copy number variant. Despite the relatively small size, a microdeletion or duplication may involve a stretch of DNA that contains multiple genes-causing a contiguous gene syndrome, which can encompass serious but unrelated phenotypic abnormalities (Schmickel, 1986). In some cases, a micro duplication may involve the exact DNA region that causes a recognized microdeletion syndrome (Table 13-2).

Technical advances that led to the ability to analyze human chromosomes immediately translated into the revelation that human disorders can be caused by an abnormality of chromosome number. In 1959, the clinically recognizable disorder, Down syndrome, was demonstrated to result from having three copies of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21).

            "content": "Regarding the genetic causes of malformations and developmental delay, much has been learned but a full picture of the genetic influences on these conditions remains incomplete. Whole chromosome karyotyping allowed the recognition of conditions such as Down syndrome and its association with triplication of the entire chromosome 21. As more refined techniques became available, such as high-resolution banding, subtle changes such as small deletions in chromosomal architecture became apparent, as occur in Angleman and Prader-Willi syndrome and fragile-X syndrome. What followed, by the use of linkage analysis and other genetic techniques, was the elucidation of single gene mutations that were obligatorily associated with malformations or developmental delays; most of the inherited metabolic disorders of infancy and childhood discussed in Chap. 36 are of this type but also certain gross malformations of the brain such as lissencephaly, discussed further on."
