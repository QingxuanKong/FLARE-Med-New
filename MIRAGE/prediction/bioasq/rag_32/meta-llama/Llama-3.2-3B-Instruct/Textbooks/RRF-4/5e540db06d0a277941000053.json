In order for patients to derive maximal benefit, they should be treated with each of these active agents in a continuum of care approach. Regorafenib and TAS102 are approved for the chemo-refractory disease setting, but unfortunately, each drug is associated with significant toxicities and only limited clinical efficacy with very low overall response rates; median progression-free survival is about 2-months. Given all of the available treatment regimens, median overall survival for metastatic CRC is now in the 28to 30-month range and, in some cases, approaches or even exceeds 3 years."

A very small fraction of lead compounds reach clinical trials, and less than one third of the drugs studied in humans survive clinical trials and reach the marketplace. Federal law in the USA and ethical considerations require that the study of new drugs in humans be conducted in accordance with stringent guidelines. Scientifically valid results are not guaranteed simply by conforming to government regulations, however, and the design and execution of a good clinical trial require interdisciplinary personnel including basic scientists, clinical pharmacologists, clinician specialists, statisticians, and others. The need for careful design and execution is based on three major confounding factors inherent in the study of any drug in humans. A. The Variable Natural History of Most Diseases"

            "content": "If phase 3 results meet expectations, application is made for permission to market the new agent. Marketing approval requires submission of a New Drug Application (NDA)\u2014or for biologicals, a Biological License Application (BLA)\u2014to the FDA. The application contains, often in hundreds of volumes, full reports of all preclinical and clinical data pertaining to the drug under review. The number of subjects studied in support of the new drug application has been increasing and currently averages more than 5000 patients for new drugs of novel structure (new molecular entities). The duration of the FDA review leading to approval (or denial) of the new drug application may vary from months to years. If problems arise, eg, unexpected but possibly serious toxicities, additional studies may be required and the approval process may extend to several additional years."

They include PDGFR-\u03b1 and PDGFR-\u03b2, VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, VEGFR3, and c-kit. It is approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell cancer and for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors after disease progression on or with intolerance to imatinib. Pazopanib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple RTKs, especially VEGF-R2 and VEGF-R3, PDGFR-\u03b2, and raf kinase. This oral agent is approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell cancer."
