Although this information is crucial to understanding gene function, it does not generally reveal the molecular mechanisms through which the gene product works in the cell. For example, genetics on its own rarely tells us all the places in the organism where the gene is expressed, or how its expression is controlled. It does not necessarily reveal whether the gene acts in the nucleus, the cytosol, on the cell surface, or in one of the numerous other compartments of the cell. And it does not reveal how a gene product might change its location or its expression pattern when the external environment of the cell changes. Key insights into gene function can be obtained by simply observing when and where a gene is expressed.

Among the most important changes are signals from other cells that coordinate the behavior of the whole organism. Many of these signals induce transient changes in gene transcription, and we discuss the nature of these signals in detail in Chapter 15. Here, we consider how specialized cell types rapidly and decisively switch groups of genes on and off in response to their environment. Even though control of gene expression is combinatorial, the effect of a single transcription regulator can still be decisive in switching any particular gene on or off, simply by completing the combination needed to maximally activate or repress that gene. This situation is analogous to dialing in the final number of a combination lock: the lock will spring open with only this simple addition if all of the other numbers have been previously entered."

Genetics starts with the study of mutants: we either find or make an organism in which a gene is altered, and then examine the effects on the organism\u2019s structure and performance (Figure 1\u201323). Biochemistry more directly examines the functions of molecules: here we extract molecules from an organism and then study their chemical activities. By combining genetics and biochemistry, it is possible to find those molecules whose production depends on a given gene. At the same time, careful studies of the performance of the mutant organism show us what role those molecules have in the operation of the organism as a whole. Thus, genetics and biochemistry used in combination with cell biology provide the best way to relate genes and molecules to the structure and function of an organism."

First, it is relatively easy for the experimenter to design the guide RNA: it simply follows standard base pairing convention. Second, the gene to be controlled does not have to be modified; the CRISPR strategy exploits DNA sequences already present in the genome. Third, numerous genes can be controlled simultaneously. Cas9 has to be expressed only once, but many guide RNAs can be expressed in the same cell; this strategy allows the experimenter to turn on or off a whole set of genes at once."

Examples of the first application include overexpression of oncogenes, growth factors, hormones, and other key regulatory genes, as well as genes of viral origins.

OVERVIEW Gene expression refers to the multistep process that ultimately results in the production of a functional gene product, either ribonucleic acid (RNA) or protein. The first step in gene expression, the use of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for the synthesis of RNA (transcription), is the primary site of regulation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, however, gene expression also involves extensive posttranscriptional and posttranslational processes as well as actions that influence access to particular regions of the DNA. Each of these steps can be regulated to provide additional control over the kinds and amounts of functional products that are produced."

It is also generally true that each transcription regulator in an organism contributes to the control of many genes. This point is illustrated schematically in Figure 7\u201333, which shows how combinatorial gene control makes it possible to generate a great deal of biological complexity even with relatively few transcription regulators. Due to combinatorial control, a given transcription regulator does not necessarily have a single, simply definable function as commander of a particular battery of genes or specifier of a particular cell type. Rather, transcription regulators can be likened to the words of a language: they are used with different meanings in a variety of contexts and rarely alone; it is the well-chosen combination that conveys the information that specifies a gene regulatory event."

In normal, differentiated cells, the major portion of the genome is not expressed. These regions of the genome are silenced by DNA methylation and histone modifications. On the other hand, cancer cells are characterized by a global DNA hypomethylation and selective promoter-localized hypermethylation. Indeed, it has become evident during the past several years that tumor suppressor genes are sometimes silenced by hypermethylation of promoter sequences, rather than by mutation. In addition, genome-wide hypomethylation has been shown to cause chromosomal instability and can induce tumors in mice. Thus, epigenetic changes may influence carcinogenesis in many ways.

            "content": "3. Studies of the number of different RNAs suggest that, at any one time, a typical human cell expresses 30\u201360% of its approximately 30,000 genes at some level. There are about 21,000 protein-coding genes and a roughly estimated 9000 noncoding RNA genes in humans. When the patterns of RNA expression in different human cell lines are compared, the level of expression of almost every gene is found to vary from one cell type to another. A few of these differences are striking, like those of hemoglobin and tyrosine aminotransferase noted above, but most are much more subtle. But even those genes that are expressed in all cell types usually vary in their level of expression from one cell type to the next. 4."

            "content": "Two Transcription Regulators That Bind to the Same Gene Promoter Can Exert Combinatorial Control Thus far, we have discussed how one transcription regulator can modulate the expression level of a gene. Most genes, however, are controlled by more than one type of transcription regulator, providing combinatorial control that allows two or more inputs to influence the expression of one gene. We can use computational methods to unveil some of the important regulatory features of combinatorial control systems."
