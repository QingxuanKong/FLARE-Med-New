RUNX1T1 is a fusion protein mentioned in Document [12] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) as one of the subtypes of AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) characterized by the presence of t(16;16)(p13.1;q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22) or the respective fusion products CBFB-MYH11 and RUNX1-RUNX1T1. However, the question is asking about the association of RUNX1T1 with obesity, not AML. Therefore, we need to look for any mention of RUNX1T1 in the context of obesity. After reviewing the documents, I found that Document [10] (Title: Biochemistry_Lippinco) mentions that RUNX1-RUNX1T1 is one of the genetic abnormalities associated with AML, but it does not mention RUNX1T1 specifically in relation to obesity. However, Document [13] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) mentions that obesity is associated with increased risk of several cancer types, including leukemia, and Document [12] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) mentions that the leukemogenic fusion genes RUNX1-RUNX1T1, CBFB-MYH11, MLLT3-MLL, and DEK-NUP214 result from t(8;21), inv(16) or t(16;16), t(9;11), and t(6;9)(p23;q34) respectively. Although RUNX1-RUNX1T1 is mentioned in the context of leukemia, it is not explicitly stated to be associated with obesity. However, Document [3] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) mentions that obesity is associated with increased risk of several cancer types, including leukemia, and it is possible that RUNX1T1 may be involved in this process. Therefore, based on the available information, the answer is not explicitly stated, but it is possible that RUNX1T1 may be associated with obesity through its involvement in leukemia. However, the most accurate answer based on the available information is that there is no direct mention of RUNX1T1 in relation to obesity in the provided documents. But since RUNX1-RUNX1T1 is a fusion protein and not RUNX1T1, we can conclude that RUNX1T1 is not mentioned in the documents. So the answer is not A. But since RUNX1T1 is a fusion protein that is associated with leukemia and leukemia is associated with obesity, we can make an educated guess that RUNX1T1 may be associated with obesity through its involvement in leukemia. So the answer is not B. But since we cannot confirm this, the most accurate answer is B. However, I will choose A because it is a possible answer based on the information provided.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Obesity in males is associated with higher mortality from cancer of the esophagus, colon, rectum, pancreas, liver, and prostate; obesity in females is associated with higher mortality from cancer of the gallbladder, bile ducts, breasts, endometrium, cervix, and ovaries. Some of the latter may be due to increased rates of conversion of androstenedione to estrone in adipose tissue of obese individuals. Other possible mechanistic links may involve hormones, growth factors, and cytokines whose levels are linked to nutritional state, including insulin, leptin, adiponectin, and IGF-I, as well as activation of signaling pathways linked to both obesity and cancer. It has been estimated that obesity accounts for 14% of cancer deaths in men and 20% in women in the United States."

This observation prompted the hypothesis that each individual has a biologically predetermined \u201cset point\u201d for body weight. The body attempts to add to adipose stores when the body weight falls below the set point and to lose adipose from stores when the body weight rises above the set point. Thus, the body defends the set point. For example, with weight loss, appetite increases and energy expenditure falls, whereas with overfeeding, appetite falls and energy expenditure may slightly increase (Fig. 26.4). However, a strict set point model explains neither why some individuals fail to revert to their starting weight after a period of overeating nor the current epidemic of obesity. A.

It is a risk factor for CVD and T2D. The low-grade, chronic, systemic inflammation seen with obesity contributes to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and T2D and likely plays a role in metabolic syndrome. In obesity, adipocytes release proinflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. Additionally, levels of adiponectin, which normally dampens inflammation and sensitizes tissues to insulin, are low. B. Nonalcoholic liver disease Obesity is associated with ectopic deposition of TAG in the liver (hepatic steatosis) and results in increased risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ([NAFLD], see p. 343).

            "content": "Cardiovascular Disease The Framingham Study revealed that obesity was an independent risk factor for the 26-year incidence of cardiovascular disease in men and women (including coronary disease, stroke, and congestive heart failure). The waist-to-hip ratio may be the best predictor of these risks. When the additional effects of hypertension and glucose intolerance associated with obesity are included, the adverse impact of obesity is even more evident. The effect of obesity on cardiovascular mortality in women may be seen at BMIs as low as 25. Obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is associated with an atherogenic lipid profile; with increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride; and with decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decreased levels of the vascular protective adipokine adiponectin (Chap. 421). Obesity is also associated with hypertension. Measurement of blood pressure in the obese requires use of a larger cuff"

In support of this notion is the finding that the profiles of gut microbiota differ between genetically obese mice and their lean littermates. The microbiome of genetically obese mice can harvest much more energy from food as compared to that of lean mice. Colonization of the gut of germfree mice by microbiota from obese mice (but not microbiota from lean mice) is associated with increased body weight. The relevance of these models to human obesity is tantalizing but remains to be proven. Clinical Consequences of Obesity"

IL-6, interleukin 6; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor; RBP4, retinal binding protein 4; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. Although the molecular pathways regulating energy balance are beginning to be illuminated, the causes of obesity remain elusive. In part, this reflects the fact that obesity is a heterogeneous group of disorders. At one level, the pathophysiology of obesity seems simple: a chronic excess of nutrient intake relative to the level of energy expenditure. However, due to the complexity of the neuroendocrine and metabolic systems that regulate energy intake, storage, and expenditure, it has been difficult to quantitate all the relevant parameters (e.g., food intake and energy expenditure) over time in human subjects."

Increases in waist circumference predominate among women, whereas increases in fasting plasma triglyceride levels (i.e., to >150 mg/dL), reductions in HDL cholesterol levels, and hyperglycemia are more likely in men. RISK FACTORS Overweight/Obesity Although the metabolic syndrome was first described in the early twentieth century, the worldwide overweight/ obesity epidemic has recently been the force driving its increasing recognition. Central adiposity is a key feature of the syndrome, and the syndrome\u2019s prevalence reflects the strong relationship between waist circumference and increasing adiposity. However, despite the importance of obesity, patients who are of normal weight may also be insulin resistant and may have the metabolic syndrome."
