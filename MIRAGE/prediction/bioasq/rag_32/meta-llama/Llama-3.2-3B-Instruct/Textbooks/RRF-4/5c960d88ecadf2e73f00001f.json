Currently, five agents that inhibit TNF-\u03b1 are approved for the treatment of RA. There are three different anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies. Infliximab is a chimeric (part mouse and human) monoclonal antibody, whereas adalimumab and golimumab are humanized monoclonal antibodies. Certolizumab pegol is a pegylated Fc-free fragment of a humanized monoclonal antibody with binding specificity for TNF-\u03b1. Lastly, etanercept is a soluble fusion protein comprising the TNF receptor 2 in covalent linkage with the Fc portion of IgG1. All of the TNF inhibitors have been shown in randomized controlled clinical trials to reduce the signs and symptoms of RA, slow radiographic progression of joint damage, and improve physical function and quality of life.

            "content": "Reslizumab binds and neutralizes the biological activity of IL-5, thereby suppressing the production and survival of eosinophils. It is approved for adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. Mepolizumab also binds to IL-5 and selectively inhibits eosinophilic inflammation in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. Siltuximab is a Mab that binds to and blocks IL-6 from binding to its cellular receptor. It is approved for the treatment of patients with multicentric Castleman\u2019s disease who are HIV-negative and HHV-8-negative. Tocilizumab is recombinant humanized IgG1 that binds to soluble and membrane-associated IL-6 receptors. It inhibits IL-6-mediated signaling on lymphocytes, suppressing inflammatory processes. Similar to anti-TNF-\u03b1 Mabs, patients receiving tocilizumab should be closely monitored for infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and other invasive bacterial, fungal, and viral infections."

            "content": "MTX. ACR20 responses at 3 months and achievement of low disease activity at 2 years were numerically comparable for both protocols. Although putatively a 24-month trial, patients could switch from one regimen to the other at 3 months, confounding comparability beyond that time frame. Not surprisingly, given this confounding, the primary goal of certolizumab MTX superiority was not met. Patients were switched without washout so blood levels of TNFis as a group could be expected to be very high during the switchover. Interestingly, no serious infectious events occurred during the switch-over period. 1. Mechanism of Action: Etanercept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of two soluble TNF p75 receptor moieties linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1 (Figure 36\u20134); it binds TNF-\u03b1 molecules and also inhibits lymphotoxin \u03b1. 2."
