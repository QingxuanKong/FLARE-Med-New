    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if the twins are identical or not, we need to understand what twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is and how it occurs. TTTS is a condition where there is an abnormal connection between the circulations of monozygotic (identical) twins who share a common placenta. This connection leads to one twin (the donor) becoming anemic and the other twin (the recipient) becoming polycythemic. The anemia in the donor twin is due to the loss of blood through the shared placental circulation, while the polycythemia in the recipient twin is due to the increased blood flow and pressure from the donor twin. The shared placenta and vascular anastomoses are key factors in the development of TTTS. Given this understanding, we can conclude that the twins in TTTS are monozygotic, or identical, because they share a common placenta and have an arteriovenous connection between their circulations. This connection is a result of the division of a single fertilized egg, which is a characteristic of monozygotic twinning. Therefore, the twins in TTTS are indeed identical.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is associated with a high mortality and is seen only in monozygotic twins who share a common placenta and have an arteriovenous connection between their circulations. The fetus on the arterial side of the shunt serves as the blood donor, resulting in fetal anemia, growth retardation, and oligohydramnios for this fetus. The recipient, or venous-side twin, is larger or discordant in size, is plethoric and polycythemic, and may show polyhydramnios.

In this syndrome, blood is transfused from a donor twin to its recipient sibling such that the donor may eventually become anemic and its growth may be restricted. In contrast, the recipient becomes polycythemic and may develop circulatory overload manifest as hydrops. Classically, the donor twin is pale, and its recipient sibling is plethoric. Similarly, one portion of the placenta often appears pale compared with the remainder. The recipient neonate may also have circulatory overload from heart failure and severe hypervolemia and hyperviscosity. Occlusive thrombosis is another concern. Finally, polycythemia in the recipient twin may lead to severe hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus (Chap. 33, p. 626). he prevalence of TTTS approximates 1 to 3 cases per 10,000 births (Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, 2013)."

Greater risks of fetalgrowth restriction, congenital anomalies, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, and fetal demise of a cotwin are suggested contributors to these diferences (Lorenz, 2012). Several unique complications arise in multifetal pregnancies. These are described in twins but can be found in higher-order multifetal gestations. Most fetal complications due to the twinning process itself are seen with monozygotic twins. heir pathogenesis is best understood after reviewing the possibilities shown in Figure 45-1."

Unfortunately, residual anastomoses remain in up to a third of cases and may lead to TTTS recurrence or to the development of twin-anemia polycythemia sequence (TAPS). The latter is a feto-fetal transfusion characterized by large diferences in hemoglobin concentrations between a pair of monochorionic twins. To address these complications, the Solomon technique was developed. With this, after selective photocoagulation, the laser is used to coagulate the entire vascular equator, from one edge of the placenta to the other (Slaghekke, 2014a). he Solomon technique lowers the proportion of pregnancies with recurrent TTTS and TAPS in multiple trials. Also, placental dye-injection studies confirm a significant reduction in the number of residual anastomoses (Ruano, 2013; Slaghekke, 2014b)."

            "content": "he cause of birthweight inequality in twin fetuses is often unclear, but the etiology in monochorionic twins likely difers from that in dichorionic twins. Because the single placenta is not always equally shared in monochorionic twins, these twins have greater rates of discordant growth outside of TTTS than dichorionic twins. Discordancy in monochorionic twins is usually attributed to placental vascular anastomoses that cause hemodynamic imbalance between the twins. Reduced pressure and perfusion of the donor twin can cause diminished placental and fetal growth. Even so, unequal placental sharing is probably the most important determinant of discordant growth in monochorionic twins (Lewi, 2013). Occasionally, monochorionic twins are discordant in size because they are discordant for structural anomalies."

Once oxygen exchange is completed in the chorionic villus, the oxygenated blood leaves the cotyledon via a placental vein of the recipient twin. Unless compensatedtypically through superficial arterioarterial anastomoses-this unidirectional low leads to an imbalance in blood volumes (Lewi, 2013). Clinically important TTTS frequently is chronic and results from significant vascular volume diferences between the twins. Even so, the pathogenesis is more complex than a net transfer of red blood cells from one twin to another.

The implications of HLA polymorphism for transplantation are obvious; because each person has HLA alleles that differ to some extent from those of every other unrelated individual, grafts from unrelated donors will elicit immune responses in the recipient and be rejected. Only identical twins can accept grafts from one another, without fear of rejection. Even grafts from a donor to a sibling with the same HLA haplotype may be rejected because of differences in so-called \u201cminor histocompatibility loci\u201d, other sets of polymorphic genes that are likely to differ by chance.

Namely, the division of one fertilized zygote into two does not necessarily result in equal sharing of protoplasmic material. Monozygotic twins may actually be discordant for genetic mutations because of a postzygotic mutation, or may have the same genetic disease but with marked variability in expression. In female fetuses, skewed lyonization can produce diferential expression of X-linked traits or diseases. Further, the process of monozygotic twinning is in a sense a teratogenic event, and monozygotic twins have a higher incidence of often discordant malformations (Glinianaia, 2008). For example, in one study of 926 monozygotic twins, the prevalence of congenital heart defects was 12-fold greater than the general population rate, but 68 percent of afected infants had a normal sibling (Pettit, 20l3).

In the TRAP sequence, there is usually a normally formed donor twin that has features of heart failure, and a recipient twin that lacks a heart. It has been hypothesized that the TRAP sequence is caused by a large artery-to-artery placental shunt, often also accompanied by a vein-to-vein shunt. Within the single, shared placenta, perfusion pressure of the donor twin overpowers that in the recipient twin, who thus receives reverse blood flow from its twin sibling. The \"used\" arterial blood that reaches the recipient twin preferentially goes to its iliac vessels and thus perfuses only the lower body. This disrupts growth and development of the upper body."

In a series of 402 patients treated for this indication, rates of pregnancy loss after the procedure by gestational age at the time of procedure were 5.4% at 9 to 12 weeks, 8.7% at 13 to 18 weeks, 6.8% at 19 to 24 weeks, and 9.1% at 25 weeks or more (369). No maternal coagulopathy occurred, and no ischemic damages or coagulopathies were seen in the surviving neonates. Maternal serum \u03b1-fetoprotein remains elevated into the second trimester after first-trimester procedures (370). Because of the possibility of embolic phenomena and infarction in the surviving twin, a different technique is needed for selective reduction of monoamniotic twins or with monochorionic twin\u2013twin transfusion syndrome. He and colleagues describe ultrasound guided bipolar coagulation of the umbilical cord of the affected twin in such cases (371)."

            "content": "If one twin of an afected pregnancy dies, cerebrl pathology in the survivor probably results from acute hypotension. A less likely cause is emboli of thromboplastic material originating from the dead fetus. Fusi and coworkers (1990, 1991) observed that with the death of one twin, acute twin-twin anastomotic transusion from the high-pressure vessels of the living twin to the lowresistance vessels of the dead twin leads rapidly to hypovolemia and ischemic antenatal brain damage in the survivor. In one review of 343 twin pregnancies complicated by single fetal demise, the risk of neurodevelopmental morbidity in monochorionic twins was 26 percent compared with 2 percent in dichorionic twins (Hillman, 2011). This morbidity was related to the gestational age at the death of the cotwin. If the death occurred between 28 and 33 weeks' gestation, monochorionic twins had an almost eightfold risk of neurodevelopmental morbidity compared with dichorionic twins of the same gestational age.
