            "content": "many of the signaling functions of MyD88 and IRAK4 molecules are shared with IL1 family receptors. Thus, at least part of the immune defect in patients with inherited abnormalities in these molecules may be attributed to aberrant signaling by IL1 family members. Note also that NEMO deficiency, which impairs Bcell class switching (see Section 139), also impairs TLR and IL1 receptor family signaling through its block of normal NF\u03baB activation. Immunodeficiency associated with defects in NEMO therefore affects both adaptive and innate immune function. Interestingly, increased viral infections are not typical in patients with MyD88 mutations, despite this protein\u2019s role in signaling by each of the nucleic acidsensing TLRs except TLR3 (for example, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9). This indicates that activation of interferon regulating factors (IRFs) that induce interferon responses downstream of these TLRs remains intact despite the defects in MyD88."

The ability of some TLRs to serve as receptors for host ligands (e.g., hyaluronans, heparan sulfate, saturated fatty acids, high-mobility group box 1) raises the possibility that they also play a role in producing noninfectious sepsis-like states.

The TLR-4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has adjuvant effects, but its use is limited by its toxicity. Small amounts of injected LPS can induce a state of shock and systemic inflammation that mimics Gram-negative sepsis, raising the question whether its adjuvant effect can be separated from its toxic effects. Monophosphoryl lipid A, an LPS derivative and TLR-4 ligand, partly achieves this, retaining adjuvant effects but being associated with much lower toxicity than LPS. Both unmethylated CpG DNA, which activates TLR-9, and imiquimod, a small-molecule drug that acts as a TLR-7 agonist, can provide adjuvant activity experimentally, but neither is approved as an adjuvant in human vaccines."

Danazol binds to androgen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptors and can translocate the androgen receptor into the nucleus to initiate androgen-specific RNA synthesis. It does not bind to intracellular estrogen receptors, but it does bind to sex hormone\u2013 binding and corticosteroid-binding globulins. It inhibits P450scc (the cholesterol side chain\u2013cleaving enzyme), 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17\u03b1-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, P450c17 (17\u03b1-hydroxylase), P450c11 (11\u03b2-hydroxylase), and P450c21 (21\u03b2-hydroxylase). However, it does not inhibit aromatase, the enzyme"

            "content": "How might microbes or their products be involved in the initiating events of RA? The immune system is alerted to the presence of microbial infections through Toll-like receptors (TLRs). There are 10 TLRsinhumansthatrecognizeavarietyofmicrobialproducts,including bacterial cell-surface lipopolysaccharides and heat-shock proteins (TLR4), lipoproteins (TLR2), double-strand RNA viruses (TLR3), and unmethylated CpG DNA from bacteria (TLR9). TLR2, -3, and -4 are abundantly expressed by synovial fibroblasts in early RA and, when bound by their ligands, upregulate production of proinflammatory cytokines. Although such events could amplify inflammatory pathways in RA, a specific role for TLRs in disease pathogenesis has not been elucidated."

Both excitatory and inhibitory actions can occur on the same neuron. 5-HT has been implicated in the regulation of virtually all brain functions, including perception, mood, anxiety, pain, sleep, appetite, temperature, neuroendocrine control, and aggression. Given the broad roles of 5-HT in CNS function and the rich molecular diversity of 5-HT receptors, it is not surprising that many therapeutic agents target the 5-HT system (see Chapters 16, 29, 30, and 32)."
