GRG5 is a gene involved in the development of the neural system, and its expression has been found in the brain and spinal cord. The gene is also expressed during embryonic development, and its expression is necessary for the proper formation of the neural tube and the development of the nervous system. Given this information, we can infer that GRG5 is involved in early embryonic development, not just late embryonic development.

As mentioned previously, the earliest phases of vertebrate development are surprisingly variable, even between closely related species, and it is even hard to say precisely how the axes of an early fly embryo correspond to those of an early frog or mouse embryo.

Cardiogenesis is a finely tuned process with transcriptional control of a complex group of regulatory proteins that activate or inhibit their gene targets in a locationand time-dependent manner. At about 3 weeks of embryonic development, two cardiac cords form and become canalized; at that point, the primordial cardiac tube develops from two sources (cardiac crescent or the first heart field, pharyngeal mesoderm or the second heart field); by 21 days, these fuse into a single cardiac tube beginning at the cranial end.

            "content": "Neuroembryologic studies have identified several milestones of neuroblast formation, migration, cortical organization, neuron differentiation, and connectivity. Certain developmental anomalies can be traced to one of these stages of cytogenesis and histogenesis in the first trimester of gestation and to the growth and differentiation that take place in the second and third trimesters. During the first trimester, postmitotic neurons that will ultimately reside in the cortex arise in the ventricular zone adjacent to the ventricles. They migrate via microtubules along the scaffold of radial glia to form the multilayered cortex. It is interesting that neurons moving up the scaffold must pass through neurons that are already in position in the cortex, leading to an \u201cinside-out\u201d lamination in which the most recently born and arrived neurons reside on the outermost surface of the forming cortex. The complex genetic and epigenetic regulation of this process is an area of active investigation,"

            "content": "The prototype GR isoform is composed of about 800 amino acids and can be divided into three functional domains (see Figure 2\u20136). The glucocorticoid-binding domain is located at the carboxyl terminal of the molecule. The DNA-binding domain is located in the middle of the protein and contains nine cysteine residues. This region folds into a \u201ctwo-finger\u201d structure stabilized by zinc ions connected to cysteines to form two tetrahedrons. This part of the molecule binds to the GREs that regulate glucocorticoid action on glucocorticoidregulated genes. The zinc fingers represent the basic structure by which the DNA-binding domain recognizes specific nucleic acid sequences. The amino-terminal domain is involved in the transactivation activity of the receptor and increases its specificity."

            "content": "At one extreme, the egg is spherically symmetrical, and the axes only become defined during embryogenesis. The mouse comes close to being an example, with little obvious sign of polarity in the egg. Correspondingly, the blastomeres produced by the first few cell divisions seem to be all alike and are remarkably adaptable. If the early mouse embryo is split in two, a pair of identical twins can be produced\u2014two complete, normal individuals from a single cell. Similarly, if one of the cells in a two-cell mouse embryo is destroyed by pricking it with a needle and the resulting \u201chalf-embryo\u201d is placed in the uterus of a foster mother to develop, in many cases a perfectly normal mouse will emerge."
