Few specific treatments have been identified to reduce or prevent brain injury in the vulnerable preterm newborn. One potential neuroprotective therapy is with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) such as erythropoietin and darbepoetin. In addition to stimulating erythropoiesis, ESAs are protective in the developing brain in animal models (Wassink, 2017).

This so-called physiologic nadir is accentuated in premature infants. Erythropoietin is produced in response to the decline in hemoglobin and decreased oxygen delivery. Erythropoiesis subsequently resumes with an increase in the reticulocyte count. The hemoglobin level gradually increases, accompanied by synthesis of increasing amounts of hemoglobin A. By 6 months of age in healthy infants, only trace gamma chain synthesis occurs."

Red blood cell production (erythropoiesis) in the bone marrow is controlled by the hormone erythropoietin, which is synthesized in the kidneys by cortical interstitial cells. Although Hgb levels are normally very stable, decreased O2 delivery, low Hgb concentration, and low PaO2 stimulate the secretion of erythropoietin. This increases the production of red blood cells. Chronic renal disease damages the cortical interstitial cells and thereby suppresses their ability to synthesize erythropoietin. This causes anemia, along with decreased Hgb because of the lack of erythropoietin. Erythropoietin replacement therapy using epoetin alfa (Epogen, Procrit) or darbepoetin alfa (Aranesp) effectively increases red blood cell production."

Neonates can dilute urine similar to adults (75 to 90 mOsm/L),but, because the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is lower,the capacity to excrete a water load is less in infants. GFRreaches adult levels by 1 to 2 years of age. Tubular reabsorption of sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, and phosphateand excretion of hydrogen are all reduced in infants relative to adults. These functions mature independently andat different ages, so a neonate rapidly develops the abilityto reabsorb sodium efficiently, but it takes 2 years for bicarbonate reabsorption to mature.

Women randomized to magnesium sulfate were given a 6-g bolus over 20 to 30 minutes followed by a maintenance infusion of 2 g per hour.

The erythropoietin receptor is a member of the JAK/ STAT superfamily of cytokine receptors that use protein phosphorylation and transcription factor activation to regulate cellular function (see Chapter 2). Erythropoietin also induces release of reticulocytes from the bone marrow. Endogenous erythropoietin is produced primarily in the kidney. In response to tissue hypoxia, more erythropoietin is produced through an increased rate of transcription of the erythropoietin gene. This results in correction of the anemia, provided that the bone marrow response is not impaired by red cell nutritional deficiency (especially iron deficiency), primary bone marrow disorders (see below), or bone marrow suppression from drugs or chronic diseases."

Iron deficiency is commonly seen in populations with increased iron requirements.

            "content": "Erythropoiesis is controlled primarily by fetal erythropoietin because maternal erythropoietin does not cross the placenta. Fetal hormone production is influenced by testosterone, estrogen, prostaglandins, thyroid hormone, and lipoproteins (Stockman, 1992). Serum erythropoietin levels rise with fetal maturity. Although the exact production site is disputed, the fetal liver appears to be an important source until renal production begins. There is a close correlation between the erythropoietin concentration in amnionic fluid and that in umbilical venous blood obtained by cordocentesis. After birth, erythropoietin normally may not be detectable for up to 3 months. In contrast, platelet production reaches stable levels by midpregnancy, although there is some variation across gestation (Fig. The fetal and neonatal platelet count is subject to various agents as discussed in Chapter 15 (p. 307)."

In midgestation, erythropoiesis occurs in the liver and spleen; the bonemarrow becomes the predominant site in the last trimester.Hemoglobin concentration increases from 8 to 10 g/dL at12 weeks to 16.5 to 18 g/dL at 40 weeks. Fetal red blood cell(RBC) production is responsive to erythropoietin; the concentration of this hormone increases with fetal hypoxia and anemia."

Techniques such as the predelivery administration of corticosteroids in premature births to promote lung maturity, attempting to bring early births to 34 to 36 weeks\u2019 gestation, and the treatment of maternal infection have all contributed to improved outcomes in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics, based on a systematic review of randomized clinical trials (e.g, Azzopardi et al and Shankaran et al), has given guidance that hypothermia is an effective therapy for improving neurologic outcome in neonatal encephalopathy. Criteria for patient enrollment that simulate those used in clinical trials of this intervention must be followed to achieve an effect, including early institution of treatment (see"
