It is derived from the same gene as CGRP, but has three different amino acid substitutions. \\u00b1CGRP has been shown to have various physiological functions, including vasodilation and neurotransmission. However, its amyloidogenic properties are not well established. To determine if \\u00b1CGRP has amyloidogenic properties, we need to examine the available evidence. According to document [11], CGRP consists of 37 amino acids, and \\u00b1CGRP differs from CGRP by three amino acids. However, there is no direct evidence in the provided documents that \\u00b1CGRP has amyloidogenic properties. In fact, document [15] mentions that peptide and nonpeptide antagonists of the CGRP receptor have been developed, but it does not mention \\u00b1CGRP. Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot conclude that \\u00b1CGRP has amyloidogenic properties.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

As shown schematically in Fig. 38-2, the A\u03b2 protein is cleaved from APP by the action of proteases termed \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 secretase. One current hypothesis focuses on the manner in which APP is cleaved by these enzymes to give rise to different-length residues of A\u03b2. During normal cellular metabolism, APP is cleaved by either \u03b1 or \u03b2 secretase. The products of this reaction are then cleaved by the \u03b3-secretase isoform of the enzyme. The sequential cleavage by \u03b1 and then \u03b3 produces tiny fragments that are not toxic to neurons. However, cleavage by \u03b2 and then \u03b3 results in a 40-amino-acid product, A\u03b240, and a longer 42-amino-acid form. The latter A\u03b242 form is toxic in several models of Alzheimer disease, and it has been proposed that the ratio of A\u03b242 to A\u03b240 is critical to the neuronal toxicity of amyloid."

The fibrillary form of amyloid is neurotoxic, a mechanism favored as the cause of cell damage in Alzheimer disease. Formation of A\u03b242 is promoted by mutations, either in the APP gene itself or in the presenilins.

The protein aggregates may be released from dead cells and accumulate as amyloid in the extracellular matrix.

Because the brain is composed of a highly organized collection of nerve cells that cannot regenerate, the brain is especially vulnerable to this sort of cumulative damage. Thus, although amyloid fibrils may form in different tissues, and are known to cause pathologies in several sites in the body, the most severe amyloid pathologies are neurodegenerative diseases. For example, the abnormal formation of highly stable amyloid fibrils is thought to play a central causative role in both Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases."

A key initial step is the digestion by either \u03b2 secretase (BASE) or \u03b1 secretase (ADAM10 or ADAM17 [TACE]), producing smaller nontoxic products. Cleavage of the \u03b2 secretase product by \u03b3 secretase (Step 2) results in either the toxic A\u03b242 or the nontoxic A\u03b240 peptide; cleavage of the \u03b1 secretase product by \u03b3 secretase produces the nontoxic P3 peptide. Excess production of A\u03b242 is a key initiator of cellular damage in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Therapeutics for AD have focused on attempts to reduce accumulation of A\u03b242 by antagonizing \u03b2 or \u03b3 secretases, promoting \u03b1 secretase, or clearing A\u03b242 that has already formed by use of specific antibodies."

            "content": "Amyloid fibrils were initially studied because they cause disease. But the same type of structure is now known to be exploited by cells for useful purposes. Eukaryotic cells, for example, store many different peptide and protein hormones that they will secrete in specialized \u201csecretory granules,\u201d which package a high concentration of their cargo in dense cores with a regular structure (see Figure 13\u201365). We now know that these structured cores consist of amyloid fibrils, which in this case have a structure that causes them to dissolve to release soluble cargo after being secreted by exocytosis to the cell exterior (Figure 3\u201334A). Many bacteria use the amyloid structure in a very different way, secreting proteins that form long amyloid fibrils projecting from the cell exterior that help to bind bacterial neighbors into biofilms (Figure 3\u201334B). Because these biofilms help bacteria to survive in adverse environments (including in humans treated with antibiotics), new drugs that"

However, new experiments reveal that a large set of low complexity domains can form amyloid fibers that have functional roles in both the cell nucleus and the cell cytoplasm. These domains are normally unstructured and consist of stretches of amino acid sequence that can span hundreds of amino acids, while containing only a small subset of the 20 different amino acids. In contrast to the disease-associated amyloid in Figure 3\u201333, these newly discovered structures are held together by weaker noncovalent bonds and readily dissociate in response to signals\u2014hence their name reversible amyloids. Many proteins with such domains also contain a different set of domains that bind to specific other protein or RNA molecules. Thus, their controlled aggregation"
