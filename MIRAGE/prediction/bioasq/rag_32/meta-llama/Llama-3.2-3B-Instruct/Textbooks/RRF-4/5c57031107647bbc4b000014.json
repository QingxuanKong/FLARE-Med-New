            "content": "Genetics Gem: Acetaldehyde, the product of ethanol oxidation by the hepatic, cytosolic, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-requiring enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), is oxidized to acetate by the mitochondrial, NAD+-requiring aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2). The majority of individuals of East Asian (but not European or African) heritage have a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that renders ALDH2 essentially inactive. This results in aldehyde-induced facial flushing and mild to moderate intoxication after consumption of small amounts of ethanol. Review Questions: Choose the ONE best answer. RQ1. Many of the metabolic consequences of chronic excessive alcohol consumption seen in AK are the result of an increase in the ratio of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to its oxidized form (NAD+) in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Which of the following statements concerning the effects of the rise in mitochondrial NADH is correct?"
