According to Document [2], PTEN encodes a 403-amino-acid protein, tyrosine phosphatase. It negatively controls the PI3K signaling pathway for the regulation of cell growth and survival by dephosphorylating phosphoinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. In Document [3], PTEN mutations have been identified in exon 5, which contains the tyrosine phosphatase core domain. This suggests that the PTEN catalytic activity is vital for its biological function. Furthermore, in Document [4], PTEN is described as a tumor-suppressor gene. Additionally, in Document [6], PTEN is mentioned as a gene that, when mutated or lost, can contribute to carcinogenesis. Lastly, in Document [7], PTEN is mentioned as a tumor suppressor gene that, when mutated or lost, can lead to the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and enhanced cell survival. Based on this information, PTEN is indeed a tumor suppressor gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

As expected from our previous discussion, cancers can activate this pathway in many different ways. Thus, for example, a growth factor receptor can become abnormally activated, as in Figure 20\u201319. Also very common in cancers is the loss of the PTEN phosphatase, an enzyme that normally suppresses the PI 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR pathway by dephosphorylating the PI (3,4,5) P3 molecules that the PI 3-kinase forms (see pp. 859\u2013861). PTEN is thus a common tumor-suppressor gene."

We have already discussed the \u201cbraking\u201d effect of the tumor suppressors NF1 and PTEN on signals downstream of growth factor receptors and RAS, allowing them to oppose the Warburg effect. Indeed, it may be that many (and perhaps all) tumor suppressors that induce growth arrest suppress the Warburg effect. For example, p53, arguably the most important tumor suppressor, upregulates target genes that collectively inhibit glucose uptake, glycolysis, lipogenesis, and the generation of NADPH (a key cofactor needed for the biosynthesis of macromolecules). Thus, it is increasingly clear that the functions of many oncoproteins and tumor suppressors are inextricably intertwined with cellular metabolism."

Both kinds of mutations interfere with breakdown of GTP, which is essential to inactivate RAS. RAS is thus trapped in its activated, GTP-bound form, and the cell is forced into a continuously proliferating state. It follows from this scenario that the consequences of activating mutations in RAS should be mimicked by loss-offunction mutations in GAPs, which would lead to a failure to simulate GTP hydrolysis and thereby restrain RAS. Indeed, the GAP neurofibromin-1 (NF1) is mutated in the cancer-prone familial disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 (Chapter 22) and is a bona fide tumor suppressor. Similarly, another important tumor suppressor called PTEN is a negative inhibitor of PI3 kinase and is frequently mutated in carcinomas, certain leukemias, and other cancers as well."

They include PTEN, an inhibitor of the AKT pathway, and STAT5, both of which are downstream of activated growth factor receptors and necessary for normal stem cell functions including self-renewal, at least in mouse models. The connections between these molecules remain to be defined, and their role in physiologic regulation of stem cell self-renewal is still poorly understood."
