We can start by looking at the documents and identifying its primary uses, side effects, and interactions. Thalidomide is mentioned in various documents as a drug with immunomodulatory properties, used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, erythema nodosum leprosum, and other autoimmune disorders. It is also mentioned as a potential treatment for certain cancers, such as renal cell carcinoma, and has been used in clinical trials for other diseases. However, it is also known for its teratogenic effects and is tightly regulated due to its potential to cause severe birth defects. Despite this, it is still used in certain cases, particularly for its immunomodulatory effects. Therefore, the answer to the question is that thalidomide is indeed used as an immunomodulatory drug nowadays, although its use is closely regulated and limited due to its side effects.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Immunomodulatory derivatives of thalidomide are termed IMiDs. Some IMiDs are much more potent than thalidomide in regulating cytokines and affecting T-cell proliferation. Lenalidomide is an oral IMiD that in animal and in vitro studies has been shown to be similar to thalidomide in action, but with less toxicity, especially teratogenicity. Lenalidomide was approved by the FDA when trials showed its effectiveness in the treatment of the myelodysplastic syndrome with the chromosome 5q31 deletion. Clinical trials using lenalidomide to treat multiple myeloma showed similar efficacy, leading to approval for both primary and relapsed/refractory myeloma. Pomalidomide (originally called CC-4047) is a newer oral IMiD that is FDA approved.

Thalidomide is an oral sedative drug that was withdrawn from the market in the 1960s because of disastrous teratogenic effects when used during pregnancy. Nevertheless, it has significant immunomodulatory actions and is currently in active use or in clinical trials for more than 40 different illnesses. Thalidomide inhibits angiogenesis and has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. It inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), reduces phagocytosis by neutrophils, increases production of IL-10, alters adhesion molecule expression, and enhances cell-mediated immunity via interactions with T cells. The complex actions of thalidomide continue to be studied as its clinical use evolves."

Although the mechanism of thalidomide\u2019s dramatic action against ENL is not entirely clear, the drug\u2019s efficacy is probably attributable to its reduction of TNF levels and IgM synthesis and its slowing of polymorphonuclear leukocyte migration. After the reaction is controlled, lower doses of thalidomide (50\u2013200 mg nightly) are effective in preventing relapses of ENL. Clofazimine in high doses (300 mg nightly) has some efficacy against ENL, but its use permits only a modest reduction of the glucocorticoid dose necessary for ENL control."

Treatments for unwanted immune responses, such as graft rejection, autoimmunity, or allergic reactions, include conventional drugs\u2014anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, and immunosuppressive drugs\u2014as well as biologic agents such as monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulatory proteins. Anti-inflammatory drugs, of which the most potent are the corticosteroids, have a broad spectrum of actions and a wide range of toxic side-effects. Their dose must be carefully controlled, and they are normally used in combination with either cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs. The cytotoxic drugs work by killing dividing cells and thereby prevent lymphocyte proliferation, but they suppress all immune responses indiscriminately and also kill other types of dividing cells. The immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporin A and rapamycin, interfere in specific signaling pathways and are generally less toxic, but are more expensive and still suppress the immune response somewhat indiscriminately."

            "content": "Dapsone is usually well tolerated. Many patients develop some hemolysis, particularly if they have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Methemoglobinemia is common but usually is not clinically significant. Gastrointestinal intolerance, fever, pruritus, and rash occur. During dapsone therapy of lepromatous leprosy, erythema nodosum leprosum often develops. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish reactions to dapsone from manifestations of the underlying illness. Erythema nodosum leprosum may be suppressed by thalidomide (see Chapter 55). Rifampin (see earlier discussion) in a dosage of 600 mg daily is highly effective in leprosy and is given with at least one other drug to prevent emergence of resistance. Even a dose of 600 mg per month may be beneficial in combination therapy."

            "content": "Thalidomide was marketed outside the United States from 1956 to 1960, before its teratogenicity was appreciated. The ensuing disaster, with thousands of afected children, was instructive of several important teratological principles. First, the placenta is not an efective barrier to the transfer of toxic substances from mother to embryo (Dally, 1998). Second, diferent species show extreme variability in their susceptibility to drugs and chemicals. Namely, thalidomide produced no defects in multiple rodent species and was assumed to be safe for humans. Last, exposure timing and defect type are often closely related (Vargesson, 2015). For example, upper-limb amelia may develop with thalidomide exposure during days 24 to 30 postconception, upper-limb phocomelia with exposure during days 24 to 33, and lower-limb phocomelia with exposure during days 27 to 33."
