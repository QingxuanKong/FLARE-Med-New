            "content": "Schizophrenia is characterized by a disintegration of thought processes and emotional responsiveness. Symp-toms commonly include auditory hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions, disorganized thinking and speech, and social and occupational dysfunction. For many patients, first-generation (eg, haloperidol) and second-generation agents (eg, risperidone) are of equal efficacy for treating positive symptoms. Second generation agents are often more effective for treating negative symptoms and cogni-tive dysfunction and have lower risk of tardive dyskinesia and hyperprolactinemia. Other indications for the use of selected antipsychotics include bipolar disorder, psychotic depression, Tourette syndrome, disturbed behavior in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and in the case of older drugs (eg, chlorpromazine), treatment of emesis, and pruritus."

            "content": "Ginkgo has been used to treat cerebral insufficiency and dementia of the Alzheimer type. The term cerebral insufficiency, however, includes a variety of manifestations ranging from poor concentration and confusion to anxiety and depression as well as physical complaints such as hearing loss and headache. For this reason, studies evaluating cerebral insufficiency tend to be more inclusive and difficult to assess than trials evaluating dementia. A meta-analysis of ginkgo for cognitive impairment or dementia was performed by the Cochrane Collaboration. They reviewed 36 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials ranging in length from 3 to 52 weeks. Significant improvements in cognition and activities of daily living were observed at 12 but not 24 weeks. Significant improvements in clinical global assessment however, were observed at 24 but not 12 weeks. The authors concluded that the effects of ginkgo in the treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia were unpredictable and"

            "content": "A list of the major drugs and available dosage strengths is provided in Table 449-5. Despite the many therapeutic agents available for the treatment of PD, patients continue to experience disease progression with intolerable disability. A neuroprotective therapy that slows or stops disease progression remains the major unmet therapeutic need in PD. As noted above, trials of certain drugs (e.g., selegiline and rasagiline) have provided positive results consistent with a disease-modifying effect. However, it is not possible to determine if the positive results were due to neuroprotection with slowing of disease progression or confounding symptomatic effects that mask ongoing progression. CoQ10, a mitochondrial bioenhancer and antioxidant, attracted attention with a positive preliminary trial, but this was not replicated in larger double-blind studies."

            "content": "2602 In a prospective observational study, the use of estrogen replacement therapy appeared to protect\u2014by about 50%\u2014against development of AD in women. This study seemed to confirm the results of two earlier case-controlled studies. Sadly, a prospective placebo-controlled study of a combined estrogen-progesterone therapy for asymptomatic postmenopausal women increased, rather than decreased, the prevalence of dementia. This study markedly dampened enthusiasm for hormonal treatments to prevent dementia. Additionally, no benefit has been found in the treatment of AD with estrogen alone. A controlled trial of an extract of Ginkgo biloba found modest improvement in cognitive function in subjects with AD and vascular dementia. Unfortunately, a comprehensive 6-year multicenter prevention study using ginkgo found no slowing of progression to dementia in the treated group. Vaccination against A\u03b242 has proved highly efficacious in mouse models of AD, helping clear brain amyloid and preventing"
