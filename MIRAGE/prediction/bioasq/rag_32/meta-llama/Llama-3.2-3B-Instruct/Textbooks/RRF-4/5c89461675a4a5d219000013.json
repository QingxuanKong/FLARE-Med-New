And having crossed it, why do they never cross back again? The answers lie in a change in the responsiveness of the growth cones during their journey. As the growth cones cross the midline, they lose sensitivity to Netrin and become sensitive instead to a signal protein called Slit (see Figure 21\u201374). Slit is also produced by the floor plate, but it has the opposite effect to that of Netrin: it repels the growth Figure 21\u201374 The guidance of commissural axons.

The growth cones cross the floor plate and then turn abruptly through a right angle to follow a longitudinal path up toward the brain, parallel to the floor plate but never again crossing it (Figure 21\u201374). The first stage of the journey depends on a concentration gradient of the signal protein Netrin, secreted by the cells of the floor plate: the commissural growth cones sniff their way toward its source."

The responses of the growth cone depend on the receptors that it expresses: as commissural neurons approach the floor plate, the Slit receptors are kept inactive by an inhibitory protein (Robo3.1) in the same membrane, allowing the commissural axons to grow to the midline without being repelled. Robo3.1 is lost as the growth cones cross the midline; now the growth cones become sensitive to repulsion by Slit and are thereby prevented from crossing back to the other side. At the same time, signals from the Slit receptors interfere with those from the Netrin receptors, making the growth cones deaf to the signal that attracted them to the floor plate initially. A similar mechanism, using similar proteins, seems to govern midline crossing of commissural axons in other animals, including flies and worms."

The pro-tein can then oligomerize and recruit other complex members. The net result is the auto-activation of pro-caspase 1 to caspase 1. This event is pivotal to all known inflammasome signaling pathways.57,58 The caspase-1 products assemble to form the IL-1 converting enzyme (ICE), which cleaves the proforms of IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, and IL-33 to form their active, mature forms required for secretion from the cell.59The inflammasome-activated cytokines, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, are potent proinflammatory molecules that promote key immune responses essential to host defense. Both IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 lack a signal sequence, which is usually necessary for the secretion of cellular proteins. More than 20 proteins in addition to IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 undergo unconventional protein secretion independent of the ER and Golgi, including a number of the DAMP molecules.60 Currently, the"
