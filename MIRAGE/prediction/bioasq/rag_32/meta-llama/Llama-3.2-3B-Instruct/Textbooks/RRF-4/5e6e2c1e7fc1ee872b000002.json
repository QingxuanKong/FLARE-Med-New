ASCOM is a complex that plays a role in the regulation of apoptosis. MLL3 is a gene involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling. From the provided documents, we can see that MLL3 is mentioned in the context of pancreatic cancer and its association with the SMAD4 gene. However, there is no direct mention of MLL3 in the context of the ASCOM complex. Therefore, we can infer that MLL3 is not part of the ASCOM complex.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Activation of the inflammasome proceeds in several stages. The first is the aggregation of LRR domains of several NLRP3 molecules, or other NLRP molecules, by a specific trigger or recognition event. This aggregation induces the pyrin domains of NLRP3 to interact with pyrin domains of another protein named ASC (also called PYCARD). ASC is an adaptor protein composed of an amino-terminal pyrin domain and a carboxy-terminal CARD domain. Pyrin and CARD domains are each able to form polymeric filamentous structures (Fig. 3.20).

As discussed in Chapter 2, the formation of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate is highly unfavorable energetically. As we shall see, ATP synthase can produce ATP only because of allosteric shape changes in this protein complex that directly couple ATP synthesis to the energetically favorable flow of protons across its membrane."

After a period of normal development, progressive stiffening and ataxia of gait, spasticity, optic atrophy,intellectual deterioration, and absent reflexes occur. Diagnostictesting reveals increased cerebral spinal fluid protein (a sign ofCNS demyelination) and slowing of motor nerve conductionvelocity (a sign of peripheral demyelination). Older school-agechildren with the juvenile form of MLD may present with gradual onset of behavior difficulties and declining academic abilities, succeeded by gait difficulties, clumsiness, slurred speech,and sometimes seizures. Relentless progression is the rule.Bone marrow transplant is a treatment option, particularly if asibling is diagnosed with MLD before symptom onset."
