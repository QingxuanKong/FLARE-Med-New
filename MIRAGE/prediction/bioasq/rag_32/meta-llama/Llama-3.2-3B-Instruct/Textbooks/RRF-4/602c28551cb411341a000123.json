Interpretation of the results may be difficult because of unexpected confounding variables, loss of subjects from some groups, or realization that results differ markedly between certain subgroups within the active treatment (new drug) group.

Therefore, new \u201cadaptive\u201d statistical methods are under development that allow changes in the study design when interim data evaluation indicates the need. Preliminary results with such methods suggest that they may allow decisions regarding superiority as well as noninferiority, shortening of trial duration, discovery of new therapeutic benefits, and more reliable conclusions regarding the results (see Bhatt & Mehta, 2016)."

            "content": "Trametinib and cobimetinib are reversible inhibitors of mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and kinase 2 (MEK2), and in combination with a BRAF inhibitor molecule, they are approved for patients with metastatic melanoma whose tumors express the BRAF V600E or V600K mutation. While these agents have clinical activity as monotherapies, clinical studies suggest that the most promising clinical activity is seen when they are used in combination with a BRAF inhibitor."
