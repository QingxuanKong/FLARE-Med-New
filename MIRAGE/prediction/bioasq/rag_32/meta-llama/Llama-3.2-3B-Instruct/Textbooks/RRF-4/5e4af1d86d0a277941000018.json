Metformin decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis and increases insulin sensitivity. Metformin has other actions including inhibition of mTOR and mitochondrial complex I and activation of the transcription factor SKN-1/Nrf2. Metformin increases lifespan in different mouse strains including female mouse strains predisposed to high incidence of mammary tumors. At a biochemical level, metformin supplementation is associated with reduced oxidative damage and inflammation and mimics some of the gene expression changes seen with caloric restriction."

Treatment is initiated at 500 mg with a meal and increased gradually in divided doses. Common schedules would be 500 mg once or twice daily increased to 1000 mg twice daily. The maximal dosage is 850 mg three times a day. Epidemiologic studies suggest that metformin use may reduce the risk of some cancers. These data are still preliminary, and the speculative mechanism of action is a decrease in insulin (which also functions as a growth factor) levels as well as direct cellular effects mediated by AMPK. Other studies suggest a reduction in cardiovascular deaths in humans and an increase in longevity in mice (see Chapter 60)."

Metformin reduces fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and insulin levels, improves the lipid profile, and promotes modest weight loss. An extended-release form is available and may have fewer gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, metallic taste). Because of its relatively slow onset of action and gastrointestinal symptoms with higher doses, the initial dose should be low and then escalated every 2\u20133 weeks based on SMBG measurements. Metformin is effective as monotherapy and can be used in combination with other oral agents or with insulin. The major toxicity of metformin, lactic acidosis, is very rare and can be prevented by careful patient selection. Vitamin B12 levels are ~30% lower during metformin treatment.

Almost all reported cases have involved patients with associated risk factors that should have contraindicated its use (kidney, liver, or cardiorespiratory insufficiency; alcoholism). Acute kidney failure can occur rarely in certain patients receiving radiocontrast agents. Metformin therapy should therefore be temporarily halted on the day of radiocontrast administration and restarted a day or two later after confirmation that renal function has not deteriorated. Renal function should be checked at least annually in patients on metformin therapy, and lower doses should be used in the elderly who may have limited renal reserve and in those with eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min per 1.73 m2."

            "content": "Certain principles have guided the selection of drugs in the most effective drug combinations, and they provide a paradigm for the development of new drug therapeutic programs. 1. Efficacy: Only drugs known to have some level of clinical efficacy when used alone against a given tumor should be selected for use in combination. If available, drugs that produce complete remission in some fraction of patients are preferred to those that produce only partial responses. 2. Toxicity: When several drugs of a given class are available and are equally effective, a drug should be selected on the basis of toxicity that does not overlap with the toxicity of other drugs in the combination. Although such selection leads to a wider range of adverse effects, it minimizes the risk of a lethal effect caused by multiple insults to the same organ system by different drugs and allows dose intensity to be maximized. 3."
