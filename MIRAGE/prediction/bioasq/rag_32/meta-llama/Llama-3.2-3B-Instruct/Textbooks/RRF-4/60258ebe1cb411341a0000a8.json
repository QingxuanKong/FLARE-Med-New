IL-6 is a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of RA, with detrimental effects on both joint inflammation and damage. IL-6 binding to its receptor activates intracellular signaling pathways that affect the acute-phase response, cytokine production, and osteoclast activation. Clinical trials attest to the clinical efficacy of tocilizumab therapy for RA, both as monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate and other DMARDs. Tocilizumab has been associated with an increased risk of infection, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia; however, the hematologic abnormalities appear to be reversible upon stopping the drug. In addition, this agent has been shown to increase LDL cholesterol; however, it is not known as yet if this effect on lipid levels increases the risk for development of atherosclerotic disease."

IL-6 is involved in a variety of physiologic processes such as T-cell activation, hepatic acute-phase protein synthesis, and stimulation of the inflammatory processes involved in diseases such as RA and systemic sclerosis (SSc).

IL-6 can suppress several CYP450 isoenzymes; thus, inhibiting IL-6 may restore CYP450 activities to higher levels. This may be clinically relevant for drugs that are CYP450 substrates and have a narrow therapeutic window (eg, cyclosporine or warfarin), and dosage adjustment of these medications may be needed. Tocilizumab can be used in combination with nonbiologic DMARDs or as monotherapy. In the United States the recommended starting dose for RA is 4 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks followed by an increase to 8 mg/kg (not exceeding 800 mg/infusion) dependent on clinical response."

With both of these factors present, the risk of PML is approximately 11 per 1,000 patients (Bloomgren et al). Serum JC virus antibody ELISA testing is performed for all patients in whom treatment with natalizumab is being considered; periodic retesting is important to reduce false-negative results or detect seroconversion, but the optimal frequency of retesting is unknown."

            "content": "Herceptin is thought to act by blocking the binding of the natural ligand (so far unidentified) to this receptor, and by downregulating the level of expression of the receptor. The effects of this antibody can be enhanced when it is combined with conventional chemotherapy. Beyond blocking a growth signal for tumor cells, experiments in mice suggest that some of trastuzumab\u2019s antitumor effects also involve innate and adaptive immune responses, such as directing ADCC or inducing antitumor T-cell responses. A monoclonal antibody that has yielded excellent results in the treatment of non-Hodgkin\u2019s B-cell lymphoma is the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, which triggers the apoptosis of B cells upon binding to CD20 on their surface (see Section 16-7). ADCC may be another mechanism by which rituximab acts, as its clinical efficacy has been linked to polymorphisms in activating Fc receptors."
