Document [13] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) mentions that the FDA has approved a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit to assay anti-HER2/neu antibodies (Stratify JCV Antibody ELISA; Focus Diagnostics, Cypress, CA), which suggests the presence of a companion diagnostic for HER2/neu testing.

The group\u2019s E2100 trial showed that when bevacizumab was added to paclitaxel chemotherapy, median progression-free survival increased to 11.3 months from the 5.8 months seen in patients who received paclitaxel alone.194 The results were not repro-duced in other trials, and the indication for the drug was revoked by the FDA in 2011.Indices of Apoptosis. Alterations in programmed cell death (apoptosis), which may be triggered by p53-dependent or p53-independent factors, may be important prognostic and pre-dictive biomarkers in breast cancer.195-197 Bcl-2 family proteins appear to regulate a step in the evolutionarily conserved pathway for apoptosis, with some members functioning as inhibitors of apoptosis and others as promoters of apoptosis. Bcl-2 is the only oncogene that acts by inhibiting apoptosis rather than by directly increasing cellular"

A series of acquired \u201cdriver\u201d mutations have been identified in sporadic breast cancer by major sequencing consortia. Unfortunately, most occur in no more than 5% of cases and generally do not have effective agents to target them, so \u201cpersonalized medicine\u201d is for now more of a dream than a reality."

There are no published trial data for once-daily gentamicin as plague therapy in adults or children, but this regimen is efficacious in gram-negative sepsis of other causes and was successful in a recent outbreak of pneumonic plague in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Neonates up to 1 week of age and premature infants should receive gentamicin (2.5 mg/kg IV bid)."
