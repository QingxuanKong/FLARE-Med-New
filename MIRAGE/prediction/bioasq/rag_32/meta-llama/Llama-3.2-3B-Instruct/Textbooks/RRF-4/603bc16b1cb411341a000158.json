The key phrase to focus on is 'not surprisingly, therefore, the mechanisms used to signal between cells in animals and in plants have both similarities and differences.' This implies that the mechanisms of cell communication in plants and animals have evolved independently. However, the question asks about erabutoxin b, which is mentioned in document 25 (Title: Immunology_Janeway) as a toxin that is recognized and destroyed by cytotoxic T cells of skin cells modified by a plant molecule. Given this context, we can infer that erabutoxin b is likely to be found in plants, as it is related to a plant molecule and is used by cytotoxic T cells to recognize and destroy skin cells modified by that molecule. Therefore, the correct answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

They diffuse readily through cell walls and can either act locally or be transported to influence cells further away. Each growth regulator can have multiple effects. The specific effect depends on environmental conditions, the nutritional state of the plant, the responsiveness of the target cells, and which other growth regulators are acting."

Phototropin is associated with the plasma membrane and is partly responsible for phototropism, the tendency of plants to grow toward light. Phototropism occurs by directional cell elongation, which is stimulated by auxin, but the links between phototropin and auxin are unknown. Cryptochromes are flavoproteins that are sensitive to blue light. They are structurally related to blue-light-sensitive enzymes called photolyases, which are involved in the repair of ultraviolet-induced DNA damage in all organisms, except most mammals. Unlike phytochromes, cryptochromes are also found in animals, where they have an important role in circadian clocks (see Figure 15\u201366). Although cryptochromes are thought to have evolved from the photolyases, they do not have a role in DNA repair."

The new cells are usually produced in special regions called meristems, and they are generally small in comparison with their final size. To accommodate subsequent cell growth, the walls of the newborn cells, called primary cell walls, are thin and extensible, although tough. Once cell growth stops, the wall no longer needs to be extensible: sometimes the primary wall is retained without major modification, but, more commonly, a rigid secondary cell wall is produced by depositing new layers of matrix inside the old ones. These new layers generally have a composition that is significantly different from that of the primary wall. The most common additional polymer in secondary walls is lignin, a complex network of covalently linked phenolic compounds found in the walls of the xylem vessels and fiber"

These are dimeric, cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases, which respond differentially and reversibly to red and far-red light: whereas red light usually activates the kinase activity of the phytochrome, far-red light inactivates it. When activated by red light, the phytochrome is thought to phosphorylate itself and then to phosphorylate one or more other proteins in the cell. In some light responses, the activated phytochrome translocates into the nucleus, where it activates transcription regulators to alter gene transcription (Figure 15\u201373).

            "content": "In spite of the radical difference in structure between plasmodesmata and gap junctions, they seem to function in remarkably similar ways. Evidence obtained by injecting tracer molecules of different sizes suggests that plasmodesmata allow the passage of molecules with a molecular weight of less than about 800, which cytoplasm plasmodesmataplasma membrane lining plasmodesma, connecting two adjacent cells smooth endoplasmic reticulum desmotubule 100 nm cell walls of adjacent plant cells Figure 19\u201327 Plasmodesmata. (a) the cytoplasmic channels of plasmodesmata pierce the plant cell wall and connect cells in a plant together. (B) Each plasmodesma is lined with plasma membrane that is common to the two connected cells. It usually also contains a fine tubular structure, the desmotubule, derived from smooth endoplasmic reticulum."
