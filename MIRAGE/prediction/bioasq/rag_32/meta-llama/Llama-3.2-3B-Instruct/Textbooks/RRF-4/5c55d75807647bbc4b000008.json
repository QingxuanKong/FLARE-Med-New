Bobble head doll syndrome is a condition characterized by a rhythmic head movement, similar to a bobbing or nodding motion, which is often associated with suprasellar arachnoid cysts or third ventricular enlargement. Hydrocephalus, on the other hand, refers to an increase in the volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricular system of the brain. The documents provide information on the causes and characteristics of hydrocephalus, including non-communicating and communicating hydrocephalus, as well as its effects on the brain and body. We need to determine if there is a direct connection between bobble head doll syndrome and hydrocephalus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The type that occurs early in life, before fusion of the cranial sutures, leads to enlargement of the head. If the cranial sutures have fused and the accumulation of CSF is very gradual, the head remains normal in size and the ventricular enlargement may remain asymptomatic or later in life cause gait, urinary and cognitive difficulties. A special form of the latter is arrested or compensated hydrocephalus of late adult life that is one of the causes of normal-pressure hydrocephalus that is addressed in Chap. 6 and in the following text."

This disorder most often is a consequence of impaired flow or decreased resorption of CSF. If there is a localized obstacle to CSF flow within the ventricular system, then a portion of the ventricles enlarges while the remainder does not. This pattern is referred to as noncommunicating hydrocephalus and most commonly is caused by masses obstructing the foramen of Monro or compressing the cerebral aqueduct. In communicating hydrocephalus, the entire ventricular system is enlarged; it is usually caused by reduced CSF resorption. If hydrocephalus develops in infancy before closure of the cranial sutures, the head enlarges. Once the sutures fuse, hydrocephalus causes ventricular expansion and increased intracranial pressure, but no change in head circumference ("

The hydrocephalic head is distinguished by several features: frontal protuberance, or bossing; a tendency for the eyes to turn down so that the sclerae are visible between the upper eyelids and iris (sunset sign); thinning of the scalp and prominence of scalp veins; separation of the cranial sutures; and a \u201ccracked pot\u201d sound on percussion of the skull. Infantile hydrocephalus usually comes to medical attention because of an expanding cranium that exceeds normal dimensions for age.

CSF flows upward from the interpeduncular cistern but is trapped above the sella by thickened arachnoid (membrane of Liliequist). As the CSF accumulates, it forms a cyst that invaginates the third ventricle; the dome of the cyst may intermittently block the foramina of Monro and cause hydrocephalus (see Fox and Al-Mefty). Children with this condition exhibit a curious to-and-fro bobbing and nodding of the head, like a doll with a weighted head resting on a coiled spring. This has been referred to as the \u201cbobble-head doll syndrome\u201d by Benton and colleagues; it can be cured by emptying the cyst. Seesaw and other pendular and jerk types of nystagmus may also result from these suprasellar lesions."

In such settings, the hydrocephalus merely reflects the primary disorder and is of no clinical significance. Herniation is the displacement of brain tissue from one compartment to another in response to increased intra-cranial pressure. The intra-cranial compartment is divided by rigid dural folds (falx and tentorium). If the pressure is sufficiently high, portions of the brain are displaced across these rigid structures.

            "content": "sometimes aggravated acutely by hemorrhage; there may be papilledema, an unusual finding in a hydrocephalic infant with enlarging head. Headaches, lethargy, stupor, spastic weakness of the legs, unsteadiness of gait, and diplopia are more frequent in the older child. Tumors that arise from the choroid plexus and project into the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle may present with a syndrome of the cerebellopontine angle (see in the following text). One consequence of the tumor (rather uncertain or inconsistent) may be increased CSF formation, which contributes to the hydrocephalus. Some of the tumors acquire more malignant attributes (mitoses, atypia of nuclei) and invade surrounding brain. They have the appearance of a carcinoma and may be mistaken for an epithelial metastasis from an extracranial site."
