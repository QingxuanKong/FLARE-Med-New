Document [0] states that the first important achievement in the biologic understanding of Huntington disease was the discovery of a marker linked to the huntingtin gene (HTT) and localized to the short arm of chromosome 4. Document [5] and [6] also mention the huntingtin gene and its relation to Huntington's disease. However, they specify that the expansion is of a CAG repeat, not CTG. Document [1] mentions that genetic testing is the primary laboratory test for the determination of Huntington's disease, which is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene on chromosome 4. Document [7] and [8] also confirm that Huntington's disease is caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat in the HTT gene on chromosome 4. Therefore, the correct answer is that Huntington's disease is not caused by expansion of a CTG repeat, but rather a CAG repeat in the HTT gene on chromosome 4.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Subsequently, these investigators and others identified the mutation as an excessively long repeat of the trinucleotide CAG within the gene, the length (number) of which determines not only the presence of the disease, but also the age of onset, longer repeat lengths being associated with an earlier appearance of signs. The result of the expansion is the accumulation of abnormal protein also termed huntingtin. At the Huntington gene locus there are normally 11 to 34 (median: 19) consecutive repetitions of the CAG triplet, each coding for glutamine. Individuals with 35 to 39 triplets may eventually manifest the disease but it tends to be late in onset and mild in degree, or limited to the below-mentioned \u201csenile chorea.\u201d"

At this locus on chromosome 19q there is a specific molecular defect, an unstable trinucleotide sequence (CTG) in the DMPK gene that is longer in affected individuals than it is in healthy siblings or unaffected subjects. Whereas healthy individuals will have 5 to 30 CTG repeats, patients with myotonic dystrophy have 50 to 2,000. Longer sequences are associated with more severe disease, and they increase in size through successive generations lead to earlier occurrence (genetic anticipation), particularly in DM1. The CTG repeats reside within the myotonin protein kinase gene. It is of considerable interest that these CTG repeating segments do not code for a protein (i.e., they are intronic), quite unlike conditions such as Huntington disease in which the triplet expansion codes for amino acid sequences within a protein."

There is a strong genotype-phenotype correlation, with larger numbers of repeats resulting in earlier-onset disease. Once the symptoms appear, however, the course of the illness is not affected by repeat length. Further expansions of the CAG (glutamine-encoding) repeats occur during spermatogenesis, so paternal transmission may be associated with earlier onset in the next generation, a phenomenon referred to as anticipation (Chapter 7). HD appears to be caused by a toxic gain-of-function related to the expanded polyglutamine tract in huntingtin."

Trinucleotide repeat expansion: Occasionally, a sequence of three bases that is repeated in tandem will become amplified in number so that too many copies of the triplet occur. If this happens within the coding region of a gene, the protein will contain many extra copies of one amino acid. For example, expansion of the CAG codon in exon 1 of the gene for huntingtin protein leads to the insertion of many extra glutamine residues in the protein, causing the neurodegenerative disorder Huntington disease (Fig. 32.4). The additional glutamines result in an abnormally long protein that is cleaved, producing toxic fragments that aggregate in neurons. If the trinucleotide repeat expansion occurs in an untranslated region (UTR) of a gene, the result can be a decrease in the amount of protein produced, as seen in fragile X syndrome and myotonic dystrophy.

Some general principles follow: In all cases, gene functions are altered by an expansion of the repeats, but the precise threshold at which premutations are converted to full mutations differs with each disorder. Whereas the expansion in fragile X syndrome occurs during oogenesis, in other disorders such as Huntington disease, premutations are converted to full mutations during spermatogenesis. The expansion may involve any part of the gene, and the range of possibilities can be divided into two broad categories: those that affect untranslated regions (as in fragile X syndrome) and those that affect coding regions (as in Huntington disease) ("

Symptoms manifest between ages 20 and 50: chorea, athetosis, aggression, depression, dementia (sometimes initially mistaken for substance abuse). Anticipation results from expansion of CAG repeats. Caudate loses ACh and GABA. Atrophy of caudate and putamen with ex vacuo ventriculomegaly. \u2022 dopamine, \u0090 GABA, \u0090 ACh in brain. Neuronal death via NMDA-R binding and glutamate excitotoxicity. Most common cause of dementia in elderly. Down syndrome patients have \u008f risk of developing Alzheimer disease, as APP is located on chromosome 21. ACh. Associated with the following altered proteins: ApoE-2: \u0090 risk of sporadic form"

It is characterized by choreoathetotic movements, progressive dementia, and psychiatric manifestations. Because the mean age of onset is 40 years, Huntington disease rarely complicates pregnancy. Prenatal diagnosis is discussed in Chapter 14 (p. 288). Prenatal screening is controversial, and because this usually is a late-onset adult disease, extensive counseling is important (Schulman, 2015)."

But if by any chance these children go through life without it, the thread is broken and the grandchildren and great grandchildren of the original shakers may rest assured that they are free from disease.\u201d Vessie in a review of 962 patients with Huntington chorea, found only 5 who had descended from unaffected parents. Possibly, in these 5 patients, a parent had the trait, in very mild form, or parentage was in question, because spontaneous mutations are rare."

            "content": "DRPLA has a variable presentation that may include progressive ataxia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, seizures, myoclonus, and dementia. DRPLA is due to unstable CAG triplet repeats in the open reading frame of a gene named atrophin located on chromosome 12p12-ter. Larger expansions are found in patients with earlier onset. The number of repeats is 49 in patients with DRPLA and \u226426 in normal individuals. Anticipation occurs in successive generations, with earlier onset of disease in association with an increasing CAG repeat number in children who inherit the disease from their father. One well-characterized family in North Carolina has a phenotypic variant known as the Haw River syndrome, now recognized to be due to the DRPLA mutation."
