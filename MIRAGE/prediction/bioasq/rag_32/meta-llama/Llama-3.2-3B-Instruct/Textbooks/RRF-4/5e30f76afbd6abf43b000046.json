D-Penicillamine has been extensively used as an antifibrotic agent. In retrospective studies, D-penicillamine stabilized and improved skin induration, prevented new internal organ involvement, and improved survival. However, a randomized controlled clinical trial in early active SSc found no difference in the extent of skin involvement between patients treated with standard-dose (750 mg/d) or very low-dose (125 mg every other day) D-penicillamine. Recent clinical trials show benefit of pirfenidone and of nintedanib in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, with significant slowing of the loss of lung function. Whether these two new drugs will have comparable efficacy in the treatment of SSc-associated lung disease is still under investigation."

Anti-inflammatory therapies have proven to be of little use, in line with the idea that inflammation is of secondary pathogenic importance. By contrast, anti-fibrotic therapies such as nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and pirfenidone, an inhibitor of TGF-\u03b2, have produced positive outcomes in clinical trials and are now approved for use in patients with IPF. The overall prognosis remains poor, however; survival is only 3 to 5 years, and lung transplantation is the only definitive treatment."

Involvement of the viscera, including esophageal lesions, pulmonary hypertension, and biliary cirrhosis, may not occur at all or occur late.

Inset, higher magnification showing thick hyalinized collagen bundles replace skin appendages. Right panel: Inflammation in the reticular dermis. Mononuclear inflammatory cells infiltrating the dermis and intradermal adipose tissue. B. Early interstitial lung disease. Diffuse fibrosis of the alveolar septae and a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate. Trichrome stain. C. Pulmonary arterial obliterative vasculopathy. Striking intimal hyperplasia and narrowing of the lumen of a small pulmonary artery, with minimal interstitial fibrosis, in a patient with limited cutaneous SSc."

            "content": "Two groups of pathologic conditions are associated with the malfunction of proteasome-mediated degradation. The frst group of diseases results from a loss of proteasome function because of mutations in the system of ubiquitinactivating enzymes. This leads to a decrease in protein degradation and their subsequent accumulation in the cell cytoplasm (e.g., in Angelman syndrome and Alzheimer\u2019s disease). The second group of diseases results from an accelerated degradation of proteins by overexpressed proteins involved in this system (e.g., infections with human papilloma virus). The recent discovery of specifc proteasome inhibitors holds promise for treatment of cancers and certain viral infections. The protein synthetic system of the cell consists of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes."
