Enhancers are DNA sequences that increase the rate of initiation of transcription by RNA pol II. They can be located upstream or downstream of the transcription start site and can be found on either strand of the DNA. The documents mention that enhancers function by looping back to gene promoters, and therefore, they are not necessarily close to their gene targets. In fact, some enhancers can be tens or even hundreds of thousands of nucleotide pairs away from the promoter that directs transcription of the gene. This indicates that enhancers do not have to be close to their gene targets to exert their effect. The documents also mention that the looping of DNA allows enhancers to interact with promoters even if they are far apart. Therefore, the correct answer is that enhancers do not have to be close to their gene targets.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

In prokaryotes, these proteins typically bind to specific DNA sequences close to the RNA polymerase start site and, depending on the nature of the regulatory protein and the precise location of its binding site relative to the start site, either activate or repress transcription of the gene. The flexibility of the DNA helix, however, also allows proteins bound at distant sites to affect the RNA polymerase at the promoter by the looping out of the intervening DNA. The regulation of higher eukaryotic genes is much more complex, commensurate with a larger genome size and the large variety of cell types that are formed. A single eukaryotic gene is typically controlled by many transcription regulators bound to sequences that can be tens or even hundreds of thousands of nucleotide pairs from the promoter that directs transcription of the gene. Eukaryotic activators and repressors act by a wide variety"

            "content": "how does the collection of cisregulatory sequences embedded in a genome orchestrate the developmental program of a multicellular organism? how much of the human genome sequence is functional, and why is the remainder retained? which of the thousands of unstudied noncoding rnAs have functions in the cell, and what are these functions? were introns present in early cells (and subsequently lost in some organisms), or did they arise at later times? RNA molecules together to speed up needed reactions. Which statements are true? Explain why or why not. 7\u20131 In terms of the way it interacts with DNA, the helix\u2013loop\u2013helix motif is more closely related to the leucine zipper motif than it is to the helix\u2013turn\u2013helix motif. 7\u20132 Once cells have differentiated to their final specialized forms, they never again alter expression of their genes."
