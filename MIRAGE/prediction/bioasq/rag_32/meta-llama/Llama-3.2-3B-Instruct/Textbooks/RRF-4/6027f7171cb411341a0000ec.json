In the absence of thrombopoietin, endomitotic megakaryocytic reduplication and, by extension, the cytoplasmic development necessary for platelet production are impaired. Like erythropoietin, thrombopoietin is produced in both the liver and the kidneys, and an inverse correlation exists between the platelet count and plasma thrombopoietic activity. Unlike erythropoietin, thrombopoietin is only constitutively produced, and the plasma thrombopoietin level is controlled by the size of its progenitor cell pool. Also, in contrast to erythropoietin, but like its myeloid counterparts, granulocyte and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors, thrombopoietin not only enhances the proliferation of its target cells but also enhances the reactivity of their end-stage product, the platelet.

Two factors synthesized by megakaryocytes have been implicated: platelet-derived growth factor and TGF-\u03b2. As you recall, platelet-derived growth factor and TGF-\u03b2 are fibroblast mitogens. In addition, TGF-\u03b2 promotes collagen deposition and causes angiogenesis, both of which are observed in myelofibrosis. As marrow fibrosis progresses, displaced hematopoietic stem cells take up residence in niches in secondary hematopoietic organs, such as the spleen, the liver, and the lymph nodes, leading to the appearance of extramedullary hematopoiesis. For incompletely understood reasons, red cell production at extramedullary sites is disordered. This factor and the concomitant suppression of marrow function result in moderate to severe anemia."

In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), terminal differentiation occurs but in a disordered and ineffective fashion, leading to the appearance of dysplastic marrow precursors and peripheral blood cytopenias. Although these three categories provide a useful starting point, the divisions between the myeloid neoplasms sometimes blur.

            "content": "TMD constitutes an often but not always transient phenomenon of abnormal megakaryoblast proliferation, which occurs in approximately 10% of infants with Down\u2019s syndrome. TMD is usually recognized at birth and either undergoes spontaneous regression (75% of cases) or progresses into acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) (25% of cases). Almost all patients with TMD and TMD-derived AMKL display somatic GATA1 mutations. TMD-associated GATA1 mutations constitute exon 2 insertions, deletions, or missense mutations, affecting the N-terminal transactivation domain of GATA-1, and result in loss of full-length (50-kDa) GATA-1 and its replacement with a shorter isoform (40-kDa) that retains friend of GATA-1 (FOG 1) binding. In contrast, inherited forms of exon 2 GATA1 mutations produce a phenotype with anemia, whereas exon 4 mutations that affect the N-terminal, FOG-1-interactive domain produce familial dyserythropoietic anemia with thrombocytopenia or X-linked macrothrombocytopenia."

            "content": "that the low level of constitutively expressed eNOS-derived NO is primarily beneficial in models of I/R injury with vasodilation and subsequent improvement in hepatic microcirculation as the proposed mechanism of protec-tion. Interestingly, activation of iNOS in similar models sug-gests a potentially harmful role for iNOS. Nitric oxide, through its reaction with reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates generated in the course of reperfusion injury, can contribute to much of the hepatocellular damage depending on the intracellu-lar ratio of these intermediates to nitric oxide. The production of iNOS and NO are also closely tied to multiple other inflamma-tory mediators in the liver, and activation of these downstream signals may explain some of the detrimental effects of NO in I/R injury of the liver. Thus, given its diverse biological effects as a signaling molecule, it is not surprising that NO plays both pro-tective and potentially harmful role in the setting of hepatic I/R"
