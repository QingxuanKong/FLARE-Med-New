Document [7] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) mentions that there are tools for reviewing variant calls, specifically MuSiC, MutSigCV, and OncodriveFM. These tools are used to annotate clinical phenotypes to variants observed in cancer genomes. Additionally, Document [18] (Title: Surgery_Schwartz) mentions the NCI Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG) and the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC), which provide tools for users to interact with the GDC data and provide their own data. Furthermore, Document [20] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) mentions the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques for rapidly and accurately obtaining a patient's predominant mtDNA sequence and detecting single-nucleotide heteroplasmy. Document [26] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) also mentions the HapMap, which describes the nature and location of SNP haplotypes and how they are distributed among individuals within and among populations. This information can be used to review variant calls. Therefore, the answer to the question is that there are indeed tools for reviewing variant calls.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Most of these variations are common and relatively harmless. When two sequence variants coexist in the population and both are common, the variants are called polymorphisms. The majority of polymorphisms are due to the substitution of a single nucleotide, called single-nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs (Figure 8\u201350). The rest are due largely to insertions or deletions\u2014called indels when the change is small, or copy number variations (CNVs) when it is large. Although these common variants can be found throughout the genome, they are not scattered randomly\u2014or even independently. Instead, they tend to travel in groups called haplotype blocks\u2014combinations of polymorphisms that are inherited as a unit."

A VUS (also termed unclassified variant) is a sequence variation in a gene where the effect of the alteration on the function of the protein is not known. Many of these variants are single nucleotide substitutions (also called missense mutations) that result in a single amino acid change. Although many VUSs will ultimately be reclassified as benign polymorphisms, some will prove to be functionally important. As more genes are sequenced (for example, in a multiplex panel or through WES), the percentage of individuals found to have a VUS increases significantly. The finding of a VUS is difficult for patients and providers alike and complicates decisions regarding medical management."

The substitution of one nucleotide at a restriction site can render the site unrecognizable by a particular restriction endonuclease. A new restriction site can also be created by the same mechanism.

ASDs are also genetically heterogeneous. More than 100 known mutations account for up to 20% of cases, although none individually accounts for more than 1% (Table 465e-1). It appears that most cases result from complex genetic mechanisms, including inheritance of multiple genetic risk variants and epigenetic modifications. For example, up to 10% of patients with autism have large (>500 kb) de novo copy number variations scattered across the genome, suggesting that hundreds of different genes can influence autism risk."

Despite these successes, many experienced geneticists question the real value of common disease-associated variants, particularly whether they are actually causative or merely mark the approximate locations of more important\u2014truly causative\u2014rare mutations."
