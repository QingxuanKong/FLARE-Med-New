    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the information provided from the given documents. Epigenetic changes refer to heritable alterations in gene expression that are not caused by changes in the DNA sequence. These changes include modifications of chromatin structure, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, which can be influenced by environmental factors and can be passed on to daughter cells. The concept of epigenetic inheritance suggests that these changes can be transmitted from one cell generation to the next, allowing for the maintenance of complex multicellular organisms. For example, studies have shown that identical twins can have different epigenetic marks on their genes, even though they have the same DNA sequence. This implies that epigenetic changes can be heritable. Additionally, the ability of a daughter cell to retain a memory of the gene expression patterns present in the parent cell is an example of epigenetic inheritance. Therefore, the answer to the question is that epigenetic changes are indeed heritable.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Their genomes have the same sequence of nucleotides, and, obviously, many features of identical twins\u2014such as their appearance\u2014are strongly determined by the genome sequences they inherit. When their gene expression, histone modification, and DNA methylation patterns are compared, however, many differences are observed. Because these differences are roughly correlated not only with age but also with the time that the twins have spent apart from each other, it has been proposed that some of these differences are heritable from cell to cell and are the result of environmental factors. Although these studies are in early stages, the idea that environmental events can be permanently registered as epigenetic changes in our cells is a fascinating one that presents an important challenge to the next generation of biological scientists."

In normal, differentiated cells, the major portion of the genome is not expressed. These regions of the genome are silenced by DNA methylation and histone modifications. On the other hand, cancer cells are characterized by a global DNA hypomethylation and selective promoter-localized hypermethylation. Indeed, it has become evident during the past several years that tumor suppressor genes are sometimes silenced by hypermethylation of promoter sequences, rather than by mutation. In addition, genome-wide hypomethylation has been shown to cause chromosomal instability and can induce tumors in mice. Thus, epigenetic changes may influence carcinogenesis in many ways.

Methylation is by methyltransferases that use S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor (Fig. 33.17). Transcriptionally active genes are less methylated (hypomethylated) than their inactive counterparts, suggesting that DNA hypermethylation silences gene expression. Modification of histones and methylation of DNA are epigenetic in that they are heritable changes in DNA that alter gene expression without altering the base sequence."
