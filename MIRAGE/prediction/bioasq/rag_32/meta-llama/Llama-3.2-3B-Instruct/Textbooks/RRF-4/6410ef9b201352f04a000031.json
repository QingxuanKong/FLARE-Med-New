    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the role of KCNQ1 in cardiac function and its relationship to arrhythmias. KCNQ1 is a potassium channel gene that plays a crucial role in repolarization of the cardiac action potential. Mutations in KCNQ1 have been associated with long QT syndrome (LQT), a condition characterized by abnormal heart rhythms and increased risk of sudden death. The KCNQ1 gene undergoes alternative splicing, which allows for the production of different isoforms of the protein. Research has shown that modulation of KCNQ1 splicing can affect its function and may be a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing arrhythmias. In fact, studies have suggested that modifying the splicing pattern of KCNQ1 can alter the risk of arrhythmias in individuals with LQT. Therefore, modulation of KCNQ1 splicing may be a promising approach for preventing arrhythmias in certain individuals with LQT or other cardiac arrhythmias.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

This represents prolongation of the action potential of at least some ventricular cells (Figure 14\u20131).

Instead, the mutation typically creates a new pattern of splicing (Figure 6\u201333). Most commonly, an exon is simply skipped (Figure 6\u201333B). In other cases, the mutation causes a cryptic splice junction to be efficiently used (Figure 6\u201333C). Apparently, the splicing machinery has evolved to pick out the best possible pattern of splice junctions, and if the optimal one is damaged by mutation, it will seek out the next best pattern, and so on. This inherent plasticity in the process of RNA splicing suggests that changes in splicing patterns caused by random mutations have been important in the evolution of genes and organisms.

            "content": "each passing generation because of further trinucleotide repeat expansion. The CTG repeat is located in the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the DMPK mRNA. Experimental studies suggest that the skeletal muscle phenotype stems from a \u201ctoxic\u201d gain-of-function caused by the triplet repeat expansion. The mutant DMPK mRNA with the resulting CUG expansions sequesters muscleblindlike proteins involved in RNA splicing. This functional depletion of proteins involved in RNA splicing disrupts normal gene expression patterns and alters the function of diseased tissues like skeletal and cardiac muscle. Myotonic dystrophy often manifests in late childhood with gait abnormalities due to weakness of foot dorsiflexors, with subsequent progression to weakness of the intrinsic muscles of the hands and wrist extensors, atrophy of the facial muscles, and ptosis. Involvement of other organ systems results in potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias, cataracts, early frontal balding, endocrinopathies, and testicular"

            "content": "The maternally derived gene, on the other hand, is immune to these effects because the specific methylation present from imprinting blocks the synthesis of the lncRNA but allows transcription of the protein-coding gene. Like Igf 2, the specificity of Kcnq1 imprinting arises from the inherited methylation patterns; the difference lies in the way these patterns bring about differential expression of the imprinted gene."

            "content": "The plasticity of RNA splicing also means that the cell can easily regulate the pattern of RNA splicing. Earlier in this section we saw that alternative splicing can give rise to different proteins from the same gene and that this is a common strategy to enhance the coding potential of genomes. Some examples of alternative splicing are constitutive; that is, the alternatively spliced mRNAs are produced continuously by cells of an organism. However, in many cases, the cell regulates the splicing patterns so that different forms of the protein are produced at different times and in different tissues (see Figure 6\u201326). In Chapter 7, we return to this issue to discuss some specific examples of regulated RNA splicing."
