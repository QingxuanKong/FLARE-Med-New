ABCG2 is an efflux transporter located on epithelial cells of the kidney, liver, and intestine as well as on the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier. It is involved in the transport of various molecules, including drugs, across cell membranes. In the context of uric acid excretion, we need to consider the transporters involved in the proximal tubule and the role of ABC transporters in general. Urate is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule by URAT1, OAT1, OAT2, and OAT3 transporters. The question is whether ABCG2 is involved in the excretion of uric acid. However, the main excretion of uric acid occurs through the apical membrane of the proximal tubule by MRPs (multidrug resistance proteins) and BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein), not by ABCG2. In contrast, OAT4 reabsorbs urate from the lumen of the proximal tubule. Therefore, ABCG2 does not primarily excrete uric acid but rather is involved in the reabsorption of uric acid.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

            "content": "The other major cobalamin transport protein in plasma is transcobalamin, also known as TC II. The gene is on chromosome 22q11-q13.1. As for IF and HC, there are nine exons. The three proteins are likely to have a common ancestral origin. TC II is synthesized by liver and by other tissues, including macrophages, ileum, and vascular endothelium. It normally carries only 20\u201360 ng of cobalamin per liter of plasma and readily gives up cobalamin to marrow, placenta, and other tissues, which it enters by receptor-mediated endocytosis involving the TC II receptor and megalin (encoded by the LRP-2 gene). The TC II cobalamin is internalized by endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits; the complex is degraded, but the receptor probably is recycled to the cell membrane as is the case for transferrin. Export of \u201cfree\u201d cobalamin is via the ATP-binding cassette drug transporter alias multidrug resistance protein 1."

            "content": "Export by phagocytes may constitute one response to local lipid overload in the evolving lesion. Another mechanism, reverse cholesterol transport mediated by high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), probably provides an independent pathway for lipid removal from atheroma. This transfer of cholesterol from the cell to the HDL particle involves specialized cell-surface molecules such as the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABCA1, the gene mutated in Tangier disease, a condition characterized by very low HDL levels, transfers cholesterol from cells to nascent HDL particles and ABCG1 to mature HDL particles. \u201cReverse cholesterol transport\u201d mediated by these ABC transporters allows HDL loaded with cholesterol to deliver it to hepatocytes by binding to scavenger receptor B1 or other receptors. The liver cell can metabolize the sterol to bile acids that can be excreted. Thus, macrophages may play a vital role in the dynamic economy of lipid accumulation in the arterial wall during"

            "content": "FIgURE 431e-1 The total-body urate pool is the net result between urate production and excretion. Urate production is influenced by dietary intake of purines and the rates of de novo biosynthesis of purines from nonpurine precursors, nucleic acid turnover, and salvage by phosphoribosyltransferase activities. The formed urate is normally excreted by urinary and intestinal routes. Hyperuricemia can result from increased production, decreased excretion, or a combination of both mechanisms. When hyperuricemia exists, urate can precipitate and deposit in tissues as tophi. urate is excreted by the kidneys, and most of the remainder is eliminated 431e-1 through the intestines."
