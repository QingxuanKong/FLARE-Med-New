Why, then, are these shielded helices nevertheless composed primarily of hydrophobic amino acids? The answer lies in the way in which multi-pass proteins are integrated into the membrane during their biosynthesis. As we discuss in Chapter 12, transmembrane \u03b1 helices are inserted into the lipid bilayer sequentially by a protein translocator. After leaving the translocator, each helix is transiently surrounded by lipids, which requires that the helix be hydrophobic. It is only as the protein folds up into its final structure that contacts are made between adjacent helices, and protein\u2013protein contacts replace some of the protein\u2013lipid contacts (Figure 10\u201322)."

As a consequence, it is often possible to engineer cells to produce just the cytosolic or extracellular domains of these proteins as water-soluble molecules. This approach has been invaluable for studying the structure and function of these domains, especially the domains of transmembrane receptor proteins (discussed in Chapter 15). A transmembrane \u03b1 helix, even in a single-pass membrane protein, however, often does more than just anchor the protein to the lipid bilayer. Many single-pass membrane proteins form homoor heterodimers that are held together by noncovalent, but strong and highly specific, interactions between the two transmembrane \u03b1 helices; the sequence of the hydrophobic amino acids of these helices contains the information that directs the protein\u2013protein interaction."

Two ATPase domains protrude into the cytosol. In some cases, the two halves of the transporter are formed by a single polypeptide, whereas in other cases they are formed by two or more separate polypeptides that assemble into a similar structure. Without ATP bound, the transporter exposes a substrate-binding site on one side of the membrane. ATP binding induces a conformational change that exposes the substrate-binding site on the opposite side; ATP hydrolysis followed by ADP dissociation returns the transporter to its original conformation.

ATP binding brings together the two ATPase domains, and ATP hydrolysis leads to their dissociation (Figure 11\u201316). These movements of the cytosolic domains are transmitted to the transmembrane segments, driving cycles of conformational changes that alternately expose solute-binding sites on one side of the membrane and then on the other, as we have seen for other transporters. In this way, ABC transporters harvest the energy released upon ATP binding and hydrolysis to drive transport of solutes across the bilayer. The transport is directional toward inside or toward outside, depending on the particular conformational change in the solute binding site that is linked to ATP hydrolysis (see Figure 11\u201316)."
