    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the provided documents to find any information related to the BCL11B gene and its involvement in schizophrenia. After reviewing the documents, we found no direct evidence linking BCL11B to schizophrenia. However, we can make an educated guess by looking at the documents related to the BCL2 gene and its connection to schizophrenia. The BCL2 gene is mentioned in Document [28] as being upregulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia due to the loss of expression of specific micro-RNAs that normally dampen BCL2 expression. Similarly, amplification of the MCL1 gene is seen in a subset of lung and breast cancers. Although there is no direct connection to BCL11B, it is possible that BCL11B might be involved in schizophrenia, but this is not supported by the provided documents. Therefore, based on the available information, the answer is not explicitly stated, but given the lack of information, the most likely answer is that BCL11B is not directly involved in schizophrenia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

This implies that structural and functional changes in the brain are present even in utero in some patients, or that they develop during childhood and adolescence, or both. Twin, adoption, and family studies have established that schizophrenia is a genetic disorder with high heritability. No single gene is involved. Current theories involve multiple genes with common and rare mutations, including large deletions and insertions (copy number variations), combining to produce a very variegated clinical presentation and course."

The etiology of schizophrenia is unknown. Numerous studies have shown genetic predisposition and linkages for the disorder.

Some data, including a strong association between schizophrenia and the velocardiofacial syndrome, suggest that associated genes are located on chromosome 22q 11 (Murphy, 2002). But sophisticated gene mapping studies clearly show that schizophrenia is not related to a single gene or mutation. Instead, multiple DNA variants likely interact to lead to schizophrenia (Kukshal, 2012).

In addition to these malformations, patients with 22q11.2 deletion are at high risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In fact, it is estimated that schizophrenia develops in approximately 25% of adults with this syndrome. Conversely, deletions of the region can be found in 2% to 3% of individuals with childhood-onset schizophrenia. The molecular basis for this syndrome is not fully understood. The affected region of chromosome 11 encodes many genes. Among these, a transcription factor gene called TBX1 is suspected to be one of the responsible candidates, because its loss seems to correlate with the occurrence of DiGeorge syndrome.

These include genes for dysbindin, DAOA/G30, disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 (DISC-1), and neuregulin 1. Lithium was first used therapeutically in the mid-19th century in patients with gout. It was briefly used as a substitute for sodium chloride in hypertensive patients in the 1940s but was banned after it proved too toxic for use without monitoring.

As with the dopaminergic model, attention was drawn to mechanisms relating to a new class of antipsychotics (clozapine, risperidone), which have major effects on the serotonin system and were found to ameliorate the psychosis. Several groups have reported alterations in serotonin receptors in the brains of schizophrenic patients (see later). A further connection is based on the finding by Williams and colleagues of an allelic variation in the gene on chromosome 13 encoding for a serotonin receptor (5-HT2A) that confers a susceptibility to schizophrenia. The variation in this gene is insufficient to explain the presence of the disease in any one individual, if for no other reason than that many patients who are homozygous for the suspect allele do not develop schizophrenia. Perhaps a nearby region relating to the receptor may be at fault through linkage disequilibrium (see commentary by"

He called it dementia praecox (adopting the term introduced earlier by Morel) to refer to a deterioration of mental function at an early age, from a previous level of normalcy. At first, Kraepelin believed that \u201ccatatonia\u201d and \u201chebephrenia,\u201d which had previously been described by Kahlbaum and by Hecker, respectively, as well as the paranoid form of schizophrenia, were separate diseases, but later, by 1898, he had concluded that several subtypes were a single disease. He emphasized an onset in adolescence or early adult life and a chronic course, often ending in marked deterioration of personality as the defining attributes of all forms of the disease. Early in the 20th century, the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler substituted the term schizophrenia for dementia praecox. This was an improvement insofar as the term dementia"

And although what are thought to be \u201cschizoid\u201d traits may be recognized in childhood, a frank psychosis is hardly ever recorded at this age.

Epidemiology: Prevalence is approximately 1%; males and females are affected equally. Peak onset is earlier in males (ages 18\u201325) than in females (ages 25\u201335), and has an \u2191 incidence in those born in winter or early spring. Schizophrenia in frst-degree relatives also \u2191 risk. Ten percent of those affected commit suicide. Etiology: Etiologic theories focus on neurotransmitter abnormalities such as dopamine dysregulation (frontal hypoactivity; limbic hyperactivity; effcacy of dopamine antagonists) and brain abnormalities on CT and MRI (enlarged ventricles and \u2193 cortical volume). Subtypes are as follows: Paranoid: Delusions (often of persecution of the patient) and/or hallucinations are present. Cognitive function is usually preserved. Associated with the best overall prognosis."

In other tumors such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Chapter 12), it appears that BCL2 is upregulated because of loss of expression of specific micro-RNAs that normally dampen BCL2 expression. Many other mechanisms leading to overexpression of anti-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family have been described, particularly in the setting of resistance to chemotherapy. For example, amplification of the MCL1 gene is seen in a subset of lung and breast cancers."

Those without hallucinations, delusions, and thought control or projection responded more poorly to treatment and required a more prolonged period in the hospital and higher doses of neuroleptic drugs than did those with these features. The 2 groups correspond closely to two categories of schizophrenic disorders later separated by Robins and Guze on the basis of prognosis. The Schneider-positive, poor-prognosis schizophrenia (also referred to in older literature as nuclear or process schizophrenia) corresponded closely to kraepelinian schizophrenia, while many of the Schneider-negative patients with good prognosis were probably suffering from some other nonschizophrenic illness such as bipolar disease (see Chap. 48). Having made these comments, it must be acknowledged that newer classifications of schizophrenia gives these distinctions less credibility and points to marginal differences in outcome and responses to treatment."

            "content": "Neurologists and psychiatrists currently accept the idea that schizophrenia comprises a group of closely related disorders characterized by a particular type of disordered thinking, affect, and behavior. The syndrome by which these disorders manifest themselves differs from those of delirium, confusional states, dementia, and depression in ways that will become clear in the following pages. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of schizophrenia depends on the recognition of characteristic psychologic disturbances largely unsupported by physical findings and laboratory data. This inevitably results in a certain degree of diagnostic imprecision. In other words, any group classified as schizophrenic will include patients with diseases that only resemble schizophrenia, whereas variant or incomplete cases of schizophrenia may not have been included. Moreover, there is not full agreement as to whether all the conditions that are called schizophrenic are the expression of a single disease process. In"
