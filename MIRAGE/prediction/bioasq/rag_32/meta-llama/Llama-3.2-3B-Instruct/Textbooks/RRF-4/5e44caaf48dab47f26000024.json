In a limited trial, there was no increase in the frequency of hemorrhagic transformation of the ischemic region when compared to placebo treatment (Kay et al). Because the outcome measures in this study were coarse (death or dependence 6 months after stroke), further investigations of this approach need to be carried out. We can only infer that the use of low-molecular-weight heparins appears to be safe but there is no compelling evidence supporting their use in acute ischemic stroke.
