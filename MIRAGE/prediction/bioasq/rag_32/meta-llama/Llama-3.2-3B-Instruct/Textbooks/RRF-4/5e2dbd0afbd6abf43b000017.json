    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer whether pimavanserin is a typical antipsychotic, we need to understand the characteristics of typical and atypical antipsychotics. Typical antipsychotics, also known as first-generation antipsychotics, are known for causing extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) due to their high affinity for dopamine D2 receptors. On the other hand, atypical antipsychotics, or second-generation antipsychotics, have a lower affinity for D2 receptors and are associated with a lower risk of EPS. Pimavanserin is classified as a selective serotonin 5-HT2A inverse agonist, which means it primarily targets the serotonin system rather than the dopamine system. This characteristic makes it distinct from typical antipsychotics. Furthermore, pimavanserin has been approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis and has been shown to have a lower risk of EPS compared to typical antipsychotics. Therefore, based on its pharmacological profile and clinical use, pimavanserin is not a typical antipsychotic.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Moreover, the low cost of the older drugs contributes to their widespread use despite their risk of adverse EPS effects. Several of the newer antipsychotics, including clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, show superiority over haloperidol in terms of overall response in some controlled trials.

At least one randomized trial has described benefit from the anticholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine, in reducing delusions, hallucinations, and anxiety (McKeith and colleagues, 2000). Pimavanserin, a selective serotonin 5-HT2A inverse agonist used to treat psychosis in Parkinson disease, has shown some modest benefit for psychosis and hallucinations in a trial in Lewy body dementia without worsening motor symptoms (see Cummings et al).

If sedation is to be avoided, haloperidol or a second generation (atypical) antipsychotic is more appropriate. Haloperidol has increased extrapyramidal toxicity, however, and should be avoided in patients with preexisting extra- pyramidal disease. The phenothiazines, especially older drugs such as chlorpromazine, often induce orthostatic hypotension because of their \u03b1-adrenoceptor-blocking effects. They are even more prone to do so in the elderly. Dosage of these drugs should usually be started at a fraction of that used in young adults. The second generation antipsychotic agents (clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperi done, aripiprazole) do not appear to be significantly superior to the effects.

Chlorpromazine is a neuroleptic agent; that is, it produces catalepsy in rodents and EPS in humans. The discovery that its antipsychotic action was related to dopamine (D or DA)-receptor blockade led to the identification of other compounds as antipsychotics between the 1950s and 1970s. The discovery of clozapine in 1959 led to the realization that antipsychotic drugs need not cause EPS in humans at clinically effective doses. Clozapine was called an \u201catypical\u201d antipsychotic drug because of this dissociation; it produces fewer EPS at equivalent antipsychotic doses in man and laboratory animals. As a result, there has been a major shift in clinical practice away from typical or first-generation antipsychotic drugs toward the use of an ever-increasing number of atypical or second-generation drugs, which have other advantages as well.

For this reason, they are particularly favored in controlling the confusion and psychosis of parkinsonian patients. The other new class of drugs, of which risperidone is the main example, also has fewer extrapyramidal side effects than the phenothiazines and a more rapid onset of action than the traditional antipsychotic medications. All of these newer medications produce the \u201cmetabolic syndrome\u201d of weight gain, adverse lipid changes, and glucose intolerance.

The prevalence varies enormously, but tardive dyskinesia is estimated to have occurred in 20\u201340% of chronically treated patients before the introduction of the newer atypical antipsychotics. Early recognition is important, since advanced cases may be difficult to reverse. Any patient with tardive dyskinesia treated with a typical antipsychotic drug or possibly risperidone or paliperidone should be switched to quetiapine or clozapine, the atypical agents with the least likelihood of causing tardive dyskinesia.

Alteration in mental status and other neurological signs typically precede systemic signs. The onset of symptoms varies from hours to days after drug initiation. Some cases develop within 24 hours after drug initiation, most within the first week, and virtually all cases within 30 days. Once the syndrome is diagnosed and oral antipsychotic drugs are discontinued, neuroleptic malignant syndrome is self\u2014limited in most cases. The mean recovery time after drug discontinuation is 7\u201410 days, with most individuals recovering within 1 week and nearly all within 30 days. The duration may be prolonged when long-acting antipsychotics are implicated. There have been reports of in- dividuals in whom residual neurological signs persisted for weeks after the acute hyper- metabolic symptoms"

However, controlled trials of antipsychotics in the management of behavioral symptoms in dementia patients have generally not demonstrated efficacy. Furthermore, second-generation as well as some first-generation antipsychotics have been associated with increased mortality in these patients. Antipsychotics are not indicated for the treatment of various withdrawal syndromes, eg, opioid withdrawal. In small doses, antipsychotic drugs have been promoted (wrongly) for the relief of anxiety associated with minor emotional disorders. The antianxiety sedatives (see Chapter 22) are preferred in terms of both safety and acceptability to patients."

There is some evidence that lamotrigine is more effective than any of the other mood stabilizers for this indication (see below). It is uncertain whether instances of successful combination therapy represent misdiagnosed cases of mania or schizoaffective disorder. Benzodiazepines may be useful for patients with anxiety symptoms or insomnia not controlled by antipsychotics."

            "content": "The range of effective dosages among various antipsychotic agents is broad. Therapeutic margins are substantial. At appropriate dosages, antipsychotics\u2014with the exception of clozapine and perhaps olanzapine\u2014are of equal efficacy in broadly selected groups of patients. However, some patients who fail to respond to one drug may respond to another; for this reason, several drugs may have to be tried to find the one most effective for an individual patient. Patients who have become refractory to two or three antipsychotic agents given in substantial doses become candidates for treatment with clozapine or high-dose olanzapine. Thirty to fifty percent of patients previously refractory to standard doses of other antipsychotic drugs respond to these drugs. In such cases, the increased risk of clozapine can well be justified. Some dosage relationships between various antipsychotic drugs, as well as possible therapeutic ranges, are shown in Table 29\u20134."

            "content": "In contrast to the difficult search for receptors responsible for antipsychotic efficacy, the differences in receptor effects of various antipsychotics do explain many of their toxicities (Tables 29\u20131 and 29\u20132). In particular, extrapyramidal toxicity appears to be consistently associated with high D2 potency. D. Psychological Effects Most antipsychotic drugs cause unpleasant subjective effects in nonpsychotic individuals. The mild to severe EPS, including akathisia, sleepiness, restlessness, and autonomic effects are unlike any associated with more familiar sedatives or hypnotics. Nevertheless, low doses of some of these drugs, particularly quetiapine, are used to promote sleep onset and maintenance, although there is no approved indication for such usage."

The introduction of antipsychotic drugs led to massive changes in disease management, including brief instead of life-long hospitalizations. These drugs have also proved to be of great value in studying the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and other psychoses. It should be noted that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are no longer believed by many to be separate disorders but rather to be part of a continuum of brain disorders with psychotic features."
