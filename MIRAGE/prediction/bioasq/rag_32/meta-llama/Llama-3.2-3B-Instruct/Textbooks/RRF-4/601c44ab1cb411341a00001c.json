DNET tumors are a type of neuroepithelial tumor, and the provided documents mention them in the context of neurosurgery and radiation therapy. According to the documents, neurosurgical excision is the primary treatment for DNET tumors, and radiation therapy is not explicitly mentioned as a primary treatment option. However, the documents do mention that radiation therapy may be beneficial in cases where the tumor is incompletely removed or shows malignant characteristics. Therefore, it is not clear if radiosurgery is a standard treatment for DNET tumors.

This is true even in the elderly who have had only a biopsy without resection according to a trial conducted by Keime-Guibert and colleagues. In many centers, a fraction of this is delivered as a \u201cboost\u201d through focused or stereotactic radiation, particularly if the tumor is small enough to encompass in these fields. Brachytherapy (implantation of iodine-125 or iridium-193 beads or needles) and high-dose focused radiation (stereotactic radiosurgery) have so far not significantly altered survival times but continue to be studied. They have gone through periods of popularity but are currently used only sparsely, partly because they cause local radiation necrosis."

In a large series of patients treated with radiosurgery, facial motor and sensory functions were preserved in 75 percent of cases and, after 28 months of observation, no new neurologic deficits were detected (Kondziolka et al). This approach is favored in older patients with few symptoms but is being adopted increasingly for others. The rates of hearing loss and facial numbness and weakness are comparable or lower than with surgery, but the follow-up period in most series is less than 5 years (Flickinger et al). Focused radiation with the Gamma Knife or proton beam also appears to be preferable to surgery in cases of recurrent tumor.

Protons are a charged particle that can be also used in external beam radiation therapy. Proton therapy employs a beam of protons as a means of delivering radiation to a tumor. In con-trast to photons, which deposit energy continuously during their passage through tissue, protons deposit a large amount of their energy near the end of their path (known as the Bragg peak) and release less energy along the way. Thus, proton therapy could theoretically reduce the exposure of normal tissue to radiation, allowing the delivery of higher doses of radiation to a tumor.

Corticosteroids produce prompt improvement, probably on the basis of a reduction in the edema surrounding the lesion(s), but sustained use is restricted by side effects and eventual loss of efficacy. Most patients with multiple metastases also temporarily benefit from the use of whole-brain irradiation, usually administered over approximately a 2-week period, in multiple doses. Various studies report a response rate, albeit temporary, in 50 to 70 percent of patients with multiple metastases but the type of tumor also determines the likelihood of response.

Tumors that lie beneath the hypothalamus, along the medial part of the sphenoid bone and parasellar region, or anterior to the brainstem are the most difficult to remove surgically. By invading adjacent bone, they may become impossible to remove totally. Carefully planned radiation therapy, including various forms of stereotactic treatment, is beneficial in cases that are inoperable and when the tumor is incompletely removed or shows malignant characteristics."

Germinoma, mentioned above, is the most common of this rare group of neoplasms, which also includes choriocarcinoma, embryonal cell carcinoma, endodermal sinus tumors, and malignant teratomas. Certain biochemical markers of these tumors are of interest and of clinical utility, because they may be detected in samples of the blood and CSF. The beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is elaborated by choriocarcinoma and alpha-fetoprotein, and by endodermal sinus tumors and immature teratomas. Typical germinomas have shown little elevation of either. Most often these markers indicate the presence of complex mixed germ cell tumors."

This has led to increased use of stereotactic radiosurgery, which uses CT guidance to deliver high doses of radiotherapy to the tumor (photon or gamma knife) and also bilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Patients who fail to respond to either treatment are candidates for pharmacologic therapy with adrenal inhibitors (medical adrenalectomy) such as ketoconazole, metyrapone, or aminoglutethimide.Patients with ectopic ACTH production are best managed by treating the primary tumor, including recurrences, if possible. Medical or bilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy has been used to palliate patients with unresectable disease and those whose ectopic ACTH-secreting tumor cannot be localized.Patients undergoing surgery for a primary adrenal ade-noma secreting glucocorticoids require preoperative and post-operative steroids due to suppression of the contralateral adrenal gland. These patients are also at increased predisposition for infectious and thromboembolic complications, the"

Either treatment may be supplemented by endocrine therapy (for carcinoma of breast and prostate), and of antineoplastic drugs (for certain lymphomas and myelomas. Pain relief is sometimes difficult to attain and requires narcotics. Gilbert and associates presented evidence that patients who receive high-dose corticosteroids (16 to 60 mg of dexamethasone) and fractionated radiation (500 cGy on each of the first 3 days and then spaced radiation up to 3,000 cGy) do as well as those who have surgical decompression. However, a comparison of five different radiation programs by Nieder and colleagues suggested there is little difference between them. An often cited review of the radiotherapy options was given by Gerszten and colleagues in 2009 but the techniques change so rapidly that it is difficult to determine and compare outcomes. The issue of radiosensitivity of any particular tumor has become a relative one as"
