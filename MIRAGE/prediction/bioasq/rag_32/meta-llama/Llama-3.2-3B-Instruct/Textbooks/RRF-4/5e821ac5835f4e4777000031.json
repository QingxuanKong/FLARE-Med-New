Although these molecules are found throughout the body, their types and organization are dictated by the structural role collagen plays in a particular organ. In some tissues, collagen may be dispersed as a gel that gives support to the structure, as in the ECM or the vitreous humor of the eye. In other tissues, collagen may be bundled in tight, parallel fibers that provide great strength, as in tendons.

Fibrillar collagen has a long, rigid structure, in which three collagen polypeptide \u03b1 chains are wound around one another in a rope-like triple helix stabilized by interchain hydrogen bonds. Diseases of fibrillar collagen synthesis affect bones, joints, skin, and blood vessels. Elastin is a connective tissue protein with rubber-like properties in tissues such as the lung. \u03b11-Antitrypsin (AAT), produced primarily by the liver, inhibits elastase-catalyzed degradation of elastin in the alveolar walls.

Each fibrous protein exhibits special mechanical properties, resulting from its unique structure, which is obtained by combining specific amino acids into regular, secondary structural elements.

            "content": "Collagen molecule biosynthesis involves a number of intracellular events. The steps in biosynthesis of almost all fibrillar collagens are similar, but type I collagen has been studied in most detail. In general, the synthetic pathway for collagen molecules is similar to other constitutive secretory pathways used by the cell. The unique features of collagen biosynthesis are expressed in multiple posttranslational processing steps that are required to prepare the molecule for the extracellular assembly process. Thus, we see the following: \u0081 Collagen chains are synthesized in the rER as long precursors containing large globular aminoand carboxyterminus propeptides called pro\u2013 chains (preprocollagen molecules). The newly synthesized polypeptides are simultaneously discharged into the cisternae of the rER, where intracellular processing begins. \u0081 Within the cisternae of the rER a number of posttranslational modifications of the preprocollagen molecules occur, including the following: 1."
