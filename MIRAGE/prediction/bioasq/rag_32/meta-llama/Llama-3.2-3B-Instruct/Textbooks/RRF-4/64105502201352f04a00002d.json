The NSAA score is a tool used to assess ambulatory function in children with DMD. We need to consider the diagnostic criteria for DMD, the clinical features of the disease, and the purpose of the NSAA score.\\n\\nDMD is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness, primarily affecting boys. The diagnosis is established by genetic testing, and the disease is typically apparent between 3 and 5 years of age. The NSAA score is used to assess ambulatory function in children with DMD.\\n\\nHowever, the question is whether the NSAA score is a reliable clinical outcome for disease progression assessment in DMD. To answer this, we need to consider the limitations of the NSAA score and the clinical features of DMD.\\n\\nThe NSAA score is a useful tool for assessing ambulatory function, but it may not capture the full range of disease progression in DMD. DMD is a complex disease with multiple symptoms, including muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy, and respiratory failure. The NSAA score may not account for these other symptoms, which can impact disease progression.\\n\\nFurthermore, the NSAA score may be influenced by various factors, such as muscle atrophy, contractures, and respiratory complications, which can affect ambulatory function. These factors can also impact disease progression, but the NSAA score may not capture these changes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while the NSAA score is a useful tool for assessing ambulatory function in children with DMD, it is not a reliable clinical outcome for disease progression assessment. A more comprehensive assessment that takes into account multiple symptoms and factors is needed to accurately track disease progression in DMD.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Muscular dystrophies are a group of genetic muscle diseases characterized by progressive myofiber degeneration and the gradual replacement of muscle by fibrotic tissue.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked disorder (Xp21) affecting approximately 1 in 3500 boys and resulting from a gene mutation of dystrophin. Becker muscular dystrophy is an allelic disorder associated with more mild symptoms; its mutations at least partially preserve the function of the resulting gene product.

Proximal muscles, especially of the lower extremities, are prominently involved. As the disease progresses, weakness becomes more generalized. Significant facial muscle weakness is not a feature. Hypertrophy of muscles, particularly in the calves, is an early and prominent finding. Most patients with Becker dystrophy first experience difficulties between ages 5 and 15 years, although onset in the third or fourth decade or even later can occur. By definition, patients with Becker dystrophy walk beyond age 15, whereas patients with Duchenne dystrophy are typically in a wheelchair by the age of 12. Patients with Becker dystrophy have a reduced life expectancy, but most survive into the fourth or fifth decade."

Some patients cannot tolerate glucocorticoid therapy; weight gain and increased risk of fractures in particular represent a significant deterrent for some boys. As in other recessively inherited dystrophies presumed to arise from loss of function of a critical muscle gene, there is optimism that Duchenne disease may benefit from novel therapies that either replace the defective gene or missing protein or implement downstream corrections (e.g., skipping mutated exons or reading through mutations that introduce stop codons). This less severe form of X-linked recessive muscular dystrophy results from allelic defects of the same gene responsible for Duchenne dystrophy. Becker muscular dystrophy is ~10 times less frequent than Duchenne."

Isolated cases of muscular dystrophy had been described earlier, but no distinction was made between neuropathic and myopathic disease.

By 1868, he was able to write a comprehensive description of 13 cases and recognized that the disease was muscular in origin and restricted to males.

The diagnosis of Becker muscular dystrophy requires Western blot analysis of muscle biopsy samples, demonstrating a reduced amount or abnormal size of dystrophin or mutation analysis of DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes. Genetic testing reveals deletions or duplications of the dystrophin gene in 65% of patients with Becker dystrophy, approximately the same percentage as in Duchenne dystrophy. In both Becker and Duchenne dystrophies, the size of the DNA deletion does not predict clinical severity; however, in ~95% of patients with Becker dystrophy, the DNA deletion does not alter the translational reading frame of messenger RNA. These \u201cin-frame\u201d mutations allow for production of some dystrophin, which accounts for the presence of altered rather than absent dystrophin on Western blot analysis."

We have, for example, encountered patients who served in the military with the disease undetected. If maternal uncles are affected by the disease and are still walking, the diagnosis is relatively easy. Mentation is usually normal and cardiac involvement is far less frequent than in Duchenne dystrophy, but there are cases that present with a cardiomyopathy and we have been made aware of 2 brothers who had cardiac transplantation before the disease was detected. Kuhn and associates have reported a genealogy in which early myocardial disease and cramping myalgia were prominent features. The molecular-genetic basis of this form is discussed below."

            "content": "\u0081 Dystrophin, a large 427-kilodalton protein, is thought to link laminin, which resides in the external lamina of the muscle cell, to actin filaments. Absence of this protein is associated with progressive muscular weakness, a genetic condition called Duchenne\u2019s muscular dystrophy. Dystrophin is encoded on the X chromosome, which explains why only boys suffer from Duchenne\u2019s muscular dystrophy. Recently, characterization of the dystrophin gene and its product has been clinically important (Folder 11.2). When a muscle contracts, each sarcomere shortens and becomes thicker, but the myofilaments remain the same length."

Even biopsy may be misleading in showing a few inflammatory foci in an otherwise dystrophic picture. As a rule, polymyositis evolves more rapidly than dystrophy. It may be associated with higher CK and aldolase values than most of the dystrophies except the Duchenne and distal Miyoshi types. With these points in mind, if immunostaining of a muscle biopsy fails to reveal the diagnosis of a dystrophy, there may still be uncertainty, in which instance a trial of prednisone may be indicated for a period of 6 months. Unmistakable improvement favors polymyositis; questionable improvement (physician\u2019s and patient\u2019s judgment not in accord) leaves the diagnosis unsettled but suggests inclusion of body myositis or a dystrophy. Pompe disease, a treatable metabolic glycogen storage myopathy discussed elsewhere in this chapter, may simulate Becker or"
