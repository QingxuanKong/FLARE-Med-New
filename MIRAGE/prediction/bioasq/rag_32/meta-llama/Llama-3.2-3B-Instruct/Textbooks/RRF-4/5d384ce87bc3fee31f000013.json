    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the role of GRHL2 in the context of Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). GRHL2 is a transcription factor that has been implicated in the regulation of EMT. Research has shown that GRHL2 can induce EMT in various cancer cell types by repressing the expression of E-cadherin, a key adhesion molecule that maintains epithelial cell polarity and integrity. By downregulating E-cadherin, GRHL2 can promote the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype, which is characterized by increased motility, invasion, and metastasis. Therefore, over-expression of GRHL2 is likely to lead to EMT in cancer cells.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

These changes are believed to favor the development of a promigratory phenotype that is essential for metastasis. Loss of E-cadherin expression seems to be a key event in EMT, and SNAIL and TWIST are transcriptional repressors that downregulate E-cadherin expression. How expression of these master regulator transcription factors is stimulated in tumors is not clear; however, experimental models suggest that interactions of tumor cells with stromal cells are a key stimulus for this change. Thus, acquisition of a metastatic phenotype may not require a set of mutations but may be an emergent property arising from the interactions of tumor cells and stroma."

This question is of more than academic interest, because if altered forms of certain genes promote or suppress the metastatic phenotype, their detection in a primary tumor would have both prognostic and therapeutic implications. Among candidates for such metastasis oncogenes are those encoding SNAIL and TWIST, transcription factors whose primary function is to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In EMT, carcinoma cells downregulate certain epithelial markers (e.g., E-cadherin) and upregulate certain mesenchymal markers (e.g., vimentin, smooth muscle actin). These molecular changes are accompanied by phenotypic alterations such as morphologic change from polygonal epithelioid cell shape to a spindly mesenchymal shape, along with increased production of proteolytic enzymes that promote migration and invasion.

As mentioned earlier, this step resembles the normal developmental process known as the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT ), in which epithelial cells undergo a shift in character, becoming less adhesive and more migratory (discussed in Chapter 19). A key part of the EMT process involves switching off expression of the E-cadherin gene. The primary function of the transmembrane E-cadherin protein is in cell\u2013cell adhesion, binding epithelial cells together through adherens junctions (see Figure 19\u201313). In some carcinomas of the stomach and of the breast, E-cadherin has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene, and a loss of E-cadherin may promote cancer development by facilitating local invasiveness."
