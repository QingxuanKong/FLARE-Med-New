This occurs in a way that is heavily influenced by the biology of the particular tumor type. For example, decreased alkylguanine alkyltransferase defines a subset of glioblastoma patients with the prospect of greatest benefit from treatment with temozolomide, but has no predictive value for benefit from temozolomide in epithelial neoplasms. Likewise, ovarian cancers resistant to platinating agents have decreased expression of the proapoptotic gene bax.

Indeed, inhibitors of MDM2 that reactivate p53 and induce apoptosis in tumors with MDM2 gene amplification, such as certain types of sarcoma, are being tested in clinical trials. Even more promising results are being generated with drugs that mimic the activities of BH3-only proteins and inhibit the function of antiapoptotic members of the BCL2 family, particularly BCL2 itself. These drugs have potent activity against tumors characterized by BCL2 overexpression (such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and are likely to become a standard part of cancer treatment over the course of the next few years."

            "content": "From the perspective of the patient, the pace of advance in cancer research can seem frustratingly slow. Each new drug has to be tested in the clinic, first for safety and then for efficacy, before it can be released for general use. And if the drug is to be used in combination with others, the combination therapy must then go through the same long process. Strict ethical rules constrain the conduct of trials, which means that they take time\u2014typically several years. But slow and cautious steps, taken systematically in the right direction, can lead to great advances. There is still far to go, but the examples that we have discussed provide proof of principle and grounds for optimism. From the cancer research effort, we have learned a great deal of what we know about the molecular biology of the normal cell. Now, more and more, we are discovering how to put that knowledge to use in the battle with cancer itself."

            "content": "An ideal treatment is one that is cell-lethal in combination with some lesion that is present in the cancer cells, but harmless to cells where this lesion is absent. Such a treatment is said to be synthetic-lethal (from the original sense of the word synthesis, meaning \u201cputting together\u201d): it kills only in partnership with the cancer-specific mutation. As we become increasingly able to pinpoint the specific alterations in cancer cells that make them different from their normal neighbors, new opportunities for such precisely targeted treatments are coming into view. We end this chapter with some examples of new treatments of this type that are already being put into practice."
