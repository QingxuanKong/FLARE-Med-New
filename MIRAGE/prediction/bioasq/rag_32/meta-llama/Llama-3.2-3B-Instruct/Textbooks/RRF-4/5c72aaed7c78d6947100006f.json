            "content": "Chemotherapy is rarely useful for brain metastases. Metastases from certain tumor types that are highly chemosensitive, such as germ cell tumors or small-cell lung cancer, may respond to chemotherapeutic regimens chosen according to the underlying malignancy. Increasingly, there are data demonstrating responsiveness of brain metastases to chemotherapy including small molecule\u2013targeted therapy when the lesion possesses the target. This has been best illustrated in patients with lung cancer harboring EGFR mutations that sensitize them to EGFR inhibitors. Antiangiogenic agents such as bevacizumab may also prove efficacious in the treatment of CNS metastases."

They generally present in the fourth and fifth decades of life as variably enhancing tumors. Treatment is the same as for glioblastoma, consisting of maximal safe surgical resection followed by RT with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide or by RT and adjuvant temozolomide alone."

            "content": "some glioblastomas lead to resistance to chemotherapy. Hegi and colleagues found a relationship between the epigenetic silencing of the promoter of this gene (\u201cmethylation status\u201d) and the response to temozolomide. In fact, almost all the marginal benefit of the drug in their study could be attributed to improved survival in this group who displayed a methylated gene. However, there is still activity of temozolomide in nonmethylated tumors and it is used in almost all cases. Additionally, there may be an interaction between MGMT methylation and mutations in other genes such as IDH1 (Wick et al)."
