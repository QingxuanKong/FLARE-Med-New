The variants of psychological factors affecting other medical conditions are removed in favor of the stern diagnosis. Criteria for conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder) have been modified to emphasize the essential importance of the neurological examina- tion, and in recognition that relevant psychological factors may not be demonstrable at the time of diagnosis.

And there are many cases that do not conform entirely to the conventional subtypes or that display characteristics of more than one type (referred to as undifferentiated or mixed types). They are briefly reviewed here for their historical interest and because their elimination in modern work signals a willingness of the field to move ahead with classification of mental disease on the basis of demonstrated biologic and therapeutic distinctions.

We take a neutral position on the value of DSM not out of iconoclasm but because the definitions in that system are changed frequently, are subject to considerable controversy, and often do not accord with neurobiologic ideas of brain function. In any case, readers may wish to consult the most current DSM-5 where appropriate, to gain insight into the evolving thinking of the psychiatric community."

In theory, it prepares one for the next step, of passing from a superficial to a deeper order of inquiry, where questions of pathogenesis and etiology can be broached. Practically, it provides certain clues that are useful in differential diagnosis.

Individuals with personality disorders are often regarded as \u201cdifficult patients\u201d in clinical medical practice because they are seen as excessively demanding and/or unwilling to follow recommended treatment plans.

Unfortunately, the diagnosis of schizophrenia depends on the recognition of characteristic psychologic disturbances largely unsupported by physical findings and laboratory data. This inevitably results in a certain degree of diagnostic imprecision. In other words, any group classified as schizophrenic will include patients with diseases that only resemble schizophrenia, whereas variant or incomplete cases of schizophrenia may not have been included. Moreover, there is not full agreement as to whether all the conditions that are called schizophrenic are the expression of a single disease process. In"

The symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., anatomical le- sions and infections of the brain, visual epilepsies) and are not better explained by an- other mental disorder (e.g., delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, schizophrenia) or hypnopompic hallucinations."

This chapter includes the diagnoses of somatic symptom disorder, illness anxiety disorder, con- version disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder), psychological factors affect- ing other medical conditions, factitious disorder, other specified somatic symptom and related disorder, and unspecified somatic symptom and related disorder. All of the disor- ders in this chapter share a common feature: the prominence of somatic symptoms associ\u2014 ated with significant distress and impairment.

Hallmarks of this condition are the failure of repeated examinations to disclose any physical basis for the patient\u2019s symptoms and the failure of reassurance to affect either the patient\u2019s symptoms or his conviction of being sick. It is estimated that 85 percent of hypochondriasis is secondary to other mental disorders, chiefly depression, but also schizophrenia and anxiety neuroses. In approximately 15 percent of cases, however, there appears to be no associated illness (primary hypochondriasis). Most patients in this latter category are habitu\u00e9s of medical outpatient clinics, who are passed from specialist to specialist, perplexing and angering doctors along the way, because their symptoms defy both satisfactory diagnosis and cure."
