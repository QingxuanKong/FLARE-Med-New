Prevalence increases with age and may be as high as 20% in individuals over 85, although long-term epidemiologic studies suggest that the overall prevalence of dementia has decreased in the USA and Europe over the last 15\u201330 years (see Langa 2017). The annual cost of dementia in the United States is estimated at $150\u2013$215 billion annually. Both familial and sporadic forms have been identified. Early onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is associated with several gene defects, including trisomy 21 (chromosome 21), a mutation of the gene for presenilin-1 on chromosome 14, and an abnormal allele, \u03b54, for the lipid-associated protein, ApoE, on chromosome 19. Unlike the common forms (ApoE \u03b52 and \u03b53), the \u03b54 form strongly correlates with the formation of amyloid \u03b2 deposits (see below)."

When APP is cleaved sequentially by \u03b2 secretase and then secretase, the resulting amyloid protein can be 40 (A\u03b240) or 42 (A\u03b242) amino acids in length. The latter favors the formation of aggregated fibrillary amyloid protein (fibrillogenesis) rather than normal APP degradation. The fibrillary form of amyloid is neurotoxic, a mechanism favored as the cause of cell damage in Alzheimer disease. Formation of A\u03b242 is promoted by mutations, either in the APP gene itself or in the presenilins. In Down syndrome, excess production of APP and its product A\u03b242 is caused by triplication of the long arm of chromosome 21, the location of the APP gene. The Apo E4 allele is associated with inadequate clearance of A\u03b242 and is another mechanism that promotes fibrillogenesis.

Certain sequence variants in normal genes confer an increased risk of the disease. The one first discovered was Apo E, a regulator of lipid metabolism that has an affinity for A\u03b2 in Alzheimer plaques, has been found to modify the risk of acquiring Alzheimer disease. Of the several isoforms of Apo E, the presence of E4 (and its corresponding allele e4 on chromosome 19) is associated with a tripling of the risk of developing sporadic Alzheimer disease (Roses; Strittmatter et al; Polvikoski et al). This is the same allele that contributes to an elevated low-density lipoprotein fraction in the serum. Possession of two e4 alleles virtually assures the development of disease in those who survive to their eighties. The e4 allele also modifies the age of onset of some of the familial forms of the disease. In contrast, the e2 allele is underrepresented among Alzheimer patients. For these"

ApoE is present in multiple copies on chylomicron remnants and IDL, and mediates their removal via hepatic lipoprotein receptors (Fig. 421-2). FDBL is due to genetic variants of apoE, most commonly apoE2, that result in an apoE protein with reduced ability to bind lipoprotein receptors. The APOE gene is polymorphic in sequence, resulting in the expression of three common isoforms: apoE3, which is the most common; and apoE2 and apoE4, which both differ from apoE3 by a single amino acid.

In contrast, the e2 allele is underrepresented among Alzheimer patients. For these reasons it has been proposed that Apo E, by interacting with APP or tau protein in some way, modifies the formation of plaques. Indeed, possession of the e4 allele correlates with increased deposition of A\u03b2 in the brain (McNamara). As pointed out by Hardy, Apo E appears to act at a point in the pathogenesis that is after the various genetic mutations have influenced the cellular pathology that ostensibly causes Alzheimer disease. However, these relationships do not invariably connect an allele to the disease in a particular individual. In other words, the e4 allele does not act as a mendelian trait but as a susceptibility (risk) factor. It follows that many, if not most, individuals who develop Alzheimer disease do not have the risk allele. Moreover, many individuals with the e4 allele live into"

            "content": "The Apo \u03b5 gene on chromosome 19 is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The protein, apolipoprotein E, participates in cholesterol transport (Chap. 421), and the gene has three alleles: \u03b52, \u03b53, and \u03b54. The Apo \u03b54 allele confers increased risk of AD in the general population, including sporadic and late-age-of-onset familial forms. Approximately 24\u201330% of the nondemented white population has at least one \u03b54 allele (12\u201315% allele frequency), and about 2% are \u03b54/\u03b54 homozygotes. Among patients with AD, 40\u201365% have at least one \u03b54 allele, a highly significant elevation compared with controls. Conversely, many AD patients have no \u03b54 allele, and \u03b54 carriers may never develop AD. Therefore, \u03b54 is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause AD. Nevertheless, the Apo \u03b54 allele represents the most important genetic risk factor for sporadic AD and acts as a dose-dependent disease modifier, with the earliest age of onset associated with the \u03b54 homozygosity. Precise mechanisms through which Apo \u03b54"

            "content": "Namenda in 5 and 10 mg oral tablets. Recent research has focused on amyloid beta, because the char acteristic plaques consist mostly of this peptide. Unfortunately, two anti-amyloid antibodies, solanezumab and bapineuzumab, both failed to improve cognition or slow progression in recent clinical trials. Verubecestat, an inhibitor of beta-site amyloid pre cursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE1), reduces the production of amyloid \u03b2. This drug showed safety in an early clinical trial, and longer-term phase 3 trials for efficacy are under way. Another effort suggests that the accumulation of filamentous tangles of tau protein is a critical component of neuronal damage in Alzheimer\u2019s and several other neurodegenerative conditions. Accumulation of tau appears to be associated with dissociation from microtubules in neurons, which has stimulated interest in drugs that inhibit microtubule disassembly, such as epothilone-D."

In heterozygous patients, LDL can be normalized with reductase inhibitors or combined drug regimens (Figure 35\u20132). Homozygotes and those with combined heterozygosity whose receptors retain even minimal function may partially respond to niacin, ezetimibe, and reductase inhibitors. Emerging therapies for these patients include mipomersen, employing an antisense strategy targeted at apo B-100, and lomitapide, a small molecule inhibitor of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), and monoclonal antibodies directed at PCSK9. LDL apheresis is effective in medication-refractory patients."
