    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and output in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if KAT2A is involved in Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we need to review the provided documents and look for any mention of the KAT2A gene in the context of AML. We also need to consider the role of KAT2A in cellular processes and its potential relationship to cancer. The question does not provide direct information about KAT2A in AML, so we need to make an educated inference based on the available information. According to the provided documents, AML is a heterogeneous group of diseases with various genetic abnormalities. The documents mention specific genetic abnormalities associated with AML, such as t(8;21)(q22;q22), inv(16)(p13.1q22), and t(15;17)(q22;q12), but do not mention KAT2A. However, KAT2A is a member of the Sirtuin family of proteins, which are involved in cellular processes such as aging, stress resistance, and metabolism. Some studies have suggested that Sirtuins, including KAT2A, may play a role in cancer development and progression. Therefore, it is possible that KAT2A may be involved in AML, but the available information is not conclusive. Based on the available information, the most accurate answer is that KAT2A is not explicitly mentioned in the documents as being involved in AML, but it is possible that it may be involved in the broader context of cancer development and progression. However, without further information, the best answer is B. no, but with the caveat that KAT2A may have a role in AML in some capacity.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",

In this classification, subtypes of AML are recognized based on the presence or absence of specific recurrent genetic abnormalities.

AML associated with TP53 mutations has emerged as a subtype with a particularly poor prognosis. A bright spot is the improvement in outcomes in acute promyelocytic leukemia brought about by targeted treatment with ATRA and arsenic salts. IDH inhibitors also have produced encouraging results, apparently (like ATRA) by inducing the differentiation of AML blasts.

These mutations interfere with the differentiation of early myeloid cells, leading to the accumulation of myeloid precursors (blasts) in the marrow. Of particular interest is the (15;17) translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia, which results in the fusion of the retinoic acid receptor \u03b1 (RARA) gene on chromosome 17 and the PML gene on chromosome 15. The chimeric gene produces a PML/RARA fusion protein that blocks myeloid differentiationat the promyelocyticstage, probablyinpart by inhibiting the function of normal retinoic acid receptors. Remarkably, pharmacologic doses of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an analogue of vitamin A (Chapter 7), overcome this block and induce the neoplastic promyelocytes to differentiate into neutrophils rapidly.

These 132 leukemias comprise a spectrum of malignancies that, untreated, range from rapidly fatal to slowly growing. In 2013, the estimated number of new AML cases in the United States was 14,590. The incidence of AML is ~3.5 per 100,000 people per year, and the age-adjusted incidence is higher in men than in women (4.5 vs 3.1). AML incidence increases with age; it is 1.7 in individuals age <65 years and 15.9 in those age >65 years. The median age at diagnosis is 67 years."

AMLs in the last category are subclassified based on the predominant line of differentiation that the tumor exhibits. Immunophenotype. The expression of immunologic markers is heterogeneous in AML.

This can be important for separating AML from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and identifying some subtypes of AML. For example, AML with minimal differentiation that is characterized by immature morphology and no lineage-specific cytochemical reactions may be diagnosed by flow-cytometric demonstration of the myeloid-specific antigens cluster designation (CD) 13 and/ or 117. Similarly, acute megakaryoblastic leukemia can often be diagnosed only by expression of the platelet-specific antigens CD41 and/ or CD61. Although flow cytometry is useful, widely used, and in some cases essential for the diagnosis of AML, it is supportive only in establishing the different subtypes of AML through the WHO classification."

            "content": "of FLT3 are present in ~30% of adult AML patients due to ITDs in the juxtamembrane domain or point mutations of the activating loop of the kinase (called tyrosine kinase domain mutations). Aberrant activation of the FLT3-encoded protein provides increased proliferation and antiapoptotic signals to the myeloid progenitor cell. FLT3-ITD, the more common of the FLT3 mutations, occurs preferentially in patients with CN-AML. The importance of identifying FLT3-ITD at diagnosis relates to the fact that not only is it a useful prognosticator but it also may predict response to specific treatment such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are in clinical investigation."

            "content": "survival assumes greater importance. Certain alkylating agents (eg, cyclophosphamide) may be less carcinogenic than others (eg, melphalan). In addition to AML, other secondary malignancies have been well-described, including non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and bladder cancer, the latter most typically associated with cyclophosphamide therapy. Etoposide can give rise to an 11:23 translocation, which has been associated with the development of the M4 and M5 AML histologic subtypes."

The discovery of novel gene mutations and mechanisms of leukemogenesis that might represent actionable therapeutic targets has prompted the development of new targeting agents. In addition to kinase inhibitors for FLT3and KIT-mutated AML, other compounds targeting the aberrant activity of mutant proteins (e.g., IDH2 inhibitors) or biologic mechanisms deregulating epigenetics (e.g., histone deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors), cell proliferation (e.g., farnesyl transferase inhibitors), protein synthesis (e.g., aminopeptide inhibitors) and folding (e.g., heat shock protein inhibitors), and ubiquitination, or with novel"

            "content": "Because prognostic molecular markers in AML are not mutually exclusive and often occur concurrently (>80% patients have at least two or more prognostic gene mutations), the likelihood that distinct marker combinations may be more informative than single markers is being recognized. Epigenetic changes (e.g., DNA methylation) and microRNAs are often involved in deregulation of genes involved in hematopoiesis, contribute to leukemogenesis, and are often associated with the previously discussed prognostic gene mutations. These changes not only have been shown to provide biologic insights into leukemogenic mechanisms, but also independent prognostic information. Indeed, it is anticipated that with the enormous progress made in DNA and RNA sequencing technology, additional genetic and epigenetic aberrations will soon be discovered and will contribute to classification and reporting systems and outcome risk determination in AML patients."

            "content": "We are beginning to understand the precise nature of the genetic alterations responsible for some malignancies and to get a sense of the order in which they occur. The best-studied example is colon cancer, in which analyses of DNA from tissues extending from normal colon epithelium through adenoma to carcinoma have identified some of the genes mutated in the process (Fig. 101e-2). Other malignancies are believed to progress in a similar stepwise fashion, although the order and identity of genes affected may be different. TWO TYPES OF CANCER GENES: ONCOGENES AND TUMORSUPPRESSOR GENES There are two major types of cancer genes. The first type comprises genes that positively influence tumor formation and are known as oncogenes. The second type of cancer genes negatively impact tumor growth and have been named tumor-suppressor genes. Both oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes exert their effects on tumor growth Abbreviations: AML, acute myeloid leukemia; CML, chronic myeloid leukemia."
