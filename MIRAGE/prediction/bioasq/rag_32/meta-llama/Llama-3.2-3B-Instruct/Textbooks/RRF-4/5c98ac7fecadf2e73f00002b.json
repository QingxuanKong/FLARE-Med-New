According to Document [0], Anaplasma phagocytophilum is an obligately intracellular organism. In Document [9], it is mentioned that the cell envelope of a Gram-negative bacterium includes a lipid bilayer and porins, and the peptidoglycan layer is unique to bacteria. Since Anaplasma phagocytophilum is a Gram-negative bacterium, it must have a lipid bilayer and porins in its cell envelope. In Document [10], it is stated that Anaplasma phagocytophilum is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis ticks, which is a vector for Gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, Anaplasma phagocytophilum is indeed a Gram-negative bacterium. Given that it is an obligately intracellular organism and a Gram-negative bacterium, we can conclude that Anaplasma phagocytophilum is an obligate Gram-negative, intracellular bacterium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

The bacteria reside in vertebrate reservoirs and target vacuoles of hematopoietic cells (Fig. 211-4). Three Ehrlichia species and one Anaplasma species are transmitted by ticks to humans and cause infection that can be severe and prevalent. E. chaffeensis, the agent of HME, and an E. muris\u2013like agent (EMLA) infect predominantly mononuclear phagocytes; E. ewingii and A. phagocytophilum infect neutrophils. Infection with Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis is less well characterized, but the agent has been identified in human blood neutrophils."

            "content": "Prevention HGA prevention requires tick avoidance. Transmission can be documented as few as 4 h after a tick bite. The agent of Q fever is Coxiella burnetii, a small intracellular prokaryote that only recently was grown in cell-free medium. C. burnetii, a pleomorphic coccobacillus with a gram-negative cell wall, survives in harsh environments; it escapes intracellular killing in macrophages by inhibiting the final step in phagosome maturation (cathepsin fusion) and has adapted to the acidic phagolysosome by producing superoxide dismutase. Infection with C. burnetii induces a range of immunomodulatory responses, from immunosuppression in chronic Q fever to the production of autoantibodies, particularly those to smooth muscle and cardiac muscle."

(A) Phagocytosis of a particle (e.g., a bacterium) involves binding to receptors on the leukocyte membrane,engulfment,and fusion of the phagocytic vacuoles with lysosomes.This is followed by destruction of ingested particles within the phagolysosomes by lysosomal enzymes and by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. (B) In activated phagocytes, cytoplasmic components of the phagocyte oxidase enzyme assemble in the membrane of the phagosome to form the active enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of oxygen into superoxide ( O2 \u2212 ) and H2O2. Myeloperoxidase, present in the granules of neutrophils, converts H2O2 to hypochlorite. (C) Microbicidal reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) kill ingested microbes. During phagocytosis, granule contents may be released into extracellular tissues (not shown). iNOS, Inducible NO synthase; MPO, myeloperoxidase; ROS, reactive oxygen species."

The process by which microorganisms are killed within neutrophils is termed oxygen-dependent intracellular killing. In general, two biochemical pathways are involved in this process: the first is the phagocyte oxidase (phox) system that utilizes the phagocyte\u2019s nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex in the phagolysosome membrane; the second is associated with the lysosomal enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) found in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils (Fig 10.8)."
