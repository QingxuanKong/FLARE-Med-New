These advances come from a wholly unexpected source: the discovery of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and Cas (or CRISPR-associated genes). These are linked genetic elements that endow prokaryotes with a form of acquired immunity to phages and plasmids. Bacteria use this system to sample the DNA of infecting agents, incorporating it into the host genome as CRISPRs. CRISPRs are transcribed and processed into an RNA sequence that binds and directs the nuclease Cas9 to a sequences (e.g., a phage), leading to its cleavage and the destruction of the phage. Gene editing repurposes this process by using artificial guide RNAs (gRNAs) that bind Cas9 and are complementary to a DNA sequence of interest. Once directed to the target sequence by the gRNA, Cas9 induces double-strand DNA breaks."

In bacteria, DNA sequences consisting of CRISPRs are transcribed into guide RNAs (gRNAs) with a constant region and a variable sequence of about 20 bases. The constant regions of gRNAs bind to Cas9, permitting the variable regions to form heteroduplexes with homologous host cell DNA sequences. The Cas9 nuclease then cleaves the bound DNA, producing a double-stranded DNA break. To perform gene editing, gRNAs are designed with variable regions that are homologous to a target DNA sequence of interest. Coexpression of the gRNA and Cas9 in cells leads to efficient cleavage of the target sequence.

EGFR and KRAS mutations (in 30% of adenocarcinomas) are mutually exclusive, as might be expected since KRAS lies downstream of EGFR. Other \u201ctargetable\u201d mutations have been described in a low frequency of adenocarcinomas (4% to 6% overall), including mutations that activate other tyrosine kinases, including ALK, ROS1, HER2, or c-MET. Each of these kinases is optimally targeted by a different drug, which has spurred a new era of \u201cpersonalized\u201d lung cancer treatment, in which the genetics of the tumor guide therapy."

After infection by a virus (left panel), a small bit of DnA from the viral genome is inserted into the CriSpr locus. for this to happen, a small fraction of infected cells must survive the initial viral infection. the surviving cells, or more generally their descendants, transcribe the CriSpr locus and process the transcript into crrnAs (middle panel). Upon reinfection with a virus that the population has already been \u201cvaccinated\u201d against, the incoming viral DnA is destroyed by a complementary crrnA (right panel). for a CriSpr system to be effective, the crrnAs must not destroy the CriSpr locus itself, even though the crrnAs are complementary in sequence to it. in many species, in order for crrnAs to attack an invading DnA molecule, there must be additional short nucleotide sequences that are carried by the target molecule. Because these sequences, known as pAMs (protospacer adjacent motifs), lie outside the crrnA"

(A) The Cas9 protein (artificially expressed in the species of interest) binds to a guide RNA, designed by the experimenter and also expressed. The portion of RNA in light blue is needed for associations with Cas9; that in dark blue is specified by the experimenter to match a position on the genome. The only other requirement is that the adjacent genome sequence includes a short PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) that is needed for Cas9 to cleave. As described in Chapter 7, this sequence is how the CRISPR system in bacteria distinguishes its own genome from that of invading viruses. (B) When directed to make double-strand breaks, the CRISPR system greatly improves the ability to replace an endogenous gene with an experimentally altered gene since the altered gene is used to \u201crepair\u201d the double-strand break (C, D). By using a mutant form of Cas9 that can no longer cleave DNA, Cas9 can be used to activate a"

The cell repairs the double-strand break through either NHEJ or HDR. In NHEJ, the broken ends are recognized, bound, and tethered by end-binding protein complexes. The ends are then processed and ligated but may result in ran-dom insertion/deletion (experimentally, deletions are more commonly seen) mutations at the break site. The repair process in HDR, however, generates no random error due to the presence of a homologous repair template. During the repair, the broken strands find the homologous template and proceed with DNA synthesis using the template. This results in a repaired DNA that has the same sequence as the repair template. Therefore, point mutations, insertions, or deletions carried on the template will be inherited by the repaired DNA and thus achieve precise gene editing.designed site within the sgRNA, and the"

As we saw in Chapter 5, double-strand breaks are often repaired by homologous recombination; here, the template chosen by the cell to repair the damage is often the altered gene, which is introduced to ES cells by the experimenter. In this way, the normal gene can be selectively damaged by the CRISPR system and replaced at high efficiency by the experimentally altered gene."

Thus, the current trend in molecular diagnostic laboratories is to develop methods that permit several hundred exons of key genes to be sequenced simultaneously at sufficient \u201cdepth\u201d (fold coverage of the sequence in question) to reliably detect any mutations that might be present in as few as 5% of tumor cells. A second method that is moving into clinical practice involves the use of DNA arrays to identify changes in DNA copy number, such as amplifications and deletions. Arrays containing probes that span the entire genome at some standard spacing can detect all but the smallest copy number aberrations, providing information that is complementary to that obtained from focused DNA sequencing. Other \u201comics,\u201d such as proteomics and epigenomics, are currently being used mainly in the realm of clinical research, but with many drugs that target the cancer epigenome moving into the clinic, it can be anticipated that tests directed at assessing the state of the epigenome that"
