But different combinations of mutations and epigenetic changes are found in different types of cancer, and even in different patients with the same type of cancer, reflecting the random way in which these inherited changes arise. Nevertheless, many of the same changes are encountered repeatedly, suggesting that there are a limited number of ways to breach our defenses against cancer.

The self-sufficiency in growth that characterizes cancer cells generally stems from gain-of-function mutations that convert proto-oncogenes to oncogenes. Oncogenes encode proteins called oncoproteins that promote cell growth, even in the absence of normal growth-promoting signals. To appreciate how oncogenes drive inappropriate cell growth, it is helpful to review briefly the sequence of events that characterize normal cell proliferation (introduced in Chapter 1).

Before doing so, however, we must first touch on the important concept of driver mutations and passenger mutations. Driver mutations are mutations that alter the function of cancer genes and thereby directly contribute to the development or progression of a given cancer. They are usually acquired, but as mentioned earlier, occasionally inherited. By contrast, passenger mutations are acquired mutations that are neutral in terms of fitness and do not affect cellular behavior; they just come along for the proverbial ride. Because they occur at random, passenger mutations are sprinkled throughout the genome, whereas driver mutations tend to be tightly clustered within cancer genes. It is now appreciated that particularly in cancers caused by carcinogen exposure, such as melanoma and smoking-related lung cancer, passenger mutations greatly outnumber driver mutations."

Cancer formation is initiated by damage to DNA of stem cells. The damage overcomes DNA repair mechanisms, but is not lethal. 1. Carcinogens are agents that damage DNA, increasing the risk for cancer. Important carcinogens include chemicals, oncogenic viruses, and radiation (Table 3.2). B. DNA mutations eventually disrupt key regulatory systems, allowing for tumor promotion (growth) and progression (spread). 1. Disrupted systems include proto-oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and regulators of apoptosis. II. ONCOGENES A. Proto-oncogenes are essential for cell growth and differentiation; mutations of proto-oncogenes form oncogenes that lead to unregulated cellular growth."

            "content": "In the end, observations of cancer occurring in chimney sweeps, studies of x-rays, and the overwhelming data demonstrating cigarette smoke as a causative agent in lung cancer, together with Ames\u2019s work on chemical mutagenesis, provided convincing evidence that cancer originated through changes in DNA. Although the viral theory of cancer did not prove to be generally accurate (with the exception of human papillomaviruses, which can cause cervical and other cancers in human), the study of retroviruses led to the discovery of the first human oncogenes in the late 1970s. Soon after, the study of families with genetic predisposition to cancer was instrumental in the discovery of tumor-suppressor genes. The field that studies the type of mutations, as well as the consequence of these mutations in tumor cells, is now known as cancer genetics. Nearly all cancers originate from a single cell; this clonal origin is a critical discriminating feature between neoplasia and hyperplasia."

            "content": "We are beginning to understand the precise nature of the genetic alterations responsible for some malignancies and to get a sense of the order in which they occur. The best-studied example is colon cancer, in which analyses of DNA from tissues extending from normal colon epithelium through adenoma to carcinoma have identified some of the genes mutated in the process (Fig. 101e-2). Other malignancies are believed to progress in a similar stepwise fashion, although the order and identity of genes affected may be different. TWO TYPES OF CANCER GENES: ONCOGENES AND TUMORSUPPRESSOR GENES There are two major types of cancer genes. The first type comprises genes that positively influence tumor formation and are known as oncogenes. The second type of cancer genes negatively impact tumor growth and have been named tumor-suppressor genes. Both oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes exert their effects on tumor growth Abbreviations: AML, acute myeloid leukemia; CML, chronic myeloid leukemia."

            "content": "A large-scale genetic screen can turn up many different mutations that show the same phenotype. These defects might lie in different genes that function in the same process, or they might represent different mutations in the same gene. Alternative forms of the same gene are known as alleles. The most common difference between alleles is a substitution of a single nucleotide pair, but different alleles can also bear deletions, substitutions, and duplications. How can we tell, then, whether two mutations that produce the same phenotype occur in the same gene or in different genes? If the mutations are recessive\u2014if, for example, they represent a loss of function of a particular gene\u2014a complementation test can be used to ascertain whether the mutations fall in the same gene or in different genes. To test complementation in a diploid organism, an individual that is homozygous for one mutation\u2014that is, it possesses two identical alleles of the mutant gene in question\u2014is mated with an"
