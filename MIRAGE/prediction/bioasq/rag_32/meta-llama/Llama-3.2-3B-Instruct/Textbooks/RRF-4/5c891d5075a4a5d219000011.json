Analyses of postmortem human and animal brains have failed to demonstrate a decline with age in the concentration of serotonin or its metabolites (McEntee and Crook). Accurate assessment of other neurotransmitters has been more difficult because of their marked lability in postmortem material. Data from experiments in rats suggest that the glutamate content of the brain and the number of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors diminish with age, but the functional significance of this finding is unclear.

            "content": "Depression occurs frequently in patients with neurologic disorders, particularly cerebrovascular disorders, Parkinson\u2019s disease, dementia, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury. One in five patients with left-hemisphere stroke involving the dorsolateral frontal cortex experiences major depression. Late-onset depression in otherwise cognitively normal individuals increases the risk of a subsequent diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. All classes of antidepressant agents are effective against these depressions, as are, in some cases, stimulant compounds."
