Testing is particularly useful when there is a serial decline in ability. Certain aspects of attention and executive function in Alzheimer disease that also show changes in Alzheimer disease were reviewed by Perry and Hodges. The use of these examinations is described in Chap. 20. Beyond PET and related imaging studies there are no established biologic markers of Alzheimer disease with the possible exception of the ratio of tau to A\u03b2 42 (tau-amyloid ratio) in the cerebrospinal fluid (the ratio is low in Alzheimer disease). This test is used in some clinics and in clinical trials (Maddalena et al). Schoonenboom and colleagues have shown that the incorporation of CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) with the typical CSF amyloid/tau ratio may provide additional specificity in distinguishing Alzheimer from other dementing diseases."

These criteria have essentially been reaffirmed by more recent consensus panels (see McKhann et al, 2011). Using these measures, the correct diagnosis is achieved in more than 85 percent of patients, but this is not surprising given that Alzheimer disease is overwhelmingly the most common cause of adult dementia. Most cases are identifiable without resorting to restrictive lists such as these, especially if the patient is observed serially over a period of months or years. There is strong interest in the addition of biomarkers such as positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for amyloid and tau/amyloid ratio in CSF to the diagnostic criteria for the disease but the diagnosis remains predominantly a clinical one, aided by imaging and other tests."

Alternatively, soluble oligomers of A\u03b2 amyloid may be the toxic agents, whereas the emphasis until now has been on the effects of visible assemblies of insoluble amyloid fibrils. Similarly, TDP-43, the product of inadequate functioning of the progranulin gene, is also deposited in neurons and may play a substantial role in the severity of expression of Alzheimer disease; this protein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia and motor neuron disease, both discussed later in the chapter.

When APP is cleaved sequentially by \u03b2 secretase and then secretase, the resulting amyloid protein can be 40 (A\u03b240) or 42 (A\u03b242) amino acids in length. The latter favors the formation of aggregated fibrillary amyloid protein (fibrillogenesis) rather than normal APP degradation. The fibrillary form of amyloid is neurotoxic, a mechanism favored as the cause of cell damage in Alzheimer disease. Formation of A\u03b242 is promoted by mutations, either in the APP gene itself or in the presenilins. In Down syndrome, excess production of APP and its product A\u03b242 is caused by triplication of the long arm of chromosome 21, the location of the APP gene. The Apo E4 allele is associated with inadequate clearance of A\u03b242 and is another mechanism that promotes fibrillogenesis.

As shown schematically in Fig. 38-2, the A\u03b2 protein is cleaved from APP by the action of proteases termed \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 secretase. One current hypothesis focuses on the manner in which APP is cleaved by these enzymes to give rise to different-length residues of A\u03b2. During normal cellular metabolism, APP is cleaved by either \u03b1 or \u03b2 secretase. The products of this reaction are then cleaved by the \u03b3-secretase isoform of the enzyme. The sequential cleavage by \u03b1 and then \u03b3 produces tiny fragments that are not toxic to neurons. However, cleavage by \u03b2 and then \u03b3 results in a 40-amino-acid product, A\u03b240, and a longer 42-amino-acid form. The latter A\u03b242 form is toxic in several models of Alzheimer disease, and it has been proposed that the ratio of A\u03b242 to A\u03b240 is critical to the neuronal toxicity of amyloid."

            "content": "An increased incidence of myelocytic and lymphocytic leukemia takes its toll. A number of patients have had embolic strokes and brain abscesses secondary to cardiac abnormalities and there is disproportionate occurrence of the rare cerebrovascular disorder, moyamoya (see Chap. 33). Life expectancy is later shortened by the almost universal development of Alzheimer disease by the 40th year of life. This is explained by the presence on the duplicate copy of chromosome 21 of the gene for the precursor of the protein amyloid, a central factor in the development of Alzheimer disease. As Alzheimer disease develops, the usual clinical picture is marked by inattentiveness, reduced speech, impairment of visuospatial orientation, loss of memory and judgment, and seizures."

            "content": "The possibility that protein aggregation plays a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases is a major focus of current research. Protein aggregation is a major histopathologic hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. Deposition of \u03b2-amyloid is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Genetic mutations in familial AD cause increased production of \u03b2-amyloid with 42 amino acids, which has an increased propensity to aggregate, as compared to \u03b2-amyloid with 40 amino acids. Furthermore, mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which reduce the production of \u03b2-amyloid, protect against the development of AD and are associated with preserved cognition in the elderly. Mutations in genes encoding the MAPT lead 444e-9 to altered splicing of tau and the production of neurofibrillary tangles in frontotemporal dementia and progressive supranuclear palsy. Familial Parkinson\u2019s disease is associated with mutations in leucinerich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), \u03b1-synuclein, parkin,"
