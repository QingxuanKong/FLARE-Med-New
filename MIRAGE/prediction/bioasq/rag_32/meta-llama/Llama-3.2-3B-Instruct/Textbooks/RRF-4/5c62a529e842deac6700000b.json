According to Alberts' Cell Biology, yeast chromosomes are organized into fractal globules, which are compact structures that allow for dense packing of chromatin while preserving the ability to unfold and fold. This suggests a level of organization, but it does not directly indicate the presence of topologically associated domains (TADs). However, research has shown that the yeast genome is organized into topologically associated domains (TADs), which are regions of chromatin that are topologically associated with each other and are separated from other regions by insulating elements. This organization is thought to play a role in regulating gene expression. Given this information, the correct answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

An underlying theme occurs repeatedly: A trans-acting protein functions as a specific transcription factor (STF) that binds to a cisacting regulatory consensus sequence (see p. 415) on each of the genes in the group even if they are on different chromosomes. [Note: The STF has a DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a transcription activation domain (TAD). The TAD recruits coactivators, such as histone acetyltransferases (see p. 438), and the general transcription factors (see p. 439) that, along with RNA pol, are required for formation of the transcription initiation complex at the promoter. Although the TAD recruits a variety of proteins, the specific effect of any one of them is dependent upon the protein composition of the complex.

Bacteria, archaea, and some single-celled eukaryotes, such as yeast, have concise genomes, consisting of little more than strings of closely packed genes. However, the genomes of multicellular plants and animals, as well as many other eukaryotes, contain, in addition to genes, a large quantity of interspersed DNA whose function is poorly understood (Figure 4\u201313).
