Capping at the 5\u2032-end (see p. 441), polyadenylation at the 3\u2032-end (see p. 442), and splicing (see p. 442) are essential for the production of a functional eukaryotic messenger from most pre-mRNA. Variations in splicing and polyadenylation can affect gene expression. In addition, messenger stability also affects gene expression. 1. Alternative splicing: Tissue-specific protein isoforms can be made from the same pre-mRNA through alternative splicing, which can involve exon skipping (loss), intron retention, and use of alternative splice-donor or -acceptor sites (Fig. 33.12). For example, the pre-mRNA for tropomyosin (TM) undergoes tissue-specific alternative splicing to yield a number of TM isoforms (see p. 443).

Earlier in this section we saw that alternative splicing can give rise to different proteins from the same gene and that this is a common strategy to enhance the coding potential of genomes. Some examples of alternative splicing are constitutive; that is, the alternatively spliced mRNAs are produced continuously by cells of an organism. However, in many cases, the cell regulates the splicing patterns so that different forms of the protein are produced at different times and in different tissues (see Figure 6\u201326). In Chapter 7, we return to this issue to discuss some specific examples of regulated RNA splicing."

The machinery that catalyzes pre-mRNA splicing is complex, consisting of five addi-tional RNA molecules and several hundred proteins, and it hydrolyzes many ATP molecules per splicing event. This complexity ensures that splicing is accurate, while at the same time being flexible enough to deal with the enormous variety of introns found in a typical eukaryotic cell. It may seem wasteful to remove large numbers of introns by RNA splicing. In attempting to explain why it occurs, scientists have pointed out that the exon\u2013 intron arrangement would seem to facilitate the emergence of new and useful proteins over evolutionary time scales.

This type of RNA\u2013RNA rearrangement (in which the formation of one RNA\u2013RNA interaction requires the disruption of another) occurs several times during splicing and allows the spliceosomes to check and recheck the splicing signals, thereby increasing the overall accuracy of splicing. Second, the rearrangements that take place in the spliceosome create the active sites for the two transesterification reactions. These two active sites are created, one after the other, and only after the splicing signals on the pre-mRNA have been checked several times. This orderly progression ensures that splicing"

Instead, the mutation typically creates a new pattern of splicing (Figure 6\u201333). Most commonly, an exon is simply skipped (Figure 6\u201333B). In other cases, the mutation causes a cryptic splice junction to be efficiently used (Figure 6\u201333C). Apparently, the splicing machinery has evolved to pick out the best possible pattern of splice junctions, and if the optimal one is damaged by mutation, it will seek out the next best pattern, and so on. This inherent plasticity in the process of RNA splicing suggests that changes in splicing patterns caused by random mutations have been important in the evolution of genes and organisms. It also means that mutations that affect splicing can be severely detrimental to the organism: in addition to the \u03b2 thalassemia, example presented in Figure 6\u201333, aberrant"

Alternative splicing represents a powerful mechanism for generation of complexity and variation, and this mechanism appears to be highly prevalent in the nervous system, affecting key processes such as neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels. Numerous diseases are already known to result from abnormalities in alternative splicing. Increased inclusion of exon 10\u2013containing transcripts of MAPT can cause frontotemporal dementia. Aberrant splicing also contributes to the pathogenesis of Duchenne\u2019s, myotonic, and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophies; ataxia telangiectasia; neurofibromatosis; some inherited ataxias; and fragile X syndrome, among other disorders. It is also likely that subtle"

            "content": "There is a second and more direct way that chromatin structure can affect RNA splicing. Although the details are not yet understood, specific histone modifications attract components of the spliceosome, and, because the chromatin being transcribed is in close association with the nascent RNA, these splicing components can easily be transferred to the emerging RNA. In this way, certain types of histone modifications can affect the final pattern of splicing."

            "content": "Figure 6\u201325 The pre-mRNA splicing reaction. (A) In the first step, a specific adenine nucleotide in the intron sequence (indicated in red ) attacks the 5\u02b9 splice site and cuts the sugar-phosphate backbone of the RNA at this point. The cut 5\u02b9 end of the intron becomes covalently linked to the adenine nucleotide, as shown in detail in (B), thereby creating a loop in the RNA molecule. The released free 3\u02b9-OH end of the exon sequence then reacts with the start of the next exon sequence, joining the two exons together and releasing the intron sequence in the shape of a lariat. The two exon sequences thereby become joined into a continuous coding sequence. The released intron sequence is eventually broken down into single nucleotides, which 5\u02dc 3\u02dc are recycled.

            "content": "Prion (spongiform) encephalopathy of all types has now been firmly associated with the conversion of a normal cellular protein, PrPc to an abnormal isoform, PrPsc. The transformation involves a change in the physical conformation of the protein in which its helical proportion diminishes and the proportion of the b pleated sheet increases (see reviews by Prusiner). The current understanding is that the \u201cinfectivity\u201d of prions and their propagation in brain tissue result from the susceptibility of the native PrP to alter its shape as a result of physical contiguity to the abnormal protein, a so-called conformational disease. Conformationally altered prions have a tendency to aggregate, and this may be the mode of cellular destruction that leads to neuronal disease. In contrast, familial cases of prion disease are thought to be the result of one of several gene aberrations residing in the region that code for PrPc."
