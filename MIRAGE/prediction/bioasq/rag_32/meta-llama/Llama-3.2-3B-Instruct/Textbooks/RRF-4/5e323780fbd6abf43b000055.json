Document [0] states that there is evidence that persons who have undergone radiation therapy to the scalp or cranium are vulnerable to the development of meningiomas and that the tumors appear at an earlier age in such individuals. Document [6] also mentions that radiation, whatever its source, is an established carcinogen and that unprotected miners of radioactive elements have a 10-fold increased incidence of lung cancers. However, it does not specifically mention meningiomas. Document [4] states that exposure to ionizing radiation increases the risk of myeloid leukemias, but it does not provide information on the risk of meningiomas. Document [22] mentions that a minimum of 5 rem and more likely greater than 10 rem exposure is needed to induce birth defects in the first trimester, but it does not specifically mention meningiomas. Document [0] mentions that radiation exposure during adolescence magnifies the deleterious effect of radiation, but it does not provide information on the risk of meningiomas in atomic bomb survivors. However, Document [6] mentions that survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have a markedly increased incidence of leukemia and other cancers after an average latent period of about 7 years. Given this information, it can be inferred that atomic bomb survivors may be at increased risk of developing meningiomas, but the available information is limited and inconclusive. Therefore, the correct answer is not explicitly stated in the provided documents. However, based on the available information, the most appropriate answer would be that there is some evidence to suggest an increased risk of meningiomas in atomic bomb survivors, but the risk is not well established.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Some are familial. There is evidence that persons who have undergone radiation therapy to the scalp or cranium are vulnerable to the development of meningiomas and that the tumors appear at an earlier age in such individuals (Rubinstein et al). Radiofrequency energy exposure from portable cellular devices has failed to be linked to elevated incidence of meningiomas (or gliomas). There are also a number of reports of a meningioma developing at the site of previous trauma, such as a cranial fracture line, but the association is uncertain."

Meningiomas may be found along any of the external surfaces of the brain as well as within the ventricular system, where they arise from the stromal arachnoid cells of the choroid plexus. They often come to attention because of vague nonlocalizing symptoms, or with focal findings referable to compression of adjacent brain. Most meningiomas are easily separable from underlying brain, but some tumors are infiltrative, a feature associated with an increased risk for recurrence. The overall prognosis is determined by the lesion size and location, surgical accessibility, and histologic grade."

Finally, there is an association between obesity and increased breast cancer risk. Because the major source of estrogen in postmenopausal women is the conversion of andro-stenedione to estrone by adipose tissue, obesity is associated with a long-term increase in estrogen exposure.Nonhormonal risk factors include radiation exposure. Young women who receive mantle radiation therapy for Hodg-kin\u2019s lymphoma have a breast cancer risk that is 75 times greater than that of age-matched control subjects. Survivors of the atomic bomb blasts in Japan during World War II have a very high incidence of breast cancer, likely because of somatic muta-tions induced by the radiation exposure. In both circumstances, radiation exposure during adolescence, a period of active breast development, magnifies the deleterious effect. Studies also sug-gest that the risk of breast cancer increases"

CML is not a frequent secondary leukemia following therapy of other cancers with alkylating agents and/or radiation. Exposure to ionizing radiation (e.g., nuclear accidents, radiation treatment for ankylosing spondylitis or cervical cancer) has increased the risk of CML, which peaks at 5\u201310 years after exposure and is dose-related. The median time to development of CML among atomic bomb survivors was 6.3 years. Following the Chernobyl accident, the incidence of CML did not increase, suggesting that only large doses of radiation can cause CML. Because of adequate protection, the risk of CML is not increased in individuals working in the nuclear industry or among radiologists in recent times."

This is likely due to blastomere destruction caused by chromosomal damage (Hall, 1991). During organogenesis, high-dose radiation-1 Gy or 100 rad-is more likely to cause malformations and growth restriction and less likely to have lethal efects in the mouse. Studies of brain development suggest efects on neuronal development and a window of cortical sensitivity in early and midfetal periods. That said, acute lowdose ionizing radiation appears to have no deleterious efects (Howell,r2013). Data on adverse human efects of high-dose ionizing radiation mostly derive from the atomic bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (Greskovich, 2000; Otake, 1987). The International Commission on Radiological Protection (2003) confirmed initial studies showing that the increased risk of severe mental retardation was greatest between 8 and 15 weeks' gestation."

It is a progressive myelopathy that follows, after a variable latent period, the radiation of malignant lesions in the vicinity of the spinal cord. The incidence of this complication is difficult to determine because many patients die of their malignant disease before the myelopathy has fully evolved but it was in previous eras of delivery of radiation estimated to be between 2 and 3 percent (Palmer). According to Douglas and colleagues, patients who have undergone hyperthermia as an adjunctive treatment for cancer are particularly vulnerable to radiation myelopathy."

            "content": "Despite all of these measures, survival is only slightly prolonged by treatment. The average period of survival in cases of brain metastases, even with therapy, is about 6 months, but it varies widely and is dominated by the extent of other systemic metastases. Between 15 and 30 percent of patients live for a year and 5 to 10 percent for 2 years; with certain radiosensitive tumors (lymphoma, testicular carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, some breast cancers), however, survival can be much longer. It has been stated, without strong corroboration, that patients with bone metastases tend to live longer than those with brain and meningeal metastases."
