    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the context of the provided documents and the role of the NLM medical text indexer (MTI) in the medical field. The MTI is a tool used to index and categorize medical texts, making it easier for researchers and healthcare professionals to find relevant information. The documents mention the importance of having access to reliable and organized medical information, particularly in the context of evidence-based medicine and clinical decision-making. The Cochrane Collaboration Complementary Medicine Reviews and MedlinePlus are mentioned as resources that provide systematic reviews and scientific evidence-based information. The MTI can be seen as a complementary tool to these resources, aiding in the organization and retrieval of medical information. However, the question of whether the MTI is still useful and relevant in today's medical landscape requires consideration of the current state of medical information management and retrieval. The documents mention the challenges of information overload and the need for efficient information management in medicine. Given the emphasis on evidence-based medicine and the importance of accessing reliable medical information, it is likely that the MTI remains a relevant tool for organizing and retrieving medical texts. Therefore, the answer to the question is that the NLM medical text indexer (MTI) is still useful and relevant.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The second form, systematic reviews, is the highest level of evidence in the hierarchy because it comprehensively summarizes the available evidence on a particular topic up to a certain date.

Ideally, patient records are easily transferred across the health care system. However, technologic limitations and concerns about privacy and cost continue to limit broad-based use of electronic health records in many clinical settings. As valuable as it is, information technology is merely a tool and can never replace the clinical decisions that are best made by the physician.

Thus, the much-heralded potential for personalized medicine, except in a few instances of drugs with a relatively low therapeutic index (eg, warfarin), has remained largely unrealized. This is so even though 98% of US physicians are apparently aware that such genetic information may significantly influence therapy. This is partly due to the lack of adequate training in translating this knowledge to medical practice, and partly due to the logistics of genetic testing and the issue of cost-effectiveness.

Identifying all individuals named \u201cMary\u201d would be a sensitive test, as anyone named Mary Adel would likely be included in the results. However, it is not specif c, as numerous other physicians would also be included. Remember the mnemonic \u201cSnout\u201d: High SENsitivity would allow one to rule out physicians not listed with this f rst name. Identifying only individuals with the full name \u201cMary Lucy Adel IV\u201d is very specifc, since individuals not named Mary Adel are especially likely to be declined. However, it is not sensitive, as she may be overlooked if she is not listed by her complete name. Remember the mnemonic \u201cSPin\u201d: High SPecifcity would allow one to rule in physicians listed with this full name. Once a test has been administered and a patient\u2019s result has been made available, that result must be interpreted through use of predictive values (or post-test probabilities):"

Several of these databases are particularly useful in obstetrics and maternal-fetal medicine practice. he GeneReviews database provides in-depth clinical information for nearly 700 genetic conditions, including diagnostic criteria, management, and genetic counseling considerations (National Center for Biotechnology Information, 2017a). The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) database contains information regarding the beneits and limitations of available tests for a given disorder. It lists more than 48,000 genetic tests and instructions for specimen collection and transport to individual laboratories throughout the world (National Center for Biotechnology Information, 2017b). Another database, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), is a comprehensive catalog of human genes and phenotypes that allows clinicians to search for"

            "content": "Despite the great technological advances in medicine over the last century, uncertainty remains a key challenge in all aspects of medical decision-making. Compounding this challenge is the massive information overload that characterizes modern medicine. Today\u2019s clinician needs access to close to 2 million pieces of information to practice medicine. According to one estimate, doctors subscribe to an average of seven journals, representing over 2500 new articles each year. Of course, to be useful, this information must be sifted for applicability to and then integrated with patient-specific data. Although computers appear to offer an obvious solution both for information management and for quantification of medical care uncertainties, many practical problems must be solved before computerized decision support can be routinely incorporated into the clinical reasoning process in a way that demonstrably improves the quality of care. For the present, understanding the nature of diagnostic"
