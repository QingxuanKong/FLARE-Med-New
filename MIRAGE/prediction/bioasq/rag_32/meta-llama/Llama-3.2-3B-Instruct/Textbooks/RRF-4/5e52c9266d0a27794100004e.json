According to the provided documents, AhR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is activated by various aromatic ligands, including dioxin. The activation of AhR leads to the induction of Cyp1a1, which is a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of various substances, including environmental pollutants. The induction of Cyp1a1 by AhR ligands makes them attractive targets for pharmaceutical development, as they can be used to treat diseases related to Cyp1a1 deficiency or dysfunction. Therefore, AhR ligands are indeed attractive drug targets for pharmaceutical development due to their induction of Cyp1a1.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

A cytoplasmic receptor (termed AhR) for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (eg, benzo[a]pyrene, dioxin) has been identified. The translocation of the inducer-receptor complex into the nucleus, followed by ligand-induced dimerization with Arnt, a closely related nuclear protein, leads to subsequent activation of regulatory elements of CYP1A genes, resulting in their induction. This is also the mechanism of CYP1A induction by cruciferous vegetables, and the proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole. A pregnane X receptor (PXR), a member of the steroid-retinoidthyroid hormone receptor family, has recently been shown to mediate CYP3A induction by various chemicals (dexamethasone, rifampin, mifepristone, phenobarbital, atorvastatin, and hyperforin, a constituent of St. John\u2019s wort) in the liver and intestinal mucosa.

Selectivity can be measured by comparing binding affinities of a drug to different receptors or by comparing ED50s for different effects of a drug in vivo. In drug development and in clinical medicine, selectivity is usually considered by separating effects into two categories: beneficial or therapeutic effects versus toxic or adverse effects. Pharmaceutical advertisements and prescribers occasionally use the term side effect, implying that the effect in question is insignificant or occurs via a pathway that is to one side of the principal action of the drug; such implications are frequently erroneous.

This flexibility is still poorly understood but is presently thought to underlie the ability of some drugs to produce a different spectrum of downstream effects from other drugs, despite binding to the same GPCR. Current drug development efforts are exploring the potential of this phenomenon, called functional selectivity or agonist bias, as a means to achieve specificity in drug action beyond that presently possible using conventional agonists and antagonists. Functionally selective agonists are thought to occupy the orthosteric ligand-binding site, making their binding competitive with conventional orthosteric agonists, but differ from conventional agonists in effects on receptor conformation after binding. Allosteric ligands may also stabilize different conformational states of the receptor, but differ from functionally selective ligands by binding noncompetitively to a different site."

Traditionally, drug binding was used to identify or purify receptor proteins from tissue extracts; consequently, receptors were discovered after the drugs that bind to them. Advances in molecular biology and genome sequencing made it possible to identify receptors by predicted structural homology to other (previously known) receptors. This effort revealed that many known drugs bind to a larger diversity of receptors than previously anticipated and motivated efforts to develop increasingly selective drugs. It also identified a number of orphan receptors, so-called because their natural ligands are presently unknown; these may prove to be useful targets for future drug development."

The molecular size, shape, and electrical charge of a drug determine whether\u2014and with what affinity\u2014it will bind to a particular receptor among the vast array of chemically different binding sites available in a cell, tissue, or patient. Accordingly, changes in the chemical structure of a drug can dramatically increase or decrease a new drug\u2019s affinities for different classes of receptors, with resulting alterations in therapeutic and toxic effects. 3. Receptors mediate the actions of pharmacologic agonists and antagonists. Some drugs and many natural ligands, such as hormones and neurotransmitters, regulate the function of receptor macromolecules as agonists; this means that they activate the receptor to signal as a direct result of binding to it. Some agonists activate a single kind of receptor to produce all their biologic functions, whereas others selectively promote one receptor function more than another."

The relation between dose of a drug and the clinically observed response may be complex. In carefully controlled in vitro systems, however, the relation between concentration of a drug and its effect is often simple and can be described with mathematical precision.

Thus, the pharmacologic potency of drug A in Figure 2\u201315 is less than that of drug B, a partial agonist because the EC50 of A is greater than the EC50 of B. Potency of a drug depends in part on the affinity (Kd) of receptors for binding the drug and in part on the efficiency with which drug-receptor interaction is coupled to response.

            "content": "do chemically similar drugs often exhibit extraordinary selectivity in their actions? these mechanisms provide targets for developing new drugs? Most transmembrane signaling is accomplished by a small number of different molecular mechanisms. Each type of mechanism has been adapted, through the evolution of distinctive protein families, to transduce many different signals. These protein families include receptors on the cell surface and within the cell, as well as enzymes and other components that generate, amplify, coordinate, and terminate postreceptor signaling by chemical second messengers in the cytoplasm. This section first discusses the mechanisms for carrying chemical information across the plasma membrane and then outlines key features of cytoplasmic second messengers."
