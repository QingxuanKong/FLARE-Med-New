According to the provided documents, Schistosoma japonicum is associated with a TH1-driven response, which can lead to fibrosis and tissue damage. However, there is no direct evidence to suggest that S. japonicum infection can prevent or improve asthma. In fact, S. japonicum is known to cause CNS schistosomiasis, which can lead to neurological symptoms. The documents also mention that S. japonicum is the second most common cause of epilepsy in certain areas, which may be related to its ability to induce a granulomatous response in the brain. Therefore, it is unlikely that S. japonicum infection can prevent or improve asthma. We need to consider the relationship between TH2 response and asthma, as S. mansoni is associated with a powerful TH2-type response, which may have a protective effect against asthma. However, S. japonicum has a TH1-driven response, which may not have the same protective effect. Based on the available information, the answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

This \u201chygiene hypothesis\u201d proposes that lack of infections in early childhood preserves the TH2 cell bias at birth, whereas exposure to infections and endotoxin results in a shift toward a predominant protective TH1 immune response. Children brought up on farms who are exposed to a high level of endotoxin are less likely to develop allergic sensitization than children raised on dairy farms. Intestinal parasite infection, such as hookworm, may also be associated with a reduced risk of asthma. Although there is considerable epidemiologic support for the hygiene hypothesis, it cannot account for the parallel increase in TH1-driven diseases such as diabetes mellitus over the same period."

            "content": "In the first category, the immune response is often partly responsible for the pathogenic effects. Infection by the helminth Schistosoma mansoni is associated with a powerful TH2-type response, characterized by high levels of IgE, circulating and tissue eosinophilia, and a harmful fibrotic response to schistosome ova in the liver, leading to hepatic fibrosis. Other common parasites, such as Plasmodium and Leishmania species, also cause damage in many patients because they are not eliminated effectively by the immune response. The mycobacterial agents of tuberculosis and leprosy cause a persistent intracellular infection; a TH1 response helps to contain these infections but also causes granuloma formation and tissue necrosis (see Fig. 11.13)."

In several studies, a few protective schistosome antigens have been identified as vaccine candidates, but none has been fully evaluated in human populations to date."
