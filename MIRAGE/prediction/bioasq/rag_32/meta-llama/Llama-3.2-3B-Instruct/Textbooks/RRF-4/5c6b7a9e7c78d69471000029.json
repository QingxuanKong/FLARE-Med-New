It is usually diagnosed late in the course of chronic liver disease, and a large majority of patients have underlying poor liver function and only limited hepatic reserve. In general, HCC is considered to be a chemotherapy-resistant disease, and palliative chemotherapy is usually not recommended as first-line therapy in patients with unresectable or advanced HCC.
