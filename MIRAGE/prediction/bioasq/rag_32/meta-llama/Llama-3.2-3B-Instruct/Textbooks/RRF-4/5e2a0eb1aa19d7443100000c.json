PRL3 (Phosphatase of Regenerating Liver 3) is a protein that has been implicated in cancer progression and metastasis. If PRL3-zumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting PRL3, it would likely inhibit PRL3+ cancer cells. However, without specific information about PRL3-zumab, we can look at related information about other HER2-targeted drugs and their effects on HER2+ cancer cells. HER2 is a related protein, and drugs targeting HER2 have shown efficacy in cancer treatment. If PRL3-zumab is a member of this class of drugs, it may also show similar effects on PRL3+ cancer cells.

Although IL-2 has no direct impact on cancer cells, the impact of IL-2 on cancers in vivo derives from its ability to expand lymphocytes with antitumor activity. The expanded lymphocyte pool enables recognition of the antigen on cancer cells. Thus, the molecular identification of cancer antigens has opened new possibilities for the development of effective immunotherapies for patients with cancer. Clinical studies using immunization with peptides derived from cancer antigens have shown that high levels of lymphocytes with antitumor activity can be produced in cancer-bearing patients.

There are three major classes of autologous T-cell manipulation. First, tumor antigen\u2013specific T cells can be developed and expanded to large numbers over many weeks ex vivo before administration. Second, the patient\u2019s T cells can be activated by exposure to polyclonal stimulators such as anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 after a short period ex vivo, and then amplified in the host after transfer by stimulation with IL-2, for example. Short periods removed from the patient permit the cells to overcome the tumor-induced T cell defects, and such cells traffic and home to sites of disease better than cells that have been in culture for many weeks. In a third approach, genes that encode for a T cell receptor specific for an antigen expressed by the tumor along with genes that facilitate T cell activation can be"

In common Brunicardi_Ch15_p0479-p0510.indd 49918/02/19 11:12 AM 500BASIC CONSIDERATIONSPART Ilaboratory settings, cells are cultured either as a monolayer (in which cells grow as one layer on culture dishes), considered 2-D, or in suspension or biomedical material skeleton such as hydrogel, considered 3-D.It is important to know the wealth of information concern-ing cell culturing before attempting the procedure. For example, conditions of culture will depend on the cell types to be cultured (e.g.,"

T-cell clones also require periodic restimulation with antigen and are more tedious to grow than T-cell hybrids, but because their growth depends on specific antigen recognition, they maintain antigen specificity, which is often lost in T-cell hybrids. Cloned T-cell lines can be used for studies of effector function both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the proliferation of T cells, a critical aspect of clonal selection, can be characterized only in cloned T-cell lines, where such growth is dependent on antigen recognition. Thus, both types of monoclonal T-cell lines, T-cell hybrids and antigen-dependent"

            "content": "16-16 T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors are an effective treatment in some leukemias. Adoptive T-cell therapy involves ex vivo expansion of tumor-specific T cells to large numbers and the infusion of those T cells into patients. Cells are expanded in vitro by various methods, such as treatment with IL-2, anti-CD3 antibodies, and allogeneic antigen-presenting cells to provide a co-stimulatory signal. Adoptive T-cell therapy is made more effective when the patient is immunosuppressed before treatment and IL-2 is then administered systemically. Another approach that has excited much interest is the use of retroviral vectors to transfer tumor-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) genes into patients\u2019 T cells before reinfusion. This can have long-lasting effects as a result of the ability of T cells to become memory cells, and there is no requirement for histocompatibility because the transfused cells are derived from the patient."
