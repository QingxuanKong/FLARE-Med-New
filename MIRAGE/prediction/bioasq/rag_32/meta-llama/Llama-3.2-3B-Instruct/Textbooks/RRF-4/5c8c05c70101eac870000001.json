    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer whether lactotransferrin is a tumor suppressor, we need to understand the role of tumor suppressors and lactotransferrin. Tumor suppressors are genes that regulate cell growth and prevent cancer. They can do this by inhibiting metabolic pathways that support growth, inducing cell death, or regulating cell cycle progression. Lactotransferrin is a protein that plays a role in iron transport and lactose metabolism in the mammary gland. While it has various functions, there is no direct evidence suggesting that lactotransferrin acts as a tumor suppressor gene. In fact, its primary roles do not appear to involve the regulation of cell growth or cancer prevention. Therefore, based on the information available, it is unlikely that lactotransferrin functions as a tumor suppressor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

We have already discussed the \u201cbraking\u201d effect of the tumor suppressors NF1 and PTEN on signals downstream of growth factor receptors and RAS, allowing them to oppose the Warburg effect. Indeed, it may be that many (and perhaps all) tumor suppressors that induce growth arrest suppress the Warburg effect. For example, p53, arguably the most important tumor suppressor, upregulates target genes that collectively inhibit glucose uptake, glycolysis, lipogenesis, and the generation of NADPH (a key cofactor needed for the biosynthesis of macromolecules). Thus, it is increasingly clear that the functions of many oncoproteins and tumor suppressors are inextricably intertwined with cellular metabolism."

Often both normal alleles of tumor suppressor genes must be damaged for transformation to occur. Tumor suppressor genes can be placed into two general groups, \u201cgovernors\u201d that act as important brakes on cellular proliferation, and \u201cguardians\u201d that are responsible for sensing genomic damage. Some guardian genes initiate and choreograph a complex \u201cdamage control response\u201d that leads to the cessation of proliferation or, if the damage is too great to be repaired, or induce apoptosis. Genes that regulate apoptosis primarily act by enhancing cell survival, rather than stimulating proliferation per se. Understandably, genes of this class that protect against apoptosis are often overexpressed in cancer cells, whereas those that promote apoptosis tend to be under-expressed or functionally inactivated by mutations."

The two major types of somatic lesions observed in tumor-suppressor genes during tumor development are point mutations and large deletions. Point mutations in the coding region of tumor-suppressor genes will frequently lead to truncated protein products or otherwise nonfunctional proteins. Similarly, deletions lead to the loss of a functional product and sometimes encompass the entire gene or even the entire chromosome arm, leading to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumor DNA compared to the corresponding normal tissue DNA (Fig. 101e-4).

For example, chromosome 8, which almost never is lost and often is present in increased copies in tumor cells, is where the MYC oncogene is located. By contrast, portions of chromosome 17, where the TP53 gene is located, are often lost and are infrequently gained.

The great majority of cancers, however, do not harbor repair deficiencies, and their rate of mutation is similar to that observed in normal cells.

Because they have an affected son, both the biological father and mother must be carriers for this disease. The affected son must have inherited a mutant allele from each parent. Because he shows only the 3kilobase (kb) band on the Southern blot, the mutant allele for this disease must be linked to the 3-kb band. The normal allele must be linked to the 4-kb band, and because the daughter inherited only the 4-kb band, she must be homozygous normal for the hexosaminidase A gene. 4.3. A physician would like to determine the global patterns of gene expression in two different types of tumor cells in order to develop the most appropriate form of chemotherapy for each patient. Which of the following techniques would be most appropriate for this purpose? A. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay B. Microarray"
