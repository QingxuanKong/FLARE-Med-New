    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between cohesin and its role in the cell cycle, as well as its potential connection to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). According to Document [2], cohesin is a protein complex that plays a crucial role in sister-chromatid cohesion during the cell cycle. Document [15] explains that cohesin forms giant ring-like structures that surround the sister chromatids. Given the importance of sister-chromatid cohesion in maintaining genomic stability, any disruption in this process could potentially contribute to the development of cancer, including AML. Document [16] mentions that mutations in genes involved in the cell cycle, including those involved in cohesin, can be found in various cancers, including AML. Furthermore, Document [22] lists cohesin-related genes, such as SMC1A and SMC3, as potential prognostic markers for AML. Based on this information, it appears that cohesin mutations may indeed play a role in the development of AML.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Inherited diseases with defective DNA repair, e.g., Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome, and ataxiatelangiectasia, are also associated with AML. Congenital neutropenia (Kostmann syndrome) is a disease with mutations in the genes encoding the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor and, often, neutrophil elastase that may evolve into AML. Germline mutations of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b1 (CEBPA), runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), and tumor protein p53 (TP53) have also been associated with a higher predisposition to AML in some series."

Recurrent somatic mutations, acquired in the abnormal marrow cells and absent in the germline, have been identified in almost 100 genes. Many of the same genes are also mutated in AML without MDS, whereas others are distinctive in subtypes of MDS. A prominent example of the latter is the discovery of mutations in genes of the RNA splicing machinery, especially SF3B1, which strongly associate with sideroblastic anemia. Some mutations correlate with prognosis: spliceosome defects with favorable outcome, and mutations in EZH2, TP53, RUNX1, and ASXL1 with poor outcome.

AML with fmsrelated tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations is not considered a distinct entity, although determining the presence of such mutations is recommended by WHO in patients with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) because the relatively frequent FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) carries a negative prognostic significance and therefore is clinically relevant.

Putative collaborating mutations in several other tyrosine kinase genes and in the RAS gene have been detected. Sequencing of the AML genomes also has identified frequent mutations in genes that directly impact the epigenome, suggesting that epigenetic alterations have a central role in AML. For example, about 15% to 20% of AMLs are associated with mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). In such tumors, an \u201concometabolite\u201d synthesized by the mutated IDH protein blocks the function of enzymes that regulate the epigenome and interferes with myeloid cell differentiation (discussed in Chapter 6).

Epigenetic changes (e.g., DNA methylation) and microRNAs are often involved in deregulation of genes involved in hematopoiesis, contribute to leukemogenesis, and are often associated with the previously discussed prognostic gene mutations. These changes not only have been shown to provide biologic insights into leukemogenic mechanisms, but also independent prognostic information. Indeed, it is anticipated that with the enormous progress made in DNA and RNA sequencing technology, additional genetic and epigenetic aberrations will soon be discovered and will contribute to classification and reporting systems and outcome risk determination in AML patients."

            "content": "Mutations in genes involved in the metastatic process occur in a number of cancers. Among the most frequently found to date are mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2). These have been most commonly seen in gliomas, AML, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. These mutations lead to the production of an oncometabolite (2-hydroxyglutarate [2HG]) instead of the normal product \u03b1-ketoglutarate. Although the exact mechanisms of oncogenesis by 2HG are still being elucidated, \u03b1-ketoglutarate is a key cofactor for a number of dioxygenases involved in controlling DNA methylation. 2HG can act as a competitive inhibitor for \u03b1-ketoglutarate, leading to alterations in methylation status (primarily hypermethylation) of genes (epigenetic changes) that can have profound effects on a number of cellular processes including differentiation. Inhibitors of mutant IDH1 and IDH2 are being developed."

In MDSs, the bone marrow is partly or wholly replaced by the clonal progeny of a transformed multipotent stem cell that retains the capacity to differentiate into red cells, granulocytes, and platelets, but in a manner that is both ineffective and disordered. As a result, the marrow usually is hypercellular or normocellular, but the peripheral blood shows one or more cytopenias. The abnormal stem cell clone in the bone marrow is genetically unstable and prone to the acquisition of additional mutations and the eventual transformation to AML. Most cases are idiopathic, but some develop after chemotherapy with alkylating agents or exposure to ionizing radiation therapy."
