    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the given documents and understand the relationship between heavy metals like lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) and DNA methylation patterns. Document [3] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) discusses the role of heavy metals in modifying gene expression and altering chromatin structure, which can lead to changes in DNA methylation patterns. Document [9] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison) mentions that arsenic, a heavy metal, can cause changes in DNA methylation patterns, and Document [10] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) explains that DNA methylation patterns can be dynamic during mammalian development. Although the specific question is about Isoetes sinensis, a plant species, we can infer that heavy metals can affect DNA methylation patterns in other organisms, including plants. Document [8] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) describes how DNA methylation patterns are established and maintained, and Document [11] (Title: Obstentrics_Williams) discusses the importance of placental sequestration of heavy metals, including zinc, copper, lead, and cadmium. Given that Isoetes sinensis is a plant species, it is plausible that exposure to heavy metals like lead (Pb) or cadmium (Cd) could affect its DNA methylation patterns. Therefore, the answer to the question is that exposure to heavy metals like lead (Pb) or cadmium (Cd) can cause changes in DNA methylation patterns in Isoetes sinensis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Others, such as lead and mercury, are xenobiotic and theoretically are capable of exerting toxic effects at any level of exposure. Indeed, much research is currently focused on the contribution of low-level xenobiotic metal exposure to chronic diseases and to subtle changes in health that may have significant public health consequences. Genetic factors, such as polymorphisms that encode for variant enzymes with altered properties in terms of metal binding, transport, and effects, also may modify the impact of metals on health and thereby account, at least in part, for individual susceptibility to metal effects."

Disruption of chromatin remodeling (the process of modifying chromatin structure to control exposure of specific genes to transcriptional proteins, thereby controlling the expression of those genes) leads to aberrant gene expression and can induce proliferation of undifferentiated cells. Epigenetics is defined as changes that alter the pattern of gene expression that persist across at least one cell division but are not caused by changes in the DNA code. Epigenetic changes include alterations of chromatin structure mediated by methylation of cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides, modification of histones by acetylation or methylation, or changes in higher-order chromosome structure (Fig. 102e-4). The transcriptional regulatory regions of active genes 102e-7 often contain a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides (referred to as CpG islands), which are"

Some of the oldest diseases of humans can be traced to heavy metal poisoning associated with metal mining, refining, and use. Even with the present recognition of the hazards of heavy metals, the incidence of intoxication remains significant, and the need for preventive strategies and effective therapy remains high. Toxic heavy metals interfere with the function of essential cations, cause enzyme inhibition, generate oxidative stress, alter gene expression, and perturb cell signaling. As a result, multisystem signs and symptoms are a hallmark of heavy metal intoxication. When intoxication occurs, chelator molecules (from chela \u201cclaw\u201d), or their in vivo biotransformation products, may be used to bind the metal and facilitate its excretion from the body. Chelator drugs are discussed in the second part of this chapter."

            "content": "A few of these carcinogens act directly on DNA. But generally the more potent ones are relatively inert chemically; these chemicals become damaging only after they have been converted to a more reactive molecule by metabolic processes in the liver, catalyzed by a set of intracellular enzymes known as the cytochrome P-450 oxidases. These enzymes normally help to convert ingested toxins into harmless and easily excreted compounds. Unhappily, their activity on certain chemicals generates products that are highly mutagenic. Examples of carcinogens activated in this way include benzo[a]pyrene, a cancer-causing chemical present in coal tar and tobacco smoke and the fungal toxin aflatoxin B1 (Figure 20\u201338). Fifty Percent of Cancers Could Be Prevented by Changes in Lifestyle"

The current permissible exposure levels for beryllium of 0.01 mcg/m3 averaged over a 30-day period or 2 mcg/m3 over an 8-hour period are insufficiently protective to prevent CBD. Both NIOSH and the ACGIH have recommended that the 8-hour PEL and TLV be reduced to 0.05 mcg/m3. These recommendations have not yet been implemented. Current OSHA information on beryllium appears at https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/beryllium/index.html. Environmental beryllium exposure is not generally thought to be a hazard to human health except in the vicinity of industrial sites where air, water, and soil pollution have occurred. Cadmium (Cd) is a transition metal widely used in industry."

            "content": "Other sequence comparisons show that a great deal of the genetic complexity of present-day organisms is due to the expansion of ancient gene families. DNA duplication followed by sequence divergence has clearly been a major source of genetic novelty during evolution. On a more recent time scale, the genomes of any two humans will differ from each other both because of nucleotide substitutions (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) and because of inherited DNA gains and DNA losses that cause copy number variations (CNVs). Understanding the effects of these differences will improve both medicine and our understanding of human biology. Which statements are true? explain why or why not. How many different types of chromatin structure are important for cells? How is each of these structures established and maintained, and which ones tend to be inherited following DNA replication?"
