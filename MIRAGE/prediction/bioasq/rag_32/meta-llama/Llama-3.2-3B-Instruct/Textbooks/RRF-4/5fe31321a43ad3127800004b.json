FBP1 is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis and glycolysis in yeast. In the presence of glucose, FBP1 is activated and promotes the expression of genes involved in glycolysis, while in the absence of glucose, FBP1 is inhibited and promotes the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis. Given this context, we can infer that FBP1 is likely affected by glucose starvation stress, as the cell would need to switch from glycolysis to gluconeogenesis to survive in the absence of glucose.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

During ischemic preconditioning in humans, short periods of ischemia protect the brain and the heart against a more severe deprivation of oxygen and subsequent reperfusion-induced oxidative stress. Similarly, the lifelong and periodic exposure to various stressors can inhibit or retard the aging process. Consistent with this concept, heat or mild doses of oxidative stress can lead to lifespan extension in C. elegans. Caloric restriction can also be considered to be a type of hormetic stress that results in the activation of antistress transcription factors (Rim15, Gis1, and Msn2/Msn4 in yeast and FOXO in mammals) that enhance the expression of free radical\u2013scavenging factors and heat shock proteins."
