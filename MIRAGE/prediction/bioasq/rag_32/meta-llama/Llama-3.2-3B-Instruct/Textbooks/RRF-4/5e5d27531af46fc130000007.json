Document [0] mentions that the Spanish flu virus is an exception to the rule that error-prone replication dominates viral evolution, and it is unusual that its genome consists of several (usually eight) strands of RNA. Document [1] states that DNA analysis of viral genomes retrieved from the lungs of a soldier who died in the great 1918 influenza pandemic identified swine influenza sequences, consistent with this virus having its origin in an antigenic shift. However, it does not explicitly state that the Spanish flu virus has been reconstructed. However, Document [4] mentions that the Spanish flu virus was a result of an antigenic shift involving a virus of swine origin, which led to the creation of a new influenza virus with a different hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigen. This implies that the Spanish flu virus has been reconstructed through antigenic shift. Furthermore, Document [11] states that influenza A viruses, including the Spanish flu virus, have a segmented genome, which allows for reassortment of gene segments during infection. This process can lead to the creation of new viral strains, including the Spanish flu virus. Based on the information provided, it appears that the Spanish flu virus has been reconstructed through antigenic shift and reassortment of gene segments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

They are unusual in that their genome consists of several (usually eight) strands of RNA. When two strains of influenza infect the same host, the RNA strands of the two strains can reassort to form a new type of influenza virus. In normal years, influenza is a mild disease in healthy adults, although it can be life-threatening in the very young and very old. Different influenza strains infect fowl such as ducks and chickens, but only a subset of these strains can infect humans, and transmission from fowl to humans is rare. In 1918, however, a particularly virulent variant of avian influenza crossed the species barrier to infect humans, triggering the catastrophic pandemic of 1918 called the Spanish flu, which killed 20\u201350 million people worldwide.

            "content": "Influenza virus may be isolated from tissue culture or chick embryos, but these labor-intensive procedures generally are no longer used for diagnostic purposes. Serologic methods for diagnosis require comparison of antibody titers in sera obtained during the acute illness with those in sera obtained 10\u201314 days after the onset of illness and are useful primarily in retrospect and for epidemiologic studies. Other laboratory tests generally are not helpful in the specific diagnosis of influenza virus infection. Leukocyte counts are variable, frequently being low early in illness and normal or slightly elevated later. Severe leukopenia has been described in overwhelming viral or bacterial infection, whereas leukocytosis with >15,000 cells/\u03bcL raises the suspicion of secondary bacterial infection."

            "content": "Fig. 13.22 Two types of variation allow repeated infection with type A influenza virus. neutralizing antibody that mediates protective immunity is directed at the viral surface protein hemagglutinin (H), which is responsible for viral binding to and entry into cells. antigenic drift (left panels) involves the emergence of point mutants with altered binding sites for protective antibodies on the hemagglutinin. the new virus can grow in a host that is immune to the previous strain of virus, but as t cells and some antibodies can still recognize epitopes that have not been altered, the new variants cause only mild disease in previously infected individuals. antigenic shift (right panels) is a rare event involving the reassortment of the segmented Rna viral genomes of two different influenza viruses, probably in a bird or a pig. these antigen-shifted viruses have large changes in their hemagglutinin, and therefore t cells and antibodies produced in earlier infections are not protective."
