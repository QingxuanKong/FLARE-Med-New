According to Document [8], lncRNAs can serve as scaffolds, bringing together proteins that function in the same process. In Document [9], it is mentioned that lncRNAs can function as scaffold RNA molecules, holding together groups of proteins to coordinate their functions. Additionally, Document [18] states that some lncRNAs work simply by base-pairing, without bringing in enzymes or other proteins, and can form complementary base pairs with mRNA to block its translation into protein. Furthermore, Document [19] mentions that lncRNAs can regulate gene expression in many ways, including controlling the enzymatic activity of proteins and affecting splicing patterns. Considering these functions, it is reasonable to infer that lncRNAs can control various cellular processes, including neuronal outgrowth. Specifically, lncRNAs can regulate the expression of genes involved in cell growth and differentiation, including those involved in neuronal development and outgrowth. Therefore, the answer to the question is that there are lncRNAs that can control the extent of neuronal outgrowth.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Nevertheless, there are two unifying features of lncRNAs that can account for their many roles in the cell. The first is that lncRNAs can function as scaffold RNA molecules, holding together groups of proteins to coordinate their functions (Figure 7\u201379A). We have already seen an example in telomerase, where the RNA molecule holds together and organizes protein components. These RNA-based scaffolds are analogous to protein scaffolds we discussed in Chapter 3 (see Figure 3\u201378) and Chapter 6 (see Figure 6\u201347). RNA molecules are well suited to act as scaffolds: small bits of RNA sequence, often those portions that form stem-loop structures, can serve as binding sites for proteins, and these can be strung together with random sequences of RNA in between. This property may be one reason that lncRNAs show relatively little primary-sequence conservation across species."

For example, some neurons fire action potentials at high frequencies, while others fire rarely. The firing properties of each neuron type are determined to a large extent by the ion channels that the cell expresses. The number of ion channels in a neuron\u2019s membrane is not fixed: as conditions change, a neuron can modify the numbers of depolarizing (Na+ and Ca2+) and hyperpolarizing (K+) channels and keep their proportions adjusted so as to maintain its characteristic firing behavior\u2014a remarkable example of homeostatic control. The molecular mechanisms involved remain an important mystery. Neuronal signals are transmitted from cell to cell at specialized sites of contact known as synapses. The usual mechanism of transmission is indirect. The cells are"

            "content": "The phenomenon of activity-dependent synapse elimination is encountered in almost every part of the developing vertebrate nervous system (Figure 21\u201384). It has a key role, for example, in the refinement of the retinotopic map discussed earlier. Synapses are first formed in abundance and distributed over a broad target field; then the system of connections is pruned back and remodeled by competitive processes that depend on electrical activity and synaptic signaling. The elimination of synapses in this way is distinct from the elimination of surplus neurons by cell death, and it occurs after the period of normal neuronal death is over. Synapse remodeling during neural development, however, involves more than just synapse elimination; it also involves synapse reinforcement, as we discuss next."
