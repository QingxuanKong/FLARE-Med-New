Tirilazad is a drug that was investigated for its potential to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke, but the available information does not provide clear evidence on its effectiveness or safety for this purpose. However, based on the information provided in the documents, we can see that tirilazad is not mentioned as a treatment option for ischemic stroke in any of the documents. The documents discuss various treatment options for ischemic stroke, including thrombolytics, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and other medications, but tirilazad is not mentioned. Therefore, based on the available information, the correct answer is that tirilazad should not be used for the treatment of ischemic stroke.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

            "content": "Several trials have confirmed that statin drugs reduce the risk of 2569 stroke even in patients without elevated LDL or low HDL. The Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial showed benefit in secondary stroke reduction for patients with recent stroke or TIA who were prescribed atorvastatin, 80 mg/d. The primary prevention trial, Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), found that patients with low LDL (<130 mg/dL) caused by elevated C-reactive protein benefitted by daily use of this statin. Primary stroke occurrence was reduced by 51% (hazard ratio 0.49, p = .004), and there was no increase in the rates of intracranial hemorrhage. Meta-analysis has also supported a primary treatment effect for statins given acutely for ischemic stroke. Therefore, a statin should be considered in all patients with prior ischemic stroke. Tobacco smoking should be discouraged in all patients (Chap."

            "content": "After the clinical diagnosis of stroke is made, an orderly process of evaluation and treatment should follow (Fig. 446-1). The first goal is to prevent or reverse brain injury. Attend to the patient\u2019s airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs), and treat hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia if identified. Perform an emergency noncontrast head CT scan to differentiate between ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke; there are no reliable clinical findings that conclusively separate ischemia from hemorrhage, although a more depressed level of consciousness, higher initial blood pressure, or worsening of symptoms after onset favor hemorrhage, and a deficit that is maximal at onset, or remits, suggests ischemia. Treatments designed to reverse or lessen the amount of tissue infarction and improve clinical outcome fall within six categories: (1) medical support, (2) IV thrombolysis, (3) endovascular revascularization, (4) antithrombotic treatment, (5) neuroprotection, and (6) stroke centers and"

Patients who awaken with stroke have the onset defined as when they went to bed. Table 446-1 summarizes eligibility criteria and instructions for administration of IV rtPA."
