The key information is in Document [13] and Document [3]. According to Document [13], pioglitazone was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, and Document [3] states that the overall methodologic quality of the studies was higher than that of the Cochrane review, which suggested that patients with a diagnosis of dementia are more likely to benefit from ginkgo, but not necessarily pioglitazone. However, Document [3] also states that the effects of ginkgo in the treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia were unpredictable and that significant improvements in cognition and activities of daily living were observed at 12 weeks but not 24 weeks. There is no information in the provided documents about pioglitazone and cognitive impairment. However, Document [3] states that ginkgo did not affect the incidence of hypertension or reduce blood pressure among persons with hypertension or prehypertension. Given the lack of direct evidence on pioglitazone and cognitive impairment, it is not possible to definitively answer this question based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Early onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is associated with several gene defects, including trisomy 21 (chromosome 21), a mutation of the gene for presenilin-1 on chromosome 14, and an abnormal allele, \u03b54, for the lipid-associated protein, ApoE, on chromosome 19.

Dopaminergic drugs can worsen cognitive function in demented patients and should be stopped or reduced to try and provide a compromise between antiparkinsonian benefit and preserved cognitive function. Drugs are usually discontinued in the following sequence: anticholinergics, amantadine, dopamine agonists, COMT inhibitors, and MAO-B inhibitors. Eventually, patients with cognitive impairment should be managed with the lowest dose of standard levodopa that provides meaningful antiparkinsonian effects and does not worsen mental function. Anticholinesterase agents such as rivastigmine and donepezil reduce the rate of deterioration of measures of cognitive function and can improve attention, but do not typically improve cognitive function in any meaningful way."

            "content": "Among the compounds that have been investigated as potential neuroprotective agents to slow disease progression are antioxidants, antiapoptotic agents, glutamate antagonists, intraparenchymally administered glial-derived neurotrophic factor, and anti-inflammatory drugs. None of these agents has been shown to be effective in this context, however, and their use for therapeutic purposes is not indicated at this time. Coenzyme Q10, creatine, pramipexole, and pioglitazone have not been found to be effective despite early hopes to the contrary. The possibility that rasagiline has a protective effect was discussed earlier. Active and passive immunization against \u03b1-synuclein is being explored."

            "content": "Several putative epidemiologic risk factors for Alzheimer disease proposed in the past, such as birth order, mother\u2019s age at birth, and a family history of Down syndrome seem marginal at best and in some instances, may be a result of selection bias. Depression and possibly head injuries seem to confer a somewhat increased risk later in life. Whether low educational attainment is a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer disease or, conversely, whether cognitively demanding occupations or higher intelligence protects against dementia is still under discussion. Provocative data indicating that inherent intellectual endowment (cognitive reserve) is important were presented in Chap. 20 (Katzman; Cobb et al). Finally, associations between diabetes or hyperglycemia and dementia, in general, have emerged from epidemiologic studies, for example, one reported by Crane and coworkers, but the ostensible mechanism by which this confers risk (if it is even valid) has not been established.

            "content": "Psychiatric disturbance is common in both folate and cobalamin deficiencies. This, like the neuropathy, has been attributed to a failure of the synthesis of SAM, which is needed in methylation of biogenic amines (e.g., dopamine) as well as that of proteins, phospholipids, and neurotransmitters in the brain (Fig. 128-1). Associations between lower serum folate or cobalamin levels and higher homocysteine levels and the development of decreased cognitive function and dementia in Alzheimer\u2019s disease have been reported. A meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of homocysteine-lowering B-vitamin supplementation of individuals with and without cognitive impairment, however, showed that supplementation with vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and folic acid alone or in combination did not improve cognitive function. It is unknown whether prolonged treatment with these B vitamins can reduce the risk of dementia in later life."

            "content": "A series of trials using a small molecule inhibitors of the enzyme \u03b3-secretase (Doody et al, 2013), or of an inhibitor of \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein\u2013cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1, see Egan et al), or of a monoclonal antibody directed at soluble forms of amyloid (solanezumab; see Doody et al, 2014) have failed to demonstrate clear benefit in even early stages of Alzheimer disease. The presumption is being explored that amyloid is deposited well before the onset of clinical symptoms and such agents might be useful if started in the presymptomatic stages of disease but there have also been several failed trials at this stage of disease. This is one goal of studies in dominantly inherited forms of the disease, in which presymptomatic patients can be treated."
