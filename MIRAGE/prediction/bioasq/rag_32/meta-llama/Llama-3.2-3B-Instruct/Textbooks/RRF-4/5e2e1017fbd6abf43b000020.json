The majority of these cells belong to the conventional CD4 or CD8 T-cell lineages. Less abundant subsets, such as iNKT cells and a subset of regulatory T cells expressing CD4 and high levels of CD25, also develop in the thymus from CD4+CD8+ cells. Moreover, almost all mature T cells that express CD4 have receptors that recognize peptides bound to self MHC class II molecules and are programmed to become cytokine-secreting helper T cells.

These are not just random markers, but are important for a T cell\u2019s function, because they help to determine the interactions between the T cell and other cells. Recall from Section 1-10 that T cells detect peptides derived from foreign antigens that are displayed by MHC molecules on a cell\u2019s surface. CD8 and CD4 function in antigen recognition by recognizing different regions of MHC molecules and by being involved in the signaling of the T-cell receptor that is engaged with its antigen.

CD8 is expressed by cytotoxic T cells, while CD4 is expressed by T cells whose function is to activate other cells. CD4 and CD8 were known as markers for these functional sets for some time before it became clear that the distinction was based on the ability of T cells to recognize different classes of MHC molecules. We now know that CD8 recognizes MHC class I molecules and CD4 recognizes MHC class II. During antigen recognition, CD4 or CD8 (depending on the type of T cell) associates with the T-cell receptor on the T-cell surface and binds to invariant sites on the MHC portion of the composite peptide:MHC ligand, away from the peptide-binding site. This binding contributes to the overall effectiveness of the T-cell response, and so CD4 and CD8 are called co-receptors."

T cell development also depends on IL-2 receptor signaling, a cytokine signal that is not required for the development of conventional T cells. The repertoire of T-cell receptors expressed on T cells is thought to be composed of receptors with high affinity for self MHC:self peptide complexes. Evidence supporting this conclusion comes from studies showing that some lines of TCR transgenic mice generate large numbers of T cells when the mice also express the antigen for this T-cell receptor.

One of the most important is in their activation requirements: once a T cell has differentiated into an effector cell, encounter with its specific antigen results in immune attack without the need for co-stimulation (Fig. 9.26). This distinction is particularly easy to understand for CD8 cytotoxic T cells, which must be able to act on any cell infected with a virus, whether or not the infected cell can express co-stimulatory molecules.

            "content": "made originally in transgenic knockout mice and more recently in humans suggest that other T cell subsets, especially CD8+ T cells, may play an important role. CD8+ T cells have been associated with protective activities via cytotoxic responses and lysis of infected cells as well as with production of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1. Finally, natural killer cells act as co-regulators of CD8+ T cell lytic activities, and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are increasingly thought to be involved in protective responses in humans."

            "content": "Perhaps because the effector actions of these cells are so destructive, naive CD8 T cells require more co-stimulatory activity to drive them to become activated effector cells than do naive CD4 T cells. This requirement can be met in two ways. The simplest is priming by activated dendritic cells, which have high intrinsic co-stimulatory activity. In some viral infections, dendritic cells become sufficiently activated to directly induce CD8 T cells to produce the IL-2 required for their differentiation into cytotoxic effector cells, without help from CD4 T cells. This property of dendritic cells has been exploited to generate cytotoxic T-cell responses against tumors, as we will see in Chapter 16."

Expression of small amounts of pT\u03b1:\u03b2 on the cell surface in association with CD3 signals the cessation of \u03b2-chain gene rearrangement and triggers rapid cell proliferation, which causes the loss of CD25. The cells are then known as DN4 cells. Eventually, the DN4 cells cease to proliferate and CD4 and CD8 are expressed. The small CD4+CD8+ double-positive cells begin efficient rearrangement at the \u03b1-chain locus. The cells then express low levels of an \u03b1:\u03b2 T-cell receptor and the associated CD3 complex and are ready for selection. Most cells die by failing to be positively selected or as a consequence of negative selection, but some are selected to mature into CD4 or CD8 single-positive cells and eventually to leave the thymus.

            "content": "the CTL also releases cytokines that stimulate cells to proliferate and destroy the abnormal host cells. CD8 T lymphocytes are MHC I restricted, and CD4 T lymphocytes are MHC II restricted. MHC molecules are recognized by helper CD4 T lymphocytes or CTLs, depending on the class of the MHC molecule engaged. This restricted presentation of foreign antigens by MHC molecules to either cytotoxic or helper T lymphocytes is a key component of immune surveillance. The MHC I molecule with the peptide antigen displayed on its surface interacts only with the TCR and CD8 molecule expressed on cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes; these cells are therefore described as MHC I restricted. This interaction allows cytotoxic T lymphocytes to recognize infected or transformed target cells (Fig. 14.5a)."
