    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) is a type of muscular dystrophy that primarily affects the muscles of the face, scapula, and upper arm. It is a genetic disorder that is characterized by muscle weakness and wasting, particularly in the muscles of the face, shoulder, and upper arm. The disease is caused by a mutation in the DUX4 gene, which is located on chromosome 4q21.1. There is currently no cure for FSHD, but various treatments can help manage the symptoms and slow disease progression. These treatments include physical therapy, orthotics, and medications to manage pain and muscle spasms. Additionally, some patients may benefit from surgical interventions, such as muscle transplantation or electrical stimulation therapy. Furthermore, research is ongoing to explore new treatments, including gene therapy and stem cell therapy, which may potentially lead to a cure in the future.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
