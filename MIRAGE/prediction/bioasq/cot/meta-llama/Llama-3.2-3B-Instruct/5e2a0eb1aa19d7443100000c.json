    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the properties and functions of PRL3 (proline-rich-like 3) and its potential role in cancer cells. PRL3 is a protein that has been implicated in various cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, and survival. It is also known to be overexpressed in certain types of cancer, including breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer. PRL3 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment due to its overexpression in cancer cells. One approach to targeting PRL3 is through the development of monoclonal antibodies, such as PRL3-zumab. PRL3-zumab is a monoclonal antibody that has been designed to specifically target and bind to PRL3 protein. By binding to PRL3, PRL3-zumab can potentially inhibit the activity of PRL3 and its downstream signaling pathways, which are involved in cancer cell proliferation and survival. In vitro studies have shown that PRL3-zumab can inhibit the growth of PRL3-positive cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. These findings suggest that PRL3-zumab may be effective in targeting and killing PRL3+ cancer cells in vitro. In vivo studies have also demonstrated the efficacy of PRL3-zumab in inhibiting tumor growth and reducing tumor burden in animal models of cancer. These studies provide evidence that PRL3-zumab can effectively target and eliminate PRL3+ cancer cells in both laboratory and animal models. Based on the available data, it appears that PRL3-zumab can inhibit PRL3+ cancer cells in both in vitro and in vivo studies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
