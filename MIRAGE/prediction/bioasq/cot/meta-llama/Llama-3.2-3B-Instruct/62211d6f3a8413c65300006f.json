    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what circRNAs are and how RNase R functions. circRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that are covalently linked to the cytoplasmic scaffold protein Argonaute 2 (AGO2), forming a circular RNA-protein complex. They are involved in various cellular processes, including gene regulation, cell signaling, and disease progression. RNase R, on the other hand, is a ribonuclease that is involved in the degradation of various RNAs, including mRNA and tRNA. It is also known to cleave circRNAs. The mechanism of RNase R-mediated circRNA degradation involves the recognition of specific sequences within the circRNA, followed by the cleavage of the RNA strand. This suggests that circRNAs are indeed susceptible to degradation by RNase R.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
