The trial aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ALVAC-HIV, a recombinant HIV vaccine candidate, in preventing HIV infection in high-risk individuals.\\n\\nIn the trial, participants were randomly assigned to receive either the ALVAC-HIV vaccine or a placebo. The primary endpoint was the rate of HIV infection at 30 days post-vaccination.\\n\\nThe results of the trial showed that the ALVAC-HIV vaccine was not effective in preventing HIV infection. The vaccine elicited immune responses, but these responses were not sufficient to provide protection against HIV infection.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the findings of the HVTN 702 trial, the correct answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
