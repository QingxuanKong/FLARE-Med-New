    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's consider the complexity and size of the human genome. The human genome consists of approximately 3.2 billion base pairs of DNA, which is organized into 23 pairs of chromosomes. The functional genome refers to the portion of the genome that is actively transcribed into RNA or translated into proteins, which are essential for various cellular processes. Research has shown that a significant portion of the genome is non-coding, with estimates suggesting that around 98-99% of the genome is non-coding. However, this non-coding region still plays important roles in regulating gene expression, influencing chromatin structure, and interacting with proteins. Considering the complexity and functional importance of the non-coding regions, it is unlikely that there is a strict upper limit on the functional fraction of the human genome. Instead, the functional genome is thought to be a dynamic and constantly evolving entity, with new genes and regulatory elements being discovered and added to the genome through various mechanisms such as gene duplication, gene conversion, and gene fusion. Furthermore, the functional genome is also subject to various epigenetic modifications, which can influence gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. These modifications can be inherited and can have a significant impact on cellular function and disease susceptibility. Therefore, it is likely that the functional fraction of the human genome is not fixed and can vary between individuals and even within the same cell, making it challenging to define a strict upper limit.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
