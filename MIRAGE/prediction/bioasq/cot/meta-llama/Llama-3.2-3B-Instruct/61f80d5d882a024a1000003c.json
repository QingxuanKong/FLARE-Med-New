    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what MEF2C is and its role in development. MEF2C is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in various developmental processes, including embryonic development, muscle function, and cell growth. It is a member of the MEF2 family of transcription factors, which are known to regulate gene expression in response to various signals. In the context of developmental disorders, mutations in the MEF2C gene have been associated with several conditions, including developmental delays, intellectual disability, and physical abnormalities. However, the question is whether only changes in coding regions of MEF2C cause developmental disorders. \\n\\nTo address this, we need to consider the function of MEF2C and the nature of mutations. Coding regions are the parts of the gene that encode proteins, and mutations in these regions can lead to changes in protein function. Non-coding regions, on the other hand, can also influence gene expression and regulation through various mechanisms, such as enhancers, promoters, and regulatory elements. \\n\\nGiven the complexity of gene function and regulation, it is unlikely that only changes in coding regions of MEF2C would cause developmental disorders. Mutations in non-coding regions can also impact gene expression and contribute to disease. Therefore, the correct answer is that changes in both coding and non-coding regions of MEF2C can cause developmental disorders.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
