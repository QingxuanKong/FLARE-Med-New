    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I will consider the available evidence on Sotrovimab, a monoclonal antibody treatment for COVID-19. Sotrovimab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It is designed to block the virus from entering human cells, thereby reducing the severity of the disease. Step 1: Efficacy of Sotrovimab in clinical trials - Sotrovimab has been studied in several clinical trials, including the RECOVERY trial, which was a large, randomized controlled trial conducted in the UK. The trial involved over 11,000 participants and compared Sotrovimab with placebo. Step 2: Results of the RECOVERY trial - The trial showed that Sotrovimab reduced hospitalization and death from COVID-19 in participants with mild to moderate symptoms. However, the trial did not show a significant reduction in hospitalization or death in participants with severe symptoms. Step 3: FDA approval - Sotrovimab was approved by the US FDA in December 2021 for emergency use in adults and adolescents 12 years and older with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. Step 4: Real-world evidence - Several real-world studies have also shown that Sotrovimab is effective in reducing hospitalization and death from COVID-19 in various populations, including older adults and those with comorbidities. Conclusion - Based on the available evidence, Sotrovimab is effective in reducing hospitalization and death from COVID-19 in participants with mild to moderate symptoms, and it has been approved by the FDA for emergency use in this population. However, its effectiveness in severe cases is less clear, and it should not be used as a replacement for established treatments for severe COVID-19.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
