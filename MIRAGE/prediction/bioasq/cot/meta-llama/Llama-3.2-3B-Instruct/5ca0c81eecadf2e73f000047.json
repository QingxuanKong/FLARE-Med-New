It can be acute or chronic and is usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection.\\n\\nStep 3: Analyzing the Connection Between Sinusitis and Subdural Empyema\\nWhile sinusitis is primarily an infection of the sinuses, it can potentially spread to other parts of the skull and brain through various routes, including direct extension through the ethmoidal sinuses, which are located near the brain.\\n\\nStep 4: Considering the Pathophysiology\\nSubdural empyema can occur when an infection spreads to the subdural space, which is located between the dura mater and the arachnoid mater. If the infection originates from the sinuses, it can potentially spread to the subdural space through the following routes: (1) direct extension through the ethmoidal sinuses, (2) hematogenous spread (through the bloodstream), or (3) contiguous spread along the nerves or blood vessels.\\n\\nStep 5: Drawing a Conclusion\\nGiven the potential routes of spread, it is possible for sinusitis to lead to subdural empyema, especially if the infection is severe or if there is a breach in the skull or meninges.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer to the question is that subdural empyema can be a complication of sinusitis, particularly in severe cases or when there is a direct extension of the infection.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
