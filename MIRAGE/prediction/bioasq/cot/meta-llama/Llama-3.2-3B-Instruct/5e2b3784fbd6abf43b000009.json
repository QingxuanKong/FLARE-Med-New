    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if GRG5 is involved in late embryonic mouse development, we need to consider its known functions and expression patterns. GRG5 is a transcription factor that plays a role in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival. It is also involved in the regulation of embryonic development, particularly in the early stages. However, its role in late embryonic development needs to be evaluated specifically.\\n\\nResearch has shown that GRG5 is expressed in multiple tissues and cell types during embryonic development, including the embryo itself. Moreover, studies have demonstrated that GRG5 is required for the proper development of certain tissues and organs, such as the heart, nervous system, and limbs. This suggests that GRG5 is involved in early embryonic development, rather than only late embryonic development.\\n\\nHowever, GRG5 has also been implicated in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation in adult tissues, which could imply a potential role in late embryonic development as well. Nevertheless, the majority of evidence suggests that GRG5 is involved in early embryonic development, rather than only late embryonic development.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the available evidence, the correct answer is that GRG5 is not only involved in late embryonic mouse development, but also in early embryonic development.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
