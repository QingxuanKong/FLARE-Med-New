    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what circRNA (circular RNA) is and how it is produced. CircRNA is a type of non-coding RNA that is circular in shape, unlike linear RNAs which are found in messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The production of circRNA is different from the production of linear RNAs. It is formed through a process called backsplicing, which involves the joining of exons and introns from different parts of a pre-mRNA molecule. This process does not involve the removal of introns as in the splicing of linear RNAs. Instead, the exons and introns are joined together to form a continuous loop, resulting in a circular RNA molecule. Therefore, circRNA is produced by the backsplicing of exons and introns, forming a new circRNA molecule.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
