CEP-26401 is known as a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, which is a type of receptor antagonist that blocks the action of serotonin at 5-HT3 receptors. It is primarily used as an antiemetic to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy and radiation therapy. However, its effect on cognition is not its primary indication. Research has shown that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, including CEP-26401, can have a positive effect on cognitive function, particularly in patients with cancer, by reducing chemotherapy-induced cognitive dysfunction. Therefore, considering this information, the answer to the question is that CEP-26401 has a positive effect on cognition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
