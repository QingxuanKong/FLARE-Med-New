    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if CD63 is an exosomal marker, let's consider what exosomes are and the typical markers associated with them. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that are secreted by cells and play a role in intercellular communication. They are often identified by their characteristic surface proteins and markers. Common exosomal markers include CD63, CD81, CD9, and others. CD63, also known as CD11b, is a transmembrane protein that is also found on the surface of various cell types, including platelets, neutrophils, and monocytes. It is involved in the regulation of cellular processes such as calcium signaling and cell adhesion. While CD63 is not exclusive to exosomes, it is often co-expressed with other exosomal markers, suggesting its involvement in the formation or function of exosomes. However, its presence alone does not definitively confirm an exosome. Therefore, CD63 can be considered a potential exosomal marker, but its expression is not specific to exosomes and requires further context to confirm its association with exosomes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
