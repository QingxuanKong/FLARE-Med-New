    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer whether dacomitinib should be used for the treatment of glioblastoma patients, we need to understand what dacomitinib is and its primary indication.\\n\\nDecomitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR, c-KIT, PDGFR, and FLT3. It is primarily used in the treatment of certain types of leukemia, such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\\n\\nGlioblastoma, on the other hand, is a type of brain cancer that is characterized by its aggressive nature and poor prognosis. The standard treatment for glioblastoma typically involves surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.\\n\\nConsidering the different primary indications and mechanisms of action of dacomitinib and glioblastoma, there is no established evidence to suggest that dacomitinib is a suitable treatment option for glioblastoma patients. In fact, the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors like dacomitinib in brain tumors is generally limited due to the blood-brain barrier and the potential for neurotoxicity.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the available information, the correct answer is that dacomitinib should not be used for the treatment of glioblastoma patients.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
