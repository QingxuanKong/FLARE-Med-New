    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if MYC is a tumor suppressor gene, let's consider its function and role in cancer. MYC is a proto-oncogene that encodes a transcription factor involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is known to be overexpressed in many types of cancer, including breast, lung, and lymphoma cancers. Overexpression of MYC is often associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis. In contrast, tumor suppressor genes typically function to inhibit cell growth and prevent tumor formation. Given that MYC promotes cell proliferation and is often overexpressed in cancers, it does not fit the typical definition of a tumor suppressor gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
