    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if selenocysteine is an amino acid, we need to understand what selenocysteine is and its classification.\\nSelenocysteine is a rare amino acid found in some proteins, particularly in those involved in antioxidant defense mechanisms. It is structurally similar to cysteine, but contains selenium instead of sulfur.\\nAmino acids are organic compounds that serve as the building blocks of proteins. They have a specific structure, consisting of a central carbon atom bonded to an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a side chain.\\nSelenocysteine meets all these criteria: it has a sulfur-free side chain but still has the characteristic amino and carboxyl groups.\\nTherefore, based on its structure and function, selenocysteine can be classified as an amino acid.\\n\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
