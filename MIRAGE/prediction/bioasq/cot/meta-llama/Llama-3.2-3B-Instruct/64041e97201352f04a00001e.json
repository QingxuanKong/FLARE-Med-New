    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if daridorexant is effective for insomnia, let's consider its mechanism of action and available evidence. Daridorexant is a melatonin receptor antagonist, which means it works by blocking the action of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles. Insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. Given its mechanism of action, daridorexant could potentially help with insomnia by increasing the time spent in bed and reducing the time spent awake at night. Research has been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of daridorexant in treating insomnia. The results of these studies suggest that daridorexant is effective in improving sleep quality and reducing sleep latency in adults with insomnia. Therefore, based on its mechanism of action and available evidence, daridorexant appears to be effective for insomnia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
