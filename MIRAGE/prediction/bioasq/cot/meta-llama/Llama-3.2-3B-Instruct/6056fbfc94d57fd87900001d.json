    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether royal jelly contains proteins, let's consider its composition. Royal jelly is a substance produced by worker bees in the hive, and it is known for its nutritional and medicinal properties. It is a complex mixture of various compounds, including enzymes, vitamins, amino acids, and other nutrients. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, so if royal jelly contains amino acids, it is likely to contain proteins as well. Research has shown that royal jelly is rich in proteins, with some studies indicating that it can contain up to 50% protein by weight. This high protein content makes royal jelly a valuable ingredient in bee products and a popular supplement among beekeepers and health enthusiasts alike.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
