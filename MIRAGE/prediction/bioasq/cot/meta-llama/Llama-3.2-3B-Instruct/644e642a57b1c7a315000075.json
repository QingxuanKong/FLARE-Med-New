    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether all proteins start with methionine, we need to understand the basics of protein synthesis and the role of the amino acid methionine in it. Proteins are composed of amino acids, which are linked together by peptide bonds. The process of protein synthesis involves the sequence of amino acids being read from a genetic code in DNA. The genetic code specifies the sequence of amino acids, but it does not dictate the specific order in which they are added to the polypeptide chain. Methionine is an essential amino acid, meaning it cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained through the diet. It plays a crucial role in various bodily functions, including serving as a precursor for other amino acids and participating in enzyme reactions. However, the question of whether all proteins start with methionine is not a straightforward one. While methionine is often the first amino acid added to the growing polypeptide chain during translation, this is not a hard and fast rule. In some cases, other amino acids may be added first, and then methionine is added later. For example, in some protein sequences, the first amino acid may be glutamate, aspartate, or even a non-standard amino acid. In these cases, methionine is not the initial amino acid. Therefore, the answer to the question is not a simple yes or no. However, for the purpose of this multiple-choice question, we will consider the most common scenario in which methionine is indeed the first amino acid added to the polypeptide chain, which is approximately 20% of all protein sequences. In this context, the answer would be A. yes, but with the understanding that it is not a universal rule. However, considering the nature of the question and the provided options, the most accurate answer would be B. no, as it acknowledges that not all proteins start with methionine.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
