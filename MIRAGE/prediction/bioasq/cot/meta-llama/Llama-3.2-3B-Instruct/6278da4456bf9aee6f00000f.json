        "A": "yes",
        "B": "no"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Thalidomide is a medication that was first introduced in the 1950s and was initially used as a sedative and anti-nausea medication. However, it was later withdrawn from the market due to its severe side effects, particularly its teratogenic properties, which caused birth defects in thousands of children. Despite its dark history, thalidomide has seen a resurgence in use in recent years due to its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. In 1998, the US FDA approved thalidomide for the treatment of multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer, and in 2006, it was approved for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosy (ENL) in patients with leprosy. Today, thalidomide is indeed used as an immunomodulatory drug, specifically for the treatment of these conditions, as well as for the treatment of certain complications of multiple myeloma, such as peripheral neuropathy and graft-versus-host disease. Therefore, the answer is affirmative.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
