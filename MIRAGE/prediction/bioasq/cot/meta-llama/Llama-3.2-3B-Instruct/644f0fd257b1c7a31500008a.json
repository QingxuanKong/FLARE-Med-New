    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's consider the role of enhancers in gene regulation. Enhancers are DNA sequences that can increase the transcription of a gene by interacting with transcription factors and other regulatory elements. The location of enhancers relative to their target genes can vary, and their function is not strictly limited to being close to the gene. While some enhancers are indeed located near their target genes, others can be far away, even on different chromosomes or even on different DNA strands. The key factor is not the distance but rather the presence of specific DNA sequences and regulatory elements that allow the enhancer to interact with transcription factors and influence gene expression. Therefore, the proximity of enhancers to their target genes is not a hard requirement for their function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
