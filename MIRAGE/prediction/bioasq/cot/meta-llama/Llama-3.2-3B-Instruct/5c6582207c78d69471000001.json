    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if lucatumumab is a polyclonal antibody, I need to understand what a polyclonal antibody is. A polyclonal antibody is an antibody that is derived from a mixture of different B cell clones, meaning it is a mixture of antibodies with different specificities. This results in a broad range of antigen-binding specificities. On the other hand, a monoclonal antibody is an antibody produced by a single B cell clone and has a single specificity. Lucatumumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, meaning it is designed to be highly similar to a naturally occurring human antibody, but it is produced by a single B cell clone. Therefore, based on its monoclonal nature, lucatumumab is not a polyclonal antibody.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
