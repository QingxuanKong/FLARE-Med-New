Tebentafusp is an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody that has been approved for the treatment of melanoma. Uveal melanoma is a type of cancer that affects the uvea, the middle layer of the eye. Research has shown that immunotherapy, including checkpoint inhibitors like tebentafusp, can be effective in treating various types of cancer, including melanoma. Specifically, tebentafusp has been studied in clinical trials for its efficacy in uveal melanoma. The results of these trials suggest that tebentafusp can improve progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with uveal melanoma. Therefore, based on the available evidence, tebentafusp appears to be an effective treatment option for uveal melanoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
