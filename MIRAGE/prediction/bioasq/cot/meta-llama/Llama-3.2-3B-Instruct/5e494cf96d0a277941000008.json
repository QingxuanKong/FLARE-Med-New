    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if Nivolumab (Opdivo) is a PD-L1 inhibitor, let's break down the information step by step. Nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 receptor on T cells. The PD-1 receptor is a checkpoint protein on T cells that, when engaged by its ligands (PD-L1 or PD-L2), inhibits T cell activation and proliferation. Inhibiting this interaction can enhance anti-tumor immune responses. Nivolumab works by binding to the PD-1 receptor, thereby blocking the interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, which leads to the activation of T cells and the induction of an anti-tumor immune response. Therefore, Nivolumab indeed functions as a PD-1 inhibitor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
