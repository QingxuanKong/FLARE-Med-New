    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if atenolol is metabolized by CYP2D6, we need to understand the metabolic pathway of atenolol and the role of CYP2D6 in drug metabolism.\\n\\nAtenolol is a beta-blocker used primarily for the treatment of hypertension and angina. It is a selective \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blocker.\\n\\nCYP2D6 is a member of the cytochrome P450 enzyme family, which is involved in the metabolism of many drugs. Specifically, CYP2D6 is known to metabolize a wide range of drugs, including many antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antiarrhythmics.\\n\\nHowever, atenolol is not typically considered a substrate of CYP2D6. It is primarily metabolized by CYP2D17 and CYP3A4, but not significantly by CYP2D6.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is that atenolol is not metabolized by CYP2D6.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
