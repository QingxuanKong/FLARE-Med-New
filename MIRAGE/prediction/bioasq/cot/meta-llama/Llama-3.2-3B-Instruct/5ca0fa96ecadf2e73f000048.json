While there have been advancements in creating artificial blood substitutes and components, such as artificial red blood cells, oxygen-carrying liquids, and blood substitutes, the development of fully functional artificial blood cells that can replace all the functions of natural red blood cells is still in its infancy. Researchers are actively working on this area, but no commercially available artificial blood cells are currently on the market.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
