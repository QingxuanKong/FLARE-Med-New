TNF stands for Tumor Necrosis Factor, which is a type of cytokine involved in systemic inflammation. Tocilizumab is a medication used to treat various inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and COVID-19. It works by blocking the action of TNF-alpha, a specific type of TNF. Given this information, we can conclude that Tocilizumab targets TNF-alpha, making it an anti-TNF antibody.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
