        "A": "yes",
        "B": "no"

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if cardenolides are inhibitors of Na+/K+ ATPase, let's break down the concept:\\n\\nCardenolides are a group of compounds found in plants, primarily in the genus Digitalis (e.g., Digitalis purpurea, also known as foxglove).\\n\\nNa+/K+ ATPase, also known as the sodium-potassium pump, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in maintaining the resting membrane potential of cells by pumping sodium ions out of the cell and potassium ions into the cell.\\n\\nCardenolides are known to have a unique mechanism of action, which involves binding to the Na+/K+ ATPase enzyme, inhibiting its activity. This inhibition leads to an accumulation of sodium ions inside the cell, causing hyperpolarization of the cell membrane and ultimately leading to a decrease in the heart rate.\\n\\nGiven this information, it is clear that cardenolides do indeed inhibit the Na+/K+ ATPase enzyme.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
