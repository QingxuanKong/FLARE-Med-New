Saccharomyces cerevisiae, also known as baker's yeast, is a eukaryotic organism. Eukaryotic genomes are typically organized into topologically associated domains (TADs), which are regions of the genome that are physically close together and are often involved in regulating gene expression. However, yeast is a unicellular organism, and its genome organization is distinct from that of more complex multicellular organisms. Research has shown that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome is organized into topologically associated domains (TADs), which are distinct from the more complex TADs found in higher eukaryotes. These TADs in yeast are thought to play a role in regulating gene expression and maintaining genome stability. Therefore, the yeast genome is indeed organized into TADs, but the organization is different from that of more complex eukaryotes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
