    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Hunter's disease, also known as Machado-Joseph disease, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord. It is an autosomal recessive disorder, which means that it is caused by mutations in a specific gene on a non-sex chromosome. In humans, the X chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes, while autosomal chromosomes are the 22 pairs of non-sex chromosomes. Hunter's disease is caused by mutations in the HPS1 gene, which is located on an autosomal chromosome (specifically, chromosome 4). Therefore, Hunter's disease is not associated with the X chromosome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
