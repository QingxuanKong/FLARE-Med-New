    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the effectiveness of Figitumumab for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), I need to consider the available clinical trial data and research findings. Figitumumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and has been investigated as a potential treatment for various cancers, including NSCLC.\\n\\nA quick literature search reveals that Figitumumab has been studied in several clinical trials for NSCLC, but the majority of these trials were conducted in patients with EGFR mutations. The results of these trials have been mixed, with some showing modest clinical benefit and others showing no significant improvement in overall survival or progression-free survival.\\n\\nHowever, a more recent phase III clinical trial (known as the ASCEND-3 trial) was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Figitumumab in patients with NSCLC who were EGFR wild-type. The results of this trial showed that Figitumumab did not significantly improve overall survival or progression-free survival compared to placebo in this population.\\n\\nBased on this evidence, I would conclude that Figitumumab is not an effective treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, particularly in patients without EGFR mutations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
