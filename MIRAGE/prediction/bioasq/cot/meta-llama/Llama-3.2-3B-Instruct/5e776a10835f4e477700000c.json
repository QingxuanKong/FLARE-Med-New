        "A": "yes",

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if the drug Exubera is currently available, I need to check its current status. Exubera is a type of inhaled insulin that was approved by the US FDA in 2006 for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, it has been several years since its approval, and I need to check if it is still on the market. I can find that Exubera was discontinued by the manufacturer, United Therapeutics, in 2011 due to low sales and high production costs. Although it is no longer in production, it is possible that some remaining stock may still be available through certain pharmacies or online retailers, but I couldn't find any information on its current availability in March 2020. Given the discontinuation of the drug and lack of recent updates, I would say that Exubera is unlikely to be widely available.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
