    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification (PTM), let's break down the process and its characteristics. ADP-ribosylation is a type of post-translational modification where an ADP-ribose molecule is transferred from NAD+ to a protein. This process can occur on various proteins, including enzymes, transcription factors, and other signaling molecules. The addition of ADP-ribose can alter the activity, localization, or stability of the target protein. Therefore, ADP-ribosylation meets the criteria for a PTM, as it involves the covalent attachment of a small molecule to a protein, which can significantly impact its function. This process is also reversible, which is another characteristic of PTMs. Additionally, ADP-ribosylation has been extensively studied and is a well-established mechanism in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell signaling, and gene regulation. Based on these characteristics, it can be concluded that ADP-ribosylation is indeed a type of post-translational modification.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
