    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether eptinezumab is a small molecule, we need to understand what eptinezumab is and its chemical properties. Eptinezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which is a type of biologic medication. Monoclonal antibodies are large, complex molecules composed of multiple polypeptide chains, typically ranging from 100 to 150 kDa in size. They are designed to target specific proteins or receptors in the body and are often used to treat various diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cancers. Given that eptinezumab is a monoclonal antibody, it is not a small molecule but a large, complex biologic agent.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
