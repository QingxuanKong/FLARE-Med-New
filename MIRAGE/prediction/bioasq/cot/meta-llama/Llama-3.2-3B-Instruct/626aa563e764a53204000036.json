    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether pRETRO-SUPER is an adenoviral vector, we need to understand what adenoviral vectors are and what pRETRO-SUPER is. Adenoviral vectors are commonly used in gene therapy and vaccine development due to their ability to infect a wide range of cells, including non-dividing cells, and express high levels of the therapeutic gene. They are derived from adenoviruses, which are a type of virus that can cause infections in humans. pRETRO-SUPER, on the other hand, is a proprietary gene therapy product developed by a biotechnology company. It is designed to treat various genetic disorders by delivering a therapeutic gene to specific cells in the body. Given that pRETRO-SUPER is a gene therapy product and not a virus itself, it is not an adenoviral vector.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
