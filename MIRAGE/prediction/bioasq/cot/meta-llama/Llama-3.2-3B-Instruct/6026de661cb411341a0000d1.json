    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the current state of research and development in the field of migraine treatment, specifically focusing on small molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists (CGRPs). CGRP is a neurotransmitter involved in migraine pathophysiology, and targeting it has been a promising approach for migraine treatment.\\n\\nThere have been several CGRP antagonists in development for migraine treatment, including oral and injectable options. These small molecule CGRPs aim to block the CGRP receptor, thereby reducing migraine symptoms. Some examples include erenumab, fremanezumab, and eptinezumab, which have already been approved for clinical use.\\n\\nGiven this information, it is clear that there are indeed small molecule CGRPs under development for the treatment of migraine.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
