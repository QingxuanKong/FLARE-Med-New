    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the impact of whole-genome duplications versus small-scale duplications on the evolution of yeast. Whole-genome duplications involve the duplication of the entire genome, while small-scale duplications involve the duplication of specific genes or gene families. Step 1: Understanding the mechanisms of duplication. Whole-genome duplications are often the result of errors during DNA replication, while small-scale duplications can occur through various mechanisms such as gene conversion, unequal crossing over, or the duplication of specific chromosomal regions. Step 2: Analyzing the impact on gene function. Whole-genome duplications can lead to the creation of new gene families with novel functions, as duplicate genes can evolve to perform different functions. On the other hand, small-scale duplications often result in the duplication of genes with similar functions, which can lead to redundancy and potentially decreased gene expression. Step 3: Examining the evolutionary consequences. Whole-genome duplications can lead to a significant increase in genetic diversity, as duplicate genes can evolve to occupy new ecological niches. In contrast, small-scale duplications may not result in as much diversity, as the duplicated genes are often similar in function and may not occupy new ecological niches. Step 4: Considering the evidence from yeast. In yeast, whole-genome duplications have been observed to occur relatively frequently, and these events have been linked to the evolution of new gene families and increased genetic diversity. In contrast, small-scale duplications are less common and do not appear to have had as significant an impact on yeast evolution. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, it appears that whole-genome duplications are more divergent than small-scale duplications in yeast, as they lead to the creation of new gene families and increased genetic diversity.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"A\"",
