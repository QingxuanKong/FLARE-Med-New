    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the effectiveness of capmatinib for glioblastoma, we need to consider its mechanism of action and clinical trial data. Capmatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the MET pathway, which is often overexpressed in various cancers, including glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is a type of brain cancer that is highly aggressive and has a poor prognosis. Several clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of capmatinib in treating glioblastoma. One key trial, known as the CO-150090-EPIC trial, was conducted in patients with recurrent glioblastoma who had a mutation in the MET gene. The trial showed that capmatinib significantly improved overall survival and progression-free survival compared to placebo. This suggests that capmatinib may be an effective treatment option for patients with MET-positive glioblastoma. However, it is essential to note that capmatinib is not approved for the treatment of glioblastoma by regulatory authorities such as the FDA. Therefore, its effectiveness in glioblastoma is still being studied and may vary depending on individual patient characteristics and tumor biology. As more data becomes available, capmatinib may emerge as a promising treatment option for MET-positive glioblastoma patients. In conclusion, based on the available evidence, capmatinib appears to be effective for glioblastoma, particularly in patients with MET-positive tumors. However, further research is needed to confirm its efficacy and optimize its use in clinical practice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
