    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what lysozyme is and its role in the human body. Lysozyme is an enzyme that has antimicrobial properties, breaking down the cell walls of certain bacteria. It is found in various bodily secretions, such as saliva, respiratory tract mucus, and tears. Given its antimicrobial properties, it's plausible that lysozyme could be present in tears to help protect the eyes from infection. Let's evaluate the options: Option A: yes - This is a possible answer, considering lysozyme's role in other bodily secretions. However, we need to verify if it's specifically abundant in human tears. Option B: no - This option suggests that lysozyme is not present or abundant in human tears, which contradicts its known functions in other bodily secretions. Considering these points, the most logical answer is that lysozyme is indeed found in human tears, although I couldn't find a definitive source confirming its abundance in tears specifically. However, given its presence in other bodily secretions, it's reasonable to assume it might be present in tears as well. Therefore, the answer is: answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",
