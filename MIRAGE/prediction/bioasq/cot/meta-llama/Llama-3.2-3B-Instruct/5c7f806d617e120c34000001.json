    "question": "Are tumour specific antigens originating from known protein coding genes?",
    "options": {
        "A": "yes",
        "B": "no"
    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking: 1. Tumor-specific antigens are molecules that are recognized by the immune system as foreign when they are expressed by cancer cells. These antigens can be proteins, peptides, or other molecules. 2. The majority of tumor-specific antigens are indeed derived from known protein-coding genes. These antigens often arise from mutations or alterations in the normal function of proteins that are encoded by these genes. 3. Many tumor-specific antigens are also known as neoantigens, which are proteins that are not normally expressed by the cell but are produced as a result of genetic mutations. 4. Examples of tumor-specific antigens include mutated proteins such as HER2, EGFR, and PD-L1, which are encoded by known protein-coding genes. 5. Therefore, the majority of tumor-specific antigens originate from known protein-coding genes. Based on this step-by-step analysis, the answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Tumor-specific antigens are indeed derived from known protein-coding genes, as they often arise from mutations or alterations in the normal function of proteins encoded by these genes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
