After conducting a search, I found that ubrogepant is an investigational calcitonin receptor agonist being developed by Ubrogepant LLC for the treatment of acute migraine attacks. According to the information available, ubrogepant has completed several clinical trials, including phase II and phase III trials, for the treatment of acute migraine. The phase III trials were designed to assess the efficacy and safety of ubrogepant compared to sumatriptan in the treatment of acute migraine attacks. Based on this information, it appears that ubrogepant has indeed entered clinical phase III trials.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
