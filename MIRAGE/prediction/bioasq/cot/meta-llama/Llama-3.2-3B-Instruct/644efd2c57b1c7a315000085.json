    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break it down step by step. Epigenetic changes refer to heritable modifications in gene expression that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence. These changes can affect how genes are turned on or off, and they can be influenced by various factors such as environmental influences, lifestyle choices, and genetic predispositions. Epigenetic modifications include DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA-mediated gene regulation. These modifications can alter the structure of chromatin, which is the complex of DNA and proteins that make up chromosomes. As a result, epigenetic changes can influence gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. Therefore, the answer to the question is that epigenetic changes do not change the DNA sequence, but rather affect how the genes are expressed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
