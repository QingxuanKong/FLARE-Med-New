    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the current state of research and treatment options for Alzheimer's disease as of February 2019. Major brain gangliosides are a type of complex lipid molecule found in the brain, and they have been studied for their potential role in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Research has suggested that gangliosides may play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, particularly in the modulation of neuronal function and the regulation of amyloid-beta peptides, which are associated with the disease. Some studies have investigated the use of gangliosides as potential therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease. For example, certain gangliosides have been shown to have neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects, which could be beneficial in preventing or slowing the progression of the disease. Additionally, gangliosides may also be able to modulate the immune response and reduce inflammation in the brain, which is also a key component of Alzheimer's disease pathology. However, as of February 2019, there were no FDA-approved treatments that specifically target major brain gangliosides for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. While gangliosides show promise as potential therapeutic agents, more research is needed to fully understand their efficacy and safety in humans. Therefore, the answer to the question is that major brain gangliosides are not a target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease as of February 2019, but they do hold promise for future research and potential therapeutic applications.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
