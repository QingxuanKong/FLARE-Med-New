        "A": "yes",

    },
    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if enasidenib can be used for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we need to consider its mechanism of action and clinical evidence. Enasidenib is a potent and selective inhibitor of the fatty acid synthase 1 (FASN) enzyme. FASN is involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, which are essential for cell growth and proliferation. In cancer cells, including AML cells, FASN is often overexpressed and plays a critical role in their survival and growth. Clinical trials have investigated the efficacy and safety of enasidenib in patients with AML. The most notable study is the ENRICHTO trial, which demonstrated that enasidenib significantly improved overall survival in patients with untreated or minimally treated AML with a specific genetic mutation, known as the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation. Based on the clinical evidence, enasidenib can be used for the treatment of AML in patients with the IDH1 mutation. However, its use in other types of AML is not established, and it is not a standard treatment for AML in general.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
