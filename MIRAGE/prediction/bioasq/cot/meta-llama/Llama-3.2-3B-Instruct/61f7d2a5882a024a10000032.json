It is a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin-6 (IL-6) protein, which plays a key role in the inflammatory process of lupus.\\n\\nGiven its mechanism of action and its indication for treating SLE, it is reasonable to conclude that Belimumab is indeed used for treating lupus nephritis, which is a common complication of lupus.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
