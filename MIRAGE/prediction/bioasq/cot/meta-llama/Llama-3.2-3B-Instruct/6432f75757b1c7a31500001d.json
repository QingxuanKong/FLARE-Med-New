BTK inhibitors are a class of medications used primarily for the treatment of certain types of blood cancers, such as mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstr\\u00f6m macroglobulinemia. The first-generation BTK inhibitors areibrutinib (Imbruvica) and ibrutinib is indeed a first-generation BTK inhibitor. Zanubrutinib, on the other hand, is a second-generation BTK inhibitor. It was approved by the FDA in 2021 for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstr\\u00f6m macroglobulinemia, but it is not a first-generation BTK inhibitor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
