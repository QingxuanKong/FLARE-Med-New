    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Avelumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-L1 protein, which is involved in the immune response. It has been investigated in several cancer trials, including those for bladder cancer. In 2018, the FDA approved avelumab for the treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer. Additionally, avelumab has been studied in a Phase II trial for urothelial carcinoma, a type of bladder cancer. The trial showed that avelumab significantly improved overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with urothelial carcinoma. Therefore, based on the available evidence, it appears that avelumab is effective for bladder cancer, specifically urothelial carcinoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
