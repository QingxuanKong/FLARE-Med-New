        "A": "yes",
        "B": "no"

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what royal jelly proteins and yellow proteins are. Royal jelly is a substance produced by worker bees in the honey bee colony, and it is known for its nutritional and medicinal properties. It is composed of various proteins, mainly enzymes, vitamins, and other nutrients. The yellow proteins, on the other hand, refer to the proteins found in the venom of certain insects, such as bees, wasps, and ants. These proteins are responsible for the venom's pain-inducing and inflammatory effects. Given the different origins and functions of royal jelly and yellow proteins, it is unlikely that they share similar characteristics. However, some research has suggested that certain proteins in royal jelly may have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which are also present in some yellow proteins. But overall, the primary function and composition of royal jelly proteins and yellow proteins are distinct.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
