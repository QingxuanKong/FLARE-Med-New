It works by blocking the action of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine involved in inflammation, rather than tumor necrosis factor (TNF).\\n\\nTNF inhibitors are a class of medications that specifically target and block the action of tumor necrosis factor, a cytokine involved in systemic inflammation.\\n\\nGiven that tocilizumab targets IL-6, not TNF, it is not a TNF inhibitor.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
