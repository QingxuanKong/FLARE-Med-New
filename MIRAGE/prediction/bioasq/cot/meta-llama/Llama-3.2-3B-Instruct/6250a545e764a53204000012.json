The EQ-5D is a widely used instrument that assesses health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in individuals with chronic diseases. It is a self-report questionnaire that evaluates five dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. However, the EQ-5D does not consist of 5 questions. Instead, it has a single index score and a visual analogue scale (VAS) that ranges from 0 to 100. The index score is calculated based on the responses to the five dimensions. Therefore, the EQ-5D is not a 5-question assessment but rather a multi-component instrument that evaluates multiple aspects of HRQoL.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
