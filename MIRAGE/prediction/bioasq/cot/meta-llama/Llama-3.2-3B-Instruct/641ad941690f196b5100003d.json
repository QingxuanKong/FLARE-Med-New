Both LOQ (Limit of Quantitation) and LOD (Limit of Detection) are used to describe the lowest amount of a substance that can be detected or quantified in a sample. However, the key difference lies in their definitions and the level of accuracy required.\\n\\nLOQ is the lowest amount of a substance that can be detected with a high degree of accuracy (usually 99% or 99.9%) and is used to establish the minimum amount of the analyte that can be reliably quantified in a sample. LOD, on the other hand, is the lowest amount of a substance that can be detected but not necessarily quantified with a certain degree of accuracy (usually 3:1 or 5:1 signal-to-noise ratio).\\n\\nIn summary, while both LOQ and LOD are important in laboratory settings, they serve different purposes and are not exactly the same.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
