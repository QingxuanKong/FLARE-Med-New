    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's consider the available evidence and scientific consensus on SARS-CoV-2 transmission through breast milk.\\n\\nFirstly, SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that causes COVID-19, a respiratory illness. The primary mode of transmission is through respiratory droplets, contact with contaminated surfaces, and close contact with an infected person.\\n\\nBreast milk is a nutrient-rich fluid that provides essential antibodies and immunoglobulins to infants. However, the question is whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through breast milk.\\n\\nSeveral studies have investigated this topic, and the consensus is that SARS-CoV-2 is not transmitted through breast milk.\\n\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other reputable health organizations have stated that there is no evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through breast milk.\\n\\nIn fact, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2020 found that breast milk from mothers with COVID-19 did not contain detectable levels of the virus.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the available evidence and scientific consensus, the answer is that SARS-CoV-2 is not transmitted through breast milk.\\n\\nSo, the correct answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
