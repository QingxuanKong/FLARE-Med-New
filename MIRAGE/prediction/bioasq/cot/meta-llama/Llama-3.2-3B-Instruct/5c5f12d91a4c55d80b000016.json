    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if chlorotoxin is a peptide, I need to understand what chlorotoxin is and its composition. Chlorotoxin is a small, cationic peptide found in the venom of the green mamba snake (Dendroaspis viridis). It is known for its ability to inhibit potassium channels in neurons, which can lead to paralysis. Peptides are short chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. Given that chlorotoxin is a small, cationic molecule and is composed of amino acids, I will consider it as a peptide.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
