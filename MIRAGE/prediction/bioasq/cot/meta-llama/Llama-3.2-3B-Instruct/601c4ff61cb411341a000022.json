Proton beam therapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses protons instead of X-rays to treat cancer. It is often used for tumors that are sensitive to protons, such as brain tumors. Craniopharyngioma is a type of brain tumor that typically occurs in children and is often treated with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. Considering the characteristics of proton beam therapy and craniopharyngioma, I need to determine if proton beam therapy is a viable treatment option for this type of tumor.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
