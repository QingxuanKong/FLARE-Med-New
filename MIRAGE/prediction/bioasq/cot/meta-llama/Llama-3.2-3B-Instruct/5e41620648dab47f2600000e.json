Poliosis circumscripta refers to a specific type of vitiligo, which is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the loss of pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) in the skin. This results in white or depigmented patches on the skin. The term 'circumscripta' indicates that these patches are well-defined and typically circular or oval in shape. Given this information, it is clear that poliosis circumscripta is indeed another term for a white or unpigmented patch of hair or skin, specifically in the context of vitiligo.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
