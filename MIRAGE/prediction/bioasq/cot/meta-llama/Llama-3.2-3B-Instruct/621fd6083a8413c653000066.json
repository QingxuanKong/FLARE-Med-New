    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the difference between DNA and RNA in terms of methylation. Methylation is a process by which a methyl group is added to the DNA molecule, which can affect gene expression. RNA, on the other hand, is not typically methylated in the same way as DNA. While some RNA molecules, such as tRNA and rRNA, may undergo modifications like methylation, the primary function of these modifications is to modify the structure of the RNA molecule rather than to influence gene expression like DNA methylation does. However, there are some exceptions, like certain types of RNA that are involved in epigenetic regulation. Despite these exceptions, RNA is generally not methylated in the same way as DNA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
