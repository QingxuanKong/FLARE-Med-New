    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Nelson's syndrome is a rare condition that typically occurs in individuals who have undergone bilateral adrenalectomy (surgical removal of both adrenal glands) as part of treatment for Cushing's disease. The primary goal of treatment for Nelson's syndrome is to manage the symptoms and prevent further complications. Cabergoline is a dopamine agonist that is primarily used to treat hyperprolactinemia (elevated levels of prolactin in the blood) and Parkinson's disease. It works by stimulating dopamine receptors in the brain, which helps to decrease prolactin secretion. While cabergoline can be used to treat conditions related to prolactin imbalances, it is not a primary treatment for Nelson's syndrome. The standard treatment for Nelson's syndrome typically involves replacing the missing adrenal hormones with hormone replacement therapy, such as hydrocortisone and aldosterone. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to reduce tumor size or manage symptoms. Therefore, cabergoline is not a typical treatment for Nelson's syndrome.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
