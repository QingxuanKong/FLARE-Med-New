    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I need to understand what ProSavin is and how it is delivered to the cells. ProSavin is a gene therapy treatment for Sanfilippo syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. Gene therapy typically involves using a vector to deliver genetic material to cells to replace or repair faulty genes. Adenoviral vectors are commonly used in gene therapy because they can infect a wide range of cell types and can be engineered to be replication-deficient, reducing the risk of unwanted side effects. However, there is another type of viral vector that is also used in gene therapy, the adeno-associated virus (AAV). AAV vectors are also replication-deficient and have a smaller size, making them a popular choice for gene therapy. ProSavin is known to use an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector for gene delivery, not an adenoviral vector. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
