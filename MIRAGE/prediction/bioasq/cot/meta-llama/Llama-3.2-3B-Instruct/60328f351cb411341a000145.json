    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Freund\\u2019s complete adjuvant is a substance used in immunology research to induce arthritis in animal models. It is a mixture of incomplete Freund\\u2019s adjuvant (a mycobacterial extract) and complete Freund\\u2019s adjuvant (a mycobacterial extract plus arthritic serum). The complete adjuvant component is responsible for inducing the autoimmune response and subsequent arthritis in animal models. Therefore, Freund\\u2019s complete adjuvant can induce arthritis in experimental animal models, making option A the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
