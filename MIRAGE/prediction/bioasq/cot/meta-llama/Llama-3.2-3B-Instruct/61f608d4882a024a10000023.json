    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if sacituzumab govitecan is effective for breast cancer, let's consider its mechanism of action and available clinical data.\\n\\nSacituzumab govitecan is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD38 protein, which is often overexpressed on the surface of triple-negative breast cancer cells. It is designed to bind to CD38 and induce apoptosis (cell death) in these cancer cells.\\n\\nClinical trials have shown that sacituzumab govitecan is effective in treating patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer that has progressed on or after prior chemotherapy. The drug has been shown to improve overall survival and progression-free survival in these patients.\\n\\nAdditionally, sacituzumab govitecan has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer that has expressed CD38 and has progressed on or after at least two prior chemotherapy regimens for this type of cancer.\\n\\nBased on the available clinical data and its mechanism of action, sacituzumab govitecan appears to be an effective treatment option for patients with triple-negative breast cancer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
