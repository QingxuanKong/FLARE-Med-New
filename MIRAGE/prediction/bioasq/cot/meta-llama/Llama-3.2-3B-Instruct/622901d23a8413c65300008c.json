    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if Ameloblastoma (AB) is a benign tumor that never metastasizes, we need to consider its characteristics and behavior. Ameloblastoma is a rare, benign (non-cancerous) tumor that primarily affects the jaw, particularly the maxilla. It is thought to originate from the epithelial cells of the dental lamina, which is the tissue that forms the teeth and surrounding tissues. Despite its benign nature, Ameloblastoma can grow and expand, potentially causing significant damage to surrounding tissues and structures. However, its ability to metastasize, or spread to other parts of the body, is a topic of ongoing debate. While most cases of Ameloblastoma do not metastasize, there have been reports of rare instances where the tumor has spread to distant sites, such as the lungs, liver, and lymph nodes. Therefore, while Ameloblastoma is generally considered benign, its potential for metastasis cannot be entirely ruled out, making option B the correct answer.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
