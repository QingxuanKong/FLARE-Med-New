    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) is primarily known for its use in treating certain types of cancer, particularly those affecting the skin and lungs. It is most commonly used to treat early-stage lung cancer and skin cancer, such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. BCG is also used to prevent tuberculosis (TB). When considering its application in bladder cancer, BCG has been used in a specific context: as an immunotherapy to treat high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). This is because BCG can stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells in the bladder. However, its use in bladder cancer is not widespread or as common as in other types of cancer. It is not a standard treatment for most bladder cancer cases, and its application is usually limited to specific cases where there is high-risk disease or after other treatments have failed. Therefore, the correct answer is not a straightforward yes or no, but rather a nuanced understanding of its limited but specific application in bladder cancer treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
