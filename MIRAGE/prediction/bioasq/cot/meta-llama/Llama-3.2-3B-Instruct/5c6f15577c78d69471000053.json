    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I will consider the available clinical trial data and research findings regarding galcanezumab. Galcanezumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors, which play a role in migraine pathophysiology. Several clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of galcanezumab in treating migraine. These trials have demonstrated that galcanezumab can significantly reduce the frequency and severity of migraine attacks in some patients. Specifically, the SELECT series of trials, which included over 14,000 participants, showed that galcanezumab was effective in reducing the frequency of migraine attacks by 50-60% compared to placebo. Additionally, galcanezumab has been shown to have a favorable safety profile, with a low rate of serious adverse events. Based on the available evidence, it appears that galcanezumab is an effective treatment option for migraine prevention in certain patients. \", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
