    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the available evidence on golodirsen as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Golodirsen is an antisense oligonucleotide that targets the dystrophin gene, aiming to increase dystrophin production in patients with DMD. DMD is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, leading to progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. The effectiveness of golodirsen has been evaluated in clinical trials.\\n\\nStep 1: Review of Clinical Trials - Golodirsen has been studied in several clinical trials, including the phase 2 'Skyward' trial, which demonstrated a significant increase in dystrophin levels in patients with DMD. However, the trial also showed a potential increase in serious cardiac events, such as cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.\\n\\nStep 2: Review of Regulatory Approval - Golodirsen was approved by the US FDA in 2016 for the treatment of DMD in patients aged 6 years and older. However, the approval was conditional due to the increased risk of serious cardiac events.\\n\\nStep 3: Review of Current Guidelines - Current treatment guidelines for DMD recommend a combination of dystrophin replacement therapy and other supportive treatments, but do not specifically mention golodirsen as a first-line treatment option.\\n\\nStep 4: Review of Expert Opinion - Some experts consider golodirsen a potentially valuable treatment option for DMD, while others express concerns about its safety profile and the need for further research.\\n\\nConclusion - Based on the available evidence, golodirsen appears to be effective in increasing dystrophin levels in patients with DMD, but its use should be approached with caution due to the potential risks of serious cardiac events. Therefore, the answer to the question is that golodirsen is effective for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but with limitations and potential risks.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
