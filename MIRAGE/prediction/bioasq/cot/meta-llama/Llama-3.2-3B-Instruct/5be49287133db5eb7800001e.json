    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break down the key points: 1. **Understanding Pembrolizumab**: Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 protein, which is involved in the immune response. It is primarily used to treat various types of cancer, including melanoma, lung cancer, and head and neck cancer. 2. **Ewing's Sarcoma Overview**: Ewing's sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that typically affects the bones or the soft tissue around the bones. It is most commonly diagnosed in children and adolescents. 3. **Immunotherapy in Ewing's Sarcoma**: Immunotherapy, which includes checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab, has shown promise in treating various types of cancer, including sarcomas. However, its effectiveness in Ewing's sarcoma is not as well-established as in other cancers. 4. **Clinical Trials and Evidence**: To determine the effectiveness of pembrolizumab in Ewing's sarcoma, we need to look at clinical trial data. As of my knowledge cutoff, there is limited data on the use of pembrolizumab in Ewing's sarcoma. 5. **Conclusion**: Based on the available information, I couldn't find any conclusive evidence that pembrolizumab is specifically approved or widely used for the treatment of Ewing's sarcoma. Therefore, I would be cautious in saying that pembrolizumab is not effective against Ewing's sarcoma. However, it's essential to note that cancer treatment is highly individualized, and ongoing research may lead to new treatment options. The best course of action would be to consult a medical professional for personalized advice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
