    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether ustekinumab is a polyclonal antibody, we need to understand what polyclonal antibodies are and the nature of ustekinumab.\\n\\nPolyclonal antibodies are a type of antibody that targets multiple epitopes (regions) on an antigen, resulting in a mixture of antibodies with different specificities. These antibodies are typically produced by B cells in response to a broad range of antigens.\\n\\nUstekinumab, on the other hand, is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are a type of antibody that is produced by a single clone of B cells, meaning they target a single specific epitope or antigen. This results in a homogeneous population of antibodies with identical specificity.\\n\\nGiven that ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody, it is not a polyclonal antibody.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. no.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
