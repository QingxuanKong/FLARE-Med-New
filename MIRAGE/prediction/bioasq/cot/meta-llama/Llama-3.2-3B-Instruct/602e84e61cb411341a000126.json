    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what Tocilizumab (Actemra) is and its mechanism of action. Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor. IL-6 is a cytokine involved in the inflammatory response, and blocking its receptor can help reduce inflammation. Therefore, Tocilizumab works by binding to the IL-6 receptor, preventing IL-6 from interacting with it and thereby reducing the inflammatory response. This is the primary mechanism by which Tocilizumab exerts its therapeutic effects.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
