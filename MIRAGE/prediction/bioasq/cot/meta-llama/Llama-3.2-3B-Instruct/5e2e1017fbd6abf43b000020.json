    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break it down into two parts: (1) whether CD8+ (cytotoxic) T cells and CD4+ Helper T cells are generated in the thyroid, and (2) whether they express the T-cell receptor.\\n\\nCD8+ T cells, also known as cytotoxic T cells, are a type of T lymphocyte that plays a crucial role in cell-mediated immunity. They are generated in the thymus, not the thyroid. The thymus is the primary organ where T cells mature and develop. CD8+ T cells express the T-cell receptor (TCR) on their surface, which recognizes and binds to antigens presented by MHC class I molecules.\\n\\nCD4+ T cells, also known as helper T cells, are another type of T lymphocyte that plays a central role in the immune response. Like CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells are also generated in the thymus. They express the T-cell receptor (TCR) on their surface, which recognizes and binds to antigens presented by MHC class II molecules.\\n\\nConsidering these facts, both CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells are generated in the thymus, and they both express the T-cell receptor (TCR) on their surface. Therefore, the correct answer is A. yes.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
