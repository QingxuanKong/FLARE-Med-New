    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if METTL3 can methylate long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), we need to understand the function of METTL3 and its known targets.\\n\\nMETTL3 is a component of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase complex, which is responsible for the methylation of m6A in messenger RNA (mRNA) and some other RNAs. However, m6A methylation is not limited to mRNA; it has also been detected in other types of RNAs, including long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs).\\n\\nRecent studies have shown that METTL3 can indeed methylate lncRNAs, particularly those involved in gene regulation and cellular processes. This methylation can affect the stability, localization, and function of lncRNAs, thereby influencing various biological processes.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the available evidence, it appears that METTL3 can methylate long noncoding RNAs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
