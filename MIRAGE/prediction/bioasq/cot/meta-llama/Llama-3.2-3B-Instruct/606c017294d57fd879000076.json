    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I need to verify the FDA approval status of the HercepTest. The HercepTest is a companion diagnostic device used to identify HER2-positive status in breast cancer patients. After researching, I found that the HercepTest received FDA approval in 1999 for use in conjunction with trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody used to treat HER2-positive breast cancer. The test is a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test that detects HER2 protein overexpression or amplification in tumor cells. Given this information, I can confidently answer the question.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
