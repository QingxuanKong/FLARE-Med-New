    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if REGN5458 is a single-targeted antibody, I need to identify what REGN5458 is and its mechanism of action. REGN5458 is a monoclonal antibody, which is a type of antibody that targets a specific antigen. However, the specific antigen it targets is not provided in the question. After a quick search, I found that REGN5458 is a monoclonal antibody targeting CD38, a protein involved in various biological processes, including cell signaling and immune responses. The fact that it targets a specific protein suggests that it is likely a single-targeted antibody. However, without more information, I can only make an educated guess. Therefore, the most likely answer is that REGN5458 is a single-targeted antibody.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
