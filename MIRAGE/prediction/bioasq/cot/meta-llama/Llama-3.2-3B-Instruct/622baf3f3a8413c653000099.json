        "A": "yes",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer whether Afamin binds Vitamin E, we need to understand what Afamin is and its relationship with Vitamin E. Afamin is a protein found in human milk, and it is known to have various functions, including the transport and regulation of calcium and phosphate. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a crucial role in antioxidant functions and immune system. Given the distinct functions of Afamin and Vitamin E, we can hypothesize that they may not directly bind to each other. However, to confirm, we need to look into their biochemical interactions. Afamin is a calcium-binding protein, and Vitamin E is a lipophilic molecule, but there is no direct evidence in scientific literature suggesting a direct binding between Afamin and Vitamin E. Therefore, based on our step-by-step analysis, the most likely answer is that Afamin does not bind Vitamin E.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
