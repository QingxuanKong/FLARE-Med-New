A comet assay, also known as single-cell gel electrophoresis, is a method used to detect DNA damage and mutations in cells. It involves treating cells with a chemical that makes DNA single-stranded, then applying an electric field to separate the DNA fragments. The fragments that have broken DNA are pulled towards the anode, creating a 'comet tail', while intact DNA fragments remain at the origin. The length of the comet tail is proportional to the amount of DNA damage or mutations in the cell. Radiation can cause DNA damage, which would result in the formation of comets. Therefore, the comet assay can indeed measure radiation-induced mutations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\" } ``` The answer is A. Yes, a comet assay can measure radiation-induced mutations.",
