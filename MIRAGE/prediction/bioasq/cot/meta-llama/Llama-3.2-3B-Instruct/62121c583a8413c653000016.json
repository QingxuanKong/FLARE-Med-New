        "A": "yes",

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if MEDI2228 is a bispecific antibody, we need to understand what a bispecific antibody is. A bispecific antibody is a type of antibody that is engineered to bind to two different antigens simultaneously, which allows it to target and engage with two different parts of a cell or molecule, such as cancer cells or pathogens. Bispecific antibodies are often used in immunotherapy to enhance the body's immune response against specific diseases. Given the context, MEDI2228 is a monoclonal antibody fragment that is designed to target two different epitopes on the same protein, but it is not a full antibody. It is a bispecific antibody fragment, which is a smaller version of a bispecific antibody. However, in some contexts, the term bispecific antibody may refer to a full-length antibody that is engineered to bind to two different epitopes. In this case, MEDI2228 is a bispecific antibody fragment, but not a full-length bispecific antibody.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
