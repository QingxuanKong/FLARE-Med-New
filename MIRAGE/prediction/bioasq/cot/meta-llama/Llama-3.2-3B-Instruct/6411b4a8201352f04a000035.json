Prosopagnosia, also known as face blindness, is a condition where a person is unable to recognize familiar faces, including those of family members, friends, and even themselves. However, it is not related to auditory perception. It is a visual perception disorder that affects the ability to recognize and remember faces. Therefore, it is not related to the auditory system or the ability to recognize sounds. The correct answer is not related to auditory recognition but rather visual recognition of faces.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
