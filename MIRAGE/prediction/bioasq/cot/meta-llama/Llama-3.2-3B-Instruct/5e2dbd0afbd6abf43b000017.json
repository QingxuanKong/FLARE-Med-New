    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if pimavanserin is a typical antipsychotic, we need to understand the characteristics of typical antipsychotics and compare them to pimavanserin's pharmacological profile. Typical antipsychotics are a class of antipsychotic medications that are known for their strong dopamine D2 receptor antagonism, which is thought to contribute to their therapeutic effects in treating schizophrenia and other psychoses. They also tend to have a high affinity for the D2 receptor and are often used to treat conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Tourette's syndrome. Pimavanserin, on the other hand, is an inverse agonist of the 5-HT2A receptor, which is a subtype of serotonin receptor. It is primarily used to treat psychosis associated with Parkinson's disease, such as hallucinations and delusions. Pimavanserin works by decreasing the activity of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, rather than blocking it like typical antipsychotics. Given these differences, pimavanserin does not exhibit the typical characteristics of a typical antipsychotic, such as strong dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Therefore, it does not fit into the typical antipsychotic category.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
