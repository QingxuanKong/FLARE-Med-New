    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, I need to understand what CMB305 is and its potential applications in cancer treatment. CMB305 is a cancer immunotherapy, also known as a checkpoint inhibitor, which works by blocking a protein called CTLA-4 (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated protein 4) that helps to regulate the immune system. By blocking CTLA-4, CMB305 aims to enhance the immune system's ability to recognize and attack cancer cells.\\n\\nSarcomas are a type of cancer that originates from connective tissue, such as bone, cartilage, or fat. They are relatively rare and can be aggressive. Treatment options for sarcomas often involve surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.\\n\\nConsidering the mechanism of action of CMB305 and its use in other types of cancers, I will examine its potential effectiveness against sarcomas.\\n\\nResearch and clinical trials have shown that checkpoint inhibitors like CMB305 have shown promise in treating various types of cancer, including some sarcomas. For example, a clinical trial involving CMB305 (also known as ipilimumab) was conducted in patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma, a type of skin cancer, and showed significant improvement in overall survival.\\n\\nGiven this background, I believe that CMB305 may have potential against sarcomas, but its effectiveness and safety profile would need to be further evaluated in specific clinical trials targeting this type of cancer.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the available information, I would choose option A. yes, CMB305 may be used against sarcomas.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
