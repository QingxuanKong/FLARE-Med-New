    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if metoprolol is metabolized by CYP2D6, we need to understand the metabolic pathways of metoprolol and the role of CYP2D6 in drug metabolism. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker used to treat high blood pressure, angina, and certain heart-related conditions. It is primarily metabolized by the liver through the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. CYP2D6 is a specific subtype of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system that is involved in the metabolism of many drugs. However, metoprolol's metabolism is primarily attributed to CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, not CYP2D6. Therefore, based on the available information, metoprolol is not primarily metabolized by CYP2D6.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
