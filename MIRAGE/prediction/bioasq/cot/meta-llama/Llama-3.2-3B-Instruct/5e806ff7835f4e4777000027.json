    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine if ACE2 is expressed on cell surfaces, let's consider its function and characteristics.\\n\\nACE2 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), particularly in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. It is primarily known for its role in converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor.\\n\\nHowever, ACE2 has also been found to have a dual role, acting not only as an enzyme but also as a receptor for SARS-CoV, the virus that causes COVID-19. This dual role has led to increased interest in its expression and localization.\\n\\nResearch has shown that ACE2 is indeed expressed on the surface of various cells, including endothelial cells, alveolar cells, and certain immune cells. This surface expression is thought to facilitate the entry of SARS-CoV into these cells.\\n\\nGiven this information, the correct answer is that ACE2 is expressed on cell surfaces.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
