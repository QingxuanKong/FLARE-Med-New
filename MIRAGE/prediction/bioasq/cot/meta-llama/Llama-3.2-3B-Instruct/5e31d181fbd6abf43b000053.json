Firstly, Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder that is characterized by progressive damage to the brain, leading to cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and psychiatric problems. Secondly, Huntington's disease is known to be caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat in the HTT gene, not a CTG repeat. The HTT gene is located on chromosome 4. Thirdly, the expansion of the CAG repeat in the HTT gene leads to the production of an abnormal protein called huntingtin, which causes the symptoms of Huntington's disease. Therefore, based on this information, the correct answer is B. no, Huntington's disease is not caused by expansion of a CTG repeat in the HTT gene on Chromosome 4.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",
