    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine whether Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) is classified as a psychosomatic disorder, let's first define what a psychosomatic disorder is. A psychosomatic disorder refers to a condition where a physical symptom or disease is linked to a psychological or emotional factor, but the cause is not a direct result of a psychological disorder. Instead, it is often the result of a complex interplay between psychological, social, and biological factors. Functional Neurological Disorder (FND), also known as Conversion Disorder, is a condition where a person experiences neurological symptoms, such as weakness, tremors, or numbness, that cannot be explained by a medical condition or injury. These symptoms are often linked to psychological stress, trauma, or anxiety, but the exact cause is not always clear. Given this definition, FND shares some characteristics with psychosomatic disorders, but it is not exactly the same. While both involve a link between psychological factors and physical symptoms, FND is more focused on the loss of voluntary motor or sensory function, whereas psychosomatic disorders can encompass a broader range of symptoms. However, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) does classify FND as a psychogenic disorder, which is a category of disorders that are not caused by a medical condition, but are instead linked to psychological factors. Therefore, based on this classification, FND can be considered a psychosomatic disorder, albeit with some nuances.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
