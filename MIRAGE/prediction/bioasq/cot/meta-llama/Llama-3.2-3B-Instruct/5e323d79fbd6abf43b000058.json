    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break down the relationship between brain irradiation and secondary glioblastoma. 1. **Definition of Glioblastoma**: A glioblastoma is a type of primary brain tumor that originates from glial cells in the brain. Primary glioblastomas are typically aggressive and malignant. 2. **Definition of Secondary Glioblastoma**: A secondary glioblastoma, also known as a secondary glioblastoma or glioblastoma multiforme, is a type of brain tumor that develops in a person who has had previous radiation therapy to the brain. 3. **Radiation-Induced Secondary Tumors**: Radiation therapy is a common treatment for various cancers, including brain tumors. However, radiation can also cause DNA damage to normal cells, leading to the development of secondary tumors, including secondary glioblastomas. 4. **Mechanism of Radiation-Induced Secondary Glioblastoma**: When radiation is applied to the brain, it can cause DNA damage to the cells in the area where the radiation is applied. In some cases, this DNA damage can lead to the activation of oncogenes, which can promote the growth of new cells and the development of a secondary tumor. 5. **Clinical Evidence**: There is substantial clinical evidence that secondary glioblastomas can be caused by brain irradiation. Studies have shown that patients who have undergone radiation therapy to the brain are at increased risk of developing secondary glioblastomas. 6. **Conclusion**: Based on the understanding of the mechanisms of radiation-induced DNA damage and the clinical evidence, it is clear that secondary glioblastoma can be caused by brain irradiation. Therefore, the answer is: A. yes\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",
