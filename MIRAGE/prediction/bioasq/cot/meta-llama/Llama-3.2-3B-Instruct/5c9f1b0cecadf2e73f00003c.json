    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what protamines are and their role in the cell. Protamines are small, arginine-rich proteins that play a crucial role in the packaging of DNA in eukaryotic cells, particularly during the process of sperm maturation in males. They replace histones and help to condense the DNA into a more compact form, allowing for more efficient storage and transport of the genetic material during spermatogenesis. Given this specific function, it is unlikely that protamines are ubiquitously expressed across all cell types in the body. Instead, they are primarily expressed in cells involved in reproductive processes, such as sperm cells and, to a lesser extent, in certain types of stem cells. Therefore, based on their restricted expression pattern, it is reasonable to conclude that protamines are not ubiquitously expressed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",
