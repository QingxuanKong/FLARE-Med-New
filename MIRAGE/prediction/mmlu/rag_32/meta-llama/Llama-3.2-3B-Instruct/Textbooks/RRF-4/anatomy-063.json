The arterioles are high-resistance vessels of this system that regulate the distribution of flow to the various capillary beds. The aorta, the pulmonary artery, and their major branches have a large amount of elastin in their walls, which makes these vessels highly distensible (i.e., compliant).

            "content": "Fig. 17.31 . In the left ventricle, coronary perfusion pressure is the difference between aortic diastolic pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Left ventricular myocardial pressure (pressure within the wall of the left ventricle) is highest near the endocardium and lowest near the epicardium. This pressure gradient does not normally impair endocardial blood flow because the greater blood flow to the endocardium during diastole compensates for the greater blood flow to the epicardium during systole. Measurements of coronary blood flow indicate that the epicardial and endocardial halves of the left ventricle receive approximately equal blood flow under normal conditions. Because extravascular compression is greatest at the endocardial surface of the ventricle, the equality of epicardial and endocardial blood flow indicates that the tone of the endocardial resistance vessels is less than that of the epicardial vessels."
