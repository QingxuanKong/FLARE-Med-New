It is the structure that collects urine, but it is not the structure that transports urine out of the body. B. Kidney: The kidneys are paired organs that filter blood and produce urine. They do not collect urine, but rather produce it. C. Ureter: The ureters are narrow tubes that transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder. While they are involved in the urinary system, they do not collect urine in the body. D. Urethra: The urethra is the tube that carries urine out of the body from the bladder. It is the final structure in the urinary system, but it does not collect urine, it transports it out of the body. Given the options, the correct answer is A.

Three key concepts underlie these processes: 1. Urine is concentrated by AVP-dependent reabsorption of water from the collecting duct. 2. Reabsorption of NaCl from the ascending limb of Henle\u2019s loop dilutes the tubular fluid and at the same time generates a high [NaCl] in the medullary interstitium (up to 600 mmol/L at the tip of the papilla), which then drives water reabsorption from the collecting duct. 3. Urea accumulates in the medullary interstitium (up to 600 mmol/L), which allows the kidneys to excrete urine with the same high urea concentration. This allows large amounts of urea to be excreted with relatively little water. First, how the kidneys excrete dilute urine (water diure sis) when AVP levels are low or zero is considered.

The following factors should be measured: total volume, calcium, oxalate, citrate, uric acid, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, pH, and creatinine. When available, the calculated supersaturation is also informative. There is substantial day-to-day variability in the 24-h excretion of many relevant factors; therefore, obtaining values from two collections is important before committing a patient to long-term lifestyle changes or medication.

Medical Physiology. 2nd ed. Philadelphia: Saunders Elsevier; 2009.) medulla in the human kidney is divided into conical masses called renal pyramids. The base of each pyramid originates at the corticomedullary border, and the apex terminates in a papilla, which lies within a minor calyx. Minor calyces collect urine from each papilla. The numerous minor calyces expand into two or three open-ended pouches, the major calyces. The major calyces in turn feed into the pelvis. The pelvis represents the upper expanded region of the ureter, which carries urine from the pelvis to the urinary bladder. The walls of the calyces, pelvis, and ureters contain smooth muscle that contracts to propel the urine toward the urinary bladder."

The volume of urine excreted can be as much as 18 L/day, or approximately 10% of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

The following numbers refer to those encircled in Fig. 35.7B : 1\u20134. These steps are similar to those for production of dilute urine. An important point in understanding how a concentrated urine is produced is to recognize that while reabsorption of NaCl by the ascending thin and thick limbs of the loop of Henle dilutes the tubular fluid, the reabsorbed NaCl accumulates in the medullary interstitium and raises the osmolality of this compartment."

To distinguish a solute diuresis from a water diuresis and to determine whether the diuresis is appropriate for the clinical circumstances, urine osmolality is measured. The average person excretes between 600 and 800 mosmol of solutes per day, primarily as urea and electrolytes. If the urine output is >3 L/d and the urine is dilute (<250 mosmol/L), total mosmol excretion is normal and a water diuresis is present.

Plasma AVP levels then determine the amount of water reabsorbed by these segments. When AVP levels are low, a relatively small volume of water is reabsorbed by these segments and a large volume of hypoosmotic urine is excreted (up to 10% of the filtered water). When AVP levels are high, a large volume of water is reabsorbed by these same segments and a small volume of hyperosmotic urine is excreted (<1% of filtered water). During antidiuresis, most of the water is reabsorbed in the distal tubule and cortical and outer medullary portions of the collecting duct. Thus a relatively small volume of fluid reaches the inner medullary collecting duct where it is then reabsorbed. This distribution of water reabsorption along the length of the collecting"

Diagnosis can be made by measuring the level of glucose or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood. B. During periods of physiologic stress, the urine of an individual with T1D would likely test negative for reducing sugars. C. T1D is associated with obesity and a sedentary lifestyle. D. The characteristic metabolic abnormalities seen in T1D result from insensitivity to both insulin and glucagon. E. Treatment with exogenous insulin allows normalization of blood glucose (euglycemia). RQ2. DKA occurs when the rate of ketone body production is greater than the rate of utilization. Which of the following statements concerning ketone body metabolism is correct? Ketone bodies: A. are made in mitochondria from acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) primarily produced by the oxidation of glucose. B. are utilized by many tissues, particularly the liver, after conversion to acetyl CoA."

            "content": "The kidneys are paired organs that lie on the posterior wall of the abdomen behind the peritoneum on either side of the vertebral column. In an adult human, each kidney weighs between 115 and 170 g and is approximately 11 cm long, 6 cm wide, and 3 cm thick. The gross anatomical features of the human kidney are illustrated in Fig. 33.1 . The medial side of each kidney contains an indentation through which pass the renal artery and vein, nerves, and pelvis. If a kidney were cut in half, two regions would be evident: an outer region called the cortex and an inner region called the medulla. The cortex and medulla are composed of nephrons (the functional units of the kidney), blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. The Kidney disease is a major health problem worldwide. In the United States alone: CKD affects over 23 million patients and accounts for more than 90,000 deaths annually. Kidney diseases represent the ninth leading cause of death."

What are the mechanisms involved in formation of edema, and what role do the kidneys play in this process? he kidneys maintain the osmolality and volume of the body fluids within a narrow range by regulating excretion of water and NaCl, respectively. This chapter discusses the regulation of renal water excretion (urine concentration and dilution) and NaCl excretion. The composition and volumes of the various body fluid compartments are reviewed in"
