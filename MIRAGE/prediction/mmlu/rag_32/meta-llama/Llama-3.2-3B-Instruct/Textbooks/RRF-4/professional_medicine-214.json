The wife's gynecologist has reported that her anatomic and physiologic evaluation disclosed no abnormalities and that assessment of potential male factors is needed. The husband is 188 cm (6 ft 3 in) tall with fair skin and little facial hair. He has mild gynecomastia and small, firm testicles. No sperm are seen on semen analysis.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a history of infertility, and the physical examination reveals mild gynecomastia, small firm testicles, and no sperm on semen analysis. These findings suggest a potential issue with androgen production or testosterone levels, which could be related to hypogonadism. The patient's height and lack of facial hair also support this suspicion. The most likely underlying cause of the patient's infertility is a hormonal imbalance, particularly hypogonadism. To establish the underlying cause of this couple's infertility, we need to assess the patient's hormonal levels. The most relevant test would be to measure serum testosterone and estrogen concentrations, as these hormones play a crucial role in male fertility. Measuring serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations may also be helpful, but these tests are not as directly relevant to the patient's symptoms. A karyotype from peripheral leukocytes may be useful in identifying chromosomal abnormalities, but it is not the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Measuring serum prolactin concentration may be helpful in ruling out hyperprolactinemia, but it is not as directly related to the patient's symptoms as measuring testosterone and estrogen levels.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The first is the result of a WHO study of 7,057 men with complete diagnoses based on the WHO standard investigation of the infertile couple (54). The figures include data from cases in which the male partner was normal and the presumed cause of the couple\u2019s infertility was a female factor. The second distribution is the result of a study of 425 subfertile male patients (54).

The physical examination of the woman should be thorough, with particular attention given to height, weight, body habitus, hair distribution, thyroid gland, and pelvic examination. Referral of the male partner to a urologist for examination often is beneficial if historic information or subsequent evaluation suggests an abnormality.

The range of required investigations should be reviewed as well as a brief description of infertility treatment options, including adoption. Initial investigations are focused on determining whether the primary cause of the infertility is male, female, or both. These investigations include a semen analysis in the male, confirmation of ovulation in the female, and, in the majority of situations, documentation of tubal patency in the female. In some cases, after an extensive workup excluding all male and female factors, a specific cause cannot be identified, and infertility may ultimately be classified as unexplained."

Both criteria were developed using fertile men whose semen parameters were in the lowest fifth percentile of the group studied, but values above the reference ranges do not guarantee male fertility. Furthermore, since infertile men were not used to develop the criteria, values below the cutoffs may not necessarily indicate infertility (30). However, significant deviations from the reference limits are generally classified as male factor infertility (44).

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min).

In 2002, over 7 million US women age 22 to 44 reported using infertility services in their lifetimes (7). Once diagnosed, 13% of couples will not pursue treatment (8). The diagnosis of impaired fecundity has been rising, reaching 15% in 2002 and largely resulting from the trend toward delayed childbearing in developed countries (3). Worldwide, male factor accounts for 51.2% and tubal blockage for 25% to 35% of infertility and subfertility (conception after attempting for 1 year) (9,10). In Europe, ovulatory dysfunction accounts for 21% to 32%, male factor 19% to 57%, tubal factor 14% to 26%, unexplained 8% to 30%, endometriosis 4% to 6%, and combined male and female factors 34.4% of infertility (11\u201313).

The decline in fecundability begins in the early 30s and accelerates during the late 30s and early 40s. Disorders of ovulation account for about 20% to 40% of all cases of female infertility. These disorders are generally among the most easily diagnosed and treatable causes of infertility. The most common cause of oligo-ovulation and anovulation\u2014both in the general population and among women presenting with infertility\u2014is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Tubal and peritoneal factors account for 30% to 40% of cases of female infertility. Cervical factor is estimated to be a cause of infertility in no more than 5% of infertile couples. Uterine pathologies constitute the etiologic factor in infertility in as many as 15% of couples seeking treatment and are diagnosed in as many as 50% of infertile patients. Leiomyomas have not been shown to be a direct cause of infertility."

He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications?
