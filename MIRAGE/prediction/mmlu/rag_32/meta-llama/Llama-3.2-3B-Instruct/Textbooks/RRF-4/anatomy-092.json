    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's consider the anatomy of the larynx and the characteristics of laryngeal edema. The larynx is divided into three main regions: the supraglottis, glottis, and subglottis. The glottis is the area between the vocal folds and is the site of vocal cord vibration to produce sound. The vocal folds are located below the level of the vocal ligament and are separated from the supraglottic region by the false vocal cords and the ventricle. Laryngeal edema, also known as vocal cord edema, typically occurs due to inflammation or irritation of the larynx. Considering the anatomy, the supraglottic region, which includes the false vocal cords and the ventricle, is less likely to be affected by laryngeal edema because it is above the level of the vocal folds. The mucosa above the vocal folds is more vascular than that below the vocal folds, which means that edema is more likely to drain rapidly into the thorax below the vocal folds, rather than being confined to the larynx above the vocal folds. Therefore, the correct answer is D. the mucosa above the vocal folds is more vascular than that below the vocal folds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

As acute laryngitis is caused predominantly by respiratory viruses, these symptoms usually occur in association with other symptoms and signs of URI, including rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, cough, and sore throat. Direct laryngoscopy often reveals diffuse laryngeal erythema and edema, along with vascular engorgement of the vocal folds. In addition, chronic disease (e.g., tuberculous laryngitis) often includes mucosal nodules and ulcerations visible on laryngoscopy; these lesions are sometimes mistaken for laryngeal cancer."

For example, about 90% of glottic tumors are confined to the larynx at diagnosis. First, as a result of interference with vocal cord mobility, they develop symptoms early in the course of disease; second, the glottic region has a sparse lymphatic supply, and spread beyond the larynx is uncommon. By contrast, the supraglottic larynx is rich in lymphatic spaces, and nearly one-third of these tumors metastasize to regional (cervical) lymph nodes. The subglottic tumors tend to remain clinically quiescent, usually manifesting as advanced disease. With surgery, radiation therapy, or combination treatment, many patients can be cured, but about one-third die of the disease. The usual cause of death is widespread metastases and cachexia, sometimes complicated by pulmonary infection."

Injury to one RLN leads to paralysis of the ipsilateral vocal cord, which comes to lie in the parame-dian or the abducted position. The paramedian position results in a normal but weak voice, whereas the abducted position leads to a hoarse voice and an ineffective cough. Bilateral RLN injury may lead to airway obstruction, necessitating emergency trache-ostomy, or loss of voice. If both cords come to lie in an abducted position, air movement can occur, but the patient has an ineffec-tive cough and is at increased risk of repeated respiratory tract infections"

            "content": "The free margin between these two points of attachment is thickened to form the vocal ligament, which is under the vocal fold (true vocal cord) of the larynx. The conus elasticus is also thickened anteriorly in the midline to form a distinct median cricothyroid ligament, which spans the distance between the arch of cricoid cartilage and the inferior thyroid notch and adjacent deep surface of the thyroid cartilage up to the attachment of the vocal ligaments. In emergency situations, when the airway is blocked above the level of the vocal folds, the median cricothyroid ligament can be perforated to establish an airway. Except for small vessels and the occasional presence of a pyramidal lobe of the thyroid gland, normally there are few structures between the median cricothyroid ligament and skin."

            "content": "Its posterior border in the midline is formed by a mucosal fold that forms a depression (interarytenoid notch) between the two corniculate tubercles. The inferior opening of the laryngeal cavity is continuous with the lumen of the trachea, is completely encircled by the cricoid cartilage, and is horizontal in position unlike the laryngeal inlet, which is oblique and points posterosuperiorly into the pharynx. In addition, the inferior opening is continuously open, whereas the laryngeal inlet can be closed by downward movement of the epiglottis. Two pairs of mucosal folds, the vestibular and vocal folds, which project medially from the lateral walls of the laryngeal cavity, constrict it and divide it into three major regions\u2014the vestibule, a middle chamber, and the infraglottic cavity (Fig. 8.221B): The vestibule is the upper chamber of the laryngeal cavity between the laryngeal inlet and the vestibular folds, which encloses the vestibular ligaments and associated soft tissues."

            "content": "The vocalis muscles adjust tension in the vocal folds and are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal branches of the vagus nerves [X]. The two thyro-arytenoid muscles are broad flat muscles lateral to the fibro-elastic membrane of the larynx and the laryngeal ventricles and saccules (Fig. 8.224). Each muscle runs from a vertical line of origin on the lower half of the thyroid angle and adjacent external surface of the cricothyroid ligament to the anterolateral surface of the arytenoid cartilage. Some of the fibers may continue into the ary-epiglottic fold and reach the margin of the epiglottis. These fibers are the thyro-epiglottic part of the muscle."
