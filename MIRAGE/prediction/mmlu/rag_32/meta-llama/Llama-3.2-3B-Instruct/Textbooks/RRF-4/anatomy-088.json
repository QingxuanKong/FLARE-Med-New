The middle meatus is a channel in the lateral wall of the nasal cavity that receives drainage from multiple sinuses. According to the provided documents, the middle meatus is associated with the superior meatus, which drains the sphenoid and posterior ethmoid sinuses, the middle meatus, which drains the frontal, maxillary, and anterior ethmoid sinuses, and the inferior meatus, which drains the nasolacrimal duct. Based on this information, we can conclude that the sinuses that open into the middle meatus are the frontal, maxillary, and anterior ethmoidal sinuses. The sphenoidal sinus does not drain into the middle meatus, but rather into the superior meatus. Therefore, the correct answer is the option that includes the anterior ethmoidal, frontal, and maxillary sinuses.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

These conchae increase the surface area of contact between tissues of the lateral wall and the respired air. The openings of the paranasal sinuses, which are extensions of the nasal cavity that erode into the surrounding bones during childhood and early adulthood, are on the lateral wall and roof of the nasal cavities (Fig. 8.231). In addition, the lateral wall also contains the opening of the nasolacrimal duct, which drains tears from the eye into the nasal cavity.

Each sinus is lined with a respiratory epithelium that produces mucus, which is transported out by ciliary action through the sinus ostium and into the nasal cavity. Normally, mucus does not accumulate in the sinuses, which remain mostly sterile despite their adjacency to the bacterium-filled nasal passages. When the sinus ostia are obstructed or when ciliary clearance is impaired or absent, the secretions can be retained, producing the typical signs and symptoms of sinusitis.

The identifying feature of the olfactory region of the nasal mucosa in a histologic preparation is the presence of the olfactory nerves in combination with olfactory glands in the lamina propria. The nerves are particularly conspicuous because of the relatively large diameter of the individual unmyelinated fibers that they contain (see Figs. 19.3 and 19.4). Paranasal sinuses are air-filled spaces in the bones of the walls of the nasal cavity."

If equalization fails, pain usually results in termination of the dive. Difficulty with equalizing ears or sinuses may respond to oral or nasal decongestants."
