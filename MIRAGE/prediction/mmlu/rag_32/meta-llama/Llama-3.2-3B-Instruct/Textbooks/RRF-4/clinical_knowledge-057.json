Systole is the contraction phase of the heart, where the heart muscle contracts and pumps blood out of the heart. The question does not mention a third phase called'rest', so option A and B are incorrect. Option D is also incorrect because contraction is not a separate phase of the cardiac cycle.

This term is appropriate because ventricular volume remains constant during this brief period (see Fig. 16.39 ). The onset of isovolumic contraction also coincides with the peak of the R wave on an ECG, initiation of the first heart sound, and the earliest rise in ventricular pressure on the ventricular pressure curve after atrial contraction. Opening of the semilunar valves marks the onset of the ventricular ejection phase, which may be subdivided dWith inspiration, intrathoracic pressure is reduced (see Chapter 21), which then increases venous blood flow to the right atrium."

As a consequence, as the basic cycle length diminishes, each action potential tends to occur earlier in the inactivation period of the iK current initiated by the preceding action potential. Therefore, the shorter the basic cycle length, the greater the outward K+ current during phase 2 and hence the shorter the action potential duration. The ito current also influences the relationship between cycle length and action potential duration. The ito current is also activated at near zero potential, and its magnitude varies inversely with cardiac frequency. Therefore, as cycle length decreases, the consequent increase in the outward K+ current shortens the plateau. Natural Excitation of the Heart and the Electrocardiogram"

DADs appear late in phase 3 or in phase 4. They are more likely to occur when the basic cycle length of the initiating beats is short and when the cardiac cells are overloaded with Ca++ . 6.

Blood flow occurs as follows: The ventricles of the heart pump blood into the elastic arteries during systole (the contraction phase of the cardiac cycle). The pressure generated by contraction of the ventricles moves the blood through the elastic arteries and along the arterial tree. Simultaneously, it also causes the wall of the large elastic arteries to distend. The distension is limited by the network of collagenous fibers in the tunica media and tunica adventitia (Fig. 13.14). During diastole (the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle), when no pressure is generated by the heart, the recoil of the distended elastic arteries serves to maintain arterial blood pressure and the flow of blood within the vessels.

At slow heart rates, filling practically ceases toward the end of diastasis, and atrial contraction contributes little additional filling. During tachycardia, however, diastasis is abbreviated and the atrial contribution can become substantial. Should tachycardia become so severe that the rapid filling phase is attenuated, atrial contraction assumes great importance in rapidly propelling blood into the ventricle during this brief period of the cardiac cycle. If the period of ventricular relaxation is so brief that filling is seriously impaired, even atrial contraction cannot provide adequate ventricular filling.

Phase 3: Final repolarization is initiated when the efflux of K+ exceeds the influx of Ca++ . The resultant partial repolarization rapidly increases K+ conductance and restores full repolarization. Phase 4: The resting potential of the fully repolarized cell is determined by conductance of the cell membrane to K+ , mainly through iK1 channels."

            "content": "For renewing cell populations and growing cell populations, including embryonic cells, and cells in tissue culture, the goal of the cell cycle is to produce two daughter cells, each containing chromosomes identical to those of the parental cell. The cell cycle incorporates two principal phases: the interphase, representing continuous growth of the cell, and the M phase (mitosis), characterized by the partition of the genome. Three other phases, G1 (gap1) phase, S (synthesis) phase, and G2 (gap2) phase, further subdivide interphase (Fig. 3.10). Rapidly renewing populations of human cells progress through the full cell cycle in about 24 hours. Throughout the cycle, several internal quality-control mechanisms or checkpoints represented by biochemical pathways control transition between cell-cycle stages. The cell cycle stops at several checkpoints and can only proceed if certain conditions are met\u2014for example, if the cell has reached a certain size. Checkpoints monitor and modulate the"

            "content": "prevents a sustained, tetanic contraction of cardiac muscle, which would retard ventricular relaxation and therefore interfere with the normal intermittent pumping action of the heart. As the cell repolarizes (phase 3), the inactivated channels begin to transition to the closed state. During this period, called the relative refractory period, another action potential can be generated, but it requires a larger-than-normal depolarization of Vm. Only when Vm has returned to the resting level (phase 4) are all the sodium channels closed and thus able to be reactivated by the normal depolarization of Vm."
