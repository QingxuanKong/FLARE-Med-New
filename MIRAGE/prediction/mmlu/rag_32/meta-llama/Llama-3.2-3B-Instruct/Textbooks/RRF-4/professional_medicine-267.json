Slight deviation of the protruded tongue as a solitary finding can usually be disregarded, but a major deviation represents under action of the hypoglossal nerve and muscle on that side. The pronunciation of words should be noted. The jaw jerk (masseter tendon reflex) should be evaluated in order to localize the source of dysphagia, dysarthria, or dysphonia.

When the initial denervation involves bulbar rather than limb muscles, the problem at onset is difficulty with chewing, swallowing, and movements of the face and tongue. Early involvement of the muscles of respiration may lead to death before the disease is far advanced elsewhere. With prominent corticospinal involvement, there is hyperactivity of the muscle-stretch reflexes (tendon jerks) and, often, spastic resistance to passive movements of the affected limbs. Patients with significant reflex hyperactivity complain of muscle stiffness often out of proportion to weakness. Degeneration of the corticobulbar projections innervating the brainstem results in dysarthria and exaggeration of the motor expressions of emotion. The latter leads to involuntary excess in weeping or laughing (pseudobulbar affect)."

The symptoms generally appear over hours or days, at times being so trifling that they are ignored, and other times coming on so acutely and prominently as to bring the patient urgently to the doctor. The resulting clinical syndromes vary from a mere dragging or poor control of one or both legs to a spastic or ataxic paraparesis. The tendon reflexes are retained and later become hyperactive with extensor plantar reflexes; varying degrees of deep and superficial sensory loss may be associated.

Hypotonia accompanies the weakness, and because passive displacement of articulated parts in testing muscle tone is easier to judge than power of contraction at this early age, it may be singled out as the dominant clinical characteristic. As a rule, the tendon reflexes are unobtainable. Volume of muscle is diminished but is difficult to evaluate in the infant because of the coverings of adipose tissue.

The proximal shoulder and hip musculature are involved first by weakness and atrophy, followed in about half of patients by dysarthria and dysphagia.

This weakness gives rise to an early defect in articulation, in which there is difficulty in the pronunciation of lingual (r, n, l), labial (b, m, p, f), dental (d, t), and palatal (k, g) consonants. As the condition worsens, syllables lose their clarity and run together, until, finally, the patient\u2019s speech becomes unintelligible.

However, the time of appearance and degree of spasticity are variable from child to child. The stretch reflexes are hyperactive, and the plantar reflex may be extensor on the affected side. With bilateral hemiplegia, the same abnormalities are detectable, but there is a greater likelihood of pseudobulbar manifestations, with delayed, poorly enunciated speech."

            "content": "Psychogenic paralysis may involve one arm or leg, both legs, or all of one side of the body. Tendon reflexes are of normal amplitude, there is no Babinski sign, and atrophy is lacking, features that distinguish it from chronic lower motor neuron disease. Diagnostic difficulty arises only in certain acute cases of upper motor neuron disease that lack the usual changes in reflexes and muscle tone. Sometimes there is loss of sensation in the paralyzed parts and loss of sight, hearing, and smell on the paralyzed side\u2014a pattern of sensory changes that cannot be explained on the basis of organic disease of the nervous system. When the hysterical patient is asked to move the affected limbs, the movements tend to be slow, hesitant, and jerky, often with contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles simultaneously and intermittently (\u201cgive-way\u201d weakness). Lack of effort is usually obvious, despite facial and other expressions to the contrary. Power of contraction improves with encouragement"

            "content": "On physical examination, pain induced by straight leg raising, neck flexion, or vertebral percussion may help to determine the level of cord compression. Patients develop numbness and paresthesias in the extremities or trunk. Loss of sensibility to pinprick is as common as loss of sensibility to vibration or position. The upper limit of the zone of sensory loss is often one or two vertebrae below the site of compression. Motor findings include weakness, spasticity, and abnormal muscle stretching. An extensor plantar reflex reflects significant compression. Deep tendon reflexes may be brisk. Motor and sensory loss usually precedes sphincter disturbance. Patients with autonomic dysfunction may present with decreased anal tonus, decreased perineal sensibility, and a distended bladder. The absence of the anal wink reflex or the bulbocavernosus reflex confirms cord involvement. In doubtful cases, evaluation of postvoiding urinary residual volume can be helpful. A residual volume of >150 mL"

            "content": "The uppermost level of a spinal cord lesion can also be localized by attention to the segmental signs corresponding to disturbed motor or sensory innervation by an individual cord segment. A band of altered sensation (hyperalgesia or hyperpathia) at the upper end of the sensory disturbance, fasciculations or atrophy in muscles innervated by one or several segments, or a muted or absent deep tendon reflex may be noted at this level. These signs also can occur with focal root or peripheral nerve disorders; thus, they are most useful when they occur together with signs of long tract damage. With severe and acute transverse lesions, the limbs initially may be flaccid rather than spastic. This state of \u201cspinal shock\u201d lasts for several days, rarely for weeks, and may be mistaken for extensive damage to the anterior horn cells over many segments of the cord or for an acute polyneuropathy. The main features of transverse damage at each level of the spinal cord are summarized below."
