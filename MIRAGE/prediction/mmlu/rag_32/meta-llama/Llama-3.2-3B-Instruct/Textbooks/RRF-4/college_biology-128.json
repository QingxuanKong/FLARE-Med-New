Root pressure is a type of negative pressure that is generated by the roots of plants as they grow. This pressure is created by the turgor pressure of the root cells, which is the result of water entering the cells through osmosis. As the root grows downward, the turgor pressure increases, causing water to flow out of the cells and into the root cortex. This creates a negative pressure that pulls water up the root through a process called translocation. The correct answer is A. translocation. Translocation is the movement of substances, in this case, water, from one part of the plant to another, often through the xylem. It is the result of the root pressure created by the turgor pressure of the root cells. \"answer_choice\": \"A\"",

A cell can rapidly redistribute transporters by controlling the traffic of vesicles containing them. The auxin efflux transporters, for example, normally recycle between intracellular vesicles and the plasma membrane. A cell can redistribute these transporters on its surface by inhibiting their endocytosis in one domain of the plasma membrane, causing the transporters to accumulate there. One example occurs in the root, where gravity influences the direction of growth. The auxin efflux transporters are normally distributed symmetrically in the cap cells of the root. Within minutes of a change in the direction of the gravity vector, however, the efflux transporters redistribute to one side of the cells, so that auxin is pumped out toward the side of the root pointing downward. Because auxin inhibits root-cell elongation, this redirection"

Although the fluid in the plant cell wall contains more solutes than does the water in the plant\u2019s external milieu (for example, soil), it is still hypotonic in comparison with the cell interior. This osmotic imbalance causes the cell to develop a large internal hydrostatic pressure, or turgor pressure, which pushes outward on the cell wall, just as an inner tube pushes outward on a tire. The turgor pressure increases just to the point where the cell is in osmotic equilibrium, with no net influx of water despite the salt imbalance. The turgor pressure generated in this way may reach 10 or more atmospheres, about five times that in the average car tire. This pressure is vital to plants because it is the main driving force for cell expansion during growth, and it provides much of the mechanical rigidity of living plant tissues.

The manner of this expansion determines the final shape of each cell, and hence the final form of the plant as a whole. Turgor pressure inside the cell drives the expansion, but it is the behavior of the cell wall that governs its direction and extent. Complex wall-remodeling activities are required, as well as the deposition of new wall materials. Because of their crystalline structure, the individual cellulose microfibrils in the wall are unable to stretch, and this gives them a crucial role in the process. For the cell wall to stretch or deform, the microfibrils must either slide past one another or become more widely separated, or both. The orientation of the microfibrils in the innermost layers of the wall governs the direction in which the cell expands. Cells in plants therefore anticipate their future morphology by controlling the"

            "content": "The driving force for this water movement is an osmotic pressure difference. The osmotic pressure of both the ICF and ECF is determined by the molecules/ions present in these fluids. For simplicity, these can be divided into (1) molecules of low molecular weight (e.g., glucose) and ions (e.g., Na+) and (2) macromolecules (e.g., proteins). The osmotic pressures of both the ICF and ECF are in the range of 280 to 295 mOsm/kg H2O. For the ECF, the low-molecular-weight molecules and ions account for nearly all of this pressure because the osmotic pressure contributed by proteins is only 1 to 2 mOsm/kg H2O. The molecules/ions contributing to the osmotic pressure within the cell are less well understood, but they also include low-molecular-weight molecules (e.g., glucose), ions (e.g., Na+), and macromolecules (e.g., proteins). The fact that cell volume remains constant when ECF osmolality is constant means that the osmotic pressure inside the cells is equal to that of the ECF. If an osmotic"
