Lipidation is a process where a lipid molecule is attached to a protein, which can modify its function or localization. This process can occur after translation has occurred, so it is a valid method of modifying protein structure.\\n\\nNext, let's consider option B: Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds. This process is actually the opposite of what we're looking for, as it involves adding more amino acids to the existing protein chain, rather than modifying the structure of the protein after translation.\\n\\nNow, let's examine option C: Glycosylation. Glycosylation is a process where a carbohydrate molecule is attached to the protein, which can modify its function or localization. Like lipidation, glycosylation can occur after translation has occurred, so it is a valid method of modifying protein structure.\\n\\nFinally, let's look at option D: Phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is a process where a phosphate group is added to a protein, which can modify its activity or localization. This process can occur after translation has occurred, so it is also a valid method of modifying protein structure.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds, as it is the only option that does not modify protein structure after translation has occurred.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The site at which protein synthesis begins on the mRNA is especially crucial, since it sets the reading frame for the whole length of the message. An error of one nucleotide either way at this stage would cause every subsequent codon in the message to be misread, resulting in a nonfunctional protein with a garbled sequence of amino acids. The initiation step is also important because for most genes it is the last point at which the cell can decide whether the mRNA is to be translated to produce a protein. The rate of this step is thus one determinant of the rate at which any particular protein will be synthesized. We shall see in Chapter 7 how regulation of this step occurs."

An incorrect codonanticodon interaction in the P site of the ribosome (which would occur after the misincorporation) causes an increased rate of misreading in the A site. Successive rounds of amino acid misincorporation eventually lead to premature termination of the protein by release factors, which are described below. Normally, these release factors act when translation of a protein is complete; here, they act early. Although this mechanism does not correct the original error, it releases the flawed protein for degradation, ensuring that no additional peptide synthesis is wasted on it."

STEPS IN TRANSLATION The process of protein synthesis translates the 3-letter alphabet of nucleotide sequences on mRNA into the 20-letter alphabet of amino acids that constitute proteins. The mRNA is translated from its 5\u2032-end to its 3\u2032-end, producing a protein synthesized from its amino (N)-terminal end to its carboxyl (C)-terminal end. Prokaryotic mRNA often have several coding regions (that is, they are polycistronic; see p. 434). Each coding region has its own initiation and termination codon and produces a separate species of polypeptide. In contrast, each eukaryotic mRNA has only one coding region (that is, it is monocistronic). The process of translation is divided into three separate steps: initiation, elongation, and termination. Eukaryotic translation resembles that of prokaryotes in most aspects. Individual differences are noted in the text."

The dimensions of the tunnel suggest that nascent proteins are largely unstructured as they pass through the ribosome, although some \u03b1-helical regions of the protein can form before leaving the ribosome tunnel.

The translation of genetic information from the 4-letter alphabet of polynucleotides into the 20-letter alphabet of proteins is a complex process. The rules of this translation seem in some respects neat and rational but in other respects strangely arbitrary, given that they are (with minor exceptions) identical in all living things.

            "content": "Although approximately 90% of eukaryotic mRNAs are translated beginning with the first AUG downstream from the 5\u02b9 cap, certain AUGs, as we saw in the previous section, can be skipped over during the scanning process. In this section, we discuss yet another way that cells can initiate translation at positions distant from the 5\u02b9 end of the mRNA, using a specialized type of RNA sequence called an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). In some cases, two distinct protein-coding sequences are carried in tandem on the same eukaryotic mRNA; translation of the first occurs by the usual scanning mechanism, and translation of the second occurs through an IRES. IRESs are typically several hundred nucleotides in length and fold into specific structures that bind many, but not all, of the same proteins that are used to initiate normal 5\u02b9 cap-dependent translation (Figure 7\u201368). In fact, different IRESs require different subsets of initiation factors. However, all of them bypass the need for a 5\u02b9"

            "content": "from Macmillan Publishers Ltd.) translating damaged or incompletely processed mRNAs (which would produce truncated or otherwise aberrant proteins) is apparently so great that the cell has several backup measures to prevent this from happening. To avoid translating broken mRNAs, for example, the 5\u02b9 cap and the poly-A tail are both recognized by the translation-initiation machinery before translation begins (see Figure 6\u201370)."

            "content": "This four-step cycle is repeated each time an amino acid is added to the polypeptide chain, as the chain grows from its amino to its carboxyl end. The basic cycle of polypeptide elongation shown in outline in Figure 6\u201364 has an additional feature that makes translation especially efficient and accurate. Two elongation factors enter and leave the ribosome during each cycle, each hydrolyzing GTP to GDP and undergoing conformational changes in the process. These factors are called EF-Tu and EF-G in bacteria, and EF1 and EF2 in eukaryotes. Under some conditions in vitro, ribosomes can be forced to synthesize proteins"

How to translate a codon: This table can be used to translate any codon and, thus, to determine which amino acids are coded for by an mRNA sequence. For example, the codon AUG codes for methionine ([Met] see Fig. 32.2). [Note: AUG is the initiation (start) codon for translation.] Sixty-one of the 64 codons code for the 20 standard amino acids (see p. 1). 2. Termination codons: Three of the codons, UAA, UAG, and UGA, do not code for amino acids but, rather, are termination (also called stop, or nonsense) codons. When one of these codons appears in an mRNA sequence, synthesis of the polypeptide coded for by that mRNA stops. B. Characteristics"

Proteins consisting of one polypeptide have quaternary structure that is stabilized by covalent bonds. B. The peptide bonds that link amino acids in a protein most commonly occur in the cis configuration. C. The formation of a disulfide bond in a protein requires the participating cysteine residues to be adjacent in the primary structure. D. The denaturation of proteins leads to irreversible loss of secondary structural elements such as the \u03b1-helix. E. The primary driving force for protein folding is the hydrophobic effect."
