If she becomes sensitized, it could lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) in a future Rh-positive fetus. The risk of sensitization is higher in Rh-negative women who have had a previous pregnancy loss or abortion. Given that the patient has had one previous spontaneous abortion, the risk of sensitization is higher. RhoGAM (Rh immune globulin) is recommended to prevent sensitization and subsequent HDN in a future Rh-positive fetus. The patient's blood group is O, Rh-negative, and the father's blood group is B, Rh-positive, which increases the risk of sensitization. Therefore, the physician's recommendation to administer RhoGAM to the patient is appropriate to prevent the development of antibodies to RhD.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The dose of RhoGAM (300 \u03bcg) is based on the ability of this amount of anti-Rh-positive antibody to bind all the possible fetal Rh-positive erythrocytes entering the maternal circulation during the fetal-to-maternal transfusion at birth (approximately 30 mL). RhoGAM may bind Rh-positive fetal erythrocytes or interfere with maternal anti-Rh-positive antibody production by another, unknown mechanism. RhoGAM is effective only in preventing sensitization to the D antigen. Other blood group antigens that can cause immune hydrops and erythroblastosis include Rh C, E, Kell, and Duffy. Anti-Kell alloimmunity produces lower amniotic bilirubin levels and a lower reticulocyte count because, in addition to hemolysis, it inhibits erythropoiesis."

            "content": "Spontaneous Abortion Spontaneous abortion is a pathologic process resulting in unintentional termination of the pregnancy prior to 20 weeks\u2019 gestation. About 8% to 20% of known pregnancies terminate in spontaneous abortion (2,3). About 80% of spontaneous pregnancy losses occur in the first trimester; the incidence decreases with each gestational week (4\u20136). In women who had one prior spontaneous abortion, the rate of spontaneous abortion in a subsequent pregnancy ranges from 13% to 20%; in women who had three consecutive losses, the rate is 33% (7). Patients should be reassured that, in most cases, spontaneous abortion does not recur. In women less than 36 years of age, when fetal cardiac activity is confirmed by ultrasound, the risk of spontaneous abortion is less than 4.5%. For women older than 36, the risk of spontaneous abortion rises to 10%, and above 40 years may approach 30% (8). Risk factors for spontaneous abortion include increasing maternal age, closely spaced pregnancies"

Most patients have crampy lower abdominal pain, and some have cervical motion or adnexal tenderness. When it is certain that the pregnancy is not viable because the cervical os is dilated or excessive bleeding is present, the patient should be offered medical or surgical management. Blood type and Rh determination and a complete blood count should be obtained if there is any concern about the amount of bleeding. Rh0(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM) should be given if the patient\u2019s blood is Rh negative (22). It is acceptable to give a dose of 50 \u03bcg until 12 completed weeks; if this dose is not available, the standard 300 \u03bcg dose may be given."
