According to Document [0], LHON is a maternally inherited mitochondrial disorder.

Document [5] mentions that LHON is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Additionally, Document [24] explicitly states that Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, a condition similar to LHON, is caused by a mutation in mtDNA.

As the number of identified pathogenic genetic variations increases, it becomes more challenging to match specific phenotypes and genotypes. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, a maternally inherited mitochondrial disorder, is an infrequent but important cause of blindness that usually presents in young adults. It may simulate the more common inflammatory optic neuropathies that also cause a relatively abrupt onset of visual loss, and in some cases also shows some degree of recovery (see \u201cHereditary Optic Atrophy of Leber\u201d in Chap. 36). The visual field defect typically takes the form of a severe cecocentral scotoma."

In some instances, cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and cardiac conduction defects are observed. In >95% of cases, LHON is due to one of three homoplasmic point mutations of mtDNA that affect genes encoding different subunits of complex I of the mitochondrial ETC; however, not all individuals who inherit a primary LHON mtDNA mutation develop optic neuropathy, and males are four to five times more likely than females to be affected, indicating that additional environmental (e.g., tobacco exposure) or genetic factors are important in the etiology of the disorder.

The family studies of Nikoskelainen and coworkers indicate that all daughters of carrier mothers become carriers themselves, a type of transmission that is determined by inheritance of defective mitochondrial DNA from the mother (Wallace et al). Common to all cases is the presence of a pathogenic mitochondrial DNA abnormality (Riordan-Eva et al), but the defect may occur at one of several sites as discussed in Chap. 36. Thus, Leber optic atrophy has been added to the growing list of mitochondrial diseases. Variants in approximately 20 genes have been detected, together accounting for about half of cases."

            "content": "Because the unique function of mitochondria is the production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation, it is not surprising that many of the genes contained in mitochondria code for proteins in the respiratory chain. However, there is not always concordance between the error in the mitochondrial genome and the enzymatic defect that leads to disease. Of the five complexes that make up the respiratory chain, cytochrome-c oxidase (complex IV) is the one most often disordered, and its deficient function gives rise to lactic acidosis, a feature common to many of the mitochondrial disorders (see further on). In keeping with the mutable nature of this class of disorders, it is thought that some cases of complex IV defect are autosomally transmitted. Complex I defects, which originate in mitochondrial mutations, are seen, for example, in Leber optic atrophy. A more complete account of the disorders of the mitochondrial respiratory chain can be found in the review by Leonard and Schapira."

Unlike the optic atrophy of Leber, which affects only the third neuron of the visual neuronal chain, retinitis pigmentosa affects all the retinal layers, both the neuroepithelium and pigment epithelium (see Fig. 12-2). The incidence of this disorder is 2 or 3 times greater in males than in females. Inheritance is more often autosomal recessive than dominant; in the former, consanguinity plays an important part, increasing the likelihood of the disease by approximately 20 times. Sex-linked types are also known. It is estimated that 100,000 Americans are afflicted with this disease. Mutations in approximately 60 genes have been associated with the disorder but the most commonly affected in autosomal dominant cases is RHO; in recessive cases, USH2A, and in X-linked cases, RPGR and RP2."

            "content": "Degenerations of the retina are important causes of chronic progressive visual loss. The retinal degenerations assume several forms and can be associated with progressive conditions of the brain or other organs. The most frequent degeneration in youth and middle age is retinitis pigmentosa, a hereditary disease of the outer photoreceptor layer and subjacent pigment epithelium. The retina is thin, and there are fine deposits of black pigment in the shape of bone corpuscles, more in the periphery; later the optic discs become atrophic (described as \u201cwaxy pallor\u201d). The disorder is marked by constriction of the visual fields with relative sparing of central vision (\u201cgun-barrel\u201d vision), metamorphopsia (distorted vision), delayed recovery from glare, and nyctalopia (reduced twilight vision). The causes of retinitis pigmentosa and related retinal degenerations are diverse, linked to deficits in more than 75 different genes. In one form of isolated retinitis pigmentosa, which follows an"

            "content": "Soon after the publication of Friedreich\u2019s descriptions of a spinal type of hereditary ataxia, reports began to appear of somewhat different diseases in which the ataxia was related to degenerative changes in the cerebellum and brainstem rather than in the spinal cord. Claims of their independence from the spinal type were based largely on a later age of onset, a more definite hereditary transmission (usually of autosomal dominant type), the persistence or hyperactivity of tendon reflexes, and associations with ophthalmoplegia, retinal degeneration, and optic atrophy. Several of these clinical features, particularly briskness of tendon reflexes, are alien to the classic form of Friedreich ataxia."
