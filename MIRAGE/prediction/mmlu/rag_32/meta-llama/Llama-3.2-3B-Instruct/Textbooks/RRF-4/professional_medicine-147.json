Six days after treatment is started, she develops a temperature of 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Physical examination shows no other abnormalities.

The patient is undergoing chemotherapy for small cell carcinoma of the lung, which is a type of cancer that can cause neutropenia. The goal is to increase the patient's leukocyte count to reduce the risk of infection. The options for increasing the leukocyte count include growth factors, corticosteroids, and other medications. However, the most appropriate option for this patient is a growth factor that stimulates the production of neutrophils, which are a type of white blood cell that helps fight infection. The correct answer is Filgrastim, which is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) that stimulates the production of neutrophils. The other options are not the best choice for this patient: Darbepoetin is an erythropoietin that stimulates red blood cell production, dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can suppress the immune system, and interferon alfa is a cytokine that can stimulate the immune system but is not specific for neutrophil production.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

If the nadir neutrophil count is >1000/\u03bcL, there is little risk; if <500/\u03bcL, risk of death is markedly increased. Management of febrile neutropenia has conventionally included empirical coverage with antibiotics for the duration of neutropenia (Chap. 104).

The peripheral blood differential shows left-shifted hematopoiesis with predominance of neutrophils and the presence of bands, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, promyelocytes, and blasts (usually \u22645%). Basophils and/or eosinophils are frequently increased. Thrombocytosis is common, but thrombocytopenia is rare and, when present, suggests a worse prognosis, disease acceleration, or an unrelated etiology. Anemia is present in one-third of patients. Cyclic oscillations of counts are noted in 25% of patients without treatment. Biochemical abnormalities include a low leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score and high levels of vitamin B12, uric acid, lactic dehydrogenase, and lysozyme. The presence of unexplained and sustained leukocytosis, with or without splenomegaly, should lead to a marrow examination and cytogenetic analysis."

            "content": "A. Cancer Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia Neutropenia is a common adverse effect of the cytotoxic drugs used to treat cancer and increases the risk of serious infection in patients receiving chemotherapy. Unlike the treatment of anemia and thrombocytopenia, transfusion of neutropenic patients with granulocytes collected from donors is performed rarely and with limited success. The introduction of G-CSF in 1991 represented a milestone in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. This growth factor dramatically accelerates the rate of neutrophil recovery after dose-intensive myelosuppressive chemotherapy (Figure 33\u20135). It reduces the duration of neutropenia and usually raises the nadir count, the lowest neutrophil count seen following a cycle of chemotherapy."

Regimens of combination chemotherapy improved the median survival rates in small cell bronchogenic carcinoma, and these regimens are used for treatment of small cell carcinoma of the cervix. Combination chemotherapy may consist of vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC)or VP-16 (etoposide) and cisplatin (EP) (56).

Immediate consultation with an internist, hospitalist, or infectious disease specialist is recommended. Oxygen therapy and hydration should be initiated in addition to antibiotic therapy. Most patients will have an adequate clinical response within 3 days of treatment. Oral antibiotics may be given when patients meet the following criteria: ability to eat and drink, improvement in cough and dyspnea, afebrile (<100\u25e6F) on two occasions 8 hours apart, and a decreasing white blood cell count. If other clinical features are favorable, patients may be switched to oral antibiotics even if febrile. They may be discharged on the same day that oral antibiotics are started if other medical and social factors are favorable."
