The PDH complex is a multienzyme complex that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA. This reaction is a critical step in the metabolism of glucose and is considered the link between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The PDH complex is located in the mitochondrial matrix and consists of three enzymes: pyruvate decarboxylase (E1), dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2), and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3). The conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA is a key step in the TCA cycle, which is involved in the generation of energy for the cell. The PDH complex is regulated by covalent modification, with phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the E1 component controlling its activity.

The products of pyruvate decarboxylation are a molecule of CO2 (a waste product), a molecule of NADH, and acetyl CoA (see Panel 2\u20139).

The metabolism of glucose to carbon dioxide and water, with pyruvate as an intermediate (Fig. 57-2), occurs as part of the energy cycle in many tissues. Interference with mitochondrial oxidative metabolism may result in the accumulation of pyruvate. Because lactate dehydrogenase is ubiquitous, and because the equilibrium catalyzed by this enzyme greatly favors lactate over pyruvate, the accumulation of pyruvate results in lactic acidosis. The most common cause of such lactic acidosis is oxygen deficiency caused by hypoxia or poor perfusion. Lactic acidosis also occurs when specific reactions of pyruvate are impaired. In the liver, pyruvate undergoes carboxylation to form oxaloacetate using the enzyme pyruvate carboxylase; deficiency in this enzyme causes severe"

(a) When there is inadequate oxygen, for example, in a muscle cell undergoing vigorous contraction, the pyruvate produced by glycolysis is converted to lactate as shown. This reaction regenerates the naD+ consumed in step 6 of glycolysis, but the whole pathway yields much less energy overall than complete oxidation. (B) in some organisms that can grow anaerobically, such as yeasts, pyruvate is C regeneration C converted via acetaldehyde into carbon dioxide and ethanol. again, this pathway CO HCOH regenerates naD+ from naDh, as required to enable glycolysis to continue. Both (a) and (B) are examples of fermentations."

            "content": "This uncommon disease of the neonatal period or early infancy has many biochemical etiologies. The symptoms have consisted of psychomotor regression and episodic hyperventilation, hypotonia, and convulsions, with intervening periods of normalcy. Choreoathetosis has been observed in a few cases. Death often occurs before the third year. The important laboratory findings are acidosis with an anion gap and high serum lactate levels and hyperalaninemia. Defects can be found in the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex of enzymes and the electron transport chain complexes, which function in the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A (CoA), relating the disease to defects in the mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes. Indeed, lactic acidosis is a feature of several of the mitochondropathies discussed later in this chapter. Cases examined postmortem have shown necrosis and cavitation of the globus pallidus and cerebral white matter. Possibly this is a variant of Leigh disease."

            "content": "4. Increased glycolysis: In the liver, glycolysis is significant only during the absorptive period following a carbohydrate-rich meal. The conversion of glucose to pyruvate is stimulated by the elevated insulin/glucagon ratio that results in increased amounts of the regulated enzymes of glycolysis: glucokinase, PFK-1, and pyruvate kinase ([PK] see p. 105). Additionally, PFK-1 is allosterically activated by fructose 2,6bisphosphate generated by the active (dephosphorylated) kinase domain of bifunctional PFK-2. PK is dephosphorylated and active. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA, is active (dephosphorylated) because pyruvate inhibits"

            "content": "2. Lactate utilization: The direction of the LDH reaction depends on the relative intracellular concentrations of pyruvate and lactate and on the ratio of NADH/NAD+. For example, in the liver and heart, this ratio is lower than in exercising muscle. Consequently, the liver and heart oxidize lactate (obtained from the blood) to pyruvate. In the liver, pyruvate is either converted to glucose by gluconeogenesis or converted to acetyl CoA that is oxidized in the TCA cycle. Heart muscle exclusively oxidizes lactate to carbon dioxide and water via the TCA cycle. 3."
