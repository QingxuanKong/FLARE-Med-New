The patient presents with greenish discharge from her left nipple, which is not accompanied by any trauma, fever, or other symptoms. The patient is also not currently using oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, and her last pregnancy was approximately 20 years ago. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms such as pain or lumpiness in the breast make breast cancer (A) less likely. Fibrocystic disease (B) is a common cause of nipple discharge, but it is usually bilateral and may be accompanied by other symptoms such as lumpiness or tenderness. Mammary duct ectasia (C) is a common cause of unilateral, spontaneous, and greenish discharge, often in postmenopausal women, and is typically associated with a palpable mass or nipple retraction. Pituitary adenoma (D) is unlikely to cause nipple discharge, as it is a tumor of the pituitary gland and does not directly affect the breast tissue. Considering these factors, the most likely cause of the patient's presenting complaint is mammary duct ectasia (C), as it is a common cause of unilateral, spontaneous, and greenish discharge in postmenopausal women, and the patient's age and lack of other symptoms make breast cancer (A) less likely.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The examiner should be familiar with the normal appearance of the prepubertal genitalia. The normal unestrogenized hymenal ring and vestibule can appear mildly erythematous. The technique of examination is different from that used for examining an adult and may need to be tailored to the individual child based on her age, size, and comfort with the examiner."

She has had a good recovery from the surgery. CR is no longer taking pain medication but has continued her oral contraceptives (OCP). Pertinent Findings: CR\u2019s right calf is reddish in color (erythematous) and warm to the touch. It is visibly swollen. The left calf is normal in appearance and is without pain. An ultrasound is ordered. Diagnosis: CR has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT). OCP are a risk factor for DVT, as are surgery and immobilization. Treatment (Immediate): Heparin and warfarin are administered. Prognosis: In the 10 years following a DVT, about one third of individuals have a recurrence."

The causes of vaginal complaints are commonly infectious in origin, but they include a number of noninfectious causes, such as chemicals or irritants, hormone deficiency, foreign bodies, systemic diseases, and malignancy. Symptoms include abnormal vaginal discharge, pruritus, irrita-tion, burning, odor, dyspareunia, bleeding, and ulcers. A puru-lent discharge from the cervix should always raise suspicion of upper genital tract infection even in the absence of pelvic pain or other signs.Normal vaginal discharge is white or transparent, thick, and mostly odorless. It increases during pregnancy, with use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives, or at mid-cycle around the time of ovulation. Complaints of foul odor and abnormal vaginal discharge should be investigated. Candidiasis, bacte-rial vaginosis, and trichomoniasis account for 90% of vaginitis cases. The initial workup includes pelvic examination, vagi-nal pH testing, microscopy, vaginal cultures if microscopy is"

            "content": "The usual approach for nipple discharge is surgical excision through a periareolar incision adjacent to the trigger point, the pressure point that elicits nipple discharge (179). A microdochetomy of a single duct or a central duct excision of the major subareolar ducts can be performed under local or general anesthesia. The putative duct can be cannulated, methylene blue can be injected, or a lacrimal probe can be inserted into the duct for localization. A resection of breast tissue for 3 to 5 cm, or until no bloody \ufb02uid can be identified in the ductal system, is performed. The patient must be warned of possible skin and nipple loss as a result of compromised vascularity, change in nipple sensation, deformity, inability to breastfeed, and recurrence if only a single duct if removed."

            "content": "Blood from the lower limbs and the pelvis may drain via a series of collateral vessels, some of which include the superficial inferior epigastric veins, which run in the superficial fascia. These anastomose with the superior, superficial, and deep epigastric venous systems to drain into the internal thoracic veins, which in turn drain into the brachiocephalic veins and the superior vena cava. After the initial inferior vena cava thrombosis, the veins of the anterior abdominal wall and other collateral pathways hypertrophy to accommodate the increase in blood flow. A 52-year-old woman visited her family physician with complaints of increasing lethargy and vomiting. The physician examined her and noted that compared to previous visits she had lost significant weight. She was also jaundiced, and on examination of the abdomen a well-defined 10-cm rounded mass was palpable below the liver edge in the right upper quadrant (Fig. 4.185)."

Physical examina-tion reveals a pale woman with diminished vibration sen-sation, diminished spinal reflexes, and extensor plantar reflexes (Babinski sign). Examination of her oral cavity reveals atrophic glossitis, in which the tongue appears deep red in color and abnormally smooth and shiny due to atro-phy of the lingual papillae. Laboratory testing reveals a mac-rocytic anemia based on a hematocrit of 30% (normal for women, 37\u201348%), a hemoglobin concentration of 9.4 g/dL, an erythrocyte mean cell volume (MCV) of 123 fL (nor-mal, 84\u201399 fL), an erythrocyte mean cell hemoglobin con-centration (MCHC) of 34% (normal, 31\u201336%), and a low reticulocyte count.

The history should include a review of symptoms, general medical history, review of past surgery, and current medications. The woman\u2019s most troubling symptoms must be ascertained\u2014how often she leaks urine, how much urine she leaks, what provokes urine loss, what improves or worsens the problem, and what treatment (if any) she had in the past. It is essential to keep the patient\u2019s chief symptom at the forefront to avoid inappropriate management. Consider, for example, a woman whose chief concern is that once a month, while leading a business seminar, she has a sudden, overwhelming urge to void followed by complete bladder emptying. She finds this leakage devastating and is considering quitting her job because of her acute embarrassment. On occasion, she leaks a few drops of urine during exercise, but this minor leakage does not bother her. During the evaluation, urodynamics reveal minimal stress"
