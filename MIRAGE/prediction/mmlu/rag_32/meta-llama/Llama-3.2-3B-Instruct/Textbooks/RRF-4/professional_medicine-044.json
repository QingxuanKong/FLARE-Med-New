    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of pain and swelling of his right arm where he scraped it on a tree branch 2 days ago. His temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F). Examination of the right forearm shows edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion at the site of trauma. The area is extremely tender to palpation.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's consider the given symptoms and examination findings. The patient presents with pain and swelling of his right arm, edema around a fluctuant erythematous lesion, and tenderness to palpation at the site of trauma. The patient also has a fever of 38.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F). These symptoms are indicative of an infection, likely cellulitis, which is a bacterial infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Cellulitis is characterized by increased vascular permeability, leading to edema and fluid accumulation in the affected area. The primary mechanism of the development of edema in this patient is the increased vascular permeability due to the infection. This is a result of the release of histamine and other chemical mediators from the damaged tissue, which cause the separation of endothelial junctions and increased permeability of blood vessels. This allows fluid and proteins to leak into the interstitial space, leading to edema. The other options are not directly related to the development of edema in this patient. Disruption of vascular basement membranes (A) is a feature of vascular injury, but it is not the primary mechanism of edema development in cellulitis. Increased hydrostatic pressure (B) is not a factor in this scenario. Release of thromboxane (C) is involved in platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, not edema formation. Separation of endothelial junctions (D) is a result of increased vascular permeability, which is the primary mechanism of edema development in cellulitis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

            "content": "Edema is recognized by the persistence of an indentation of the skin after pressure; this is known as \u201cpitting\u201d edema. In its more subtle form, edema may be detected by noting that after the stethoscope is removed from the chest wall, the rim of the bell leaves an indentation on the skin of the chest for a few minutes. Edema may be present when the ring on a finger fits more snugly than in the past or when a patient complains of difficulty putting on shoes, particularly in the evening. Edema may also be recognized by puffiness of the face, which is most readily apparent in the periorbital areas. The differences among the major causes of generalized edema are shown in Table 50-1. Cardiac, renal, hepatic, or nutritional disorders are responsible for a majority of patients with generalized edema. Consequently, the differential diagnosis of generalized edema should be directed toward identifying or excluding these several conditions."

Winston, MD* A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 2-month history of fatigue, weight loss (10 kg), fevers, night sweats, and a productive cough. He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

He is then switched to celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily, and on this regimen his joint symptoms and heartburn resolve. Two years later, he returns with increased joint symptoms. His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor. With the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, he is started on a regimen"

Lymphadenitis manifests as a tense, tender swelling (bubo) that, when palpated, has a boggy consistency with an underlying hard core. Generally, there is one painful and erythematous bubo with surrounding periganglionic edema. The bubo is most commonly inguinal but can also be crural, axillary (Fig. 196-2), cervical, or submaxillary, depending on the site of the bite. Abdominal pain from intraabdominal node involvement can occur without other visible signs. Children are most likely to present with cervical or axillary buboes."

            "content": "Presents with sudden onset of pain and swelling at the site of trauma or recent surgery. Pain often progresses to anesthesia. An area of erythema quickly spreads over the course of hours to days. Margins move out into normal skin, and skin becomes dusky or purplish near the site of insult, ultimately leading to necrosis. Necrosis can initially have the appearance of undermining of the skin and subcutaneous layer; if the skin is open, gloved fingers can easily pass between the two layers to reveal yellow-green necrotic fascia (infection spreads quickly in deep fascia). The most important signs are tissue necrosis, a putrid discharge, bullae, severe pain, gas production, rapid burrowing through fascial planes, lack of classical tissue in\ufb02ammatory signs, and intravascular volume loss. Local radiographs or CT scans show air in tissue. Biopsy from the edge of the lesion can be diagnostic. A surgical emergency. Early and aggressive surgical debridement is critical."
