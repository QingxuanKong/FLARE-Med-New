The question states that a mistake is noted and the incorrect base is removed shortly following the time RNA primer is removed. This implies that the repair mechanism must act quickly to remove the mistake before the DNA polymerase adds another nucleotide to the growing chain. The mismatch repair mechanism is responsible for correcting mismatches in the newly synthesized strand, but it requires the presence of a mismatched base on the newly synthesized strand. Since the mistake was removed shortly after the RNA primer was removed, it is likely that the mismatch repair mechanism is not the primary mechanism at play here. DNA polymerase I is an enzyme that has 5'\\u20133'\\u2013exonuclease activity, which allows it to remove errors from the 3'\\u20135' end of the DNA strand. This activity would allow it to remove the incorrect base shortly after it is incorporated into the DNA strand. DNA polymerase III is the primary enzyme responsible for DNA replication and does not have exonuclease activity. Endonuclease repair is not directly involved in correcting errors on the leading strand. Therefore, the most likely repair mechanism responsible for removing the incorrect base shortly after it is incorporated into the DNA strand is DNA polymerase I.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

If there were a DNA polymerase that added deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates in the 3\u02b9-to-5\u02b9 direction, the growing 5\u02b9 end of the chain, rather than the incoming mononucleotide, would have to provide the activating triphosphate needed for the covalent linkage. In this case, the mistakes in polymerization could not be simply hydrolyzed away, because the bare 5\u02b9 end of the chain thus created would immediately terminate DNA synthesis (see Figure 5\u20133). It is therefore possible to correct a mismatched base only if it has been added to the 3\u02b9 end of a DNA chain.

The argument that a self-correcting polymerase cannot start chains de novo also implies the converse: an enzyme that starts chains anew cannot be efficient at self-correction. Thus, any enzyme that primes the synthesis of Okazaki fragments will of necessity make a relatively inaccurate copy (at least one error in 105). Even if the copies retained in the final product constituted as little as 5% of the total genome (for example, 10 nucleotides per 200-nucleotide DNA fragment), the resulting increase in the overall mutation rate would be enormous.

The final RNA primer synthesized on the lagging-strand template cannot be replaced by DNA because there is no 3\u02b9-OH end available for the repair polymerase. Without a mechanism to deal with this problem, DNA would be lost from the ends of all chromosomes each time a cell divides."

            "content": "The central event of chromosome duplication\u2014DNA replication\u2014poses two problems for the cell. First, replication must occur with extreme accuracy to minimize the risk of mutations in the next cell generation. Second, every nucleotide in the genome must be copied once, and only once, to prevent the damaging effects of gene amplification. In Chapter 5, we discuss the sophisticated protein machinery that performs DNA replication with astonishing speed and accuracy. In this section, we consider the elegant mechanisms by which the cell-cycle control system initiates the replication process and, at the same time, prevents it from happening more than once per cycle."

            "content": "All of a cell\u2019s DNA is under constant surveillance for damage, and the repair mechanisms we have described act on all parts of the genome. However, cells have a way of directing DNA repair to the DNA sequences that are most urgently needed. They do this by linking RNA polymerase, the enzyme that transcribes DNA into RNA as the first step in gene expression, to the nucleotide excision repair pathway. As discussed above, this repair system can correct many different types of DNA damage. RNA polymerase stalls at DNA lesions and, through the use of coupling proteins, directs the excision repair machinery to these sites. In bacteria, where genes are relatively short, the stalled RNA polymerase can be dissociated from the DNA; the DNA is repaired, and the gene is transcribed again from the beginning. In eukaryotes, where genes can be enormously long, a more complex reaction is used to \u201cback up\u201d the RNA polymerase, repair the damage, and then restart the polymerase."

            "content": "The Chemistry of the DNA Bases Facilitates Damage Detection The DNA double helix seems optimal for repair. As noted above, it contains a backup copy of all genetic information. Equally importantly, the nature of the four bases in DNA makes the distinction between undamaged and damaged bases very clear. For example, every possible deamination event in DNA yields an \u201cunnatural\u201d base, which can be directly recognized and removed by a specific DNA glycosylase. Hypoxanthine, for example, is the simplest purine base capable of pairing specifically with C, but hypoxanthine is the direct deamination product of A (Figure 5\u201343A). The addition of a second amino group to hypoxanthine"
