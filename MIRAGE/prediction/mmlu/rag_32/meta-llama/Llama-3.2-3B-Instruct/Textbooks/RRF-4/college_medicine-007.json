    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the type of inhibition that DFP has on acetylcholinesterase (ACE) enzyme. The key detail in the question is that DFP binds to the active site of ACE and renders the enzyme permanently inactive. This suggests that DFP does not compete with acetylcholine for the active site, but rather permanently alters the enzyme's structure in a way that prevents it from functioning. This type of inhibition is known as irreversible inhibition. Reversible inhibitors, on the other hand, can be reactivated by washing or other means. Competitive inhibitors compete with the substrate (acetylcholine) for the active site, while noncompetitive inhibitors bind to a site other than the active site and reduce the enzyme's activity. Partially competitive inhibitors reduce enzyme activity by competing with the substrate for the active site, but the enzyme can still be reactivated by increasing the substrate concentration. Given that DFP permanently inactivates the ACE enzyme, it is clear that the interaction between DFP and ACE is an example of irreversible inhibition.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Therefore, central nervous system toxicity is an important component of poisoning with these agents. A. Mechanism of Action Acetylcholinesterase is the primary target of these drugs, but butyrylcholinesterase is also inhibited. Acetylcholinesterase is an extremely active enzyme. In the initial catalytic step, acetylcholine binds to the enzyme\u2019s active site and is hydrolyzed, yielding free choline and the acetylated enzyme. In the second step, the covalent acetyl-enzyme bond is split, with the addition of water (hydration). The entire process occurs in approximately 150 microseconds. All the cholinesterase inhibitors increase the concentration of endogenous acetylcholine at cholinoceptors by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. However, the molecular details of their interaction with the enzyme vary according to the three chemical subgroups mentioned above."

Inhibition of acetylcholinesterases causes the released neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, to accumulate abnormally. End-organ overstimulation, which is recognized by clinicians as a cholinergic crisis, ensues (Fig. 262e-4).

            "content": "Metrifonate Metrifonate has selective activity against Schistosoma haematobium. This organophosphorous compound is a prodrug that is converted nonenzymatically to dichlorvos (2,2-dichlorovinyl dimethylphosphate, DDVP), a highly active chemical that irreversibly inhibits the acetylcholinesterase enzyme. Schistosomal cholinesterase is more susceptible to dichlorvos than is the corresponding human enzyme. The exact mechanism of action of metrifonate is uncertain, but the drug is believed to inhibit tegumental acetylcholine receptors that mediate glucose transport."

            "content": "There are five known muscarinic subtypes of acetylcholine receptors (M1 to M5). All are metabotropic receptors; however, they are coupled to different G proteins and can thus have distinct effects on the cell. M1, M3, and M5 are coupled to pertussis toxin\u2013insensitive G proteins, whereas M2 and M4 are coupled to pertussis toxin\u2013sensitive G proteins. Each set of G proteins is coupled to different enzymes and second messenger pathways (see for details of these pathways). Inhibitory Amino Acid Receptors: GABA and Glycine As noted, the most common inhibitory synapses in the CNS use either glycine or GABA as their transmitter. Glycine-mediated inhibitory synapses are common in the spinal cord, whereas GABAergic synapses make up the majority of inhibitory synapses in the brain."

            "content": "Drugs acting on the synthesis, storage, metabolism, and release of neurotransmitters fall into the presynaptic category. Synaptic transmission can be depressed by blockade of transmitter synthesis or storage. For example, reserpine depletes monoamine synapses of transmitters by interfering with intracellular storage. Blockade of transmitter catabolism inside the nerve terminal can increase transmitter concentrations and has been reported to increase the amount of transmitter released per impulse. Drugs can also alter the release of transmitters. The stimulant amphetamine induces the release of catecholamines from adrenergic synapses (see Chapters 6, 9, and 32). Capsaicin causes the release of the peptide substance P from sensory neurons, and tetanus toxin blocks the release of transmitters. After a CNS transmitter has been released into the synaptic cleft, its action is terminated either by uptake or by degradation. For most neurotransmitters, there are uptake mechanisms into the"
