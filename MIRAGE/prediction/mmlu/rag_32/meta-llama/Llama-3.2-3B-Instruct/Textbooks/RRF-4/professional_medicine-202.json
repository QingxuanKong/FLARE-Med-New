She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. Twelve months ago, she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She currently takes no medications. Subsequent blood pressure measurements on three separate occasions since the last visit have been: 155/94 mm Hg, 145/90 mm Hg, and 150/92 mm Hg. She is at the 50th percentile for height and 95th percentile for weight. Her blood pressure today is 150/90 mm Hg confirmed by a second measurement, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Her hematocrit is 40%. Urinalysis is within normal limits. Cardiac and renal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities.

She has been experiencing persistent hypertension (150/90 mmHg) on multiple occasions since the last visit. The patient is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. The patient's blood pressure measurements are consistently above the 95th percentile for her age and sex, indicating hypertension. The patient's cardiac and renal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities, and the urinalysis is within normal limits. The patient's hematocrit is elevated at 40%, which may indicate a secondary cause of hypertension, such as renal disease or a coagulopathy. The patient's family history is not provided, but the patient's weight is at the 95th percentile, which may indicate a genetic component to her hypertension. Given the patient's age and presentation, the most likely cause of her hypertension is essential hypertension. The next step in management would be to refer the patient to a pediatric cardiologist for further evaluation and management.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

            "content": "At Parkland Hospital, between 5 and 10 percent of all women with intrapartum hypertensive disorders are given a parenteral antihypertensive agent. Antepartum, we usually give hydralaxine as described. We do not limit the total dose, and seldom is a second antihypertensive agent needed. We estimate that by severe superimposed preeclampsia, and hydralazine was injected more frequently than recommended. Her blood pressure in less than 1 hour dropped from 240-270/130-150 mm Hg to 1r10/80 mm Hg. Fetal heart rate decelerations characteristic of utero placental insuiciency became evident. Decelerations persisted until her blood pressure was increased with rapid crystalloid infusion. In some cases, this fetal response to diminished uterine perfusion may be confused with placental abruption and may result in unnecessary and potentially dangerous emergency cesarean delivery."

His physician initially prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic commonly used to treat hyper-tension. His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic. Because the patient had elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, hydrochlorothiazide was replaced with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril lowered his blood pressure to almost normotensive levels. However, after several weeks on enalapril, the patient returned complaining of a persistent cough. In addition, some signs of angioedema were detected. How does enalapril lower blood pressure? Why does it occasionally cause coughing and angioedema? What other drugs could be used to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and decrease blood pressure,"

The physiologic stability of the patient may be abnormal with acute blood loss and acute hemolysis, manifesting as tachycardia, blood pressure changes, and, most ominously, an altered state of consciousness. The presence of jaundice suggests hemolysis. Petechiae and purpura indicate a coagulopathy. Hepatosplenomegaly and adenopathy suggest infiltrative disorders. Growth failure or poor weight gain suggests an anemia of chronic disease. An essential element of the physical examination is the investigation of the stool for the presence of occult blood."

Serum sodium concentrationsmay be elevated, normal, or low, depending on the balance ofsodium and free water losses. The measured serum sodium concentration is artificially low, however, because of hyperglycemia. Hyperlipidemia also contributes to the decrease inmeasured serum sodium. The level of blood urea nitrogen(BUN) can be elevated with prerenal azotemia secondary todehydration. The white blood cell count is usually elevatedand can be left-shifted without implying the presence ofinfection. Fever is unusual and should prompt a search forinfectious sources that may have triggered the episode ofDKA. Available @ StudentConsult.com"

Assessment of the patient\u2019s general appearance and vital signs, skin and soft tissue examination, and the neurologic evaluation are of particular importance. The patient may appear either anxious and agitated or lethargic and apathetic. Fever is usually present, although elderly patients and compromised hosts (e.g., patients who are uremic or cirrhotic and those who are taking glucocorticoids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be afebrile despite serious underlying infection. Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate helps determine the degree of hemodynamic and metabolic compromise. The patient\u2019s airway must be evaluated to rule out the risk of obstruction from an invasive oropharyngeal infection."
