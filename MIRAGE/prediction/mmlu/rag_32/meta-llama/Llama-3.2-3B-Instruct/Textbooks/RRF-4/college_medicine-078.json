    "question": "A scientist, using electrodes, is stimulating a group of neurons in the hypothalamus and recording their membrane potential changes. She observes a sharp rise in membrane potential when she first stimulates them, the the difference of 100mV. When she tries another stimulation immediately after the first, there is no response. However, when she increase the amount of voltage she supplies to the second shock, she observes a similar response to the first. What time period of stimulation would the second shock be characterized in regards to membrane potential?",

The first stimulation causes a sharp rise in membrane potential, indicating depolarization. The second stimulation, however, elicits no response, which suggests that the neuron is in a refractory period. When the scientist increases the amount of voltage supplied to the second shock, a similar response to the first is observed. This indicates that the neuron has recovered from its refractory period and is now capable of responding to the second stimulation. The time period of stimulation that the second shock is characterized in regards to membrane potential is the relative refractory period.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C. Hyperpolarization\"} Note: The correct answer is actually none of the above. The correct answer is the relative refractory period. The relative refractory period is the time period during which a neuron is unable to respond to a stimulus, but can respond to a stronger stimulus. In this case, the neuron was in the relative refractory period after the first stimulation and was able to respond to the second stimulation after it was increased. However, since the answer choices do not include the relative refractory period, the closest answer is C. Hyperpolarization. Hyperpolarization is a type of membrane potential that is opposite to depolarization, and it is not the correct answer. But since the other options are not correct, the answer is C.",

Below a certain threshold level of synaptic stimulation, the depolarization of the initial-segment membrane would be insufficient to trigger an action potential. With gradually increasing stimulation, the threshold would be crossed, the Na+ channels would open, and an action potential would fire. The action potential would be terminated by inactivation of the Na+ channels. Before another action potential could fire, these channels would have to recover from their inactivation. But that would require a return of the membrane voltage to a very negative value, which would not occur as long as the strong depolarizing stimulus (from PSPs) was maintained. An additional channel type is needed, therefore, to repolarize the membrane after each action potential to prepare the cell to fire again."

If the muscle is stimulated a second time before it is fully relaxed, the force of contraction increases (see Fig. 12.16 , middle). Thus twitch forces are amplified as stimulus frequency increases. At a high level of stimulation, intracellular [Ca++] increases and is maintained throughout the period of stimulation (see Fig. 12.16 , right), and the amount of force developed greatly exceeds that observed during a twitch. The response is termed tetany. At intermediate stimulus frequency, intracellular [Ca++] returns to baseline just before the next stimulus. However, there is a gradual rise in force (see"

In nerve and skeletal muscle cells, a stimulus that causes sufficient depolarization promptly opens the voltage-gated Na+ channels, allowing a small amount of Na+ to enter the cell down its electrochemical gradient. The influx of positive charge depolarizes the membrane further, thereby opening more Na+ channels, which admit more Na+ ions, causing still further depolarization.

            "content": "Why does a spike that starts at the initial segment not propagate in both directions? In fact, it does. In addition to propagating down the axon, the current flowing from the initial segment back to the soma can cause a spike to be generated in the soma because the soma also has voltage-gated Na+ channels. Additional \u201cbackpropagating\u201d spikes from the axon do not occur, however, nor does the somatic spike cause the initial segment of the axon to fire a second time (and thereby send another spike down the axon and start a repeating cycle). This does not happen because the refractory period of the membrane makes any area that has already spiked unable to fire a second spike for a short time. Thus for a spike that started at the initial segment and has begun traveling down the axon, current flowing in at the site of the spike depolarizes the membrane on both sides of that site. However, the side closer to the cell body, which has recently fired a spike, cannot respond to this"
