Identiication of a structural chromosomal abnormality raises two primary questions. First, what phenotypic abnormalities or later developmental abnormalities are associated with this finding? Second, is evaluation of parental karyotype indicated-speciically, are the parents at increased risk of carrying this abnormality? If so, what is their risk of having future afected ofspring?"

Indeed, phenotypically normal males with two and even three Y chromosomes have been identified. Such extreme karyotypic deviations are not encountered with the autosomes. In large part, this latitude relates to two factors: lyonization of X chromosomes and the small amount of genetic information carried by the Y chromosome. The consideration of lyonization must begin with Mary Lyon, who in 1962 proposed that in females, only one X chromosome is genetically active. X inactivation occurs early in fetal life, about 16 days after conception. Either the paternal or the maternal X chromosome is randomly inactivated in each cell of the developing embryo. Once inactivated, the same X chromosome remains inactive in all of the progeny of these cells. Moreover, all but one X chromosome is inactivated, and so a 48,XXXX female has only one active X chromosome. This phenomenon"

When a deletion or duplication is identified in a fetus or infant, parental karyotyping should be ofered, because if either parent carries a balanced translocation, the recurrence risk in subsequent pregnancies is signiicantly increased.

With the widely used Giemsa stain (G banding) technique, each chromosome set can be seen to possess a distinctive pattern of alternating light and dark bands of variable widths ( Fig. 7.13 ). The use of banding techniques allows identification of each chromosome, and can detect and localize structural abnormalities large enough to produce changes in banding pattern (described later)."

The karyotype has 14 chromosomes, including XY. (C) Karyotype of cancer cells found in each of the 11 facial tumors studied. The karyotype has 13 chromosomes, no sex chromosomes, no chromosome 2 pair, one chromosome 6, two chromosomes 1 with deleted long arms, and four highly rearranged marker chromosomes (M1\u2013M4).

Aneuploidy accounts for more than 50 percent of irst-trimester miscarriages, approximately 20 percent of second-trimester losses, and 6 to 8 percent of stillbirths and early-childhood deaths (Reddy, 2012; Stevenson, 2004; Wou, 2016). In the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT) network of population-based registries, chromosomal abnormalities were identiied in 0.4 percent of births (Wellesley, 2012). Of recognized pregnancies with aneuploidy, trisomy 21 composes just more than half of all cases. Trisomy 18 accounts for almost 15 percent, and trisomy 13 for 5 percent (Fig. Karyotypes are described using the International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature (McGowan-Jordan, Trisomy 21 (23:10,000) 0 45,X (3:10,000) Trisomy 18 (6: 1 0,000) o 47,XXX; 47,XXY; 47,XYY (2:1e0,000) o Trisomy 13 (2:10,000) o Other (23: 10,000)"

Copy number variant is another term for a microdeletion or microduplication of DNA too small to be visualized with a standard karyotype. The array designation begins with the abbreviation arr and the version of the genome build to which the nucleotide designations are aligned, such as GRCh38 for Genome Reference Consortium human build 38. his is followed by the number of the chromosome on which the abnormality is identified, by the p or q arm, and by the speciic bands in question. Array reports next include the afected base pair coordinates, thus conveying the exact size and location within the genome for every abnormality identiied-including copy number variants of uncertain signiicance . \u2022 Abnormalities of Chromosome Number"
