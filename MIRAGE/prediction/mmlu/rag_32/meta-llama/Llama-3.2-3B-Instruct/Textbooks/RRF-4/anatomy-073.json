The mandible is composed of the body, angle, ramus, and condyle. The muscles of mastication include the masseter, temporalis, lateral pterygoid, and medial pterygoid muscles. The question asks about the displacement of the fragments in an unfavorable fracture of the body of the mandible. The correct answer can be determined by understanding the action of the muscles of mastication on the mandible. The lateral pterygoid muscle pulls the condyle medially, while the medial pterygoid muscle pulls the condyle laterally. The masseter muscle and temporalis muscle primarily elevate the mandible, but do not directly affect the displacement of the body fragment. The digastric muscle does not significantly affect the displacement of the body fragment. Therefore, the posterior fragment is likely to be displaced medially by the action of the medial pterygoid muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The horizontal buttresses of the midface pass through the superior and inferior orbital rims and hard palate. A guiding principle of facial facture management is to restore the integrity of these buttresses.Mandible FracturesMandibular fractures are common injuries that may lead to permanent disability if not diagnosed and properly treated. The mandibular angle, ramus, coronoid process, and condyle are points of attachment for the muscles of mastication, including the masseter, temporalis, lateral pterygoid, and medial pterygoid muscles (Fig. 45-52).

After taking a history and performing a physical examination, imaging is performed in the form of a Panorex or a CT scan. Where closed reduction can be achieved, patients are placed in maxillomandibular fixation (MMF) with arch bars applied via circumdental wiring, and these are left in place for 4 to 6 weeks depending on patient factors and the fracture location.

Isolated arch fractures manifest as a flattened, wide facial appearance with edema and ecchymosis. Typically, they are also associated with pain or limited mobility of the mandible. Nondisplaced fractures may be treated without surgery, but Brunicardi_Ch45_p1967-p2026.indd 200401/03/19 6:30 PM 2005PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERYCHAPTER 45displaced or comminuted fractures should be reduced and stabi-lized. This can be accomplished using an indirect approach from above the hairline in the temporal scalp, the so-called \u201cGilles approach,\u201d or directly through a coronal incision in severe fractures.A common fracture pattern is called the zygomaticomaxil-lary complex (ZMC) fracture. This involves the zygomatic arch, the inferior orbital rim, the zygomaticomaxillary buttress, the lateral orbital wall, and the zygomaticofrontal buttress. Muscle forces acting on the fracture segment tend to rotate it"

If the neck happens to be rigid and straight and the force is applied quickly to the head, the atlas and the odontoid process of the axis may fracture."

            "content": "In the clinic In these fractures, the break usually runs from the greater trochanter through to the lesser trochanter and does not involve the femoral neck. Intertrochanteric fractures preserve the femoral neck blood supply and do not render the femoral head ischemic. They are most commonly seen in the elderly and result from low-energy impact (Fig. 6.29). Sometimes isolated fractures of the greater or the lesser trochanter can occur. An isolated fracture of the lesser trochanter in adults is most commonly pathological and due to an underlying malignant deposit. In the clinic An appreciable amount of energy is needed to fracture the femoral shaft. This type of injury is therefore accompanied by damage to the surrounding soft tissues, which include the muscle compartments and the structures they contain. In the clinic"
