Thus, we saw previously that defects in a human gene whose product normally functions to repair the mismatched base pairs resulting from DNA replication errors can lead to an inherited predisposition to cancers of the colon and some other organs, reflecting an increased mutation rate. In another human disease, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), the afflicted individuals have an extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation because they are unable to repair certain DNA photo-products. This repair defect results in an increased mutation rate that leads to serious skin lesions and an increased susceptibility to skin cancers. Finally, mutations in the Brca1 and Brca2 genes compromise a type of DNA repair known as homologous recombination and are a cause of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer."

Exposed skin is dry and pigmented and is extraordinarily sensitive to the mutagenic effects of ultraviolet irradiation. More than 10 different genes have been shown to cause the different forms of xeroderma pigmentosum.

She has many freckles on her face, neck, arms, and hands, and the parents report that she is unusually sensitive to sunlight. Two basal cell carcinomas are identified on her face. Based on the clinical picture, which of the following processes is most likely to be defective in this patient? A. Repair of double-strand breaks by error-prone homologous recombination B. Removal of mismatched bases from the 3\u2032-end of Okazaki fragments by a methyl-directed process C. Removal of pyrimidine dimers from DNA by nucleotide excision repair D. Removal of uracil from DNA by base excision repair"

            "content": "two distinct forms. One form, eumelanin, is a brownish black pigment. The other form, pheomelanin, is a reddish yellow pigment. Each is genetically determined. Coloration is most appar-ent in hair because of the concentration of melanin pig-ment granules, but it is also reflected in skin coloration. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation, particularly the sun\u2019s rays is called tanning. It increases the number of melanocytes and accelerates the rate of melanin produc-tion, thus protecting against further radiation effects. Response to ultraviolet radiation is genetically determined and is more pronounced in individuals with darker color of skin. Increased pigmentation of the skin may also result from hormonal imbalance\u2014for example, in Addison\u2019s disease. Lack of pigmentation occurs in a condition known as albinism. In this hereditary condition, premelanosomes are produced by melanocytes, but because of the absence of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and the subsequent trans formation of DOPA"
