These symptoms are indicative of inflammation and infection, which are hallmarks of phlebitis. The question mentions that two of these symptoms are evident, suggesting that the condition has progressed beyond the initial stage. Let's review the stages of phlebitis as described in the provided documents:\\n\\nStage 0: No symptoms or mild erythema, no signs of infection.\\nStage 1: Mild erythema, no pain, and no swelling.\\nStage 2: Erythema, pain, and swelling at the IV site.\\nStage 3: Severe erythema, pain, swelling, and sometimes suppurate or have a palpable cord.\\n\\nBased on the symptoms described, the condition is at least at Stage 2, as it presents with pain, erythema, and swelling. Therefore, the appropriate action is to re-site the cannula and consider treatment to prevent further complications.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

            "content": "The intravenous site should be inspected daily, and the catheter should be removed if there is any associated pain, redness, or induration. Phlebitis can occur even with close surveillance of the intravenous site. In one study, more than 50% of the cases of phlebitis became evident more than 12 hours after discontinuation of intravenous catheters (96). Less than one-third of patients had symptoms related to the intravenous catheter site 24 hours before the diagnosis of phlebitis. Phlebitis can be diagnosed based on the presence of fever, pain, redness, induration, or a palpable venous cord. Occasionally, suppuration will be present. Phlebitis is usually self-limited and resolves within 3 to 4 days. The treatment includes application of warm, moist compresses and prompt removal of any catheters from the infected vein. Antibiotic therapy with antistaphylococcal agents should be instituted for catheter-related sepsis. Excision or drainage of an infected vein rarely is necessary."

The rash is evanescent, appearing and disappearing before the examiner\u2019s eyes. It occurs usually on the trunk, sometimes on the limbs, but almost never on the face. Subcutaneous nodules occur as painless, small (0.5\u20132 cm), mobile lumps beneath the skin overlying bony prominences, particularly of the hands, feet, elbows, occiput, and occasionally the vertebrae. They are a delayed manifestation, appearing 2\u20133 weeks after the onset of disease, last for just a few days up to 3 weeks, and are commonly associated with carditis. Fever occurs in most cases of ARF, although rarely in cases of pure chorea. Although high-grade fever (\u226539\u00b0C) is the rule, lower grade temperature elevations are not uncommon. Elevated acute-phase reactants are also present in most cases."

He is then switched to celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily, and on this regimen his joint symptoms and heartburn resolve. Two years later, he returns with increased joint symptoms. His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor. With the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, he is started on a regimen"

However, patients with a high clinical likelihood of VTE should skip d-dimer testing and undergo imaging as the next step in the diagnostic algorithm. Clinical Pearls Not all leg pain is due to DVT, and not all dyspnea is due to PE (Table 300-2). Sudden, severe calf discomfort suggests a ruptured Baker\u2019s cyst. Fever and chills usually herald cellulitis rather than DVT. Physical findings, if present, may consist only of mild palpation discomfort in the lower calf. However, massive DVT often presents with marked thigh swelling, tenderness, and erythema. If the leg is diffusely edematous, DVT is unlikely. More probable is an acute exacerbation of venous insufficiency due to postthrombotic syndrome. Upper extremity venous thrombosis may present with asymmetry in the supraclavicular fossa or in the circumference of the upper arms."

Lymphadenitis manifests as a tense, tender swelling (bubo) that, when palpated, has a boggy consistency with an underlying hard core. Generally, there is one painful and erythematous bubo with surrounding periganglionic edema. The bubo is most commonly inguinal but can also be crural, axillary (Fig. 196-2), cervical, or submaxillary, depending on the site of the bite. Abdominal pain from intraabdominal node involvement can occur without other visible signs. Children are most likely to present with cervical or axillary buboes."
