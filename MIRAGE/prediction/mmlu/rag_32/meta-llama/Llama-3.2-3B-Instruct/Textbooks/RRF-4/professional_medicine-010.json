    "question": "While you are on rounds at a local nursing facility, the nurse mentions that your patient, a 79-year-old woman, appears to be a \"poor eater.\" She was admitted to the nursing facility 3 months ago from the hospital where she was treated for congestive heart failure. Her daughter had moved away from the area, and nursing home placement was necessary because the patient could no longer function independently. Her present medications include furosemide and digoxin. Physical examination is normal except for a weight loss of 3.5 kg (7 lb) during the past 3 months. In your conversation with the patient, she says, \"No, I'm not depressed, I just don't have an appetite anymore. Nothing tastes good to me. I have a little bit of nausea most of the time.\" Which of the following is the most appropriate initial diagnostic study?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with a history of congestive heart failure, weight loss, and a decrease in appetite. The patient's decreased appetite and weight loss could be indicative of malnutrition, which is a common issue in patients with congestive heart failure. Given the patient's medical history and symptoms, the most appropriate initial diagnostic study would be to determine the patient's serum albumin concentration. Low serum albumin levels can indicate malnutrition, and albumin is often used as a marker for nutritional status in patients with congestive heart failure. A low serum albumin level could indicate that the patient is not receiving adequate nutrition, which could be contributing to her weight loss and decreased appetite. The other options, chest x-ray, complete blood count, and determination of serum digoxin level, may not directly relate to the patient's decreased appetite and weight loss.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

The history should include a review of symptoms, general medical history, review of past surgery, and current medications. The woman\u2019s most troubling symptoms must be ascertained\u2014how often she leaks urine, how much urine she leaks, what provokes urine loss, what improves or worsens the problem, and what treatment (if any) she had in the past. It is essential to keep the patient\u2019s chief symptom at the forefront to avoid inappropriate management. Consider, for example, a woman whose chief concern is that once a month, while leading a business seminar, she has a sudden, overwhelming urge to void followed by complete bladder emptying. She finds this leakage devastating and is considering quitting her job because of her acute embarrassment. On occasion, she leaks a few drops of urine during exercise, but this minor leakage does not bother her. During the evaluation, urodynamics reveal minimal stress"

Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"

Relevant questions will include the following: How often is there someone to feel close to? How has this illness been for your family? How has it affected your relationships? How much help do you need with things like getting meals and getting around? How much trouble do you have getting the medical care you need? In the area of existential needs, providers should assess distress and the patient\u2019s sense of being emotionally and existentially settled and of finding purpose or meaning. Helpful assessment questions can include the following: How much are you able to find meaning since your illness began? What things are most important to you at this stage? In addition, it can be helpful to ask how the patient perceives his or her care: How much do you feel your doctors and nurses respect you? How clear is the information from"
