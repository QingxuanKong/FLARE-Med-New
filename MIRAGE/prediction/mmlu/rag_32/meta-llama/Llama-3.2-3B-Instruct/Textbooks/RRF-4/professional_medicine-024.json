She had mildly elevated blood pressure during labor and sustained an estimated third-stage blood loss of 500 mL. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 132/84 mm Hg, no fever, and normal deep tendon reflexes. The uterine fundus is firm and at the level of the umbilicus, and the perineum is slightly edematous. The hematocrit is 33%. The patient is cuddling her infant and normal bonding seems to be occurring. The key points to consider are the estimated third-stage blood loss of 500 mL and the mildly elevated blood pressure during labor. The patient is hemodynamically stable, but the significant blood loss and potential for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) require prompt attention. The most important next step in management is to monitor the patient closely for signs and symptoms of PPH, which can include hypovolemic shock, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. The patient's current blood pressure is within normal limits, but the risk of PPH is still present. The other options are not the most critical next step in management at this time.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

            "content": "In most cases, bearing down is reflexive and spontaneous during second-stage labor. Occasionally, a woman may not employ her expulsive forces to good advantage and coaching is desirable. Her legs should be half-flexed so that she can push with them against the mattress. When the next uterine contraction begins, she is instructed to exert downward pressure as though she were straining at stool. A woman is not encouraged to push beyond the completion of each contraction. Instead, she and her fetus are allowed to rest and recover. During this period of actively bearing down, the fetal heart rate auscultated during the contraction is likely to be slow but should recover to normal range before the next expulsive efort. Fetal and obstetrical outcomes appear to be unafected whether pushing is coached or uncoached during second-stage labor (Bloom, 2006; Tuuli, 2012). Bloom and colleagues (2006) studied efects of actively coaching expulsive eforts in women without epidural analgesia. hey"

A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

            "content": "Hendricks (1968) observed that \"the clinician makes great demands upon the uterus.\" The uterus is expected to remain well relaxed during pregnancy, to contract efectively but intermittently during labor, and then to remain in a state of almost constant contraction for several hours postpartum. Figure 24-28 demonstrates an example of normal uterine activity during labor. Uterine activity progressively and gradually rises from early through late labor. Interestingly, uterine contractions after birth are identical to those resulting in delivery of the newborn. Logically, the uterus that performs poorly before delivery is also prone to atony and puerperal hemorrhage.

Patient A (blue) has mean blood pressures near the 20th percentile throughout pregnancy. Patient B (red) has a similar pattern with mean pressures at the 25th percentile until approximately 36 weeks when her blood pressure begins to rise. By term, it is substantively higher and in the 75th percentile, but she is still considered \"normotensive.\" 25th percentile until 32 weeks. These begin to rise in patient B, who by term has substantively higher blood pressures. However, her pressures are still < 140/90 mm Hg, and thus she is considered to be \"normotensive.\" We use the term delta hypertension to describe this rather acute rise in blood pressure. Some of these women will go on to have obvious preeclampsia, and some even develop eclamptic seizures or HELLP (hemolysis, devatedliver enzyme levels, low 2latelet count) syndrome while still normotensive."

If the uterus remains irm and there is no unusual bleeding, watchful waiting until the placenta separates is the usual practice. Neither massage nor downward fundal pressure is employed, but the fundus is frequently palpated to ensure that it does not become atonic and illed with blood from placental separation. To prevent uterine inversion, umbilical cord traction must not be used to pul the placenta rom the uterus. Signs of separation include a sudden gush of blood into the vagina, a globular and firmer fundus, a lengthening of the umbilical cord as the placenta descends into the vagina, and elevation of the uterus into the abdomen. With the last, the placenta, having separated, passes down into the lower uterine segment and vagina. Here, its bulk pushes the uterine body upward."

            "content": "Traditionally, postpartum hemorrhage is defined as the loss of ::500 mL of blood after completion of the third stage of labor. This is problematic because almost half of all women delivered vaginally shed that amount of blood or more when losses are carefully measured (Pritchard, 1962). These results are depicted in Figure 41-1 and show further that approximately 5 percent of women delivering vaginally lose more than 1000 mL of blood. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017d), postpartum hemorrhage is deined as cumulative blood lossr> 1000 mL accompanied by signs and symptoms ofhypovolemia. And, almost a third of women undergoing cesarean delivery have blood loss that exceeds 1000 mL. These studies show that estimated blood loss is commony ony approximatey hafthe actual loss. Because of this, estimated blood loss in excess of \"average\" should alert the obstetrician to possible excessive bleeding. Whether quantiication of blood loss improves accuracy"

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

Maternal blood pressure and weight and their extent of change are examined. Symptoms such as headache, altered vision, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, bleeding, vaginal luid leakage, and dysuria are sought. Mter 20 weeks' gestation, uterine examination measures size from the symphysis to the fundus. In late pregnancy, vaginal examination often provides valuable information that includes conirmation of the presenting part and its station, clinical estimation of pelvic capacity and configuration, amnionic luid volume adequacy, and cervical consistency, efacement, and dilatation (Chap. 22, p. 435)."
