He\u00a0says that he has been constipated for the past 5\u00a0days and denies hematochezia and melena. He\u00a0says that he usually has loose stools during final exam week. Vital signs are normal.

    "predict": "To answer this question, we need to identify the condition described in the scenario and then determine the sympathetic innervation for the viscera involved in that condition. Step 1: Analyze the patient's symptoms and history. The patient has a 6-month history of intermittent loose stools alternating with constipation, with recent constipation for the past 5 days. This pattern of symptoms, known as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), is characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with defecation, changes in stool frequency, and changes in stool consistency. Step 2: Determine the sympathetic innervation for the viscera involved in IBS. The sympathetic nervous system innervates the large intestine, which is primarily responsible for the motility of the intestines. The sympathetic nervous system stimulates the smooth muscle in the intestines to contract and move the stool through the digestive system. Step 3: Identify the spinal segments responsible for the sympathetic innervation of the large intestine. The sympathetic innervation of the large intestine originates from the T7 to L2 spinal segments. This is because the sympathetic nerves that innervate the large intestine arise from the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord segments. Step 4: Select the correct answer choice based on the sympathetic innervation of the large intestine. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is: C. T7-L2 Here is the output in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The sympathetic innervation for the viscera involved in IBS originates from the T7 to L2 spinal segments.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Past medical history included hypertension, kidney stones, and hypercholesterolemia; medications included atenolol, spironolactone, and lovastatin. She also reliably consumed >2 L of liquid per day in management of the nephrolithiasis. The patient received 1 L of saline over the first 5 h of her hospital admission.

The severity of symptoms correlates with the extent of disease. Although UC can present acutely, symptoms usually have been present for weeks to months. Occasionally, diarrhea and bleeding are so intermittent and mild that the patient does not seek medical attention. Patients with proctitis usually pass fresh blood or blood-stained mucus, either mixed with stool or streaked onto the surface of a normal or hard stool. They also have tenesmus, or urgency with a feeling of incomplete evacuation, but rarely have abdominal pain. With proctitis or proctosigmoiditis, proximal transit slows, which may account for the constipation commonly seen in patients with distal disease."

In the vast majority of cases (probably >90%), there is no underlying cause (e.g., cancer, depression, or hypothyroidism), and constipation responds to ample hydration, exercise, and supplementation of dietary fiber (15\u201325 g/d). A good diet and medication history and attention to psychosocial issues are key. Physical examination and, particularly, a rectal examination should exclude fecal impaction and most of the important diseases that present with constipation and possibly indicate features suggesting an evacuation disorder (e.g., high anal sphincter tone, failure of perineal descent, or paradoxical puborectalis contraction during straining to"

Because of the wide range of normal bowel habits, constipation is difficult to define precisely. Most persons have at least three bowel movements per week; however, low stool frequency alone is not the sole criterion for the diagnosis of constipation. Many constipated patients have a normal frequency of defecation but complain of excessive straining, hard stools, lower abdominal fullness, or a sense of incomplete evacuation. The individual patient\u2019s symptoms must be analyzed in detail to ascertain what is meant by \u201cconstipation\u201d or \u201cdifficulty\u201d with defecation."

Unfortunately, the predictive value of this finding is rather low. Physical examination is critically important for discovering evidence of ulcer complication. Tachycardia and orthostasis suggest dehydration secondary to vomiting or active GI blood loss. A severely tender, board-like abdomen suggests a perforation.

Radiographs of the abdomen often reveal characteristic annular, constricting lesions (\u201capple-core\u201d or \u201cnapkin-ring\u201d) (Fig. 110-2). Cancers arising in the rectosigmoid are often associated with hematochezia, tenesmus, and narrowing of the caliber of stool; anemia is an infrequent finding. While these symptoms may lead patients and their physicians to suspect the presence of hemorrhoids, the development of rectal bleeding and/or altered bowel habits demands a prompt digital rectal examination and proctosigmoidoscopy."

Relieved with defecation; and/or 2. Onset associated with a change in frequency of stool; and/or 3. Onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool. (Table 16.5) includes at least 3 days of recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort per month over the past 3 months with at least two of the following features: relief with defecation, onset associated with change in stool frequency, or onset associated with change in form and appearance of stool (106). On physical examination, the findings of a palpable tender sigmoid colon or discomfort during insertion of the finger into the rectum and hard feces in the rectum are suggestive of IBS."

            "content": "On physical examination, the findings of a palpable tender sigmoid colon or discomfort during insertion of the finger into the rectum and hard feces in the rectum are suggestive of IBS. The diagnosis of IBS is usually based on history and physical examination, and although suggestive, especially in young women, the findings are not specific. A CBC, thyroid function study, stool sample to test for white cells and occult blood, and sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy or barium enema are usually required, particularly in older individuals and in young individuals who have not responded to initial treatment. The results of these studies are all normal in patients with IBS."

            "content": "The history helps define the etiology of nausea and vomiting. Drugs, toxins, and infections often cause acute symptoms, whereas established illnesses evoke chronic complaints. Gastroparesis and pyloric obstruction elicit vomiting within an hour of eating. Emesis from intestinal blockage occurs later. Vomiting occurring within minutes of meal consumption prompts consideration of rumination syndrome. With severe gastric emptying delays, the vomitus may contain food residue ingested hours or days before. Hematemesis raises suspicion of an ulcer, malignancy, or Mallory-Weiss tear. Feculent emesis is noted with distal intestinal or colonic obstruction. Bilious vomiting excludes gastric obstruction, whereas emesis of undigested food is consistent with a Zenker\u2019s diverticulum or achalasia. Vomiting can relieve abdominal pain from a bowel obstruction, but has no effect in pancreatitis or cholecystitis. Profound weight loss raises concern about malignancy or obstruction. Fevers suggest"

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"

Constipation/obstipation, deep and cramping abdominal pain (less intense than SBO), nausea/ vomiting (less than SBO but more commonly feculent). PE Abdominal distention (distal SBO), abdominal tenderness, visible peristaltic waves, fever, hypovolemia. Look for surgical scars/hernias; perform a rectal exam. High-pitched \u201ctinkly\u201d bowel sounds; later, absence of bowel sounds. Signif cant distention, tympany, and tenderness; examine for peritoneal irritation or mass; fever or signs of shock suggest perforation/peritonitis or ischemia/necrosis. High-pitched \u201ctinkly\u201d bowel sounds; later, absence of bowel sounds. Etiologies Adhesions (postsurgery), hernias, neoplasm, volvulus, intussusception, gallstone ileus, foreign body, Crohn\u2019s disease, CF, stricture, hematoma. Colon cancer, diverticulitis, volvulus, fecal impaction, benign tumors."
