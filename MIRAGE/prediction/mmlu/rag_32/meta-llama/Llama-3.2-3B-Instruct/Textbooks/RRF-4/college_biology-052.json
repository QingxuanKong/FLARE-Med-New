Four processes are fundamental to animal development: (1) cell proliferation, which produces many cells from one; (2) cell\u2013cell interactions, which coordinate the behavior of each cell with that of its neighbors; (3) cell specialization, or differentiation, which creates cells with different characteristics at different positions; and (4) cell movement, which rearranges the cells to form structured tissues and organs (Figure 21\u20131). It is on the fourth point that plant development differs radically: plant cells are unable to migrate or move independently through the embryo because each one is contained within a cell wall, through which it is cemented to its neighbors, as discussed in Chapter 19."

Flowering involves a transformation of the behavior of the cells at the growing apex of the plant shoot\u2014the apical meristem. During ordinary vegetative growth, these cells behave as stem cells, generating a steady succession of new leaves and new segments of stalk. In flowering, the meristem cells switch to making the components of a flower, with its sepals and petals, its stamens carrying pollen, and its ovary containing the female gametes."

The whole control system governing the switch to flowering is thus of vital importance for agriculture, especially in an era of rapid climate change. The example of vernalization suggests a general point about the role of chromatin modification in developmental timing. The plant uses changes in chromatin to record its experience of prolonged cold. It may be that in other organisms\u2014animals as well as plants\u2014slow, progressive changes in chromatin structure provide long-term timers for those mysterious developmental processes that unfold slowly, over a period of days, weeks, months, or years. Such chromatin timers may be among the most important clocks in the embryo, but as yet we understand very little about them."

In such plants, defective chloroplasts are a cause of variegation: a mixture of normal and defective chloroplasts in a zygote may sort out by mitotic segregation during plant growth and development, thereby producing alternating green and white patches in leaves. Leaf cells in the green patches contain normal chloroplasts, while those in the white patches contain defective chloroplasts (Figure 14\u201368)."

Fat and starch are both stored inside the chloroplast until needed for energy-yielding oxidation during periods of darkness (see Figure 2\u201351C). The embryos inside plant seeds must live on stored sources of energy for a prolonged period, until they germinate and produce leaves that can harvest the energy in sunlight.

This cytoplasm contains a mixture of transcription regulators that are distributed unevenly along the length of the embryo, thus providing positional information that distinguishes one part of the embryo from another (Figure 7\u201326).

To accommodate subsequent cell growth, the walls of the newborn cells, called primary cell walls, are thin and extensible, although tough. Once cell growth stops, the wall no longer needs to be extensible: sometimes the primary wall is retained without major modification, but, more commonly, a rigid secondary cell wall is produced by depositing new layers of matrix inside the old ones. These new layers generally have a composition that is significantly different from that of the primary wall.

Many processes are common to all cells, and any two cells in a single organism therefore have many gene products in common. These include the structural proteins of chromosomes, RNA and DNA polymerases, DNA repair enzymes, ribosomal proteins and RNAs, the enzymes that catalyze the central reactions of metabolism, and many of the proteins that form the cytoskeleton such as actin (Figure 7\u20133A). 2."
