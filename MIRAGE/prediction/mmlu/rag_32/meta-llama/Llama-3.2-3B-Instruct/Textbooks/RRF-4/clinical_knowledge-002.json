Another practical approach, which follows from the method by which much of the subject matter is presented in this book, is to divide the diseases into categories on the basis of the neurologic signs and associated clinical and laboratory features of medical disease: (1) dementia with medical disease, (2) dementia that is accompanied by other principal neurologic signs, and (3) dementia as the sole or predominant feature of the illness (Table 20-3). Once it has been determined that the patient suffers from a dementing illness, the illness may be characterized from these medical, neurologic, and ancillary data discussed in the following text.

However, there is a suggestion that incidence rates for dementia in general are declining (see Satizabal et al) and it is likely that most of the cases are due to Alzheimer disease.

Rarely, purely thalamic degenerations may be the basis of a dementia because of the integral relationship of the thalamus to the cerebral cortex, particularly as regards memory. Even when a particular disease disproportionately affects one part of the cerebrum, additional areas are often implicated and contribute to the mental decline. One such important example is found in Alzheimer disease, in which the main site of damage is in the hippocampus, but degeneration of the cholinergic nuclei of the basal frontal region, which project to the hippocampus, greatly augments the deterioration in memory function. Indeed, replacement of this lost cholinergic influence is one of the current approaches to the treatment of the disease."
