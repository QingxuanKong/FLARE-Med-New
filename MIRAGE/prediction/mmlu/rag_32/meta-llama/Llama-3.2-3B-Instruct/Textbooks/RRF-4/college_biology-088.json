Photosynthesis occurs in specialized organelles called chloroplasts, which are present in plant cells. Chloroplasts are found in the cells of leaves, stems, and other parts of plants that are exposed to sunlight. The palisade mesophyll is a type of tissue in leaves that is composed of many chloroplasts and is responsible for photosynthesis. The cortex, epidermis, and vascular cambium are not typically involved in photosynthesis. The vascular cambium is a type of tissue that produces new cells for growth and development, but it is not a site of photosynthesis. The epidermis is the outermost layer of the leaf and provides protection, but it does not contain chloroplasts and is not involved in photosynthesis. The cortex is the outer layer of the stem and root and does not contain chloroplasts. Therefore, the palisade mesophyll tissue would have the highest rate of oxygen production due to its high concentration of chloroplasts and its role in photosynthesis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Ethanol is metabolized at a constant rate of about 120 mg per hour per kg body weight, regardless of its concentration. If a 70-kg person were at twice the legal limit (160 mg/100 mL), how long would it take for their blood alcohol level to fall below the legal limit?"
