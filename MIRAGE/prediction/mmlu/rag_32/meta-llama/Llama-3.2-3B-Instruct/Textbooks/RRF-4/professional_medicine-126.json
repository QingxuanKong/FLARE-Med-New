The patient's pulse is 40/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 138/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows evidence of cannon a waves. The ECG shows a P-wave rate of 90/min, and an R-wave rate of 40/min, with no apparent relation between the two. Cannon a waves are a characteristic sign of atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular, rapid atrial activation. The presence of cannon a waves and the ECG findings suggest that the patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation. The patient's slow R-wave rate of 40/min indicates that the ventricular rate is being controlled by a ventricular escape pacemaker, which is consistent with a third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. The combination of atrial fibrillation and third-degree AV block is known as a junctional escape rhythm, which is a life-threatening arrhythmia that requires immediate medical attention. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is third-degree atrioventricular block.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm.

Nevertheless, the venous waveform has several characteristic features, and its individual components can be appreciated in most patients (Fig. 267-1). The arterial pulsation is not easily obliterated with palpation; the venous waveform in patients with sinus rhythm is usually biphasic, while the carotid pulse is monophasic; and the jugular venous pulsation should change with changes in posture or inspiration (unless the venous pressure is quite elevated). The venous waveform is divided into several distinct peaks. The a wave reflects right atrial presystolic contraction and occurs just after the electrocardiographic P wave, preceding the first heart sound (S1).

Blood pressure and heart rate should be measured in the supine position and after 3 min of standing to determine whether orthostatic hypotension is present. An ECG should be performed if there is suspicion of syncope due to an arrhythmia or underlying cardiac disease. Relevant electrocardiographic abnormalities include bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias, AV block, ischemia, old myocardial infarction, long QT syndrome, and bundle branch block.

            "content": "The electrocardiographic manifestations of SA node dysfunction include sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses, sinus arrest, sinus exit block, tachycardia (in SSS), and chronotropic incompetence. It is often difficult to distinguish pathologic from physiologic sinus bradycardia. By definition, sinus bradycardia is a rhythm driven by the SA node with a rate of <60 beats/min; sinus bradycardia is very common and typically benign. Resting heart rates <60 beats/min are very common in young healthy individuals and physically conditioned subjects. A sinus rate of <40 beats/min in the awake state in the absence of physical conditioning generally is considered abnormal. Sinus pauses and sinus arrest result from failure of the SA node to discharge, producing a pause without P waves visible on the ECG (Fig. 274-3). Sinus pauses of up to 3 s are common in awake athletes, and pauses of this duration or longer may be observed in asymptomatic elderly subjects. Intermittent failure of conduction from the"

The day before he was on a long haul flight, returning from his holidays. He was usually fit and well and was a keen mountain climber. He had no previous significant medical history. On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"

He had been told that his urine would change color (become reddish) with the analgesic, but he reports that it has gotten darker (more brownish) over the last 2 days. Last night, his mother noticed that his eyes had a yellow tint. JF says he feels as though he has no energy."

Sharp, fleeting chest pain or a prolonged, dull ache localized to the 1581 left submammary area is rarely due to myocardial ischemia. However, especially in women and diabetic patients, angina pectoris may be atypical in location and not strictly related to provoking factors. In addition, this symptom may exacerbate and remit over days, weeks, or months. Its occurrence can be seasonal, occurring more frequently in the winter in temperate climates. Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d are symptoms of myocardial ischemia other than angina. They include dyspnea, nausea, fatigue, and faintness and are more common in the elderly and in diabetic patients."
