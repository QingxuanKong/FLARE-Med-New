On the lagging side of the fork, however, each time the DNA polymerase completes a short DNA Okazaki fragment (which takes a few seconds), it must start synthesizing a completely new fragment at a site further along the template strand (see Figure 5\u20137). A special mechanism produces the base-paired primer strand required by the DNA polymerase molecules. The mechanism depends on an enzyme called DNA primase, which uses ribonucleoside triphosphates to synthesize short RNA primers on the lagging strand (Figure 5\u201310).

A replication fork therefore has an asymmetric structure (Figure 5\u20137). The DNA daughter strand that is synthesized continuously is known as the leading strand. Its synthesis slightly precedes the synthesis of the daughter strand that is synthesized discontinuously, known as the lagging strand. For the lagging strand, the direction of nucleotide polymerization is opposite to the overall direction of DNA chain growth. The synthesis of this strand by a discontinuous \u201cbackstitching\u201d mechanism means that DNA replication requires only the 5\u02b9-to-3\u02b9 type of DNA polymerase.

The bases are of four types (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine), corresponding to four distinct nucleotides, labeled A, G, c, and T. (B) A single strand of dnA consists of nucleotides joined together by sugar-phosphate linkages. note that the individual sugar-phosphate units are asymmetric, giving the backbone of the strand a definite directionality, or polarity. This directionality guides the molecular processes by which the information in dnA is interpreted and copied in cells: the information is always \u201cread\u201d in a consistent order, just as written english text is read from left to right.

The clamp loader, thanks to its screw-nut structure, recognises the region of DNA that is double-stranded and latches onto it, tightening around the complex of a template strand with a freshly synthesized elongating (primer) strand. It carries the clamp along this double-stranded region until it encounters the 3\u02b9 end of the primer, at which point the loader hydrolyzes ATP and releases the clamp, allowing it to close around the DNA and bind to DNA polymerase. In the simplified reaction shown here, the clamp loader dissociates into solution once the clamp has been assembled. At a true replication fork, the clamp loader remains close to the polymerase so that, on the lagging strand, it is ready to assemble a new clamp at the start of each new Okazaki fragment (see Figure 5\u201318).

If mismatches were instead repaired without regard for which strand served as template, would mismatch repair reduce replication errors?

The original procedure for this purpose was the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method illustrated in Figure 34.9. In this method, the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to be sequenced is used as the template for DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase (DNA pol). A radiolabeled primer complementary to the 3\u2032-end of the target DNA is added, along with the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTP). The sample is divided into four reaction tubes, and a small amount of one of the four dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (ddNTP) is added to each tube. Because it contains no 3\u2032-hydroxyl group, incorporation of a ddNMP terminates elongation at that point. The products of this reaction, then, consist of a mixture of DNA strands of different lengths, each terminating at a specific base. Separation of the various DNA products by size in an electric field using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography,"

            "content": "The DNA polymerases that synthesize and repair DNA (discussed in Chapter 5) have become important tools in experimentally manipulating DNA. Because they synthesize sequences complementary to an existing DNA molecule, they are often used in the test tube to create exact copies of existing DNA molecules. The copies can include specially modified nucleotides (Figure 8\u201326). To synthesize DNA in this way, the DNA polymerase is presented with a template and a pool of nucleotide precursors that contain the modification. As long as the polymerase can use these precursors, it automatically makes new, modified molecules that match the sequence of the template. Modified DNA molecules have many uses. DNA labeled with the radioisotope 32P can be detected following gel electrophoresis by placing the gel next to a piece of photographic film (see Figure 8\u201325C). The 32P atoms emit \u03b2 particles which expose the film, producing a visible record of every band on the gel. Alternatively, the gel can be"

Each monomer in a single DNA strand\u2014that is, each nucleotide\u2014consists of two parts: a sugar (deoxyribose) with a phosphate group attached to it, and a base, which may be either adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), or thymine (T) (Figure 1\u20132). Each sugar is linked to the next via the phosphate group, creating a polymer chain composed of a repetitive sugar-phosphate backbone with a series of bases protruding from it. The DNA polymer is extended by adding monomers at one end. For a single isolated strand, these monomers can, in principle, be added in any order, because each one links to the next in the same way, through the part of the molecule that is the same for all of them. In the living cell, however, DNA is not synthesized as a free strand in isolation, but on a template formed by a preexisting DNA strand.

The resulting long, unbranched chain has polarity, with both a 5\u2032-end (free phosphate) and a 3\u2032end (free hydroxyl). The sequence of nucleotides is read 5\u2032\u21923\u2032. DNA exists as a double-stranded molecule, in which the two chains are paired in an antiparallel manner and wind around each other, forming a double helix. Adenine pairs with thymine, and cytosine pairs with guanine. Each strand of the double helix serves as a template for constructing a complementary daughter strand (semiconservative replication). DNA replication occurs in the S phase of the cell cycle and begins at an origin of replication. As the two strands unwind and separate, synthesis occurs at two replication forks that move away from the origin in opposite directions (bidirectionally). Helicase unwinds the double helix. As the two strands of the double helix are separated, positive supercoils are produced in"
