Gene doping refers to the use of genetic manipulation techniques to enhance performance in sports. This concept is closely related to the use of erythropoietin (ESA) and anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) to improve athletic performance. According to document [1], erythropoietin is used to increase hemoglobin, and document [9] mentions that gene transfer strategies for genetic disease generally involve gene addition therapy, which can also be used to enhance performance. However, the term gene doping specifically refers to the use of genetic manipulation techniques to enhance performance in sports. This is mentioned in document [2] as a novel area of therapeutics in which the active agent is a nucleic acid sequence rather than a protein or small molecule. Document [22] also mentions that gene function can be altered by reverse genetic techniques, which can be used to enhance performance. Based on this information, we can conclude that gene doping refers to the use of genetic manipulation techniques to enhance performance in sports.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Because delivery of naked DNA or RNA to a cell is an inefficient process, most gene transfer is carried out using a vector, or gene delivery vehicle. These vehicles have generally been engineered from viruses by deleting some or all of the viral genome and replacing it with the therapeutic gene of interest under the control of a suitable promoter (Table 91e-1). Gene transfer strategies can thus be described in terms of three essential elements: (1) a vector; (2) a gene to be delivered, sometimes called the transgene; and (3) a physiologically relevant target cell to which the DNA or RNA is delivered. The series of steps in which the vector and donated DNA enter the target cell and express the transgene is referred to as transduction. Gene delivery can take place in vivo, in which the vector is directly injected into the patient, or, in the case of"

[Note: In germline gene therapy, the germ cells are modified, and so the change is passed on. A long-standing moratorium on germline gene therapy is in effect worldwide.] There are two types of gene transfer: 1) ex vivo, in which cells from the patient are removed, transduced, and returned, and 2) in vivo, in which the cells are directly transduced. Both types require use of a viral vector to deliver the DNA.

This can be accomplished by harnessing a system known as RNA interference, or RNAi, that is present in many eukaryotic cell types. When small double-stranded RNA molecules (referred to as small interfering RNAs, or siRNAs) are introduced into cells, the two RNA strands will be separated and one will bind to an enzyme complex known as RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex). The bound siRNA targets the RISC complex to the mRNA to which it has homology, leading either to translation arrest or to degradation of the mRNA, and thus to silencing of the gene (Fig. A.48). For cells that are not easily transfected with siRNA molecules directly, such as primary lymphocytes and myeloid cells, gene silencing can be implemented by using recombinant viruses.

It has been used to explain how an internal portion of a gene is replaced by a homologous segment copied from another allele or locus; these genetic alterations may range from a few nucleotides to a few thousand nucleotides. As a result of gene conversion, it is possible for short DNA segments of two chromosomes to be identical, even though these sequences are distinct in the parents. A practical consequence of this phenomenon is that nucleotide substitutions can occur during gene conversion between related genes, often altering the function of the gene. In disease states, gene conversion often involves intergenic exchange of DNA between a gene and a related pseudogene. For example, the 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2) is adjacent to a nonfunctional pseudogene (CYP21A1P). Many of the nucleotide substitutions that are found in the CYP21A2 gene in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia correspond to"

            "content": "The adverse effects of long-term AAS abuse remain poorly understood. Most of the information about the adverse effects of AAS has emerged from case reports, uncontrolled studies, or clinical trials that used replacement doses of testosterone (Table 7e-2). Of note, AAS users may administer 10\u2013100 times the replacement doses of testosterone over many years, making it unjustifiable to extrapolate from trials using replacement doses. A substantial fraction of AAS users also use other drugs that are perceived to be muscle-building or performance-enhancing, such as growth hormone; erythropoiesisstimulating agents; insulin; and stimulants such as amphetamine, clenbuterol, cocaine, ephedrine, and thyroxine; and drugs perceived to reduce adverse effects such as human chorionic gonadotropin, aromatase inhibitors, or estrogen antagonists. The men who abuse AAS are Abbreviation: HPT axis, hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis."

            "content": "have been enrolled in gene transfer studies, and serious adverse events have been rare. Some of the initial trials were characterized by an overabundance of optimism and a failure to be appropriately critical of preclinical studies in animals; in addition, it was in some contexts not fully appreciated that animal studies are only a partial guide to safety profiles of products in humans (e.g., insertional mutagenesis). Initial exuberance was driven retrenchment; continued efforts led to a more nuanced understanding of the risks and benefits of these new therapies and more sophisticated selection of disease targets. Currently, gene therapies are being developed for a wide variety of disease entities (Fig. 91e-1)."
