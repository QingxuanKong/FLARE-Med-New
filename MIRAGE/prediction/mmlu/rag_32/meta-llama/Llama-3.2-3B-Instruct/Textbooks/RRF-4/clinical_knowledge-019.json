Failure of one eye to close and difficulty in sucking make this condition easy to recognize. It must be distinguished from the congenital facial diplegia that is often associated with abducens palsy, that is, the M\u00f6bius syndrome discussed earlier in the chapter.

Numbness and paresthesia of the skin supplied by the nerve branch or chronic neuralgia can be troublesome sequelae of these injuries. The facial nerve may be involved in one of two ways. In the first type of injury, associated with transverse fractures through the petrous bone, there is an immediate facial palsy, probably caused by contusion or transection of the nerve. Surgical anastomosis has sometimes been successful in restoring function in this circumstance. The second, more common type, is associated with longitudinal fractures of the petrous bone, the facial palsy then often being delayed for several days, a sequence that may be misinterpreted as progression of the intracranial traumatic lesion. This latter type is usually transitory, and its mechanism is not known."

In some instances of Bell palsy, even after nearly full recovery of facial movements, blink frequency and amplitude may be reduced on the previously paralyzed side. A trigeminal nerve lesion on one side, by reducing corneal sensation, interferes with the blink reflex on both sides, whereas Bell palsy reduces the ipsilateral blink but does not affect the contralateral blink.

            "content": "The onset of Bell\u2019s palsy is acute; about one-half of cases attain maximum paralysis in 48 h and practically all within 3 or 4 days. Pain behind the ear may precede the paralysis by a day or two and in a few patients is intense and persistent. Although a report by the patient of fullness or numbness in the face is common, in a small number there is hypesthesia in 1 or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. The explanation of this finding is not clear. Impairment of taste is present in most patients but it rarely persists beyond the second week of paralysis. This indicates that the lesion has extended proximal to the point at which the chorda tympani joins the facial nerve. Hyperacusis or distortion of sound is then experienced in the ipsilateral ear and, as mentioned, indicates paralysis of the stapedius muscle."
