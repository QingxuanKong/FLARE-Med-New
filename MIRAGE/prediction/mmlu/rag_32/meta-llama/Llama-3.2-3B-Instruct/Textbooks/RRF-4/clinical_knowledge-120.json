Obstruction is usually diagnosed by the presence of ureteral and renal pelvic dilation on renal ultrasound. However, early in the course of obstruction or if the ureters are unable to dilate (e.g., encasement by pelvic or periureteral tumors), the ultrasound examination may be negative. The specific urologic conditions that cause obstruction are discussed in Chap. 343."

            "content": "factors for postoperative urinary retention include pain, narcotic analgesia, and perioperative bladder distention. Initial treatment of urinary retention requires decompression of the bladder with short-term catheterization. Patients will generally require an overnight admission and trial of normal voiding before discharge. Failure to void normally requires reinsertion of the catheter for up to a week. Chronic requirement of a urinary catheter is rare, though older patients may require prolonged catheterization. Risk of urinary retention can be minimized by ensuring voiding prior to surgery and minimization of perioperative fluid administration.96Ileus and Bowel Obstruction. The laparoscopic transab-dominal approach is associated with a higher incidence of ileus than other modes of repair. This complication is self-limited; however, it necessitates sustained inpatient observation, intra-venous fluid maintenance, and possibly nasogastric decom-pression. Abdominal imaging may be"
