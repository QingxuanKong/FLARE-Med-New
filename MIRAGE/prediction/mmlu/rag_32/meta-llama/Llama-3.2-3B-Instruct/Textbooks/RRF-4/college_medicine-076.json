According to Document [16], acetylcholine (ACh) is synthesized in the motor nerve terminal and stored in vesicles (quanta). When an action potential travels down a motor nerve and reaches the nerve terminal, ACh from 150 to 200 vesicles is released and combines with AChRs that are densely packed at the peaks of postsynaptic folds.

Normally an action potential in a motor neuron causes a large depolarization in the postsynaptic muscle, termed an end plate potential (EPP), which is equivalent to an EPSP in a neuron. However, under conditions of low extracellular [Ca++], the EPP amplitude is reduced (because the presynaptic Ca++ current is reduced, leading to a smaller rise in intracellular [Ca++], and transmitter release is proportional to [Ca++]).

For excitatory synapses, the strength of the synapse may be quantified by what is known as its safety factor (the ratio of EPSP amplitude to the amplitude needed to reach the threshold to trigger an action potential). Most synapses have low safety factors (<1), and thus it takes the summed EPSPs of multiple active synapses to trigger an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron. This summation process is at the core of synaptic integration, which is taken up in the next section. Synapses with high (>1) safety factors exist, however, and the neuromuscular junction is one prominent example. When a motor neuron action potential triggers release of neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction, an end plate potential (EPP; the equivalent of an EPSP in a neuron) is generated in the muscle fiber.

In contrast to motor conduction measurements, the nerve is typically stimulated at one site and recordings are performed at two distal sites (therefore antidromically for sensory conduction) in order to obtain both the amplitude (at the more proximal site) and conduction velocity by the subtraction method (Fig. 2-13).

            "content": "Control of Skeletal Muscle Activity Skeletal muscle is controlled by the central nervous system. Specifically, each skeletal muscle is innervated by an \u03b1 motor neuron. The cell bodies of \u03b1 motor neurons are located in the ventral horn of the spinal cord ( Fig. 12.7 ). The motor axons exit via the ventral roots and reach the muscle through mixed peripheral nerves. The motor nerves branch in the muscle, and each branch innervates a single muscle fiber. The specialized cholinergic synapse that forms the neuromuscular junction and the neuromuscular transmission process that generates an action potential in the muscle fiber are described in A motor unit consists of the motor nerve and all the muscle fibers innervated by the nerve. The motor unit is the functional contractile unit because all the muscle cells within a motor unit contract synchronously when the motor nerve fires. The size of motor units within a muscle varies, depending on the function of the muscle."

            "content": "Other notable characteristics of muscle are its natural mode of contraction, that is, through neural innervation\u2014and the necessity of intact innervation for the maintenance of its normal tone and trophic state. Each muscle fiber receives a nerve twig from a motor nerve cell in the anterior horn of the spinal cord or nucleus of a cranial nerve; the nerve twig joins the muscle fiber at the neuromuscular junction or motor endplate. As was pointed out in Chaps. 2 and 3, groups of muscle fibers with a common innervation from one anterior horn cell constitute the motor unit, which is the basic physiologic unit in all reflex, postural, and voluntary activities."

(A) When an action potential reaches the nerve terminal in a presynaptic cell, it stimulates the terminal to release its neurotransmitter. The neurotransmitter molecules are contained in synaptic vesicles and are released to the cell exterior when the vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane of the nerve terminal. The released neurotransmitter binds to and opens the transmitter-gated ion channels concentrated in the plasma membrane of the postsynaptic target cell at the synapse. The resulting ion flows alter the membrane potential of the postsynaptic membrane, thereby transmitting a signal from the excited nerve (B) (Movie 11.12). (B) A thin-section electron micrograph of two nerve terminal synapses on a dendrite of a postsynaptic cell.
