    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the definition of abduction in the context of foot movement. Abduction refers to the movement of a limb away from the midline of the body. In the case of the foot, abduction means moving the foot away from the midline of the body. Given this definition, let's analyze the options provided. Option A (Inward) is the opposite of abduction, as it would mean moving the foot towards the midline of the body. Option C (Upward) and D (Downward) refer to vertical movements, which are not related to abduction. Therefore, these options can be eliminated. Option B (Outward) is the correct answer, as it aligns with the definition of abduction. \", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

There are five digits consisting of the medially placed digits, ending laterally with the little toe (digit V) (Fig. 6.95). The foot has a superior surface (dorsum of foot) and an inferior surface (sole; Fig. 6.95). Abduction and adduction of the toes are defined with respect to the long axis of the second digit. Unlike in the hand, where the thumb is oriented 90\u00b0 to the other fingers, the great toe is oriented in the same position as the other toes. The foot is the body\u2019s point of contact with the ground and provides a stable platform for upright stance. It also levers the body forward during walking."

The body is erect, the head is straight, and the arms hang loosely and gracefully at the sides, each moving rhythmically forward with the opposite leg. The feet are slightly externally rotated, the steps are approximately equal, and the medial malleoli almost touch as each foot passes the other. The medial edges of the heels, as they strike the ground with each step, lie almost along a straight line. As each leg moves forward, there is coordinated flexion of the hip and knee, dorsiflexion of the foot, and a barely perceptible elevation of the hip, so that the foot clears the ground. Also, with each step, the thorax advances slightly on the side opposite the swinging lower limb. The heel strikes the ground first, and inspection of the shoes will show that this part is most subject to wear."

It is characterized by a convexity of the lateral foot (Fig. 201-2) and is caused by in utero positioning. It is bilateral in half of cases. Occurring equally in boys and girls, it is more common in first-born children because of the smaller primigravid uterus. Two percent of infants with metatarsus adductus have developmental dysplasia of the hip. The forefoot is adducted and sometimes supinated, but the midfoot and hindfoot are normal. The lateral border of the foot is convex, while the medial border is concave. Ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion are normal. With the midfoot and hindfoot stabilized, the deformity can be pushed beyond a neutral position (into abduction). Older children may present with an in-toeing gait."

The leg tends to rotate outward to describe a semicircle, first away from and then toward the trunk (circumduction). The foot scrapes the floor, contact being made by the toe and outer heel of the foot. One can recognize a spastic gait by the sound of slow, rhythmic scuffing of the foot and wearing of the medial toe of the shoe. With a cerebral or cervical lesion, the arm on the affected side is weak and stiff to a variable degree; it is carried in a flexed position and does not swing naturally (Fig. 6-2A). In the hemiparetic child, the arm tends to abduct as he steps forward. This type of gait disorder is most often a sequela of stroke or trauma but may result from any condition that damages the corticospinal pathway on one side."

Rather, the metatarsals and tarsals form longitudinal and transverse arches (Fig. 6.10). The longitudinal arch is highest on the medial side of the foot. The arches are flexible in nature and are supported by muscles and ligaments. They absorb and transmit forces during walking and standing. Muscles of the gluteal region consist predominantly of extensors, rotators, and abductors of the hip joint (Fig. 6.11). In addition to moving the thigh on a fixed pelvis, these muscles also control the movement of the pelvis relative to the limb bearing the body\u2019s weight (weight-bearing or stance limb) while the other limb swings forward (swing limb) during walking."

In contrast to walking, running requires that both feet are momentarily off the ground, necessitating a forward drive or thrust by the trailing leg. Because normal body posture and locomotion require intact vestibular function, proprioception, and vision (we see where we are going and adjust our steps), the effects of deficits in these senses are worth noting. A blind person\u2014or a normal one who is blindfolded or walks in the dark\u2014moves cautiously, with arms slightly forward to avoid collisions, and shortens his step slightly on a smooth surface; there is less rocking of the body and the gait is unnaturally stiff and cautious."

A second major function of the lower limbs is to move the body through space. This involves the integration of movements at all joints in the lower limb to position the foot on the ground and to move the body over the foot. Movements at the hip joint are flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, medial and lateral rotation, and circumduction (Fig. 6.5). The knee and ankle joints are primarily hinge joints. Movements at the knee are mainly flexion and extension (Fig. 6.6A). Movements at the ankle are dorsiflexion (movement of the dorsal side of the foot toward the leg) and plantarflexion (Fig. 6.6B)."

In addition, many sciatic neuropathies are idiopathic. Weakness may involve all motions of the ankles and toes as well as flexion of the leg at the knee; abduction and extension of the thigh at the hip are spared. Sensory loss occurs in the entire foot and the distal lateral leg. The ankle jerk and on occasion the internal hamstring reflex are diminished or more typically absent on the affected side. The peroneal subdivision of the sciatic nerve is typically involved disproportionately to the tibial counterpart.

            "content": "Once walking is attempted, usually at a much later date than usual, the characteristic stance and gait become manifest. The slightly flexed legs are advanced stiffly in short steps, each describing part of an arc of a circle; adduction of the thighs is often so strong that the legs may actually cross (scissors gait); the feet are flexed and turned in with the heels not touching the floor. In the adolescent and adult, the legs tend to be short and small, but the muscles are not markedly atrophic, as they are in spinal muscular atrophy. Passive manipulation of the limbs reveals spasticity in the extensors and adductors and slight shortening of the calf muscles. The arms may be affected only slightly or not at all, but there may be awkwardness and stiffness of the fingers and, in a few, pronounced weakness and spasticity. In reaching for an object, the hand may overpronate and a grasp may be difficult to release. Speech may be well articulated or noticeably slurred, and in some instances"

            "content": "The following day the patient was sent home, but returned to the clinic after 2 weeks complaining of problems walking. On examination there was absence of dorsiflexion, a sensory disturbance over the lateral aspect of the leg and foot, and obvious wasting of the fibular muscles. As the patient walked, the foot was dragged between steps. A clinical diagnosis of footdrop was made and a common fibular nerve injury was diagnosed. The injury occurred at the time of surgery."
