A total of 5000 patients with essential hypertension are enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two groups: 2500 patients receive the new drug and 2500 patients receive placebo.

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of alpha (\\u03b1) and its relationship with Type I error rate in hypothesis testing. The alpha level (\\u03b1) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. A smaller alpha level (e.g., 0.01) means a smaller Type I error rate, which in turn means that the study requires more precise results to achieve statistical significance. On the other hand, a larger alpha level (e.g., 0.05) means a larger Type I error rate, which allows for more imprecise results to achieve statistical significance. Given that the alpha is set at 0.01 instead of 0.05, we can expect that the study will have more stringent requirements for statistical significance. This means that the study will have less power to detect significant findings, as it requires more precise results to achieve statistical significance. Therefore, the most likely result is that the study will have decreased power to detect significant findings, which corresponds to option C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

In both non-diabetic and diabetic hypertensive patients, most trials have failed to show significant differences in cardiovascular outcomes with different drug regimens as long as equivalent decreases in blood pressure were achieved. For example, the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) demonstrated that the occurrence of CHD and nonfatal myocardial infarction, as well as overall mortality, was virtually identical in hypertensive patients treated with either an ACEI (lisinopril), a diuretic (chlorthalidone), or a calcium antagonist (amlodipine)."

Labetalol, a competitive \u03b1 and \u03b2 antagonist, is effective in hypertension, although its ultimate role is yet to be determined. Use of these agents is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 11. There is some evidence that drugs in this class may be less effective in the elderly and in individuals of African ancestry.

Bupropion and naltrexone (ContraveTM)\u2014a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and an opioid receptor antagonist, respectively\u2014are theoretically combined to dampen the motivation/reinforcement that food brings (dopamine effect) and the pleasure/palatability of eating (opioid effect). In the COR-1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 1742 enrolled participants, who were 18\u201365 years of age and had BMIs of 30\u201345 kg/m2, were randomized to receive naltrexone (16 mg/d) plus bupropion (360 mg/d), naltrexone (32 mg/d) plus bupropion (360 mg/d), or placebo. Mean change in body weight for the three groups was 5.0%, 6.1%, and 1.3%, respectively. The most common adverse events were nausea, headache, constipation, dizziness, vomiting, and dry mouth. However, the FDA rejected the drug in 2011 because of cardiovascular concerns and concluded that a large-scale study of the long-term"

Stage 1 hypertension 140\u2013159 or 90\u201399 Yes Thiazide diuretics for most patients; ACEIs, ARBs, \u03b2-blockers, CCBs, or a combination may be considered. Stage 2 hypertension \u2265 160 or \u2265 100 Yes Two-drug combination for most patients (usually a thiazide diuretic plus an ACEI, an ARB, a \u03b2-blocker, or a CCB). Hypertensive crises are diagnosed on the basis of the extent of end-organ damage, not BP measurement. Rule out 2\u00b0 causes of hypertension, particularly in younger patients. Begin with lifestyle modifications (e.g., weight loss, smoking cessation, salt reduction). Weight loss is the single most effective lifestyle modification. The BP goal in otherwise healthy patients is < 140/< 90. The goal in diabetics or patients with renal disease with proteinuria is < 130/< 80."
