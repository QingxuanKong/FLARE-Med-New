    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the characteristics of bees and hummingbirds and how they interact with flowers. Bees are important pollinators of many plant species, but they are generally attracted to flowers with certain characteristics that make it easy for them to access nectar and pollen. These characteristics include ultraviolet (UV) patterns on the petals, which serve as a guide for bees as they navigate to the nectar. Hummingbirds, on the other hand, are also important pollinators, but they are generally attracted to flowers with red or purple colors, which are more visible to them. Given these differences in flower characteristics, we can infer that a flower with pendant (hanging) red-colored flowers would be more attractive to hummingbirds than to bees, thus limiting pollination by bees and promoting pollination by hummingbirds.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

When a bee stings a foe, its stinging apparatus and attached venom sac tear loose from its body. Muscular contraction of the venom sac continues to inject venom into the skin. Other kinds of bees, ants, and wasps have smooth stinging mechanisms and can sting numerous times in succession. Honeybees, bumblebees, and social wasps generally attack only when a colony is disturbed. Africanized honeybees (now present in South and Central America and the southern and western United States) respond to minimal intrusions more aggressively. Whereas the sting of an Africanized bee contains less venom than that of its non-Africanized relatives, victims tend to sustain far more stings and therefore to receive a far greater overall volume of venom. Most patients who report having sustained a \u201cbee sting,\u201d however, are more likely to have encountered stinging wasps instead."

            "content": "Yet another factor affecting beta diversity is spatial location within a habitat. Several surveys show that the skin harbors bacterial communities with predictable, albeit complex, biogeographic features. To determine whether these differences are due to differences in local environmental factors, to the history of a given site\u2019s exposure to microbes, or to a combination of the two, reciprocal microbiota transplantation has been performed. Microbial communities from one region of the skin were depleted by treatment with germicidal agents, and the region (plot) was inoculated with a \u201cforeign\u201d microbiota harvested from different regions of the skin or from different body habitats from the same or another individual. Community assembly at the site of transplantation was then tracked over time. Remarkably, assembly proceeded differently at different sites: forearm plots receiving a tongue microbiota remained more similar to tongue communities than to native forearm communities in terms of"

What might this suggest? 24\u20135 It would be disastrous if a complement attack were not confined to the surface of the pathogen that is the target of the attack. Yet, the proteolytic cascade involved in the attack liberates biologically active molecules at several steps: one that diffuses away and one that remains bound to the target surface. How does the complement reaction remain localized when active products leave the surface?"

            "content": "Genetics Gem: FH is caused by hundreds of different mutations in the gene for the LDL receptor (on chromosome 19) that affect receptor amount and/or function. FH is an autosomal-dominant disease in which homozygotes are more seriously affected than heterozygotes. Heterozygous FH has an incidence of ~1:500 in the general population. It is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Genetic screening of the first-degree relatives of BJ would identify affected individuals for treatment. Review Questions: Choose the ONE best answer. RQ1. Triacylglycerols are glycerol-based lipids. Which of the following is also a glycerol-based lipid? A. Ganglioside GM2 B. Phosphatidylcholine C. Prostaglandin PGI2 D. Sphingomyelin E. Vitamin D RQ2. Statins are of benefit to patients with hypercholesterolemia because they: A. decrease a rate-limiting and regulated step of de novo cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase."
