The most appropriate initial method to investigate this lesion should be chosen based on its characteristics. Fine-needle aspiration (C) is generally recommended for nodules that are larger than 1 cm in diameter, fixed, or have suspicious ultrasound features. However, the nodule in this case is freely movable, which is less suspicious for malignancy. A nuclear thyroid scan (A) and iodine-131 scan (B) are not typically used for the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules. Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland (D) is useful for evaluating the size, location, and characteristics of the nodule, but it does not provide a definitive diagnosis. In this case, since the nodule is freely movable, the most appropriate initial method to investigate this lesion is ultrasonography of the thyroid gland to assess its size, location, and characteristics. However, the next step would be fine-needle aspiration if the ultrasound features are suspicious for malignancy or if the nodule is larger than 1 cm in diameter.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Similarly, the insidious onset of hypothyroidism\u2014 with mental slowing, fatigue, dry skin, and other features\u2014can be difficult to distinguish from similar, nonspecific findings in the general population. Clinical judgment that is based on knowledge of disease prevalence and pathophysiology is required to decide when to embark on more extensive evaluation of these disorders. Laboratory testing plays an essential role in endocrinology by allowing quantitative assessment of hormone levels and dynamics. Radiologic imaging tests such as computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), thyroid scan, and ultrasound are also used for the diagnosis of endocrine disorders. However, these tests generally are employed only after a hormonal abnormality has been established by biochemical testing."

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

The \u201cdescent\u201d of the thyroid is intimately connected with the development of the hyoid bone. Residual thyroid tis-sue left behind during the migration may persist and subse-quently present in the midline of the neck as a thyroglossal duct cyst. The mass is most commonly appreciated in the 2to 4-year-old child when the baby fat disappears and irregulari-ties in the neck become more readily apparent. Usually the cyst is encountered in the midline at or below the level of the hyoid bone and moves up and down with swallowing or with protrusion of the tongue. Occasionally it presents as an intrathyroidal mass. Most thyroglossal duct cysts are asymp-tomatic. If the duct retains its connection with the pharynx, infection may occur, and the"

Cancer Nodules may be demonstrated on ultrasound in approximately 50% of 60-year-olds. The vast majority of nodules when discovered are asymptomatic and benign; however, malignancy and hyperthyroidism must be excluded (52). Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration is recommended in the presence of the following factors: history of radiation to the head, neck, or upper chest; family history of thyroid cancer; ultrasound findings suggestive of malignancy; or a nodule larger than 1.5 cm in diameter (53)."
