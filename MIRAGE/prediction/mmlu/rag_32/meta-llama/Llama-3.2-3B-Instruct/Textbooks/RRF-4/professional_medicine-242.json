The three main causes are (1) alveolar rupture with dissection of air into the mediastinum; (2) perforation or rupture of the esophagus, trachea, or main bronchi; and (3) dissection of air from the neck or the abdomen into the mediastinum. Typically, there is severe substernal chest pain with or without radiation into the neck and arms. The physical examination usually reveals subcutaneous emphysema in the suprasternal notch and Hamman\u2019s sign, which is a crunching or clicking noise synchronous with the heartbeat and is best heard in the left lateral decubitus position. The diagnosis is confirmed with the chest radiograph. Usually no treatment is required, but the mediastinal air will be absorbed faster if the patient inspires high concentrations of oxygen. If mediastinal structures are compressed, the compression can be relieved with needle aspiration."

The multiple dilated veins around the neck are indicative of venous obstruction. The veins are dilated on both sides of the neck, implying that the obstruction must be within a common vessel, the superior vena cava. Anterior to the superior vena cava in the right side of the chest is the phrenic nerve, which supplies the diaphragm. Because the diaphragm is elevated, suggesting paralysis, it is clear that the phrenic nerve has been involved with the tumor. A 35-year-old man was shot during an armed robbery. The bullet entry wound was in the right fourth intercostal space, above the nipple. A chest radiograph obtained on admission to the emergency room demonstrated complete collapse of the lung.

Three common pathological processes may occur in the pleural cavity. If air is introduced into the pleural cavity, a pneumothorax develops and the lung collapses because of its own elastic recoil. The pleural space fills with air, which may further compress the lung. Most patients with a collapsed lung are unlikely to have respiratory impairment. Under certain conditions, air may enter the pleural cavity at such a rate that it shifts and pushes the mediastinum to the opposite side of the chest. This is called tension pneumothorax and is potentially lethal, requiring urgent treatment by insertion of an intercostal tube to remove the air. The commonest causes of pneumothorax are rib fractures and positive pressure ventilation lung damage."

Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a"

The child should be admitted to the hospital and given intravenous (IV) fluids until endoscopy. Thetrue extent of burns may not be endoscopically apparent immediately, but delayed endoscopy can increase the risk of perforation. Most endoscopists perform the initial endoscopy soonafter injury, when the patient has been stabilized. The extent ofinjury and severity of the burn should be carefully determined.Risk of subsequent esophageal strictures is related to the degreeof burn and whether the injury is circumferential. A nasogastric tube can be placed over a guidewire at the timeof the initial endoscopy to provide a route for feeding and to stent the esophagus. Systemic steroid use has not beenfound to be beneficial in reducing stricture formation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be prescribed if infection is suspected."

Consequently, this abnormality is often confused with typical GERD. Surgical reduction of the hernia results in relief of the dysphagia in 91% of patients.DiagnosisA chest X-ray with the patient in the upright position can diag-nose a hiatal hernia if it shows an air-fluid level behind the car-diac shadow. This is usually caused by a PEH or an intrathoracic stomach. The accuracy of the upper GI barium study in detect-ing a paraesophageal hiatal hernia is greater than for a sliding hernia because the latter can often spontaneously reduce. The paraesophageal hiatal hernia is a permanent herniation of the stomach into the thoracic cavity, so a barium swallow provides the diagnosis in virtually every case. Attention should be focused on the position of the GEJ, when seen, to differentiate it from a type II hernia (see Fig. 25-39B and C)."

When any doubt exists about the status of the pleural space at the site of puncture, the wound is enlarged bluntly to admit a finger, which can be swept around the immediately adjacent pleural space to assess the situation and break down any adhesions. The tube is inserted, with the tip directed toward the optimal position suggested by the chest X-rays. In general, a high anterior tube is best for air (pneumothorax), and a low posterior tube is best for fluid. A 28F to 32F tube is adequate for most situations. A 36F tube is preferred for hemothorax or for a viscous empyema. Many surgeons prefer a very small tube (16F to 20F) for drainage of simple pneumothorax. C. The tube is connected to a water-seal drainage system. Suction is added, if necessary, to expand the lung; it usually will be required in a patient with a substantial air leak"
