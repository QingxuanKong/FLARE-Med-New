    "question": "A randomized controlled trial is conducted to assess the effectiveness of a new combination-drug antihypertensive therapy (Drug X) compared with a standard antihypertensive single-drug therapy. Study participants include 140 women (70%) and 60 men (30%) ages 30 to 60 years, with baseline blood pressure measurements of 150/95 mm Hg or higher. The investigators defined antihypertensive therapy as effective if the treatment resulted in a blood pressure measurement below 140/90 mm Hg. When designing the study, the investigators set the probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy as 1%; they set the probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same as 10%. Which of the following is the most accurate estimate of the statistical power in this study?",

    "predict": "To calculate the statistical power of the study, we need to use the concept of type I error (\u03b1) and type II error (\u03b2). The given probabilities are: - Type I error (\u03b1) = 1% (probability of wrongly finding that Drug X is more effective than the standard therapy) - Type II error (\u03b2) = 10% (probability of wrongly finding that the effectiveness of the two drugs is the same) The statistical power of the study (1 - \u03b2) is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis that the two drugs have the same effectiveness. To calculate the statistical power, we can use the following formula: Statistical Power = 1 - \u03b2 However, we need to know the effect size (\u0394) of the study. Unfortunately, the problem doesn't provide the effect size. But we can use the following formula to estimate the effect size: Effect Size (\u0394) = (Standard Deviation of Difference) / (Standard Deviation of Single-Drug Therapy) Since we don't have the standard deviations, we can assume a moderate effect size for this problem. Let's assume a moderate effect size of 10 mmHg (a reasonable estimate for antihypertensive therapy). Now, we can use the following formula to estimate the statistical power: Statistical Power = 1 - \u03b2 = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 However, this is not the final answer. We need to adjust for the effect size. A commonly used adjustment is the formula: Statistical Power = 1 - \u03b2 = 1 - (1 - (Effect Size / (2 \\* Standard Deviation of Single-Drug Therapy))) Assuming a moderate effect size of 10 mmHg and a standard deviation of 10 mmHg (a reasonable estimate for antihypertensive therapy): Statistical Power = 1 - \u03b2 = 1 - (1 - (10 / (2 \\* 10))) = 1 - (1 - 0.5) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 However, this is still not the final answer. We need to use the given probabilities to calculate the statistical power. We can use the following formula: Statistical Power = 1 - (1 - (1 - \u03b1) \\* (1 - (1 - \u03b2))) Plugging in the values: Statistical Power = 1 - (1 - (1 - 0.01) \\* (1 - 0.10)) = 1 - (1 - 0.99 \\* 0.90) = 1 - (1 - 0.891) = 1 - 0.109 = 0.891 To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100: Statistical Power \u2248 89.1% Rounding to the nearest answer choice, the most accurate estimate of the statistical power is: D. 90%",

A meta-analysis of more than 30 randomized trials of blood pressure\u2013lowering therapy indicates that for a given reduction in blood pressure, the major drug classes seem to produce similar overall net effects on total cardiovascular events. In both non-diabetic and diabetic hypertensive patients, most trials have failed to show significant differences in cardiovascular outcomes with different drug regimens as long as equivalent decreases in blood pressure were achieved. For example, the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) demonstrated that the occurrence of CHD and nonfatal myocardial infarction, as well as overall mortality, was virtually identical in hypertensive patients treated with either an ACEI (lisinopril), a diuretic (chlorthalidone), or a calcium antagonist (amlodipine)."

However, most patients with hypertension require two or more drugs acting by different mechanisms (polypharmacy). Accord-ing to some estimates, up to 40% of patients may respond inad-equately even to two agents and are considered to have \u201cresistant hypertension.\u201d Some of these patients have treatable secondary hypertension that has been missed, but most do not, and three or more drugs are required. One rationale for polypharmacy in hypertension is that most drugs evoke compensatory regulatory mechanisms for main-taining blood pressure (see Figures 6\u20137 and 11\u20131), which may markedly limit their effect. For example, vasodilators such as hydralazine cause a significant decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, but evoke a strong compensatory tachycardia and salt and water retention (Figure 11\u20134) that"

Moreover, antihypertensive therapy in nonpregnant reproductive-aged women with sustained diastolic pressures ::90 mm Hg is considered standard. Not clear from these observations, however, is what constitutes the best management for women being treated who contemplate pregnancy, for those undergoing treatment who become pregnant, or for those first identified to have chronic hypertension during pregnancy (August, 2015). In these women, the benefits and safety of instituting antihypertensive therapy are less clear, as subsequently discussed on page 981."

            "content": "Diuretics are effective in lowering blood pressure by 10\u201315 mm Hg in most patients, and diuretics alone often provide adequate treatment for mild or moderate essential hypertension. In more severe hypertension, diuretics are used in combination with sympathoplegic and vasodilator drugs to control the tendency toward sodium retention caused by these agents. Vascular responsiveness\u2014ie, the ability to either constrict or dilate\u2014is diminished by sympathoplegic and vasodilator drugs, so that the vasculature behaves like an inflexible tube. As a consequence, blood pressure becomes exquisitely sensitive to blood volume. Thus, in severe hypertension, when multiple drugs are used, blood pressure may be well controlled when blood volume is 95% of normal but much too high when blood volume is 105% of normal. Use of Diuretics"

Individuals with white coat hypertension may not benefit from drug therapy, although they may be more likely to develop sustained hypertension over time. Masked hypertension should be suspected when normal or even low blood pressures are recorded in patients with advanced atherosclerotic disease, especially when evidence of target organ damage is present or bruits are audible."

For example, among hypertensive patients with diabetes and coronary heart disease, \u201ctight control\u201d of systolic blood pressure (<130 mmHg) is not associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes. The concept of a \u201cJ-curve\u201d suggests that the risk of cardiovascular events increases at blood pressures that are either too high or too low. Theoretically blood pressures that are too low may exceed the autoregulatory capacity of cerebral, coronary, and renal blood flows. There is some suggestive evidence from recent randomized clinical trials for a J-shaped relationship between blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes (including all-cause mortality) in high-risk patients. Consequently, caution should be exercised in lowering blood pressure <130/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes, CHD, and other high-risk patients.

However, many vascular neurologists recommend that guidelines for secondary prevention of stroke should aim for blood pressure reduction to 130/80 mmHg or lower. The presence of known cerebrovascular disease is not a contraindication to treatment aimed at achieving normotension. Also, the value of treating systolic hypertension in older patients has been clearly established. Lowering blood pressure to levels below those traditionally defining hypertension appears to reduce the risk of stroke even further. Data are particularly strong in support of thiazide diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors."
