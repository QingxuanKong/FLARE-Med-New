Although no molecular oxygen is used in glycolysis, oxidation occurs, in that electrons are removed by NAD+ (producing NADH) from some of the carbons derived from the glucose molecule. The stepwise nature of the process releases the energy of oxidation in small packets, so that much of it can be stored in activated carrier molecules rather than all of it being released as heat (see Figure 2\u201345). Thus, some of the energy released by oxidation drives the direct synthesis of ATP molecules from ADP and Pi, and some remains with the electrons in the electron carrier NADH."

Understandably, normal tissues with a greater glycolytic capacity because of the presence of glycogen (e.g., the liver and striated muscle) are more likely to survive hypoxia and decreased oxidative phosphorylation than tissues with limited glucose stores (e.g., the brain). Although it seems counterintuitive, rapidly proliferating normal cells and cancer cells rely on aerobic glycolysis to produce much of their energy, a phenomenon referred to as the Warburg effect. The reason for this is that although glycolysis yields less ATP per molecule of glucose burned than oxidative phosphorylation, metabolites generated by glycolysis and the TCA cycle serve as precursors for the synthesis of cellular constituents (e.g., proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids) that are needed for cell growth and division. Alterations in cellular metabolism are frequently seen in cancer cells, so they are discussed in more detail in Chapter 6."

During a prolonged fast, however, hepatic glycogen stores are depleted, and glucose is made from noncarbohydrate precursors. The formation of glucose does not occur by a simple reversal of glycolysis, because the overall equilibrium of glycolysis strongly favors pyruvate formation (that is, the change in standard free energy [\u2206G0] is negative). Instead, glucose is synthesized de novo by a special pathway, gluconeogenesis, which requires both mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes.

This series of ten reactions is called aerobic glycolysis because O2 is required to reoxidize the NADH formed during the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (Fig. 8.9B). Aerobic glycolysis sets the stage for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, a major fuel of the TCA cycle.

These irreversible reactions, which together are unique to gluconeogenesis, are described below. A. Pyruvate carboxylation The first roadblock to overcome in the synthesis of glucose from pyruvate is the irreversible conversion in glycolysis of PEP to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase (PK). In gluconeogenesis, pyruvate is carboxylated by pyruvate carboxylase (PC) to OAA, which is converted to PEP by PEPcarboxykinase (PEPCK) (Fig. 10.3). mitochondrial and cytosolic isozymes of malate dehydrogenase; GTP and GDP = guanosine tri-and diphosphates; ADP = adenosine diphosphate."

Correct answer = C. Pyruvate is carboxylated to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase, a biotin-requiring enzyme. B (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) requires thiamine pyrophosphate, lipoic acid, flavin and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides (FAD and NAD+), and coenzyme A; D (transaminase) requires pyridoxal phosphate; E (lactate dehydrogenase) requires NADH. 0.3.

Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate oxidation The conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase is the first oxidation-reduction reaction of glycolysis (Fig. 8.18). [Note: Because there is a limited amount of NAD+ in the cell, the NADH formed by the dehydrogenase reaction must be oxidized for glycolysis to continue. Two major mechanisms for oxidizing NADH to NAD+ are the reduction of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (anaerobic, see p. 96) and the electron transport chain ([ETC] aerobic, see p. 74). Because NADH cannot cross the inner mitochondrial membrane, the ETC requires the malate-aspartate and glycerol 3-phosphate substrate shuttles to move NADH reducing equivalents into the mitochondrial matrix (see p. 79).] 1."
