Creatine is a substance that provides a small but rapidly mobilized reserve of high-energy phosphates to maintain the intracellular level of ATP during intense muscular contraction. It is synthesized in the liver and kidneys from glycine and the guanidino group of arginine, plus a methyl group from SAM. Creatine supplementation is commonly used by athletes and bodybuilders to increase muscle mass and endurance. However, like any supplement, it can cause some side effects. Let's examine the options given in the question to determine the expected side effect of creatine supplementation.\\n\\nOption A: Muscle weakness. While creatine supplementation can cause muscle cramps, it is not typically associated with muscle weakness. In fact, creatine is often used to improve muscle strength and endurance.\\n\\nOption B: Gain in body mass. Creatine supplementation is known to increase muscle mass, as it provides a readily available source of energy for muscle contractions. This is a well-documented effect of creatine supplementation.\\n\\nOption C: Muscle cramps. Muscle cramps are a known side effect of creatine supplementation, particularly when taken in high doses or without adequate hydration. This is because creatine can cause an increase in muscle sodium and potassium levels, leading to muscle cramps.\\n\\nOption D: Loss of electrolytes. Creatine supplementation can cause a slight increase in muscle sodium and potassium levels, but this is not typically considered a significant loss of electrolytes.\\n\\nBased on the information provided, the expected side effect of creatine supplementation is a gain in body mass, as it is known to increase muscle mass and endurance.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Creatine Creatine phosphate (also called phosphocreatine), the phosphorylated derivative of creatine found in muscle, is a high-energy compound that provides a small but rapidly mobilized reserve of high-energy phosphates that can be reversibly transferred to adenosine diphosphate (Fig. 21.19) to maintain the intracellular level of ATP during the first few minutes of intense muscular contraction.

Synthesis: Creatine is synthesized in the liver and kidneys from glycine and the guanidino group of arginine, plus a methyl group from SAM (see Fig. 21.19). Animal products are dietary sources. Creatine is reversibly phosphorylated to creatine phosphate by creatine kinase, using ATP as the phosphate donor. [Note: The presence of creatine kinase (MB isozyme) in the plasma is indicative of heart damage and is used in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (see p. 65).] 2."

If taken by either parent at the time of conception, colchicine may cause a small increase in the risk of trisomy 21 (Down\u2019s syndrome). In elderly patients with renal insufficiency, colchicine can cause a myoneuropathy characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevation of the creatine kinase. Cyclosporine inhibits hepatic excretion of colchicine by its effects on the MDR-1 transport system, sometimes leading to colchicine toxicity in patients who have undergone renal transplantation for amyloidosis. Intravenous colchicine should generally not be administered to patients already taking oral colchicine, because severe, sometimes fatal, toxicity can occur in this setting."

It is important to note that this decline is not reflected in an equivalent rise in serum creatinine because the production of creatinine is also reduced as muscle mass declines with age; therefore, serum creatinine alone is not an adequate measure of renal function. The practical result of this change is marked prolongation of the half-life of many drugs, and the possibility of accumulation to toxic levels if dosage is not reduced in size or frequency.

The creatine phosphokinase in the thick filament may participate in the rapid resynthesis of ATP near the myosin heads during muscle contraction. The phosphate store created, however, is only about five times the size of the ATP store and thus cannot support prolonged periods of contraction (less than a minute of maximal muscle activity). Skeletal muscle fatigue during intense exercise is associated with depletion of the creatine phosphate store, although as described subsequently, this does not necessarily imply that the fatigue is caused by depletion of the creatine phosphate store.

Rarely, hypersensitivity syndromes have been reported that include a lupus-like disorder, dermatomyositis, peripheral neuropathy, and autoimmune myopathy. The latter presents as severe pain and weakness in proximal muscles that does not remit when the statin is discontinued. It is HMG-CoA reductase antibody positive and requires immunosuppressive treatment."

Anticholinergic and parkinsonian symptoms respond well to trihexyphenidyl, 2 mg bid, or benztropine mesylate, 1\u20132 mg bid. Akathisia may respond to beta blockers. In rare cases, more serious and occasionally life-threatening side effects may emerge, including hyperprolactinemia, ventricular arrhythmias, gastrointestinal obstruction, retinal pigmentation, obstructive jaundice, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by hyperthermia, autonomic dysfunction, muscular rigidity, and elevated creatine phosphokinase levels). The most serious adverse effects of clozapine are agranulocytosis, which has an incidence of 1%, and induction of seizures, which has an incidence of 10%. Weekly white blood cell counts are required, particularly during the first 3 months of treatment."

Protein consumed in excess of the body\u2019s needs is deaminated, and the resulting carbon skeletons are metabolized to provide energy or acetyl coenzyme A for fatty acid synthesis. When excess protein is eliminated from the body as urinary nitrogen, it is often accompanied by increased urinary calcium, thereby increasing the risk of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) and osteoporosis. 2."

The ATP pool in skeletal muscle is small and capable of supporting only a few contractions if not replenished. This pool, however, is continually replenished during contraction, as described later, so that even when the muscle fatigues, ATP stores are only modestly decreased. Muscle cells contain creatine phosphate, which is used to convert ADP to ATP and thus replenish the ATP store during muscle contraction. The creatine phosphate store represents the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise. The enzyme creatine phosphokinase catalyzes the reaction:"

            "content": "The most commonly used medication for initial blood pressure reduction is a thiazide diuretic. The mechanism of action is to reduce plasma and extracellular \ufb02uid volume. This lowering of volume is thought to decrease peripheral resistance. Cardiac output initially decreases and then normalizes (25). The important long-term effect is a slight decrease in extracellular \ufb02uid volume. The maximum therapeutic dose of thiazides should be lowered to 25 mg, rather than the commonly used 50 mg. The benefit of higher doses is eliminated by the corresponding increase in side effects. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride) are available in fixed doses and should be prescribed to prevent the development of hypokalemia. Potassium supplementation is less effective than the use of potassium-sparing agents. Thiazide diuretics are best used in patients with creatinine levels less than 2.5 g/L. Loop diuretics (furosemide) work better than thiazide diuretics at lower"
