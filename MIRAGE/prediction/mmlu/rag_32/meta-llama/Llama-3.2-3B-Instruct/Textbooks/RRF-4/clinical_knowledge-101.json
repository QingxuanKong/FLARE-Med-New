Lack of intrinsic factor disables ileal vitamin B12 absorption, leading to B12 deficiency and a particular form of megaloblastic anemia called pernicious anemia (Chapter 12).

Hence hypokalemia inhibits Na+,K+-ATPase, decreases the electrochemical driving force for efflux of K+ across the apical membrane, reduces permeability of the apical membrane to K+ , and decreases plasma aldosterone levels. Chronic hypokalemia (plasma [K+] < 3.5 mEq/L) occurs most often in patients who receive diuretics for hypertension. Hypokalemia also occurs in patients who vomit, undergo nasogastric suction, have diarrhea, abuse laxatives, or have hyperaldosteronism. Hypokalemia occurs because excretion of K+ by the kidneys exceeds dietary intake of K+ . Vomiting, nasogastric suction, diuretics, and diarrhea can all decrease ECF volume (ECFV), which in turn stimulates secretion of aldosterone (see ). Because aldosterone stimulates excretion of K+ by the kidneys, its action contributes to development of hypokalemia."

Consequently, plasma osmolarity and sodium rise often to extremely high levels before the disorder is recognized. In most cases, urinary loss of water contributes little, if any, to the dehydration because AVP continues to be secreted in the small amounts necessary to concentrate the urine. In some patients this appears to be due to hypovolemic stimulation and/or incomplete destruction of AVP osmoreceptors because plasma AVP declines and DI develops during rehydration (Fig. 404-6). In others, however, plasma AVP does not decline during rehydration even if they are overhydrated. Consequently, they develop a hyponatremic syndrome indistinguishable from inappropriate antidiuresis. This suggests that the AVP osmoreceptors normally provide inhibitory and stimulatory input to the neurohypophysis and the patients can no longer osmotically stimulate or suppress tonic"

            "content": "Clinical Characteristics Hypodipsic hypernatremia is a syndrome characterized by chronic or recurrent hypertonic dehydration. The hypernatremia varies widely in severity and usually is associated with signs adipsic hypernatremia (AH) and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). Each line depicts schematically the relationship of plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) to plasma osmolarity during water loading and/or infusion of 3% saline in a patient with either AH (open symbols) or SIAD (closed symbols). The shaded area indicates the normal range of the relationship. The horizontal broken line indicates the plasma AVP level below which the hormone is undetectable and urinary concentration usually does not occur. Lines P and T represent patients with a selective deficiency in the osmoregulation of thirst and AVP that is either partial ( ) or total ( ). In the latter, plasma AVP does not change in response to increases or decreases in plasma osmolarity but remains within a range"

The most common cause is chronic H pylori infection, particularly in the corporal distribution (as opposed to the antral distribution which is more typically associated with peptic ulcer disease). Auto-immune destruction of cells (pernicious anemia) and chemical irritation (e.g., bile reflux) can also result in atrophic gastritis. Some patients with atrophic gastritis develop intestinal meta-plasia in the gastric mucosa that may progress to dysplasia and then to gastric cancer. Numerous cofactors have been impli-cated, including diet, altered gastric microbiome, genetics, and hypergastrinemia.

Dioxins and PCBs can cause skin disorders such as folliculitis and acneiform dermatosis known as chloracne, which consists of acne, cyst formation, hyperpigmentation, and hyperkeratosis, generally around the face and behind the ears. It can be accompanied by abnormalities in the liver and CNS. Because PCBs induce the P-450 enzyme system, workers exposed to these substances may show altered drug metabolism. Environmental disasters in Japan and China in the late 1960s caused by the consumption of rice oil contaminated by PCBs poisoned about 2000 people in each episode. The primary manifestations of the disease (yusho in Japan, yu-cheng in China) were chloracne and hyperpigmentation of the skin and nails."
