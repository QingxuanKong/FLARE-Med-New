    "question": "A 37-year-old Anglo-American man is admitted to the hospital for treatment for cocaine dependency. He says he has tried repeatedly to abstain from cocaine use but lives in a part of town where there are heavy drug sales. He did not like his hospital outpatient group but liked his single session at Cocaine Anonymous. Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 70/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 125/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a thin man with good muscle strength and no focal neurologic deficits. The patient is using insurance coverage through his wife but does not wish for his diagnosis to be disclosed to anyone. He is on probation after a conviction for aggravated robbery 3 years ago. There is also a warrant for his arrest for assault and battery. After listening to his requests and weighing your obligations, you should disclose this patient's diagnosis only to which of the following?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine who should be disclosed the patient's diagnosis of cocaine dependency, we need to consider the patient's rights and the purpose of disclosure. The patient has the right to confidentiality, but there may be exceptions where disclosure is necessary to protect others from harm. In this case, the patient is on probation and has a warrant for his arrest, which suggests that he may be a risk to himself or others. Disclosure to his probation officer and the authorities may be necessary to ensure public safety. However, the patient has also expressed a desire to keep his diagnosis confidential, and disclosure to his insurance company may not be necessary for his treatment. Disclosure to his Cocaine Anonymous sponsor may be appropriate, as they can provide support and guidance, but it is not as critical as disclosure to the authorities in this case. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is to disclose the patient's diagnosis to his probation officer, as it is necessary to ensure public safety and may be required by law.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

In addition to generalized seizures, neurologic complications may include headache, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Disorders of cerebral blood flow and perfusion in cocaine-dependent persons have been detected with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Inhalation of crack cocaine may lead to severe pulmonary disease due to the direct effects of cocaine and to residual contaminants in the smoked material. Hepatic necrosis may occur following chronic crack/cocaine use. Protracted cocaine abuse may also cause paranoid ideation and visual and auditory hallucinations, a state that resembles alcoholic hallucinosis."

Cocaine is abused intranasally (\u201csnorted\u201d), smoked, or injected intravenously or intramuscularly. There has been an alarming escalation in the use of cocaine, mainly because a relatively pure and inexpensive form of the free alkaloid base (\u201ccrack\u201d) became readily available in the 1980s. This form of cocaine is heat-stable and therefore suitable for smoking. According to the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, there are an estimated 600,000 frequent cocaine users in the United States. (Frequent use was arbitrarily defined as use on 51 or more days during the preceding year.) The number of occasional users (less than 12 days in the preceding year) was 2.4 million.

Body temperature usually increases following cocaine administration, and high doses of cocaine may induce lethal pyrexia or hypertension. Because cocaine inhibits reuptake of catecholamines at adrenergic nerve endings, it potentiates sympathetic nervous system activity. Cocaine has a short plasma half-life of approximately 45\u201360 min. Cocaine is metabolized by plasma esterases, and cocaine metabolites are excreted in urine. The brief duration of the euphorigenic effects of cocaine reported by chronic abusers is probably due to both acute and chronic tolerance. Cocaine may be used as often as two to three times per hour. Alcohol is often used to modulate both the cocaine high and the dysphoria associated with the abrupt disappearance of cocaine\u2019s effects.

This calm attitude toward a turbulent illness and seemingly disabling physical signs is so common that it has been singled out as an important characteristic of hysteria, la belle indifference. Other patients, however, are obviously tense and anxious and report frank anxiety attacks. Emotional reactions are superficial and scenes that are disturbing to others are quickly forgotten. Claims of early life sexual or physical abuse are common and often prove to be true, or sometimes are not valid; when present, they probably play a role in the genesis of some cases (see further on)."

Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

            "content": "A sense of well-being, euphoria, loquacity, and restlessness are the familiar effects. Pharmacologically, cocaine is thought to act like the tricyclic antidepressants; that is, it blocks the presynaptic reuptake of biogenic amines, thus producing vasoconstriction, hypertension, and tachycardia and predisposing to generalized tremor, myoclonus, seizures, and psychotic behavior. It has an additional weaker action, similar to amphetamines, of causing the release of endogenous monoamines. The cocaine abuser readily develops psychologic dependence and habituation, that is, an inability to abstain from frequent compulsive use. The manifestations of physical dependence are more subtle and difficult to recognize. Nevertheless, abstinence from cocaine following a period of chronic abuse is regularly attended by insomnia, restlessness, anorexia, depression, hyperprolactinemia, and signs of dopaminergic hypersensitivity\u2014a symptom complex that constitutes an identifiable withdrawal syndrome."
