In the case of vestibular disorders, the physical symptoms depend on whether the lesion is unilateral or bilateral, and whether it is acute or chronic and progressive. Vertigo, an illusion of self or environmental motion, implies asymmetry of vestibular inputs from the two labyrinths or in their central pathways that is usually acute. Symmetric bilateral vestibular hypofunction causes imbalance but no vertigo. Because of the ambiguity in patients\u2019 descriptions of their symptoms, diagnosis based simply on symptom characteristics is typically unreliable. The history should focus closely on other features, including whether this is the first attack, the duration of this and any prior episodes, provoking factors, and accompanying symptoms."

Unilateral hearing loss and other aural symptoms (ear pain, pressure, fullness) typically point to a peripheral cause. Because the auditory pathways quickly become bilateral upon entering the brainstem, central lesions are unlikely to cause unilateral hearing loss, unless the lesion lies near the root entry zone of the auditory nerve. Symptoms such as double vision, numbness, and limb ataxia suggest a brainstem or cerebellar lesion. Because dizziness and imbalance can be a manifestation of a variety of neurologic disorders, the neurologic examination is important in the evaluation of these patients.

When used to describe a sense of spinning or other motion, dizziness is designated as vertigo. Vertigo may be physiologic, occurring during or after a sustained head rotation, or it may be pathologic, due to vestibular dysfunction. The term light-headedness is commonly applied to presyncopal sensations due to brain hypoperfusion but also may refer to disequilibrium and imbalance.

Episodic deafness without vertigo has been called cochlear M\u00e9ni\u00e8re syndrome. As already mentioned, with recurrent attacks, there is a saltatory progressive unilateral hearing loss (in most series only 10 percent of cases involve both ears, but Baloh places the figure closer to 30 percent). Early in the disease, deafness affects mainly the low tones and fluctuates in severity; actually, tones below 500 Hz are affected early on, and this loss is not evident to the patient. Without measurable fluctuations in pure-tone audiometric thresholds, the diagnosis is left uncertain. Later the fluctuations cease and high tones are affected. Speech discrimination is relatively preserved. The attacks of vertigo usually cease when the hearing loss is complete but there may be an interval of months or longer before this occurs. Audiometry reveals a sensorineural type of deafness, with air and bone"

            "content": "Dx: The diagnosis is usually made clinically on the basis of a thorough history and physical exam to exclude other causes. Patients who would otherwise qualify for a diagnosis of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s save the absence of auditory symptoms and documented hearing loss are likely to have vestibular migraine. A history of photoor phonophobia during the episode, particularly if dizziness is associated with headache, is highly suggestive in such patients. The diagnosis is one of exclusion, and care should be taken to ensure that patients do not have intermittent dizziness due to TIA. In patients < 50 years of age, a history of recent trauma or of severe, abrupt-onset, or persistent pain (> 72 hours) should raise concern for vertebral artery dissection with TIAs. A brain MRI with vascular imaging (e.g., MRA) is sometimes indicated to assess potential intracranial pathology, particularly cerebrovascular disease. Episodic ataxia type 2 can be corroborated by genetic testing."

            "content": "Nonvertiginous Types of Dizziness It is important to distinguish vertigo from the more common complaints for which the term dizziness is used by patients. These include the feeling of impending fainting (near syncope), a disorder of gait (disequilibrium), and an ill-defined feeling of lightheadedness. Many patients in the last category who initially complain of dizziness will, on closer questioning, describe his symptoms as a \u201cdistant feeling,\u201d \u201cwalking on air,\u201d \u201cinability to focus,\u201d or some other unnatural sensation in the head. These sensory experiences are particularly common in states characterized by anxiety or panic attacks\u2014often, but not always, with depression."
