Common fracture patterns that should increase the index of suspicion include multiple fractures in different stages of radiographic healing, metaphyseal corner fractures (shaking), fractures too severe for the history, or fractures in nonambulatory infants. Although spiral fractures of long bones were historically considered pathognomic for abuse, they can be seen in nonabuse situations."

Vertebral fractures increase the risk of other vertebral fractures as well as fractures of the peripheral skeleton such as the hip and wrist. Wrist fractures also increase the risk of vertebral and hip fractures. The risk for subsequent fractures is particularly high in the first several years after the first fracture, and the risk wanes considerably thereafter. Consequently, among individuals over age 50, any fracture should be considered as potentially related to osteoporosis regardless of the circumstances of the fracture. Osteoporotic bone is more likely to fracture than normal bone at any level of trauma, and a fracture in a person over 50 should trigger evaluation for osteoporosis.

The thick periosteum may decrease the rate of displaced fractures and stabilize fractures after reduction. Because of the higher proportion of cartilage, the skeletally immature patient can withstand more force before deformation or fracture than adult bone. As children mature into adolescence, the rate of healing slows and approaches that of adults. Buckle or torus fractures occur after compression of the bone; the bony cortex does not truly break. These fractures will typically occur in the metaphysis and are stable fractures that heal in approximately 4 weeks with immobilization.

Vitamin C and scurvy Correct answer = C. The child most likely has osteogenesis imperfecta. Most cases arise from a defect in the genes encoding type I collagen. Bones in affected patients are thin, osteoporotic, often bowed, and extremely prone to fracture. Pulmonary problems are not seen in this child. Individuals with Marfan syndrome have impaired structural integrity of the skeleton, eyes, and cardiovascular system. Defects in type V collagen cause the classic form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome characterized by skin extensibility and fragility and joint hypermobility. Scurvy caused by vitamin C deficiency is characterized by capillary fragility. .2. What is the differential basis of the liver and lung pathology seen in \u03b11antitrypsin deficiency?"

            "content": "it may lead to instability of the elbow and the wrist over time.Olecranon FracturesOlecranon fractures usually occur following a fall directly onto a flexed elbow (Fig. 43-11). Nondisplaced fractures are treated with a splint in 45\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 of flexion for a short time followed by range of motion exercises to prevent stiffness. Because the triceps inserts on the olecranon, the pull of the muscle often causes active extension of the elbow and displacement of the fracture, and therefore the olecranon fracture should be fixed surgically. Simple transverse fractures can be fixed with a tension band construct, which consists of wire passing through the ulna, distal to the fracture, and wrapped in a figure-of-8 fashion around two or more pins placed proximally into the olecranon, crossing and stabilizing the fracture. This tension band construct creates a compressive force across the articular aspect of the fracture that will promote healing. Fractures that are comminuted or have large"

An external fixator is used when the wound is grossly contaminated, and definitive treatment of the wound is delayed until the wound is sufficiently clean. Early wound coverage is"
