Pagetic osteoclasts are large, increased 10to 100-fold in number, and have a greater number of nuclei (as many as 100 compared to 3\u20135 nuclei in the normal osteoclast). The overactive osteoclasts may create a sevenfold increase in resorptive surfaces and an erosion rate of 9 \u03bcg/d (normal is 1 \u03bcg/d). Several causes for the increased number and activity of pagetic osteoclasts have been identified: (1) osteoclastic precursors are hypersensitive to 1,25(OH)2D3; (2) osteoclasts are hyperresponsive to RANK ligand (RANKL), the osteoclast stimulatory factor that mediates the effects of most osteotropic factors on osteoclast formation; (3) marrow stromal cells from pagetic lesions have increased RANKL expression; (4) osteoclast precursor recruitment is increased by interleukin (IL) 6, which is increased in the blood of patients with active Paget\u2019s disease and is overexpressed in"

The cell is conspicuous not only because of its large size but also because of its marked acidophilia. It also exhibits a strong histochemical reaction for acid phosphatase because of the numerous lysosomes that it contains. One of these enzymes, the 35-kilodalton iron-containing tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), is used clinically as a marker of osteoclast activity and differentiation. Osteoclasts are derived from the fusion of mononuclear hemopoietic progenitor cells under the influence of multiple cytokines."

Osteoclasts also secrete cathepsin K, which is a cysteine protease that degrades the bone matrix by cleaving collagen. Stimulation of osteoclasts also contributes to generalized bone loss and osteoporosis."

            "content": "Osteoclasts, located on the surface of bone, are specialized multinucleated macrophages, derived from circulating monocytes, which are responsible for bone resorption ( Fig. 21.2B ). By means of cell surface integrins, osteoclasts attach to bone matrix and create a sealed extracellular trench (resorption pit). The cells secrete acid and neutral proteases (predominantly matrix metalloproteases [MMPs]) into the pit, and these enzymes resorb the bone. During embryogenesis, long bones develop from a cartilage mold by the process of endochondral ossification."
