    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break it down step by step. Gene flow is the movement of individuals with different genetic characteristics from one population to another. This process can have various effects on the genetic makeup of the metapopulation. Let's examine each option given in the context of gene flow.\\n\\nA. An increase in genetic homogeneity in the metapopulation: Gene flow typically leads to the exchange of genetic material between populations, which can result in a loss of genetic variation within the metapopulation. This is because the genetic differences between populations are reduced as individuals with different genetic characteristics move between them. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\\n\\nB. An increase in the rate of deleterious mutations in the metapopulation: Gene flow can lead to the introduction of deleterious mutations into a population, which can increase the rate of deleterious mutations in the metapopulation. This is because individuals with deleterious mutations can move into a population and reproduce, passing on their genetic defects to their offspring. Therefore, option B is correct.\\n\\nC. An increased likelihood of speciation: Gene flow can actually reduce the likelihood of speciation. Speciation occurs when a population becomes reproductively isolated from other populations and develops distinct genetic characteristics. Gene flow can prevent this by allowing gene flow between populations, which can maintain genetic similarity between populations. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\\n\\nD. Disruption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the metapopulation: Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is a theoretical model that describes the expected frequencies of alleles and genotypes in a population under certain conditions. Gene flow can disrupt this equilibrium by introducing new alleles or changing the frequency of existing alleles in a population. However, the primary effect of gene flow is not the disruption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium but rather the introduction of deleterious mutations. Therefore, option D is not the best answer.\\n\\nThe correct answer is B. An increase in the rate of deleterious mutations in the metapopulation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

These selectively neutral mutations can also spread and become fixed in a population, and they make a large contribution to evolutionary change in genomes. For example, as we saw earlier, they account for most of the DNA sequence differences between apes and humans. The spread of neutral mutations is not as rapid as the spread of the rare strongly advantageous mutations. It depends on a random variation in the number of mutation-bearing progeny produced by each mutation-bearing individual, causing changes in the relative frequency of the mutant allele in the population. Through a sort of \u201crandom walk\u201d process, the mutant allele may eventually become extinct, or it may become commonplace. This can be modeled mathematically for an idealized interbreeding population, on the assumption of constant population size and random mating, as well as selective neutrality for the mutations.

This is because there are 2N copies of the gene in the diploid population, and each of them has an equal chance of becoming the predominant version in the long run. For those mutations that do become fixed, the mathematics shows that the average time to fixation is approximately 4N generations. Detailed analyses of data on human genetic variation have suggested an ancestral population size of approximately 10,000 at the time when the current pattern of genetic variation was largely established. With a population that has reached this size, the probability that a new, selectively neutral mutation would become fixed is small (1/20,000), while the average time to fixation would be on the order of 800,000 years (assuming a 20-year generation time).

Among that small group of our ancestors, some individuals will have carried one set of genetic variants, others a different set. The chromosomes of a present-day human represent a shuffled combination of chromosome segments from different members of this small ancestral group of people. Because only about two thousand generations separate us from them, large segments of these ancestral chromosomes have passed from parent to child, unbroken by the crossover events that occur during meiosis. As described in Chapter 5, only a few crossovers occur between each set of homologous chromosomes during each meiosis (see Figure 5\u201353)."

Third, scale-free biologic systems facilitate the flow of information (e.g., metabolite flux) across the system compared with randomly organized biologic systems; this so-called \u201csmall-world\u201d property of the system (in which the clustered nature of the highly linked hubs defines a local neighborhood within the network that communicates through weaker, less frequent links to other clusters) minimizes the energy cost for the dynamic action of the system (e.g., minimizes the transition time between states in a metabolic network)."

If the size of the interbreeding population in which the mutation occurred is N, the initial allele frequency for a new mutation would be 1/(2N) for a diploid organism.

If the mutation has a significantly deleterious effect, it will simply be eliminated by purifying selection and will not become fixed. (In the most extreme case, the individual carrying the mutation will die without producing progeny.) Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population. Because humans reproduce sexually and genetic recombination occurs each time a gamete is formed (discussed in Chapter 5), the genome of each individual who has inherited the mutation will be a unique recombinational mosaic of segments inherited from a large number of ancestors. The selected mutation along with a modest amount of neighboring sequence\u2014ultimately inherited from the individual in which the mutation occurred\u2014will simply be one piece of this huge mosaic."

Although homozygosity for the sickle cell mutation is associated with severe anemia and sickle crises (Chap. 127), heterozygotes have a higher probability of survival because of the reduced morbidity and mortality from malaria; this phenomenon has led to an increased frequency of the mutant allele.

Two human genomes sampled from the modern world population at random will differ at approximately 2.5 \u00d7 106 such sites (1 per 1300 nucleotide pairs). As will be described in the overview of genetics in Chapter 8, SNPs in the human genome can be extremely useful for genetic mapping analyses, in which one attempts to associate specific traits (phenotypes) with specific DNA sequences for medical or scientific purposes (see p. 493). But while useful as genetic markers, there is good evidence that most of these SNPs have little or no effect on human fitness. This is as expected, since deleterious variants will have been selected against during human evolution and, unlike SNPs, should"

            "content": "Recently, it has become possible to measure the germ-line mutation rate directly in more complex, sexually reproducing organisms such as humans. In this case, the complete genomes from a family\u2014parents and offspring\u2014were directly sequenced, and a careful comparison revealed that approximately 70 new single-nucleotide mutations arose in the germ lines of each offspring. Normalized to the size of the human genome, the mutation rate is one nucleotide change per 108 nucleotides per human generation. This is a slight underestimate because some mutations will be lethal and will therefore be absent from progeny; however, because relatively little of the human genome carries critical information, this consideration has only a small effect on the true mutation rate. It is estimated that approximately 100 cell divisions occur in the germ line from the time of conception to the time of production of the eggs and sperm that go on to make the next generation. Thus, the human mutation rate,"

            "content": "The high polymorphism of the classical MHC genes ensures diversity in MHC gene expression in the population as a whole. However, no matter how polymorphic a gene is, no individual can express more than two alleles at a single gene locus. Polygeny, the presence of several different related genes with similar functions, ensures that each individual produces a number of different MHC molecules. The combination of polymorphism and polygeny produces the diversity of MHC molecules seen both within an individual and in the population at large."

            "content": "For much less closely related organisms, such as humans and chickens (which have evolved separately for about 300 million years), the sequence conservation found in genes is almost entirely due to purifying selection (that is, selection that eliminates individuals carrying mutations that interfere with important genetic functions), rather than to an inadequate time for mutations to occur. Phylogenetic Trees Constructed from a Comparison of DNA Sequences Trace the Relationships of All Organisms Phylogenetic trees based on molecular sequence data can be compared with the fossil record, and we get our best view of evolution by integrating the two approaches. The fossil record remains essential as a source of absolute dates, human\u2013chimpanzee comparisons show divergences of approximately 1.2%. (modified from F.C. Chen and w.H. li, Am. J. Hum.
