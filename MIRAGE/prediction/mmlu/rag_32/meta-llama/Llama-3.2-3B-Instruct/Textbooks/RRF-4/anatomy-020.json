The sinoatrial (SA) node is referred to as the pacemaker of the heart, and it is mentioned in various documents as the natural pacemaker region. We need to identify where the SA node is located in relation to the heart chambers. According to Document [5] (Title: Histology_Ross), the SA node is located at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium. Document [6] (Title: Physiology_Levy) states that the SA node is located in the superior aspect of the thick ridge of muscle known as the crista terminalis where the posterior smooth atrial wall derived from the sinus venosus meets the trabeculated anterior portion of the right atrium. This information supports the same location. Documents [23] (Title: First_Aid_Step1) and [24] (Title: Anatomy_Gray) also describe the location of the SA node in relation to the right atrium. Based on this information, we can conclude that the sinoatrial node is located between the right atrium and the right ventricle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

There are several ways to assess SA node function invasively. They include the sinus node recovery time (SNRT), defined as the longest pause after cessation of overdrive pacing of the right atrium near the SA node (normal: <1500 ms or, corrected for sinus cycle length, <550 ms), and the sinoatrial conduction time (SACT), defined as one-half the difference between the intrinsic sinus cycle length and a noncompensatory pause after a premature atrial stimulus (normal <125 ms).

            "content": "Another point of variation relates to the arterial supply to the sinu-atrial and atrioventricular nodes. In most cases, these two structures are supplied by the right coronary artery. However, vessels from the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery occasionally supply these structures. The coronary sinus receives four major tributaries: the great, middle, small, and posterior cardiac veins."

            "content": "Control of Cardiac Muscle Activity Cardiac muscle is an involuntary muscle with an intrinsic pacemaker. The pacemaker represents a specialized cell (located in the sinoatrial node of the right atrium) that is able to undergo spontaneous depolarization and generate action potentials. Of importance is that although several cells in the heart are able to depolarize spontaneously, the fastest spontaneous depolarizations occur in cells in the sinoatrial node. Moreover, once a given cell spontaneously depolarizes and fires an action potential, this action potential is then propagated throughout the heart (by specialized conduction pathways and cell-to-cell contact). Thus depolarization from only one cell is needed to initiate a wave of contraction in the heart (i.e., a heartbeat). The mechanisms underlying this spontaneous depolarization are discussed in depth in"

Sinoatrial (SA) node, atrioventricular (AV) node, and Purkinje cells display pacemaker activity (phase 4 depolarization). The ECG is the body surface manifestation of the depolarization and repolarization waves of the heart. The P wave is generated by atrial depolarization, the QRS by ventricular muscle depolarization, and the T wave by ventricular repolarization. Thus, the PR interval is a measure of conduction time from atrium to ventricle, and the QRS duration indicates the time required for all of the ventricular cells to be activated (ie, the intraventricular conduction time). The QT interval reflects the duration of the ventricular action potential."

This fibrous network (indicated in blue) serves for the attachment of cardiac muscle; it also serves for the attachment of the cuspid valves between the atria and ventricles and for the semilunar valves of the aorta and the pulmonary artery. The atrioventricular bundle passes from the right atrium to the ventricular septum via the membranous septum of the fibrous skeleton. FIGURE 13.5 \u2022 Chambers of the heart and the impulse-conducting system. The heart has been cut open in the coronal plane to expose its interior and the main parts of its impulse-conducting system (indicated in yellow). Impulses are generated in the sinuatrial (SA) node, transmitted through the atrial wall to the atrioventricular (AV) node and then sent along the AV bundle to the Purkinje fibers."
