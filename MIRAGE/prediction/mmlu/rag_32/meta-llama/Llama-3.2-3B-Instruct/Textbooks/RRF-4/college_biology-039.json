    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of ontogeny and phylogeny. Ontogeny refers to the development of an organism from a zygote to an adult, while phylogeny refers to the evolutionary history of a species or group of species. The concept of ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny suggests that the developmental stages of an organism are a reiteration of the evolutionary history of the species. This concept was first proposed by Ernst Haeckel in the 19th century. To determine which of the options is correct, let's analyze each choice in the context of vertebrate development.\\n\\nOption A: Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. This concept suggests that the developmental stages of a vertebrate embryo are a reiteration of the evolutionary history of the species. However, this concept has been largely discredited due to the discovery of developmental plasticity and the complexity of vertebrate development. Vertebrates exhibit significant differences in their developmental pathways, and the concept of ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny does not accurately describe the complexity of vertebrate development.\\n\\nOption B: Early embryos display identical features of their class, order, and species. This statement is not accurate. Early embryos of different species, even within the same class, order, and family, display distinct features and developmental pathways. The developmental processes that shape the vertebrate embryo are highly conserved across species, but the specific morphological features and developmental pathways are not identical.\\n\\nOption C: An early human embryo has features in common with early fish and avian embryos. This statement is true. Early human embryos do share some features with early fish and avian embryos, such as the formation of the blastula and gastrula stages. However, this does not necessarily imply that human embryos display features of adult fish and birds in the course of their development. The developmental pathways that shape the vertebrate embryo are highly conserved across species, but the specific morphological features and developmental pathways are not identical.\\n\\nOption D: A human embryo displays features of adult fish and birds in the course of its development. This statement is not accurate. Human embryos do not display features of adult fish and birds in the course of their development. While early human embryos share some features with early fish and avian embryos, the developmental pathways that shape the vertebrate embryo are highly conserved across species, but the specific morphological features and developmental pathways are not identical.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is C. An early human embryo has features in common with early fish and avian embryos.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

These originate from the inner cell mass of the early embryo (the cluster of cells that give rise to the body of the embryo proper, as opposed to extraembryonic structures), and they have an extraordinary property: given suitable culture conditions, they will continue proliferating indefinitely and yet retain an unrestricted developmental potential. Their only limitation is that they do not give rise to extraembryonic tissues such as those of the placenta. Thus they are classified as pluripotent, rather than totipotent. But this is a minor restriction.

            "content": "If we cannot switch the basic character of a specialized cell by changing its environment, can we do so by interfering with its inner workings in a more direct and drastic way? An extreme treatment of this sort is to take the nucleus of the cell and transplant it into the cytoplasm of a large cell of a different type. If the specialized character is defined and maintained by cytoplasmic factors, the transplanted nucleus should switch its pattern of gene expression to conform with that of the host cell. In Chapter 7, we described a famous experiment of this sort, using the frog Xenopus. In this experiment, the nucleus of a differentiated cell (a cell from the lining of a tadpole\u2019s gut) was used to replace the nucleus of an oocyte (an egg-cell precursor arrested in prophase of the first meiotic division, in readiness for fertilization). The resulting hybrid cell went on, in a certain fraction of cases, to develop into a complete normal frog (see Figure 7\u20132A). This was crucial evidence"

            "content": "Fertilization is highly complex. Molecular mechanisms allow spermatozoa to pass between follicular cells; through the zona pellucida, which is a thick glycoprotein layer surrounding the oocyte cell membrane; and into the oocyte cytoplasm. Fusion of the two nuclei and intermingling of maternal and paternal chromosomes creates the zygote. Early human development is described by days or weeks postfertilization, that is, postconceptional. By contrast, in most chapters of this book, clinical pregnancy dating is calculated from the irst day of the last menstrual period (LMP). hus, 1 week postfertilization corresponds to approximately 3 weeks from the LMP in women with regular 28-day cycles. As an example, 8 weeks' gestation refers to 8 completed weeks following the LMP. After fertilization, the zygote-a diploid cell with 46 chromosomes-undergoes cleavage, and zygote cells produced by this division are called blastomeres (Fig. 5-7). In the two-cell"

Similarly, mouse or human embryonic stem cells can be coaxed to generate specific cell types by exposing them in culture to appropriate combinations of signal molecules. In this way, the insights gained through studies of animal development can be used to generate the cell types needed for regenerative medicine, as we discuss in the next chapter. the Insect Dorsoventral axis corresponds to the Vertebrate Ventral-Dorsal axis"
