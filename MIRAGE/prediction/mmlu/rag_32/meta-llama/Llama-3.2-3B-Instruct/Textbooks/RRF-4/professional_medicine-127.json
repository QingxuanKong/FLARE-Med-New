    "question": "A 22-year-old woman contacts a medical student and asks if he would like to join her for dinner. The student met the woman when he was assigned to her care during her 2-week hospitalization for treatment of major depressive disorder. He has not treated or seen the patient since she was discharged from the hospital. He is attracted to this former patient and would be interested in dating her. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the medical student regarding this patient's invitation?",
    "options": {
        "A": "He can date her because he was a medical student, not a physician, when he contributed to her care",
        "B": "He can date her because she is no longer his patient",
        "C": "He can date her, but only after at least 1 year has passed since he treated her",
        "D": "He cannot date her because she was once his psychiatric patient"
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the ethical implications of the medical student's actions. As a medical student, the student has a professional relationship with the patient, who was under his care during her hospitalization for major depressive disorder. This creates a power imbalance in the relationship, which can make it difficult for the patient to make informed decisions or feel comfortable with the idea of dating the student. Additionally, the student's professional obligations and responsibilities to the patient may be compromised if he pursues a romantic relationship with her. The patient may also feel uncomfortable or even harassed if she accepts the student's invitation, which could compromise the patient-physician relationship. Therefore, the most appropriate action would be to decline the invitation and maintain a professional boundary between them.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The reply may help in the management of the patient\u2019s problem and allow the physician to give advice according to the patient\u2019s understanding of her ailment."

He has developed a stooped posture, drags his left leg when walking, and is unsteady on turning. He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

            "content": "It is especially important for the patient to have the opportunity to work out her feelings about having a psychiatric disorder, understand how it has affected her life, and feel comfortable taking medication or undergoing psychotherapy (115). Patients often attribute depression to weakness, laziness, or immorality, and they often confuse antidepressants with stimulants, tranquilizers, and other psychoactive drugs. Although written materials cannot substitute entirely for verbal instruction, it is useful to provide the patient with written material about depression so that she can review it at her leisure and with her family and friends if they have difficulty understanding her condition. There is widespread difficulty understanding written information, especially about medicine. Many or most antidepressant prescriptions are either not filled or not taken as prescribed (116)."

According to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the safest part of pregnancy in which to travel is between 18 and 24 weeks, when there is the least danger of spontaneous abortion or premature labor. Some obstetricians prefer that women stay within a few hundred miles of home after the 28th week of pregnancy in case problems arise. In general, however, healthy women may be advised that it is acceptable to travel."

Fund of information is assessed by asking questions about major historic or current events, with special attention to educational level and life experiences. Abnormalities of insight and judgment are usually detected during 2537 the patient interview; a more detailed assessment can be elicited by asking the patient to describe how he or she would respond to situations having a variety of potential outcomes (e.g., \u201cWhat would you do if you found a wallet on the sidewalk?\u201d)."
