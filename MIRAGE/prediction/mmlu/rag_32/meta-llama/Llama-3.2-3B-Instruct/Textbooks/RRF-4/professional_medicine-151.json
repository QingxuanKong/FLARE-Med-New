He has not had any change in bowel movements or urination. He had one similar episode 3 years ago that resolved spontaneously. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the back shows bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm. Range of motion is limited by pain. Straight-leg raising is negative.

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with nonradiating low back pain that began after physical activity, which suggests a possible musculoskeletal cause. The patient has a history of a similar episode that resolved spontaneously 3 years ago, which may indicate a chronic condition. The physical examination shows bilateral paravertebral muscle spasm and limited range of motion due to pain. The straight-leg raising test is negative, which is consistent with a non-radicular cause of low back pain. Given the lack of systemic symptoms and normal vital signs, the patient's condition appears to be a musculoskeletal issue. The most appropriate next step in management would be to assess the patient's activity level and provide guidance on regular activity to promote healing and prevent further injury. Bed rest may exacerbate the condition, and X-rays or MRI of the spine may not be immediately necessary unless there is a high suspicion of a serious underlying condition. Analgesia is already being provided, so the focus should be on promoting a healthy activity level and preventing further injury.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

A 50-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with severe lower back pain that had started several days ago. In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."

Although some physical signs and imaging studies are helpful, diagnosis often depends on the patient\u2019s description of the pain and his behavior during the execution of certain maneuvers. Seasoned clinicians appreciate the need for a systematic inquiry and method of examination. Clinical Features of Low Back Pain Of the symptoms of spinal disease (pain, stiffness, limitation of movement, and deformity), pain is foremost. Four types of pain may be distinguished: local, referred, radicular, and that arising from secondary muscular spasm. The origin of pain can often be discerned from the patient\u2019s description, reliance being placed mainly on the character of the pain, its location, and conditions that modify it."

However, low-back pain may accompany gynecologic pathology. Back pain may be caused by gynecologic, vascular, neurologic, psychogenic, or spondologenic (related to the axial skeleton and its structure) pathology (131). Women with low-back pain syndrome often have pain occurring after trauma or physical exertion, in the morning on arising, or with fatigue. Nongynecologic low-back pain can intensify with the menstrual cycle. Examination consists of inspection, evaluation with movement, and palpation. Various anatomic structures in the spine should be considered as sources of pain. Muscles, vertebral joints, and discs (including lumbosacral junction, paravertebral sacrospinal muscles, and sacroiliac joints) are common sources of spondylogenic pain that must be examined carefully (2)."

This is in contrast to the pain of root compression. Pain resulting from muscular spasm usually occurs in relation to local spinal irritation and may be thought of as a nocifensive reflex for the protection of the diseased parts against injurious motion. Chronic muscular contraction may give rise to a dull, sometimes cramping ache. One can sometimes feel the tautness of the sacrospinalis and gluteal muscles and demonstrate by palpation that the pain is localized to them. However, except for the most severe degrees of acute injuries of the back, the spasms are difficult to detect and their contribution to back pain has appeared to us to be relatively small."

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a"

            "content": "In cases of acute abdominal pain, a diagnosis is readily established in most instances, whereas success is not so frequent in patients with chronic pain. IBS is one of the most common causes of abdominal pain and must always be kept in mind (Chap. 352). The location of the pain can assist in narrowing the differential diagnosis (Table 20-3); however, the chronological sequence of events in the patient\u2019s history is often more important than the pain\u2019s location. If the examiner is sufficiently open-minded and unhurried, asks the proper questions, and listens, the patient will usually provide the diagnosis. Careful attention should be paid to the extraabdominal regions. Narcotics or analgesics should not be withheld until a definitive diagnosis or a definitive plan has been formulated; obfuscation of the diagnosis by adequate analgesia is unlikely."

            "content": "Nonetheless, the discomfort of acute low back strain can be severe, and the patient may assume unusual postures related to spasm of the lower lumbar and sacrospinalis muscles. The pain is usually confined to the lower part of the back, in the midline, across the posterior waist, or just to one side of the spine. The diagnosis of lumbosacral strain is dependent on the biomechanics of the injury or activity that precipitated the pain. The injured structures are identified by the localized tenderness, augmentation of pain by postural changes\u2014for example, bending forward, twisting, or standing up from a sitting position, and by the absence of signs of radicular involvement. In more than 80 percent of cases of acute low back strain of this type, the pain resolves in a matter of several days or a week, even with no specific treatment."

            "content": "Low back pain may be a major symptom in patients with hysteria, malingering, anxiety, depression, and hypochondriasis as well as in many persons whose symptoms do not conform to any of these psychiatric illnesses. It is good practice to assume that pain in the back in such patients may signify disease of the spine or adjacent structures, and this should always be carefully sought. However, even when some organic factors are found, the pain may be exaggerated, prolonged, or woven into a pattern of invalidism because of coexistent primary or secondary factors. This is especially true when there is the possibility of secondary gain (notably workers\u2019 compensation or settlement of personal injury claims). Patients seeking compensation for protracted low back pain without obvious structural disease tend, after a time, to become suspicious, uncooperative, and hostile toward their physicians or anyone who might question the authenticity of their illness. One notes in them a tendency to"

            "content": "Chronic and recurring back pain caused by degenerative arthritic disease is among the most common disorders in general practice. It occurs in later life and may involve all or any part of the spine but is most prevalent in the cervical and lumbar regions. The pain is described as a stiffness that is centered in the affected part of the spine. It is increased initially by movement and is associated with limitation of motion but is often worse on arising in the morning. In contrast to the spinal claudicatory syndrome of lumbar stenosis, warming up and progressive mobilization make the pain better. There is a notable absence of systemic symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, or fever, and, more importantly, there are usually no features of radicular compression although vague aching may be felt in a sciatic distribution. In contrast to conventional lumbar root compression, the straight-leg raising tests do not elicit pain. The sitting position is usually comfortable, although stiffness and"
