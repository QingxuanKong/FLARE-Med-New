    "question": "A 26-year-old male police officer comes to the office for an annual health maintenance examination. He is physically active and feels well, but he notes that his asthma has been more active during the past month. He says that he has had to use his albuterol inhaler one to two times daily for wheezing and chest tightness. He has not had gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, productive cough, or fever. Medical history is remarkable for atopic allergies, especially to pollen and cats. He has had coldand exercise-induced asthma for the past 14 years. He takes no other medications. He is 188 cm (6 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 90 kg (200 lb); BMI is 25 kg/m2 . Vital signs are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 70/min, respirations 12/min, and blood pressure 120/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities except for scattered rhonchi and wheezes with forced expiration. Peak expiratory flow rate is 240 L/min. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the given question: **Step 1: Review the patient's symptoms and history** The patient is a 26-year-old male with a history of asthma, which has been more active over the past month. He uses his albuterol inhaler 1-2 times daily for wheezing and chest tightness, but does not have gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, productive cough, or fever. **Step 2: Analyze the patient's asthma management** The patient has a history of cold and exercise-induced asthma, but his symptoms are not severe enough to warrant a change in his current management plan. He is not using his inhaler excessively, and his peak expiratory flow rate is still within the normal range (240 L/min). **Step 3: Consider the potential causes of worsening asthma symptoms** Given the patient's history and symptoms, the most likely cause of his worsening asthma is environmental exposure to allergens, such as pollen or cats. **Step 4: Evaluate the treatment options** - Option A (Chest x-ray) is not necessary as the patient does not have any acute respiratory symptoms such as fever, productive cough, or significant wheezing. - Option B (Fexofenadine therapy) is an antihistamine that can help relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis, which may be contributing to the patient's asthma symptoms. This is a reasonable option. - Option C (Increased use of the albuterol inhaler) is not necessary as the patient's symptoms are not severe enough to warrant an increase in medication. - Option D (Initiation of a daily corticosteroid inhaler) may be considered for patients with persistent asthma, but it is not necessary for this patient's mild symptoms. **Step 5: Choose the most appropriate management** Based on the patient's symptoms and history, the most appropriate management is to add fexofenadine therapy to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis, which is likely contributing to his asthma symptoms. Here is the final answer in the requested format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of asthma and has been experiencing worsening symptoms, but his symptoms are not severe enough to warrant a change in his current management plan. The most likely cause of his worsening asthma is environmental exposure to allergens, such as pollen or cats. Fexofenadine therapy is an antihistamine that can help relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis, which may be contributing to his asthma symptoms.

Lung Function Tests Simple spirometry confirms airflow limitation with a reduced FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, and PEF (Fig. 309-6). Reversibility is demonstrated by a >12% and 200-mL increase in FEV1 15 min after an inhaled short-acting \u03b22-agonist or in some patients by a 2to 4-week trial of oral corticosteroids (OCS) (prednisone or prednisolone 30\u201340 mg daily). Measurements of PEF twice daily may confirm the diurnal variations in airflow obstruction. Flow-volume loops show reduced peak flow and reduced maximum expiratory flow. Further lung function tests are rarely necessary, but whole-body plethysmography shows increased airway resistance and may show increased total lung capacity and residual volume.

            "content": "Choose the ONE best answer. For Questions 26.1 and 26.2, use the following scenario. A 40-year-old woman, 5 ft, 1 in (155 cm) tall and weighing 188 lb (85.5 kg), seeks your advice on how to lose weight. Her waist measured 41 in and her hips 39 in. The remainder of the physical examination and the blood laboratory data were all within the normal range. Her only child (who is age 14 years), her sister, and both of her parents are overweight. The patient recalls being overweight throughout her childhood and adolescence. Over the past 15 years, she had been on seven different diets for periods of 2 weeks to 3 months, losing from 5 to 25 lb each time. On discontinuation of the diets, she regained weight, returning to 185\u2013190 lb. 6.1. Calculate and interpret the body mass index for the patient. Body mass index (BMI) = weight in kg/(height in m)2 = 85.5/1.552 = 35.6. Because her BMI is >30, the patient is classified as obese."

The patient is afebrile and normotensive but anxious, tachycardic, and markedly tachy-pneic. Auscultation of the chest reveals diffuse wheezes. The physician provisionally makes the diagnosis of bronchial asthma and administers epinephrine by intramuscular injec-tion, improving the patient\u2019s breathing over several minutes. A normal chest X-ray is subsequently obtained, and the medical history is remarkable only for mild hypertension that is being treated with propranolol. The physician instructs the patient to discontinue use of propranolol, and changes the patient\u2019s antihypertensive medication to verapamil. Why is the physician correct to discontinue propranolol? Why is verapamil a better choice for managing hypertension in this patient? What alternative treatment change might the physi-cian consider?"

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

In severe exacerbations, patients may be so breathless that they are unable to complete sentences and may become cyanotic. Examination usually shows increased ventilation, hyperinflation, and tachycardia. Pulsus paradoxus may be present, but this is rarely a useful clinical sign. There is a marked fall in spirometric values and PEF. Arterial blood gases on air show hypoxemia, and PCO2 is usually low due to hyperventilation. A normal or rising PCO2 is an indication of impending respiratory failure and requires immediate monitoring and therapy. A chest roentgenogram is not usually informative but may show pneumonia or pneumothorax."

Past medical history included schizophrenia, for which he required institutional care; treatment had included neuroleptics and intermittent lithium, the latter restarted 6 months before admission. The patient was treated with antibiotics and intubated for several days, with the development of polyuria (3\u20135 L/d), hypernatremia, and acute renal insufficiency; the peak plasma Na+ concentration was 156 meq/L, and peak creatinine was 2.6 mg/dL. Urine osmolality was measured once and reported as 157 mOsm/kg, with a coincident plasma osmolality of 318 mOsm/kg. Lithium was stopped on admission to the ICU. On physical examination, the patient was alert, extubated, and thirsty. Weight was 97.5 kg. Urine output for the previous 24 h had been 3.4 L, with an IV intake of 2 L/d of D5W."

Classic wheezing may not be prominent if there is poor air movement from airway obstruction. As the attack progresses, cyanosis, diminished air movement, retractions, agitation, inability to speak, tripod sitting position, diaphoresis, and pulsus paradoxus (decrease in blood pressure of >15 mm Hg with inspiration) may be observed. Physical examination may show evidence of other atopic diseases such as eczema or allergic rhinitis."

On physical examination his lungs were clear, he was tachypneic at 24/min, and his saturation was reduced to 92% on room air. Pulmonary embolism was suspected and the patient was referred for a CT pulmonary angiogram. The study demonstrated clots within the right and left main pulmonary arteries. There was no pleural effusion, lung collapse, or consolidation. He was immediately started on subcutaneous enoxaparin and converted to oral anticoagulation over the course of a couple of days. The whole treatment lasted 6 months as no other risk factors (except immobilization during a long haul flight) were identified. There were no permanent sequelae."
