The documents do not explicitly state how often a cannula should be flushed, but we can make an educated inference based on general medical practices and the context of the documents. In the documents, cannulas are mentioned in the context of laparoscopic procedures, and the importance of maintaining patency and preventing blockages is emphasized. The documents also discuss the use of sterile saline to clean cannulas and the potential for fibrin buildup, which can clog cannulas. However, there is no specific guidance on flushing frequency. However, in the context of central venous catheter care, it is generally recommended to flush a central venous catheter every 72 hours to prevent clotting and infection (Document 7). Given the similarity between central venous catheters and laparoscopic cannulas, it is reasonable to infer that flushing every 8 hours may be a reasonable compromise for laparoscopic cannulas to prevent blockages and maintain patency.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Inadvertent gastric entry usually is associated with stomach distention because of aerophagia, difficult or improper intubation, or mask induction with inhalation anesthetic. Most often the injury is created by the trocar-cannula system used for primary access. Ancillary cannulas may result in visceral injury, although placement of these cannulas under direct vision helps reduce the risk of injury. The risk of gastric perforation can be minimized with the selective use of preoperative nasogastric or oral gastric suction when left upper-quadrant entries are used or when the intubation was difficult. Open laparoscopy likely has little impact on the risk for gastrointestinal complications, particularly those related to adhesions to the anterior abdominal wall from previous surgery.

The abdominal wall vessels most commonly injured during laparoscopy are the superficial inferior epigastric vessels as they branch from the femoral artery and vein and course cephalad in each lower quadrant. They are invariably damaged by the initial passage of an ancillary trocar-cannula system or by the introduction of a wider device later in the procedure. The problem may be recognized immediately by the observation of blood dripping along the cannula or out through the incision. However, the bleeding may be obstructed by the cannula until it is withdrawn at the end of the operation."

For diagnostic laparoscopy, the most useful and cosmetically acceptable site for insertion of an ancillary cannula is in the midline of the lower abdomen, about 2 to 4 cm above the symphysis. The ancillary cannula should not be inserted too close to the symphysis because it limits the mobility of the ancillary instruments and access to the cul-de-sac. Laparoscopic cannulas can become dislodged and slip out of the incision during a procedure. There are a variety of cannula designs designed to reduce slippage, which include those with threaded exteriors and anchoring systems with balloon tips."

Intraperitoneal volume capacity varies significantly between individuals. Many surgeons prefer to insuf\ufb02ate to 25 to 30 mm Hg for positioning the cannulas, and a body of evidence exists supporting this approach (86). This level usually provides extra volume and enough counter pressure against the peritoneum, facilitating introduction of the cannula and potentially reducing the chance of bowel or posterior abdominal wall and vessel trauma. After placement of the cannulas, the pressure should be dropped to 10 to 15 mm Hg, which reduces the risk of subcutaneous insuf\ufb02ation leading to crepitus and essentially eliminates hypercarbia or decreased venous return of blood to the heart (84,86,87)."

            "content": "The more serious injuries are those to the deep inferior epigastric vessels, which are branches of the external iliac artery and vein that course cephalad but are deep to the rectus fascia and often deep to the muscles (Fig. 23.3). More laterally located are the deep circum\ufb02ex iliac vessels, which are not often encountered in laparoscopic surgery. Laceration of these vessels may cause profound blood loss, particularly when the trauma is unrecognized and causes extraperitoneal bleeding. Signs of injury, in addition to blood dripping down the cannula, include the postoperative appearance of shock and abdominal wall discolorization or hematoma located near the incision. In some instances, the blood may track to a more distant site, presenting as a pararectal or vulvar mass. Delayed diagnosis may be prevented by laparoscopic evaluation of each peritoneal incision after removal of the cannula."

Evaluation of the patient in septic shock begins with an assessment of the adequacy of their airway and ven-tilation. Severely obtunded patients and patients whose work of breathing is excessive require intubation and ventilation to prevent respiratory collapse. Because vasodilation and decrease in total peripheral resistance may produce hypotension, fluid resuscitation and restoration of circulatory volume with bal-anced salt solutions is essential. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign has updated treatment recommendations and care bundles with a most recent goal for care within the first hour93,94 (Table 5-7). Serum lactate should be measured as a marker of shock. Fluid resuscitation should begin within the first hour and should be at least 30 mL/kg for hypotensive patients. Incremental fluid boluses should be continued based upon endpoint of resuscita-tion, including"

At the proxi-mal end of the PAC, the wires terminate in a fitting that permits connection to appropriate hardware for the calculation of car-diac output using the thermodilution technique. The final two channels are used for pressure monitoring and the injection of the thermal indicator for determinations of cardiac output. One of these channels terminates at the tip of the catheter; the other terminates 20 cm proximal to the tip.Placement of a PAC requires access to the central venous circulation. Such access can be obtained at a variety of sites, including the antecubital, femoral, jugular, and subclavian veins. Percutaneous placement through either the jugular or sub-clavian vein generally is"
