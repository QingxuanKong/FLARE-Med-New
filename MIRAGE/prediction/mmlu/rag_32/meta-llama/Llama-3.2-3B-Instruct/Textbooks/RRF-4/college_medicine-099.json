According to the provided documents, the sequence of events starts with the arrival of a nerve impulse at the neuromuscular junction, which prompts the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. The binding of acetylcholine to ACh-gated Na channels causes local depolarization of the sarcolemma. This is followed by the influx of sodium ions into the muscle cell, which leads to general depolarization that spreads over the plasma membrane of the muscle cell and continues via the T tubules. The voltage sensor proteins in the plasma membrane of T tubules change their conformation, which activates gated Ca2-release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum triggers the contraction process. Therefore, the trigger to initiate the contractile process in skeletal muscle is calcium binding to troponin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The increase in myoplasmic Ca++ promotes muscle contraction by exposing myosin-binding sites on the actin thin filaments (a process that involves binding of Ca++ to troponin C, followed by movement of tropomyosin toward the groove in the thin filament). Myosin cross-bridges then appear to undergo a ratchet action, with the thin filaments pulled toward the center of the sarcomere and contracting the skeletal muscle fiber.

The sarcomere is a contractile unit in skeletal muscle. Each sarcomere is approximately 2 \u00b5m in length at rest and is bounded by two Z lines. Sarcomeres are arranged in series along the length of the myofibril. Thin filaments, containing actin, extend from the Z line toward the center of the sarcomere. Thick filaments, containing myosin, are positioned in the center of the sarcomere and overlap the actin thin filaments.

Two major features of the muscle cell make extremely rapid contraction possible. First, as previously discussed, the individual myosin motor heads in each thick filament spend only a small fraction of the ATP cycle time bound to the filament and actively generating force, so many myosin heads can act in rapid succession on the same thin filament without interfering with one another. Second, a specialized membrane system relays the incoming signal rapidly throughout the entire cell.

If the muscle is stimulated a second time before it is fully relaxed, the force of contraction increases (see Fig. 12.16 , middle). Thus twitch forces are amplified as stimulus frequency increases. At a high level of stimulation, intracellular [Ca++] increases and is maintained throughout the period of stimulation (see Fig. 12.16 , right), and the amount of force developed greatly exceeds that observed during a twitch. The response is termed tetany. At intermediate stimulus frequency, intracellular [Ca++] returns to baseline just before the next stimulus. However, there is a gradual rise in force (see"

The two basic types of skeletal muscle fibers are distinguished on the basis of their speed of contraction (i.e., fast-twitch versus slow-twitch). The difference in speed of contraction is attributed to the expression of different myosin isoforms that differ in myosin ATPase activity.

Because the signal from the muscle cell plasma membrane is passed within milliseconds (via the T tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum) to every sarcomere in the cell, all of the myofibrils in the cell contract at once.

This result, coupled with the observation that the size of the intracellular Ca++ transient during a twitch contraction is comparable with that during tetany, suggests that enough Ca++ is released into the myoplasm during a twitch to allow the actin-myosin interactions to produce maximal tension. However, the duration of the intracellular Ca++ transient during a twitch is sufficiently short that the contractile elements may not have enough time to fully stretch the series elastic components in the fiber and muscle.

The contraction of a skeletal muscle fiber is initiated when a nerve impulse traveling along the axon of a motor neuron arrives at the neuromuscular junction. 2. The nerve impulse prompts the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft that binds into ACh-gated Na channels causing local depolarization of sarcolemma. 3. Voltage-gated Na channels open, and Na enters the cell. indicated by the numerals. ACh, acetylcholine. 4. General depolarization spreads over the plasma membrane of the muscle cell and continues via membranes of the T tubules. 5. Voltage sensor proteins in the plasma membrane of T tubules change their conformation. 6. At the muscle cell triads, the T tubules are in close contact with the lateral enlargements of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, where gated Ca2-release channels are activated by conformational changes of voltage-sensor proteins."
