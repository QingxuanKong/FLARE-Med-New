Mechanism The mechanism of action of progesterone\u2014described in more detail above\u2014is similar to that of other steroid hormones. Progestins enter the cell and bind to progesterone receptors that are distributed in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The ligand-receptor complex binds to a progesterone response element (PRE) to activate gene transcription. The response element for progesterone appears to be similar to the corticosteroid response element, and the specificity of the response depends upon which receptor is present in the cell as well as upon other cell-specific receptor coregulators and interacting transcription factors. The progesterone-receptor complex forms a dimer before binding to DNA. Like the estrogen receptor, it can form heterodimers as well as homodimers between two isoforms, A and B. These isoforms are produced by alternative splicing of the same gene. B. Effects of Progesterone"

Steroidogenic cells have some capacity for cholesterol synthesis but often obtain cholesterol from cholesterol-rich lipoproteins (low-density lipoproteins and high-density lipoproteins). Pregnenolone is then further modified by several enzymatic reactions. Because of their hydrophobic nature, steroid hormones and precursors can leave the steroidogenic cell easily and thus are not stored. Therefore, steroidogenesis is regulated at the level of uptake, storage, and mobilization of cholesterol and at the level of steroidogenic enzyme gene expression and activity.
