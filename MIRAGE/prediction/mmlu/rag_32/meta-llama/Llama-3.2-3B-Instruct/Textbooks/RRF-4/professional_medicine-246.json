Her temperature is 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 80/60 mm Hg. Examination shows the left ear displaced forward and laterally from the head. There is edema and tenderness behind the left ear. Otoscopic examination shows a red, dull, left tympanic membrane that does not move. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the given symptoms and examination findings. The 3-year-old girl presents with fever, left ear pain, and a history of left otitis media treated with amoxicillin for 5 days. The physical examination reveals a red, dull, and non-mobile left tympanic membrane, which is a sign of middle ear effusion. The ear is displaced forward and laterally from the head, and there is edema and tenderness behind the left ear. These findings suggest a possible complication of otitis media. Now, let's evaluate the options: Acoustic neuroma (A) is a non-cancerous tumor that affects the nerve connecting the inner ear to the brain, which doesn't match the symptoms presented. Labyrinthitis (B) is an inner ear infection that can cause vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus, but it doesn't typically cause a displaced ear or the specific findings of middle ear effusion. Lateral sinus thrombosis (C) is a blood clot in the lateral sinus, which can cause fever, headache, and neck stiffness, but it doesn't typically present with a non-mobile tympanic membrane. Mastoiditis (D) is an infection of the mastoid bone, which is a complication of otitis media, especially in children. The symptoms and examination findings of fever, ear pain, and a non-mobile tympanic membrane are consistent with mastoiditis, especially given the displacement of the ear and edema behind the ear. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is mastoiditis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Diagnosis in most cases reveals \ufb02uid behind the tympanic membrane. Treatment is directed to symptoms and involves the use of antihistamines and decongestants, despite few data to support their use. Acute otitis media is usually a bacterial infection; Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus in\ufb02uenza are the most common pathogens. Symptoms include acute purulent otorrhea, fever, hearing loss, and leukocytosis. Physical examination of the ear reveals a red, bulging, or perforated membrane. Indicated treatment is broad-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefuroxime axetil, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole."

The tympanic membrane of the normal, air-filled middle ear has much greater compliance than if the middle ear is fluid-filled. With acute OM, the tympanic membrane is characterized by hyperemia, or red color rather than the normal pearly gray color, but it can be pink, white, or yellow with a full to bulging position and with poor or absent mobility to negative and positive pressure. The light reflex is lost, and the middle ear structures are obscured and difficult to distinguish. A hole in the tympanic membrane or purulent drainage confirms perforation. Occasionally bullae are present on the lateral aspect of the tympanic membrane, which characteristically are associated with severe ear pain."

She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

Occasionally, it may be necessary to enter the middle ear through the tympanic membrane. Because the chorda tympani runs in the upper one-third of the tympanic membrane, incisions are always below this level. The richer blood supply to the posterior aspect of the tympanic membrane determines the standard surgical approach in the posteroinferior aspect. Otitis media (infection of the middle ear) is common and can lead to perforation of the tympanic membrane. The infection can usually be treated with antibiotics. If the infection persists, the chronic inflammatory change may damage the ossicular chain and other structures within the middle ear to produce deafness. In the clinic"

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Otorrhea, rhinorrhea, raccoon eyes, and Battle\u2019s sign (ecchymosis behind the ear) suggest a basilar skull fracture. Although such fractures may not require treatment, there is an association with blunt cerebrovascular injuries, cranial nerve injuries, and risk of meningitis.Anterior facial structures should be examined to rule out fractures. This entails palpating for bony step-off of the facial bones and instability of the midface (by grasping the upper pal-ate and seeing if this moves separately from the patient\u2019s head).

Myringotomy tubes, however, allow for preven-tion of painful tympanic membrane distension, risk of perfora-tion and other complications, and permit delivery of ototopicals into the middle ear space, in most cases obviating the need for systemic antibiotic therapy.Spontaneous tympanic membrane perforation during acute otitis media provides for drainage of purulent fluid and middle ear ventilation and frequently results in immediate resolution of severe pain. In the majority of cases, these perforations will heal spontaneously after the infection has resolved.8 Chronic otitis media, however, may be associated with nonhealing tympanic membrane perforations. Patients may have persistent otorrhea, which is treated with topical drops. Preparations containing ami-noglycoside are avoided because this class of drugs is toxic to the inner ear.
