A 'blow out' fracture typically occurs when there is a direct impact to the globe that results in a sudden increase in intraorbital pressure, leading to failure of the orbital floor. This type of fracture is also known as a blow-out fracture. The most common fracture involves the floor because this is the weakest bone. The orbital floor is made of the thinnest bone, making it more susceptible to fracture. The other options, such as the roof, lateral wall, and medial wall, are stronger and less likely to collapse in a 'blow out' fracture. Therefore, based on the anatomy and the mechanism of injury, the orbital floor is the most likely to collapse in a 'blow out' fracture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

These fractures are often part of complex facial fractures. Fractures within the orbit frequently occur within the floor and the medial wall; however, superior and lateral wall fractures also occur. Inferior orbital floor fractures are one of the commonest types of injuries. These fractures may drag the inferior oblique muscle and associated tissues into the fracture line. In these instances, patients may have upward gaze failure (upward gaze diplopia) in the affected eye. Medial wall fractures characteristically show air within the orbit in radiographs. This is due to fracture of the ethmoidal labyrinth, permitting direct continuity between the orbit and the ethmoidal paranasal sinuses.

Is one eye recessed within the orbit (enophthalmos), or is the other eye protuberant (exophthalmos, or proptosis)? A small globe or a Horner\u2019s syndrome can give the appearance of enophthalmos. True enophthalmos occurs commonly after trauma, from atrophy of retrobulbar fat, or from fracture of the orbital floor. The position of the eyes within the orbits is measured by using a Hertel exophthalmometer, a handheld instrument that records the position of the anterior corneal surface relative to the lateral orbital rim. If this instrument is not available, relative eye position can be judged by bending the patient\u2019s head forward and looking down upon the orbits. A proptosis of only 2 mm in one eye is detectable from this perspective. The development of proptosis implies a space-occupying lesion in the orbit and usually warrants CT or MR imaging."

In the first half of the last century, fractures dominated the thinking of the medical profession, and cerebral lesions were regarded as secondary. Later, it became clear that the skull, although rigid, is still flexible enough to yield to a blow that injures the brain without causing fracture. Therefore, the presence of a fracture, although a rough measure of the force to which the brain has been exposed, is not an infallible index of the presence of cerebral injury (see further on in discussion of predictive features for imaging abnormalities with concussion). Even in immediately fatal head injuries, autopsy reveals an intact skull in 20 to 30 percent of cases.

            "content": "A blow to the skull that exceeds the elastic tolerance of the bone causes a fracture. Intracranial lesions accompany roughly two-thirds of skull fractures, and the presence of a fracture increases many-fold the chances of an underlying subdural or epidural hematoma. Consequently, fractures are primarily markers of the site and severity of injury. If the underlying arachnoid membrane has been torn, fractures also provide potential pathways for entry of bacteria to the CSF with a risk of meningitis and for leakage of CSF outward through the dura. If there is leakage of CSF, severe orthostatic headache results from lowered pressure in the spinal fluid compartment."

            "content": "Pulse therapy with IV methylprednisolone (e.g., 500 mg of methylprednisolone once weekly for 6 weeks, then 250 mg once weekly for 6 weeks) is preferable to oral glucocorticoids, which are used for moderately active disease. When glucocorticoids are ineffective, orbital decompression can be achieved by removing bone from any wall of the orbit, thereby allowing displacement of fat and swollen extraocular muscles. The transantral route is used most often because it requires no external incision. Proptosis recedes an average of 5 mm, but there may be residual or even worsened diplopia. Once the eye disease has stabilized, surgery may be indicated for relief of diplopia and correction of the appearance. External beam radiotherapy of the orbits has been used for many years, but the efficacy of this therapy remains unclear, and it is best reserved for those with moderately active disease who have failed or are not candidates for glucocorticoid therapy. Other immunosuppressive agents such as"

            "content": "fracture is associated with disrupted overlying skin. The fracture lines may be single (linear); multiple and radiating from a point (stellate); or multiple, creating fragments of bone (comminuted). Closed skull fractures do not normally require specific treatment. Open fractures require repair of the scalp and operative debridement. Indications for craniotomy include depression greater than the cranial thickness, intracranial hematoma, and frontal sinus involvement.6 Skull fractures generally indicate that a signifi-cant amount of force was transmitted to the head and should increase the suspicion for intracranial injury. Fractures that cross meningeal arteries can cause rupture of the underlying vessels and subsequent epidural hematoma (EDH) formation.Depressed skull fractures may result from a focal injury of significant force. The inner and outer cortices of the skull are disrupted, and a fragment of bone is pressed in toward the brain in relation to adjacent intact skull. The"

            "content": "swelling may prevent later evaluation. A lat-eral canthotomy may be needed to relieve periorbital pressure. The tympanic membrane is examined to identify hemotym-panum, otorrhea, or rupture, which may signal an underlying head injury. Otorrhea, rhinorrhea, raccoon eyes, and Battle\u2019s sign (ecchymosis behind the ear) suggest a basilar skull fracture. Although such fractures may not require treatment, there is an association with blunt cerebrovascular injuries, cranial nerve injuries, and risk of meningitis.Anterior facial structures should be examined to rule out fractures. This entails palpating for bony step-off of the facial bones and instability of the midface (by grasping the upper pal-ate and seeing if this moves separately from the patient\u2019s head). A good question to ask awake patients is whether their bite feels normal to them; abnormal dental closure suggests malalignment of facial bones and the possibility for a mandible or maxillary fracture. Nasal fractures, which may be"

            "content": "Nevertheless, fractures cannot be dismissed without further comment for several reasons. Overall, brain injury is estimated to be 5 to 10 times more frequent with skull fractures than without them and perhaps 20 times more frequent with severe and multiple fractures. Fractures assume further importance in providing an explanation for cranial-nerve palsies, and in creating potential pathways for the ingress of bacteria and air or the egress of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF leak). In these respects, fractures through the base of the skull are of special significance, and are considered below."
