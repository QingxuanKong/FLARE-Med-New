    "question": "A 57-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of cramping in his hands and feet and numbness and tingling around his lips and in his fingers; these symptoms occurred intermittently for 6 months but have been progressively severe during the past 2 weeks. He also has had a 13-kg (30-lb) weight loss and bulky, foul-smelling stools that do not flush easily. He has a 10-year history of drinking 8 to 10 beers daily. He has been hospitalized twice for severe abdominal pain 4 and 6 years ago. His pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 105/65 mm Hg. He appears cachectic and chronically ill. The abdomen is nontender. Deep tendon reflexes are 4+ bilaterally. Chvostek and Trousseau signs are present. His serum calcium concentration is 6.5 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with cramping in his hands and feet, numbness and tingling around his lips and fingers, weight loss, bulky, foul-smelling stools, and a history of heavy alcohol consumption. These symptoms are suggestive of a nutritional deficiency, particularly vitamin B12 deficiency, which is common in individuals with poor dietary habits and heavy alcohol consumption. The presence of Chvostek and Trousseau signs, which are indicative of neuromuscular irritability, further supports this diagnosis. The patient's serum calcium concentration is 6.5 mg/dL, which is below the normal range (8.6-10.2 mg/dL), indicating hypocalcemia. Given the combination of hypocalcemia and neuromuscular irritability, the most likely diagnosis is vitamin D deficiency, which can lead to hypocalcemia and neuromuscular symptoms. Vitamin D deficiency can be caused by a lack of exposure to sunlight, poor diet, and certain medications. The patient's history of heavy alcohol consumption and poor dietary habits make it likely that he has a vitamin D deficiency. \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

Case 3: Blood on the Toothbrush Patient Presentation: LT is an 84-year-old man whose gums have been bleeding for several months. Focused History: LT is a widower and lives alone in a suburban community on the East Coast. He no longer drives. His two children live on the West Coast and come east infrequently. Since the death of his wife 11 months ago, he has been isolated and finds it hard to get out of the house. His appetite has changed, and he is content with cereal, coffee, and packaged snacks. Chewing is difficult."

Case 4: Hypoglycemia, Hyperketonemia, and Liver Dysfunction Patient Presentation: AK, a 59-year-old male with slurred speech, ataxia (loss of skeletal muscle coordination), and abdominal pain, was dropped off at the Emergency Department (ED). Focused History: AK is known to the ED staff from previous visits. He has a 6year history of chronic, excessive alcohol consumption. He is not known to take illicit drugs. At this ED visit, AK reports that he has been drinking heavily in the past day or so. He cannot recall having eaten anything in that time. There is evidence of recent vomiting, but no blood is apparent."

He was recently incarcerated near Bakersfield, California and returned to Oakland about 3 months ago. He is currently experiencing one month of severe headache and double vision. He has a temperature of 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F) and the physical exam reveals nuchal rigidity and right-sided sixth cranial nerve palsy. MRI of his brain is normal, and lumbar puncture reveals 330 WBC with 20% eosinophils, protein 75, and glucose 20. HIV test is negative, TB skin test is negative, CSF cryptococcal antigen is negative, and CSF gram stain is negative. Patient receives empiric therapy for bacterial meningitis with van-comycin and ceftriaxone, and is unimproved after 72 hours of treatment. After 3 days a white mold is identified growing from his CSF culture. What medical therapy would be most appropriate now?"

His past medical history indicated that he was otherwise fit and well; however, it was noted he was 6\u2019 9\u201d and had undergone previous eye surgery for dislocating lenses. On examination the man was pale, clammy, and hypotensive. The pulse in his right groin was weak. An ECG demonstrated an inferior myocardial infarction. Serum blood tests revealed poor kidney function and marked acidosis. The patient was transferred to the CT scanner and a diagnosis of aortic dissection was made."

She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet.

She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy.

Most Japanese patients he described were younger than 20 years, but the 2 cases we have observed in whites were middle-aged. The serum calcium in these patients is normal, and the EMG shows only high-frequency discharges that are characteristic of cramps. A patient of ours with this condition had decades of chronic diarrhea, alopecia, and continuous, extremely painful calf cramps that had the gross appearance of fasciculations. This triad virtually identifies the disease. The cause of the disorder is obscure but is tentatively presumed to be autoimmune. Glucocorticoids, particularly in high doses over short periods, have been tried with some success; dantrolene has also been used and we had the impression that plasma exchange may"

A 50-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with severe lower back pain that had started several days ago. In the past 24 hours he has had two episodes of fecal incontinence and inability to pass urine and now reports numbness and weakness in both his legs. The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone."

He has hypertension, and during the last 8 years, he has been adequately managed with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH\u2019s problem? What information would you gather to confirm your diagnosis? What treatment steps would you initiate?"
