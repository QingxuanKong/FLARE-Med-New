During this latter period, the fetus is most vulnerable to defects in migration of neural crest cells. This may explain why most cases of aganglionosis involve the rectum and rectosigmoid. The length of the aganglionic segment of bowel is therefore determined by the most distal region that the migrating neural crest cells reach. In rare instances, total colonic aganglionosis may occur.Recent studies have shed light on the molecular basis for Hirschsprung\u2019s disease. Patients with Hirschsprung\u2019s disease have an increased frequency of mutations in several genes, including GDNF, its receptor Ret, or its coreceptor Gfra-1. Moreover, mutations in these genes also lead to aganglionic megacolon in mice, which provides the"

Blood is drawn for clinical laboratory tests. Prognosis: Patients treated with the appropriate antibiotic in the early stages of Lyme disease typically recover quickly and completely. Case-Related Questions: Choose the ONE best answer. Q1. Antibiotics in the tetracycline class inhibit protein synthesis (translation) at the initiation step. Which of the following statements about translation is correct? A. In eukaryotic translation, the initiating amino acid is formylated methionine. B. Only the charged initiating transfer RNA goes directly to the ribosomal A site. C. Peptidyltransferase is a ribozyme that forms the peptide bond between two amino acids. D. Prokaryotic translation can be inhibited by the phosphorylation of initiation factor 2."

The incidence of rectal prolapse peaks in women >60 years. Women with rectal prolapse have a higher incidence 1974 of associated pelvic floor disorders including urinary incontinence, rectocele, cystocele, and enterocele. About 20% of children with rectal prolapse will have cystic fibrosis. All children presenting with prolapse should undergo a sweat chloride test. Less common associations include Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, congenital hypothyroidism, Hirschsprung\u2019s disease, dementia, mental retardation, and schizophrenia."
