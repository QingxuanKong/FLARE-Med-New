Document [2] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) mentions that fungal cells, like animal cells, possess mitochondria but not chloroplasts. It also states that fungal cells have a tough outer wall that limits their ability to move rapidly. However, the question asks about the reinforcement of cell walls in fungi. Document [10] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) explains that the composition of the cell wall depends on the cell type. Document [9] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) states that in the cell walls of higher plants, the tensile fibers are made from the polysaccharide cellulose, but in fungi, the composition of the cell wall is not explicitly mentioned. However, Document [20] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) mentions that S. cerevisiae, a type of fungus, has a tough cell wall. Document [25] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) explains that in plants, the cell walls are made almost entirely of polymers that contain no nitrogen, including cellulose and lignin. However, it does not mention fungi. Document [4] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts) asks a similar question about fungal cells and suggests that they are more likely to be animal cells that gained the ability to make cell walls, or plant cells that lost their chloroplasts. This implies that fungal cells may have a different composition than plant cells. Given the information provided, the most plausible answer is that fungal cell walls are reinforced by a polysaccharide, but the exact composition is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. However, based on the context and the options provided, the most likely answer is chitin, which is a polysaccharide that is known to be a component of fungal cell walls. Therefore, the answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

One plausible view, however, is that they are all reflections of the way of life of a primordial cell that was a predator, living by capturing other cells and eating them (Figure 1\u201327). Such a way of life requires a large cell with a flexible plasma membrane, as well as an elaborate cytoskeleton to support Figure 1\u201325 The major features of eukaryotic cells. The drawing depicts a typical animal cell, but almost all the same components are found in plants and fungi as well as in single-celled eukaryotes such as yeasts and protozoa. Plant cells contain chloroplasts in addition to the components shown here, and their plasma membrane is surrounded by a tough external wall formed of cellulose."

Correspondingly, plant cells, although they possess the cytoskeletal equipment for movement, have lost the ability to change shape rapidly and to engulf other cells by phagocytosis. Instead, they create around themselves a tough, protective cell wall. If the first eukaryotic cells were predators on other organisms, we can view plant cells as cells that have made the transition from hunting to farming. Fungi represent yet another eukaryotic way of life.

To accommodate subsequent cell growth, the walls of the newborn cells, called primary cell walls, are thin and extensible, although tough. Once cell growth stops, the wall no longer needs to be extensible: sometimes the primary wall is retained without major modification, but, more commonly, a rigid secondary cell wall is produced by depositing new layers of matrix inside the old ones. These new layers generally have a composition that is significantly different from that of the primary wall.

Turgor pressure inside the cell drives the expansion, but it is the behavior of the cell wall that governs its direction and extent. Complex wall-remodeling activities are required, as well as the deposition of new wall materials.

As the synthesis of cellulose molecules and their self-assembly into microfibrils proceeds, the distal end of each microfibril presumably forms indirect cross-links to the previous layer of wall material, orienting the new microfibril in parallel with the old ones as it becomes integrated into the texture of the wall. Since the microfibril is stiff, the rosette at its growing, proximal end has to move as it deposits the new material. Traveling in the plane of the membrane, the rosette moves in the direction defined by the way in which the far end of the microfibril is anchored in the existing wall. In this way, each layer of microfibrils would tend to be spun out from the membrane in the same orientation as the layer laid down previously, with the rosettes following the direction of the preexisting oriented microfibrils"
