Essentially the GI tract is a hollow tube divided into major functional segments; the major structures along the tube are the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, rectum, and anus ( Fig. 27.1 ). Together the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum make up the small intestine, and the colon is sometimes referred to as the large intestine. Associated with the tube are blind-ending glandular structures that are invaginations of the lining of the tube; these glands empty their secretions into the gut lumen (e.g., Brunner\u2019s glands in the duodenum, which secrete copious amounts of HCO3 \u2212). Additionally there are glandular organs attached to the tube via ducts through which secretions empty into the gut lumen\u2014for example, the salivary glands and pancreas."

The estimated length varies depending on whether radiologic, surgical, or autopsy measurements are made. In the living, it is thought to measure 4 to 6 meters.2 The small intestine consists of three segments lying in series: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum.

In this site the meal is mixed with a variety of secretions that permit its digestion and absorption, and motility functions ensure adequate mixing and exposure of the intestinal contents (chyme) to the absorptive surface. The small intestine has many specializations that enable it to perform its functions efficiently. One of the most obvious specializations is the substantial surface area of the mucosa; this is achieved in a number of different ways. The small intestine is essentially a long tube that is coiled inside the abdominal cavity, there are folds of the full thickness of the mucosa and submucosa, the mucosa has finger-like projections called villi, and finally, each epithelial cell has microvilli on its apical surface. Thus a large surface area exists over which digestion and absorption occur."

Reabsorption is accomplished by the same Na/K-activated ATPase-driven transport system as described for the small intestine.

Zinner 28chapterINTRODUCTORY COMMENTSThe small intestine is a remarkable and complex organ that is not only the principle site of nutrient digestion and absorption but also contains the body\u2019s largest reservoir of immunologi-cally active and hormone-producing cells. Hence, it can be con-ceptualized as the largest organ of the immune and endocrine systems.1 It achieves this diversity of action through unique anatomical features, which provide it with a massive sur-face area, a diversity of cell types, and a complex neural network to coordinate these functions.Despite the size and importance of the small intestine, diseases of this organ are relatively infrequent and can present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Despite introduction of novel imaging techniques such as capsule endoscopy and dou-ble balloon endoscopy, diagnostic tests lack sufficient ability to reliably assess the small bowel. Furthermore, few"

Moving inferiorly, a large part of the rest of the upper part of the anterior surface is against the liver and is separated from it by a layer of peritoneum. Medially, the descending part of the duodenum is retroperitoneal and contacts the kidney. The inferior pole of the kidney, on its lateral side, is directly associated with the right colic flexure and, on its medial side, is covered by a segment of the intraperitoneal small intestine. The anterior surface of the left kidney is also related to numerous structures, some with an intervening layer of peritoneum and some directly against the kidney (Fig. 4.150): A small part of the superior pole, on its medial side, is covered by the left suprarenal gland. The rest of the superior pole is covered by the intraperitoneal stomach and spleen. Moving inferiorly, the retroperitoneal pancreas covers the middle part of the kidney."

It shows the four layers that make up the wall of the colon: the mucosa (Muc), the submucosa (SubM ), the muscularis externa (ME ), and the serosa (S ). Although these layers are the same as those in the small intestine, several differences should be noted. The large intestine has no villi, nor does it have plicae circulares. On the other hand, the muscularis externa is arranged in a 622 distinctive manner, and this is evident in the photomicrograph. The longi- Mucosa, colon, monkey, H&E \u00d7140. The mucosa, shown at higher magnification, contains straight, unbranched, tubular glands (crypts of Lieberkn) that extend to the muscularis mucosae (MM).

            "content": "The small intestine also aids in waste elimination. Bile contains by-products of erythrocyte degradation, toxins, metabolized and unmetabolized medications, and cholesterol. Motor function of the small intestine delivers indigestible food residue and sloughed enterocytes into the colon for further processing. The small intestine terminates in the ileocecal junction, a sphincteric structure that prevents coloileal reflux and maintains small-intestinal sterility."
