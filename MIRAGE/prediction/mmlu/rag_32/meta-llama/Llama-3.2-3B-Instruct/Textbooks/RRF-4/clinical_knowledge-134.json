According to document [2] (Title: Anatomy_Gray), the knee joint is a hinge joint that allows mainly flexion and extension, but it does not describe it as a ball and socket joint.\\n\\nOption B: A baker's cyst can sometimes be found anterior to the knee. According to document [13] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison), a bursal effusion (e.g., effusions of the olecranon or prepatellar bursa) is often focal, periarticular, and overlie bony prominences, and are fluctuant with sharply defined borders. This statement about baker's cysts is not accurate. Baker's cysts are typically found posterior to the knee.\\n\\nOption C: The patellar tap is used to demonstrate an effusion. According to document [13] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison), small to moderate knee effusions may be identified by the \u201cbulge sign\u201d or \u201cballottement of the patellae.\u201d This statement is true. The patellar tap, also known as the patellar tap test, is a physical examination technique used to assess for joint effusion.\\n\\nOption D: \u2018knock knee\u2019 deformity is due to bilateral genu varum. According to document [30] (Title: Anatomy_Gray), the most common malalignment in the knee is genu varum (bowlegs) or genu valgum (knock-knees) resulting from asymmetric cartilage loss medially or laterally. This statement is false. Genu varum is bowlegs, and genu valgum is knock-knees, and both can be caused by asymmetric cartilage loss, but it can also be caused by other factors.\\n\\nThe correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

This factor has been best studied in the knee, which is the fulcrum of the longest lever arm in the body. Varus (bowlegged) knees with OA are at exceedingly high risk of cartilage loss in the medial or inner compartment of the knee, whereas valgus (knockkneed) malalignment predisposes to rapid cartilage loss in the lateral compartment. Malalignment causes this effect by increasing stress on a focal area of cartilage, which then breaks down. There is evidence that malalignment in the knee not only causes cartilage loss but leads FIGUrE 394-5 The two types of limb malalignment in the frontal plane: varus, in which the stress is placed across the medial compartment of the knee joint, and valgus, which places excess stress across the lateral compartment of the knee."

The femur is the bone of the thigh. At its distal end, its major weight-bearing articulation is with the tibia, but it also articulates anteriorly with the patella (knee cap). The patella is the largest sesamoid bone in the body and is embedded in the quadriceps femoris tendon. The joint between the femur and tibia is the principal articulation of the knee joint, but the joint between the patella and femur shares the same articular cavity. Although the main movements at the knee are flexion and extension, the knee joint also allows the femur to rotate on the tibia. This rotation contributes to \u201clocking\u201d of the knee when fully extended, particularly when standing. The leg contains two bones: The tibia is medial in position, is larger than the laterally positioned fibula, and is the weight-bearing bone."

Inflammatory arthritis is likely if there is prolonged morning stiffness and many other joints are affected. Bursitis occurs commonly around knees and hips. A physical examination should focus on whether tenderness is over the joint line (at the junction of the two bones around which the joint is articulating) or is outside of it. Anserine bursitis, medial and distal to the knee, is an extremely common cause of chronic knee pain that may respond to a glucocorticoid injection. Prominent nocturnal pain in the absence of end-stage OA merits a distinct workup. For hip pain, OA can be detected by loss of internal rotation on passive movement, and pain isolated to an area lateral to the hip joint usually reflects the presence of trochanteric bursitis. No blood tests are routinely indicated for workup of patients with OA unless symptoms and signs suggest inflammatory arthritis."

The locale and level of pain elicited by palpation or movement should be quantified. One standard would be to count the number of tender joints on palpation of 28 easily examined joints (proximal interphalangeals, metacarpophalangeals, wrists, elbows, shoulders, and knees). Similarly, the number of swollen joints (0\u201328) can be counted and recorded. Careful examination should distinguish between true articular swelling (caused by bony hypertrophy, synovial effusion or proliferation) and nonarticular (or periarticular) involvement, which usually extends beyond the normal joint margins.

Modest synovitis develops in many but not all osteoarthritic joints. Some diseased joints have no synovitis, whereas others have synovial inflammation that approaches the severity of joints with rheumatoid arthritis (Chap. 380). The presence of synovitis on MRI is correlated with the presence and severity of knee pain. Capsular stretching from fluid in the joint stimulates nociceptive fibers there, inducing pain. Increased focal loading as part of the disease not only damages cartilage but probably also injures the underlying bone. As a consequence, bone marrow edema appears on the MRI; histologically, this edema signals the presence of microcracks and scar, which are the consequences of trauma. These lesions may stimulate bone nociceptive fibers."

The patellar ligament is basically the continuation of the quadriceps femoris tendon inferior to the patella (Fig. 6.76). It is attached above to the margins and apex of the patella and below to the tibial tuberosity. The collateral ligaments, one on each side of the joint, stabilize the hinge-like motion of the knee (Fig. 6.77). The cord-like fibular collateral ligament is attached superiorly to the lateral femoral epicondyle just above the groove for the popliteus tendon. Inferiorly, it is attached to a depression on the lateral surface of the fibular head. It is separated from the fibrous membrane by a bursa."

            "content": "Available @ StudentConsult.com The patellofemoral joint is a complex joint that dependson a balance between restraining ligaments of the patella,muscular forces around the knee, and alignment for normalfunction. The interior surface of the patella has a V-shapedbottom that moves through a matching groove in the femurcalled the trochlea. When the knee is flexed, the patellarligaments and the majority of the muscular forces pullingthrough the quadriceps tendon move the patella in a lateraldirection. The vastus medialis muscle counteracts the lateral motion, pulling the patella toward the midline. Problemswith function of this joint usually result in anterior kneepain."

            "content": "A series of structures within the knee joint were damaged sequentially. As the knee went into external rotation and valgus, the anterior cruciate ligament became taut, acting as a fulcrum. The tibial collateral ligament was stressed and the lateral compartment of the knee compressed. As the force increased, the tibial collateral ligament was torn (Fig. 6.139A,B), as was the medial meniscus (Fig. 6.140C). Finally, the anterior cruciate ligament, which was taut, gave way (Fig. 6.140A,B). The joint became swollen some hours afterward. Disruption of the anterior cruciate ligament characteristically produces marked joint swelling. The ligament is extrasynovial and intracapsular and has a rich blood supply. As the ligament was torn it ruptured into the joint. Blood from the tear irritates the synovial membrane and also enters the joint. These factors produce gradual swelling of the joint over the ensuing hours with significant fluid accumulation in the joint cavity."

            "content": "Knee pain may result from intraarticular (OA, RA) or periarticular (anserine bursitis, collateral ligament strain) processes or be referred from hip pathology. A careful history should delineate the chronology of the knee complaint and whether there are predisposing conditions, trauma, or medications that might underlie the complaint. For example, patellofemoral disease (e.g., OA) may cause anterior knee pain that worsens with climbing stairs. Observation of the patient\u2019s gait is also important. The knee should be carefully inspected in the upright (weight-bearing) and supine positions for swelling, erythema, malalignment, visible trauma, muscle wasting, and leg length discrepancy. The most common malalignment in the knee is genu varum (bowlegs) or genu valgum (knock-knees) resulting from asymmetric cartilage loss medially or laterally. Bony swelling of the knee joint commonly results from hypertrophic osseous changes seen with disorders such as OA and neuropathic arthropathy."
