    "question": "A 19-year-old woman who is a regular patient comes to the office for her annual physical examination and cervical cytology. She tells you that she has not had a menstrual period for the past 6 months. She is a college student who is in good health, has not had any medical illnesses or surgery, and has never been pregnant. She is currently sexually active and uses barrier contraception. She reports that during the past year her menses had become very irregular prior to complete cessation 6 months ago. She also notes that she has gained about 9 kg (20 lb) in the past 6 months and has had an increasing problem with acne and a troublesome growth of hair on her thighs and abdomen. She has been somewhat depressed about this, and her grades have declined. She reports that one of her sisters also had this problem prior to getting married. Physical examination shows a mildly obese young woman who has scattered facial acne, mild male pattern hair growth on the abdomen, and an essentially normal pelvic examination except for slight enlargement of the uterus and both ovaries. This patient's history is most consistent with which of the following?",

The patient is a young woman with a family history of similar symptoms in a sister. The physical examination shows mild obesity, scattered facial acne, and mild male pattern hair growth on the abdomen. The pelvic examination is essentially normal except for slight enlargement of the uterus and ovaries. These symptoms are suggestive of a hormonal disorder, and the patient's age and symptoms are consistent with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, characterized by hyperandrogenism (excess androgen activity), ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with PCOS, which is often associated with insulin resistance, obesity, and hirsutism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Because body hair is felt by many to be culturally unacceptable in women and girls, sensitive questioning about specific hair removal techniques (bleaching, waxing, use of depilatories, shaving, plucking, threading) is warranted during an examination. A complete pelvic examination is appropriate in patients who are sexually active, are having severe pain, or may have an anatomic anomaly. Testing for gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis infection is appropriate during a speculum examination if the patient is sexually active. Some young teens who have a history that is classic for anovulation, who deny sexual activity, and who agree to return for follow-up evaluation may be managed with a limited gynecologic examination supplemented with pelvic ultrasonography.

The extent of the physical examination during the gynecologic visit is often dictated by the patient\u2019s primary concerns and symptoms. For example, for healthy teens without symptoms who are requesting oral contraceptives before the initiation of intercourse, a gynecologic examination is not necessarily required. Some aspects of the examination\u2014such as assessment of vital signs and measurement of height, weight, blood pressure, and calculation of a body mass index\u2014 should be performed routinely during most office visits. Typically, examination of the breasts and abdomen and a complete examination of the pelvis are considered to be essential parts of the gynecologic examination.

The ages defining primary amenorrhea were decreased by 1 year to continue to represent two standard deviations above the mean age of developing secondary sexual characteristics and menses (1). Failure to begin breast development by age 13 warrants investigation. A woman who previously menstruated can develop secondary amenorrhea, which is defined as absence of menstruation for three normal menstrual cycles (2).

A history of drug use should be obtained. In addition to drugs that commonly cause hypertrichosis, anabolic steroids and testosterone derivatives may cause hirsutism and even virilization. During the physical examination, attention should be directed to obesity, hypertension, galactorrhea, male-pattern baldness, acne (face and back), and hyperpigmentation. With virilization, the presence of an androgen-producing ovarian neoplasm or Cushing syndrome must be considered. In many cases of Cushing syndrome, the patient\u2019s presenting symptom is hirsutism. This devastating disorder may masquerade as other disorders such as AOAH and PCOS. Before making these diagnoses, the physician should search for the physical signs of the syndrome such as \u201cmoon face,\u201d plethora, purple striae, dorsocervical and"

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."
