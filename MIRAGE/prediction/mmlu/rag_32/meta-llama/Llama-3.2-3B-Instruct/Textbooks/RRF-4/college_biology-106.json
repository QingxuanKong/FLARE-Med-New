    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's evaluate each option in relation to the provided documents.\\n\\nOption A: The presence of yolk inhibits cleavage. - Document [8] states that the zygote-a diploid cell with 46 chromosomes-undergoes slow cleavage for 3 days while still remaining in the fallopian tube. This indicates that the presence of yolk does not inhibit cleavage.\\n\\nOption B: Telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage. - Document [8] states that the morula enters the uterine cavity approximately 3 days after fertilization, and the morula is a solid mulberry-like ball of cells. This suggests that telolecithal eggs undergo meroblastic cleavage, which is a characteristic of this type of egg.\\n\\nOption C: The vegetal pole undergoes cleavage more readily than does the animal pole. - Document [1] states that the outer cells of the morula become tightly adhesive with each other and begin transporting fluid into the embryonic mass. This indicates that the animal pole, not the vegetal pole, undergoes cleavage more readily.\\n\\nOption D: The rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage directly give rise to blastomeres. - Document [1] states that the embryo is under the control of maternal informational macromolecules that have accumulated in the cytoplasm of the ovum during oogenesis. Later development depends on activation of the embryonic genome, which encodes various growth factors, cell junction components, and other macromolecules required for normal progression to the blastocyst stage. This indicates that the rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage do not directly give rise to blastomeres but rather produce a mass of cells that are controlled by maternal and then embryonic factors.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C, as the vegetal pole does not undergo cleavage more readily than the animal pole, and the rapid mitotic divisions of cleavage do not directly give rise to blastomeres.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

This asymmetric inheritance ensures that the two daughter cells develop differently (Figure 21\u201312). Asymmetric division is a common feature of early development, where the fertilized egg already has an internal pattern and cleavage of this large cell segregates different determinants into separate blastomeres.

Dorsal views of embryos during 22 to 23 days of development showing 8 and 12 somites, gonadotropin (hCG) become positive by this time. As shown in Figure 7-3, the body stalk is now diferentiated. There are villous cores in which angioblastic chorionic mesoderm can be distinguished and a true intervillous space that contains maternal blood. During the third week, fetal blood vessels in the chorionic villi appear. In the fourth week, a cardiovascular system has formed (Fig. 7-4). hereby, a true circulation is established respectively.

            "content": "As soon as the first meiotic division is completed, the secondary oocyte begins the second meiotic division. As the secondary oocyte surrounded by the cells of the corona radiata leaves the follicle at ovulation, the second meiotic division (equatorial division) is in progress. This division is arrested at metaphase and completed only if the secondary oocyte is penetrated by a spermatozoon. If fertilization occurs, the secondary oocyte completes the second meiotic division and forms a mature ovum with the maternal pronucleus containing a set of 23 chromosomes. The other cell produced at this division is a second polar body. In humans, the first polar body persists for more than 20 hours after ovulation and does not divide; therefore, the fertilized egg can be recognized by the presence of two polar bodies (diploid first polar body and haploid second polar body). In some mammals, the first polar body can divide, so the final outcome of meiosis consists of one oocyte and three haploid"

By 5 to 6 days of develop ment the trophoblasts of the blastocyst secrete proteases that digest the outer-lying zona pellucida. At this point, corresponding to about day 22 of the menstrual cycle, the \u201chatched\u201d blastocyst is able to adhere to and implant into the receptive uterine endometrium (see Fig. 44.33 At the time of attachment and implantation the tro phoblasts differentiate into two cell types: an inner layer of cytotrophoblasts and an outer layer of multinuclear/ Fig. 44.33)."

            "content": "Extraembryonic mesenchyme first appears as groups of isolated cells within the blastocyst cavity, and later this mesoderm completely lines the cavity. Spaces form and then fuse within the extraembryonic mesoderm to form the chorionic cavity (extraembryonic coelom). The chorion is composed of trophoblasts and mesenchyme. Some mesenchymal cells eventually will condense to form the body stalk. his stalk joins the embryo to the nutrient chorion and later develops into the umbilical cord. The body stalk can be recognized at an early stage at the caudal end of the embryonic disc (Fig. 7-3, p. 126). As the embryo enlarges, more maternal decidua basalis is invaded by syncytiotrophoblast. Beginning approximately 12 days after conception, the syncytiotrophoblast is permeated"

            "content": "The formation of synapses involves back-and-forth signaling between target cells and the growth cone. After the growth cones have reached their targets and initial connections have formed, individual synapses are eliminated in some places and reinforced in others by mechanisms that depend on synaptic and electrical activity. These mechanisms adjust the architecture of the neural network according to the way in which it is used. Which statements are true? Explain why or why not. What regulates the pace of development? Why does a mouse embryo develop faster than a human embryo, for example? What are the mechanisms that allow cell memory to be stored during development, explaining how each cell\u2019s history determines its future behavior? how do signals move through tissues? What are the roles of the extracellular matrix and of elongated cell projections?"
