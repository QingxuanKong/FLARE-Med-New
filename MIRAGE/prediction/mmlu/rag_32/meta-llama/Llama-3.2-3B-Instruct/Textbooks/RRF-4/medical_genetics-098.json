The documents discuss the process of fertilization, egg polarity, and early development in various organisms. The key concept here is the establishment of the primary axes of the body, which is influenced by the differential distribution of substances in the egg. This distribution leads to the creation of a polarized egg that can guide the development of the embryo. The documents highlight the importance of egg polarity genes, which define the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes of the future embryo. These genes act by setting up graded distributions of transcription regulators in the egg and early embryo. The correct answer should relate to the establishment of a pattern in the embryo as the cells divide. The other options do not accurately describe the outcome of differential distribution of substances in the egg.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Fertilization, through a reorganization of the microtubule cytoskeleton, triggers a rotation of the egg cortex (a layer a few \u03bcm deep) through about 30\u00b0 relative to the core of the egg; the direction of rotation determined by the site of sperm entry. Some components are carried still further to the future dorsal side by active transport along microtubules. the resulting dorsal concentration of Wnt11 mrNa leads to dorsal production of the Wnt11 signal protein and defines the dorsoventral polarity of the future embryo.

This is the case for most species, including insects such as Drosophila, as we shall see shortly. Many other organisms lie between the two extremes. The egg of the frog Xenopus, for example, has a clearly defined A-V axis even before fertilization: the nucleus near the top defines the animal pole, while the mass of yolk (the embryo\u2019s food supply, destined to be incorporated in the gut) toward the bottom defines the vegetal pole. Several types of mRNA molecules are already localized in the vegetal cytoplasm of the egg, where they produce their protein products. After fertilization, these mRNAs and proteins act in and on the cells in the lower and middle part of the embryo, giving the cells there specialized characters, both by direct effects and by stimulating the production of secreted signal proteins.

A frog, a chicken, and a mammal, for example, even though they develop in similar ways later, make eggs that differ radically in size and structure, and they begin their development with different sequences of cell divisions and cell specializations. Gastrulation occurs in all animal embryos, but the details of its timing, of the associated pattern of cell movements, and of the shape and size of the embryo as gastrulation proceeds are highly variable. Likewise, there is great variation in the time and manner in which the primary axes of the body become marked out.

Step 5: The signaling cascade activates the exocytosis of enzyme-filled vesicles called cortical granules that reside in the outermost, or cortical, region of the unfertilized egg. The enzymes contained in the cortical granules are released to the outside of the egg upon exocytosis. These enzymes modify both ZP2 and ZP3 of the zona pellucida such that ZP2 can no longer bind acrosomereacted sperm, and ZP3 can no longer bind capacitated acrosome-intact sperm. Thus only one sperm usually enters the egg. Occasionally, more than one sperm does enter the egg. This results in a triploid cell that is unable to develop further.

For example, a fly whose chromosomes are mutant in both copies of the Bicoid gene but who is born from a mother carrying one normal copy of Bicoid develops perfectly normally, without any defects in the head pattern. However, if that offspring is a female, she cannot deposit any functional Bicoid mRNA into her own eggs, which will therefore develop into headless embryos, regardless of the father\u2019s genotype. The egg-polarity genes act first in a hierarchy of gene systems that define a progressively more detailed pattern of body parts.

These questions are largely unanswered, but it is nevertheless possible to say what the ingredients of an answer must be. The size of an organ or organism depends on its total cell mass, which depends on both the total number of cells and their size. Cell number, in turn, depends on the amounts of cell division and cell death.

Often, the severity of disease is proportional to the number of infecting organisms.

            "content": "Epidemiology Ascaris is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions as well as in other humid areas, including the rural southeastern United States. Transmission typically occurs through fecally contaminated soil and is due either to a lack of sanitary facilities or to the use of human feces as fertilizer. With their propensity for hand-to-mouth fecal carriage, younger children are most affected. Infection outside endemic areas, though uncommon, can occur when eggs on transported vegetables are ingested."

            "content": "Eosinophilia and hypergammaglobulinemia associated with elevated isohemagglutinin levels suggest the diagnosis, which is confirmed by serology (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) or, less commonly, by biopsy. This is usually a self-limited illness. In severe disease, albendazole or mebendazole is used. Deworming puppies and kittens, major excreters of eggs, decreases the risk of infection. Available @ StudentConsult.com Pinworm is caused by Enterobius vermicularis, a nematode that is distributed worldwide. Enterobiasis affects individuals at all socioeconomic levels, especially children. Crowded living conditions predispose to infection. Humans ingest the eggs carried on hands, present in house dust or on bedclothes. The eggs hatch in the stomach, and the larvae migrate to the cecum and mature. At night the females migrate to the perianal area to lay their eggs, which are viable for 2 days."

            "content": "The sorting of chromosomes that takes place during meiosis is a remarkable feat of intracellular bookkeeping. In humans, each meiosis requires that the starting cell keep track of 92 chromatids (46 chromosomes, each of which has duplicated), distributing one complete set of each type of autosome to each of the four haploid progeny. Not surprisingly, mistakes can occur in allocating the chromosomes during this elaborate process. Mistakes are especially common in human female meiosis, which arrests for years after diplotene: meiosis I is completed only at ovulation, and meiosis II only after the egg is fertilized. Indeed, such chromosome segregation errors during egg development are the most common cause of both spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) and mental retardation in humans."
