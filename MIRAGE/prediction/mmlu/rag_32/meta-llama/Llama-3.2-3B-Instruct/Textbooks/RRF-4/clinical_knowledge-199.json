In contrast, slow-twitch fibers have high oxidative capacity and low ATPase activity. Therefore, the correct answer can be deduced by considering the characteristics of fast-twitch fibers. Specifically, fast-twitch fibers are known to have a relatively small number of mitochondria and high ATPase activity, which indicates their high glycolytic capacity and low oxidative capacity.

The high oxidative capacity of slow-twitch muscle fibers supports sustained contractile activity. Fast-twitch muscle fibers, in contrast, tend to be large and typically have low oxidative capacity and high glycolytic capacity. The fast-twitch motor units are thus best suited for short periods of activity when high levels of force are required. 7."

For an in-depth description of muscle fiber types, see . Of importance in this chapter is that a number of physiological properties are correlated with this histochemical classification scheme. In particular, slow-twitch fibers, which contract and relax slowly as implied by their name, also generate low-force levels but essentially never fatigue.

The oxidative capacity of the fast-twitch muscle fiber ranges from relatively high (in muscle fibers expressing type IIa myosin heavy chain) to low (in muscle fibers expressing type IIb myosin heavy chains). The low oxidative capacity of fast type IIb muscle fibers, coupled with the high myosin ATPase activity, increases the susceptibility of these muscle fibers to fatigue. Humans, however, rarely express the type IIb myosin heavy chain. Type IIb myosins are expressed in small animals such as rabbit and rats.

Fast-twitch motor units, in contrast, tend to be large (containing 1000 to 2000 muscle fibers) and are innervated by \u03b1 motor neurons that are more difficult to excite. Thus slow-twitch motor units tend to be recruited first. As more and more force is needed, fast-twitch motor units are recruited. The advantage of such a recruitment strategy is that the first muscle fibers recruited are those that have high resistance to fatigue. Moreover, the small size of slow-twitch motor units allows fine motor control at low levels of force. The process of increasing the force of contraction by recruiting additional motor units is termed spatial summation because forces from muscle fibers are being \u201csummed\u201d within a larger area of the muscle. This is in contrast to temporal summation, which is discussed later. Action potentials in skeletal muscles are quite uniform and lead to the release of a reproducible pulse of Ca++ from the SR ("

The soleus muscle of the leg, in contrast, requires 90 msec to reach peak tension in response to an action potential, and then it relaxes slowly. The gastrocnemius muscle requires an intermediate time to reach peak tension (40 msec) because of the presence of both fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers in this muscle. The difference in speed of contraction between fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscles is correlated with myosin ATPase activity (see Fig. 12.14B ), which in turn reflects the type of myosin present in the muscle fiber (Fig. 12.15 Table 12.1 ).

The force of contraction can be increased by the activation of more motor neurons (i.e., recruiting of more muscle fibers) or by an increase in the frequency of action potentials in the muscle fiber, which produces tetany. The increase in force during tetanic contractions is due to prolonged elevation of intracellular [Ca++]. 5. The two basic types of skeletal muscle fibers are distinguished on the basis of their speed of contraction (i.e., fast-twitch versus slow-twitch). The difference in speed of contraction is attributed to the expression of different myosin isoforms that differ in myosin ATPase activity. In addition to the difference in myosin ATPase activity, fast-and slow-twitch muscles also differ in metabolic activity, fiber diameter, motor unit size, sensitivity to tetany, and recruitment pattern. 6."

As already noted, muscle fibers can be classified as fast-twitch or slow-twitch. The type of fiber is determined by its innervation. Because all fibers in a motor unit are innervated by a single \u03b1 motor neuron, all fibers within a motor unit are of the same type.

Chronic electrical stimulation of a fast-twitch muscle results in the expression of slow-twitch myosin and decreased expression of fast-twitch myosin, along with an increase in oxidative capacity. The mechanism or mechanisms underlying this change in gene expression are unknown, but the change appears to be secondary to an elevation in resting intracellular [Ca++]. The Ca++-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and the transcription factor NFAT have been implicated in this transition from the fast-twitch to the slow-twitch phenotype.

V0 corresponds to the maximal cycling rate of the cross-bridges (i.e., it is proportional to the maximal rate of energy turnover [ATPase activity] by myosin). Thus V0 for fast-twitch muscle is higher than that for slow-twitch muscle. Increasing the load decreases the velocity of muscle shortening until, at maximal load, the muscle cannot lift the load and hence cannot shorten (zero velocity). Further increases in load result in stretching the muscle (negative velocity). The maximal isometric tension (i.e., force at which shortening velocity is zero) is proportional to the number of active cross-bridges between actin and myosin, and it is usually greater for fast-twitch motor units (because of the larger diameter of fast-twitch muscle fibers and greater number of muscle fibers in a typical fast-twitch motor unit).

The high myosin ATPase activity in fast muscle fibers and the increase in diffusion distance (resulting from the large diameter of the fast muscle fibers), however, increase the susceptibility of fast muscle fibers to fatigue. Additional differences between fast and slow muscles include the following: 1. The motor neuron in slow muscle is more easily excited than that in fast muscle, and so slow muscles are typically recruited first. As stated previously, the high oxidative capacity of slow muscle, coupled with the low myosin ATPase activity, helps reduce the susceptibility to fatigue in slow muscle. 2."

These motor units contain slow-twitch fibers and thus generate the smallest contractile force, allowing the initial contraction to be finely graded. These units tend to be active much of the time, if not continuously, and so their lack of fatigability makes good functional sense. As more motor units are recruited for a motor act, motor neurons with progressively larger axons become involved, and these axons synapse onto the fast-twitch fibers. Thus they generate progressively larger amounts of tension. The most powerful such motor units are typically recruited only for tasks requiring large amounts of force (e.g., sprinting, jumping, and lifting a heavy weight), tasks that people can perform for only for short periods of time."

This result, coupled with the observation that the size of the intracellular Ca++ transient during a twitch contraction is comparable with that during tetany, suggests that enough Ca++ is released into the myoplasm during a twitch to allow the actin-myosin interactions to produce maximal tension. However, the duration of the intracellular Ca++ transient during a twitch is sufficiently short that the contractile elements may not have enough time to fully stretch the series elastic components in the fiber and muscle.

            "content": "The force-generating molecular interaction between myosin thick filaments and actin thin filaments takes place only when a signal passes to the skeletal muscle from the nerve that stimulates it. Immediately upon arrival of the signal, the muscle cell needs to be able to contract very rapidly, with all the sarcomeres shortening simultaneously. Two major features of the muscle cell make extremely rapid contraction possible. First, as previously discussed, the individual myosin motor heads in each thick filament spend only a small fraction of the ATP cycle time bound to the filament and actively generating force, so many myosin heads can act in rapid succession on the same thin filament without interfering with one another. Second, a specialized membrane system relays the incoming signal rapidly throughout the entire cell. The signal from the nerve triggers an action potential in the muscle cell plasma membrane (discussed in Chapter 11), and this electrical excitation spreads swiftly"
