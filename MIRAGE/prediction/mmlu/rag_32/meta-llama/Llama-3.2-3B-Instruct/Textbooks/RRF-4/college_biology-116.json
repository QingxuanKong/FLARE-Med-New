It is the frequency of discharge that changes with the stimulus intensity, not the amplitude of the action potential itself.\\n\\nOption B: The threshold potential - The threshold potential is the minimum amount of stimulus required to generate an action potential. This can vary between neurons and is not directly related to the intensity of the stimulus. Instead, it is a fixed value for each neuron.\\n\\nOption C: The number of action potentials per second - This is a plausible answer. The number of action potentials per second, or the frequency of discharge, is a common way to encode stimulus intensity. As the stimulus intensity increases, more primary afferent neurons are activated, leading to a greater frequency of discharge in central sensory neurons. This is a key mechanism by which the brain detects differences in stimulus intensity.\\n\\nOption D: The number of synapses crossed - The number of synapses crossed is not directly related to the detection of differences in stimulus intensity. While the number of synapses may be affected by the strength of the stimulus, it is not the primary mechanism by which the brain detects differences in intensity.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C. The number of action potentials per second.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

            "content": "Another way in which stimulus intensity is encoded is according to the number of sensory receptors that are activated. A stimulus at the threshold for perception may activate only one or only a few primary afferent neurons of an appropriate class, whereas a strong stimulus of the same type may recruit many similar receptors. Central sensory neurons that receive input from sensory receptors of this particular class would be more powerfully affected as more primary afferent neurons discharge. Greater activity in central sensory neurons may be perceived as a stronger stimulus."

            "content": "Intensity may be encoded in a number of ways. Because action potentials have a uniform magnitude, some sensory neurons encode intensity by their frequency of discharge (rate coding). The relationship between stimulus intensity and response can be plotted as a stimulus-response function. For many sensory neurons, the stimulus-response function approximates an exponential curve with an exponent that can be less than, equal to, or greater than 1. Stimulus-response functions with fractional exponents characterize many mechanoreceptors. Thermoreceptors, which detect changes in temperature, have linear stimulus-response curves (exponent of 1). Nociceptors, which detect painful stimuli, may have linear or positively accelerating stimulus-response functions (i.e., the exponent for these curves is 1 or greater). The positively accelerating stimulus-response functions of nociceptors help explain the urgency that is experienced as the pain sensation increases."

These responses are of very low voltage, often fleeting and inconsistent, and of unknown anatomic origin. The most studied types occur approximately 300 ms (P300) after an attentive subject identifies an unexpected or novel stimulus that has been inserted into a regular train of stimuli. Almost any stimulus modality can be used and the potential occurs even when a stimulus has been omitted from a regular pattern. The amplitude of the response depends on the difficulty of the task and has an inverse relationship to the frequency of the unexpected or \u201codd\u201d event; the latency depends on the task difficulty and other features of testing.

One, the specificity theory, was from the beginning associated with the name of von Frey. He asserted that the skin consisted of a mosaic of discrete sensory spots and that each spot, when stimulated, gave rise to one sensation\u2014either pain, pressure, warmth, or cold; in his view, each of these sensations had a distinctive end organ in the skin and each stimulus-specific end organ was connected by its own discrete pathway to the brain. A second theory was that of Goldscheider, who abandoned his own earlier discovery of pain spots to argue that they simply represented pressure spots, a sufficiently intense stimulation of which could produce pain. According to the latter theory, there were no distinctive pain receptors, and the sensation of pain was the result of the summation of impulses excited by pressure or thermal stimuli applied to the skin. Originally called the intensivity"

When higher frequencies need to be encoded (e.g., the auditory system, which in humans is capable of detecting frequencies up to 20,000 Hz; see ), other strategies are needed. Other candidate codes depend on the spatiotemporal patterns of firing across populations of neurons. The duration and the onset and offset of events are encoded by different populations of sensory neurons. For example, slowly adapting receptors in the skin produce a repetitive discharge throughout a prolonged stimulus. However, rapidly adapting receptors produce spikes at the onset (or offset) of the same stimulus."

The limit of a neuron\u2019s firing rate of action potentials can also limit its range of response to a stimulus. However, mechanoreceptors with different thresholds can overcome this problem: Those with low thresholds can signal over a range of low input intensities, whereas others with higher thresholds can signal higher input intensities. Together they allow fine resolution over an extended range of intensities. In addition, still higher intensities might recruit nociceptors, and that will also change the perceived quality of the stimulus."

For one thing, test procedures are relatively crude and are unlike the natural modes of stimulation with which the patient is familiar. It is also fair to say that few diagnoses are made solely on the basis of the sensory examination; more often the exercise serves to complement the remainder of the examination. There is often difficulty in evaluating the response to sensory stimuli, as it depends on the patient\u2019s interpretation of sensory experiences. This, in turn, will depend on the patient\u2019s general awareness and responsiveness and ability to cooperate, as well as degree of suggestibility.

Warm and cold spots are those small areas of skin that respond most consistently to thermal stimuli with a sensation of warmth or cold. They found that a cold stimulus applied to a warm spot gave rise to a sensation of cold and that a noxious stimulus applied to a warm or cold spot gave rise only to a painful sensation; they also noted that mechanical stimulation of these spots gave rise to a sensation of touch or pressure. These experiments indicate that cutaneous receptors, some not distinguishable from each other on morphologic grounds, are probably endowed with only relative degrees of specificity, in the sense that each responds preferentially (i.e., has a lower threshold) to one particular form of stimulation."

Also, brief EEG waves do exist and, because of their shape, are sometimes referred to as spikes, but this does not imply that they are associated with action potentials. An EEG change that can be elicited by a stimulus is called a cortical evoked potential. A cortical evoked potential is best recorded from the part of the skull located over the cortical area being activated. For example, a visual stimulus results in an evoked potential that can be recorded best over the occipital bone, whereas a somatosensory evoked potential is recorded most effectively near the junction of the frontal and parietal bones. Evoked potentials reflect the activity in large numbers of cortical neurons. They may also reflect activity in subcortical structures."

In testing for loudness recruitment, the difference in hearing between the two ears is estimated and the loudness of the pure-tone stimulus of a given frequency delivered to each ear is then increased by regular increments. In nonrecruiting deafness (characteristic of a nerve lesion), the original difference in hearing persists in all comparisons of loudness, since both highand low-intensity fibers are affected.

In order for this to happen, the stimulus must produce receptor potentials that are large enough to change the spiking levels of one or more primary afferent fibers that are connected to the receptor. Weaker intensities of stimulation can produce subthreshold receptor potentials, but such stimuli do not change the activity of central sensory neurons and thus are not detected.
