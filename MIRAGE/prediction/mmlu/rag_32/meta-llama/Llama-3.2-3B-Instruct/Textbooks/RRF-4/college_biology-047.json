The ovaries develop from the genital ridges and migrate to their final position in the pelvic cavity. The oviducts form from the mesonephric ducts, which are derived from the Wolffian ducts. The rete testis is not present in females, so it can be excluded from the options.

As this occurs, serum LH and FSH levels rise. Although sperm production typically begins to decline after age 50, many men can maintain reproductive function and spermatogenesis throughout life. The female reproductive system is composed of the gonads, called ovaries, and the female reproductive tract, which includes the oviducts, uterus, cervix, vagina, and external genitalia. The Ovary The ovary is located within a fold of peritoneum called the broad ligament, usually close to the lateral wall of the pelvic cavity ( Fig. 44.13 ). Because the ovary extends into the peritoneal cavity, ovulated eggs briefly reside within the peritoneal cavity before they are captured by the oviducts.

This descent by differential growth is under the control of a ligamentous cord called the gubernaculum, which is attached to the ovary superiorly and to the fascia in the region of the future labia majora inferiorly. The gubernaculum becomes attached to the paramesonephric ducts at their point of superior fusion so that it becomes divided into two separate structures.

Congenital uterine anomalies may, therefore, include incomplete m\u00a8ullerian duct fusion, incomplete septum resorption, and uterine cervical anomalies.

            "content": "The body of the uterus is flattened anteroposteriorly and, above the level of origin of the uterine tubes (Fig. 5.53), has a rounded superior end (fundus of the uterus). The cavity of the body of the uterus is a narrow slit, when viewed laterally, and is shaped like an inverted triangle, when viewed anteriorly. Each of the superior corners of the cavity is continuous with the lumen of a uterine tube; the inferior corner is continuous with the central canal of the cervix. Implantation of the blastocyst normally occurs in the body of the uterus. During pregnancy, the uterus dramatically expands superiorly into the abdominal cavity."

Why then do you suppose the Surgeon General has not yet issued an appropriate warning to heavy coffee and cola drinkers? A typical cup of coffee (150 mL) contains 100 mg of caffeine (196 g/ mole). How many cups of coffee would you have to drink to reach the dose (10 mM) required to interfere with the DNA damage response? (A typical adult contains about 40 liters of water.) 17\u201311 How many kinetochores are there in a human cell at mitosis? 17\u201312 A living cell from the lung epithelium of a newt is shown at different stages in M phase in Figure Q17\u20132.

            "content": "Table 5.6 Development of Genital and Urinary Tracts by Embryologic Age This process gives rise to three successive sets of increasingly advanced urinary structures, each developing more caudal to its predecessor. The pronephros, or \u201cfirst kidney,\u201d is rudimentary and nonfunctional; it is succeeded by the \u201cmiddle kidney,\u201d or mesonephros, which is believed to function brie\ufb02y before regressing. Although the mesonephros is transitory as an excretory organ, its duct, the mesonephric (wolffian) duct,is of singular importance for the following reasons: 1. It grows caudally in the developing embryo to open, for the first time, an excretory channel into the primitive cloaca and the \u201coutside world.\u201d 2. It serves as the starting point for development of the metanephros, which becomes the definitive kidney. 3. It ultimately differentiates into the sexual duct system in the male. 4."

            "content": "The design of the reproductive system in men is basically a series of ducts and tubules. The arrangement of parts and linkage to the urinary tract reflects its embryological development. The testes originally develop high on the posterior abdominal wall and then descend, normally before birth, through the inguinal canal in the anterior abdominal wall and into the scrotum of the perineum. During descent, the testes carry their vessels, lymphatics, and nerves, as well as their principal drainage ducts, the ductus deferens (vas deferens) with them. The lymph drainage of the testes is therefore to the lateral aortic or lumbar nodes and pre-aortic nodes in the abdomen, and not to the inguinal or pelvic lymph nodes."
