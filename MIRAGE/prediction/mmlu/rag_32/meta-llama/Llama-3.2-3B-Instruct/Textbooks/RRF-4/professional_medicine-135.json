The patient is also positive for opiates and cocaine in the urine toxicology screening. This combination of symptoms and lab results is indicative of a substance-induced rhabdomyolysis. The patient is at increased risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the release of myoglobin and other myoglobin-related toxins into the bloodstream from damaged muscle tissue. AKI can progress to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which is a type of kidney damage that can lead to renal failure. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Katzung, MD, PhD A 56-year-old woman is brought to the university eye center with a complaint of \u201closs of vision.\u201d Because of visual impair-ment, she has lost her driver\u2019s license and has fallen several times in her home. Examination reveals that her eyelids close involuntarily with a frequency and duration sufficient to pre-vent her from seeing her surroundings for more than brief moments at a time. When she holds her eyelids open with her fingers, she can see normally. She has no other muscle dysfunction. A diagnosis of blepharospasm is made. Using a fine needle, several injections of botulinum toxin type A are made in the orbicularis oculi muscle of each eyelid. After observation in the waiting area, she is sent home. Two days later, she reports by telephone that her vision has improved dramatically. How did botulinum toxin improve her vision? How long can her vision be expected to remain normal after this single treatment?"
