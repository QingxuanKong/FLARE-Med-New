Considering the options provided, we need to identify the one that is most closely related to skin excoriation.\\n\\nOption A, a well-fitting pouch, does not directly relate to skin excoriation. Option B, changing the pouch every day, might cause skin irritation but is not a primary cause of skin excoriation. Option D, the use of unscented soap to cleanse the skin, is also not directly related to skin excoriation. However, option C, leakage of effluent onto peristomal skin, is a plausible cause of skin excoriation. Peristomal skin can be prone to excoriation due to the constant flow of urine or feces, leading to skin irritation and lesions.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Most individuals pick with their fingernails, although many use tweezers, pins, or other objects. In addition to skin picking, there may be skin rubbing, squeezing, lancing, and biting.

            "content": "Anatomic changes that occur in postmenopausal women include atrophy of the labia majora and increasing prominence of the labia minora. The epithelium of the hymen and vestibule become thin; there is a shift in vaginal cellular maturation in response to estrogen deprivation, with resultant thinning. Although these changes lead to minimal symptoms in most women, external dysuria, pruritus, tenderness, dyspareunia, and bleeding can result from fissuring and excoriations. Because of the risk of VIN and malignancy, suspicious lesions require vulvar biopsy. Vulvar Dermatoses Several vulvar conditions occur most commonly in postmenopausal women. Symptoms are primarily itching and vulvar soreness, in addition to dyspareunia."

            "content": "Scabies should be considered in patients with pruritus and symmetric superficial, excoriated, papulovesicular skin lesions in characteristic locations, particularly if there is a history of household contact with an infested person. Burrows should be sought and unroofed with a sterile needle or scalpel blade, and the scrapings should be examined microscopically for mites, eggs, and fecal pellets. Examination of skin biopsies (including superficial cyanoacrylate biopsy) or scrapings, dermatoscopic imaging of papulovesicular lesions, and microscopic inspection of clear cellophane tape lifted from lesions also may be diagnostic. In the absence of identifiable mites or eggs, the diagnosis is based on a history of pruritus, a clinical examination, and an epidemiologic link. Diverse kinds of dermatitis from other causes frequently are misdiagnosed as scabies, particularly in presumed \u201coutbreak\u201d situations. Scabies mites of other animals may cause transient irritation, but they do not reside"

            "content": "Clinical Features Skin photosensitivity, which differs from that in other porphyrias, usually begins in childhood and consists of pain, redness, and itching occurring within minutes of sunlight exposure (Fig. 430-4). Photosensitivity is associated with substantial elevations in erythrocyte protoporphyrin and occurs only in patients with genotypes that result in ferrochelatase activities below ~35% of normal. Vesicular lesions are uncommon. Redness, swelling, burning, and itching can develop shortly after sun exposure and resemble angioedema. Pain symptoms may seem out of proportion to the visible skin involvement. Sparse vesicles and bullae occur in ~10% of cases. Chronic skin changes may include lichenification, leathery pseudovesicles, labial grooving, and nail changes. Severe scarring is rare, as are pigment changes, friability, and hirsutism. Unless hepatic or other complications develop, protoporphyrin levels and symptoms of photosensitivity remain remarkably stable over many"

            "content": "The Fitzpatrick classification of human skin phototypes is based on the efficiency of the epidermal-melanin unit, which usually can be ascertained by asking an individual two questions: (1) Do you burn after sun exposure? (2) Do you tan after sun exposure? The answers to these questions permit division of the population into six skin types, varying from type I (always burn, never tan) to type VI (never burn, always tan) (Table 75-1)."
