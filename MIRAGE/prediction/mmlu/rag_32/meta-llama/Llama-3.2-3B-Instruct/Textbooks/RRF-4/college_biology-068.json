Angiosperms, also known as flowering plants, are characterized by the presence of flowers and seeds enclosed in ovaries. Gymnosperms, on the other hand, have seeds that are not enclosed in ovaries. The question asks which of the given options distinguishes angiosperms from gymnosperms. We need to analyze each option and eliminate the incorrect ones. Option A, perennial growth, is a characteristic that can be found in both angiosperms and gymnosperms, as many plants in both groups can be perennial. Option B, true roots, is also not a distinguishing characteristic, as both angiosperms and gymnosperms have true roots. Option C, apical growth, is a characteristic that is more closely related to the growth patterns of plants, but it does not specifically distinguish angiosperms from gymnosperms. Option D, seeds enclosed in ovaries, is a key characteristic that distinguishes angiosperms from gymnosperms, as angiosperms produce flowers that contain seeds enclosed in ovaries, while gymnosperms produce seeds that are not enclosed in ovaries. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

It is on the fourth point that plant development differs radically: plant cells are unable to migrate or move independently through the embryo because each one is contained within a cell wall, through which it is cemented to its neighbors, as discussed in Chapter 19."

The new cells are usually produced in special regions called meristems, and they are generally small in comparison with their final size. To accommodate subsequent cell growth, the walls of the newborn cells, called primary cell walls, are thin and extensible, although tough. Once cell growth stops, the wall no longer needs to be extensible: sometimes the primary wall is retained without major modification, but, more commonly, a rigid secondary cell wall is produced by depositing new layers of matrix inside the old ones. These new layers generally have a composition that is significantly different from that of the primary wall.

The manner of this expansion determines the final shape of each cell, and hence the final form of the plant as a whole. Turgor pressure inside the cell drives the expansion, but it is the behavior of the cell wall that governs its direction and extent. Complex wall-remodeling activities are required, as well as the deposition of new wall materials. Because of their crystalline structure, the individual cellulose microfibrils in the wall are unable to stretch, and this gives them a crucial role in the process. For the cell wall to stretch or deform, the microfibrils must either slide past one another or become more widely separated, or both. The orientation of the microfibrils in the innermost layers of the wall governs the direction in which the cell expands.
