The oculomotor nerve controls most of the eye muscles, including the medial rectus, superior rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles. It also carries parasympathetic fibers that control pupil constriction and the sphincter pupillae muscle. Damage to the third cranial nerve can result in impaired eye movement, particularly affecting the medial rectus muscle, leading to strabismus (crossed eyes). The pupil will dilate due to the loss of parasympathetic input from the third cranial nerve. Therefore, the expected signs in this patient will be pupillary dilatation and a lateral strabismus (esotropia) because the damaged nerve is responsible for medial rectus muscle function and pupil constriction.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

On examination of the right eye the pupil was dilated. There was a mild ptosis. Testing of eye movement revealed that the eye turned down and out and the pupillary reflex was not present. These findings revealed that the patient had an ipsilateral third nerve palsy (palsy of the oculomotor nerve [III]). The oculomotor nerve [III] is the main motor nerve to the ocular and extra-ocular muscles. It arises from the midbrain and pierces the dura mater to run in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. The oculomotor nerve [III] leaves the cranial cavity and enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. Within this fissure it divides into its superior and inferior divisions."

Surgical anastomosis has sometimes been successful in restoring function in this circumstance.

Is one eye recessed within the orbit (enophthalmos), or is the other eye protuberant (exophthalmos, or proptosis)? A small globe or a Horner\u2019s syndrome can give the appearance of enophthalmos. True enophthalmos occurs commonly after trauma, from atrophy of retrobulbar fat, or from fracture of the orbital floor. The position of the eyes within the orbits is measured by using a Hertel exophthalmometer, a handheld instrument that records the position of the anterior corneal surface relative to the lateral orbital rim. If this instrument is not available, relative eye position can be judged by bending the patient\u2019s head forward and looking down upon the orbits. A proptosis of only 2 mm in one eye is detectable from this perspective. The development of proptosis implies a space-occupying lesion in the orbit and usually warrants CT or MR imaging."

            "content": "A variety of diseases can affect the trigeminal nerve (Table 455-1). Most present with sensory loss on the face or with weakness of the jaw muscles. Deviation of the jaw on opening indicates weakness of the pterygoids on the side to which the jaw deviates. Some cases are due to Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome or a collagen-vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, or mixed connective tissue disease. Among infectious causes, herpes zoster (acute or postherpetic) and leprosy should be considered. Tumors of the middle cranial fossa (meningiomas), of the trigeminal nerve (schwannomas), or of the base of the skull (metastatic tumors) may cause a combination of motor and sensory signs. Lesions in the cavernous sinus can affect the first and second divisions of the trigeminal nerve, and lesions of the superior orbital fissure can affect the first (ophthalmic) division; the accompanying corneal anesthesia increases the risk of ulceration (neurokeratitis)."

These injuries may be treated with observation only if they are isolated and small without signs of displacement or limitation of mobility of the globe. However, surgical treatment is generally indicated for large fractures or ones associated with enophthalmos (retrusion of the globe), which suggests increased intraorbital volume and restriction of upward gaze on the injured side, with entrapment of inferior orbital tissues or double vision (diplopia) persisting greater than 2 weeks.28 There are a variety of options for surgical exposure of the orbital floor, including the transconjunctival, subciliary, and lower blepharoplasty incisions. All provide good access for accurate diagnosis and treatment, which involves reducing orbital contents and repairing the floor with either autologous bone or synthetic materials. Late complications include per-sistent diplopia, enophthalmos, or displacement of the lower eyelid ciliary margin inferiorly"

These include: the long ciliary nerves, which are sensory to the eyeball but may also contain sympathetic fibers for pupillary dilation; the posterior ethmoidal nerve, which exits the orbit through the posterior ethmoidal foramen to supply posterior ethmoidal cells and the sphenoidal sinus; the infratrochlear nerve, which distributes to the medial part of the upper and lower eyelids, the lacrimal sac, and skin of the upper half of the nose; and the anterior ethmoidal nerve, which exits the orbit through the anterior ethmoidal foramen to supply the anterior cranial fossa, nasal cavity, and skin of the lower half of the nose (Fig. 8.106)."

            "content": "Coma due to Widespread Damage to the Cerebral Hemispheres This category, comprising a number of unrelated disorders, results from widespread structural cerebral damage that simulates a metabolic disorder of the cortex. Hypoxia-ischemia is perhaps the best characterized and one in which it is not possible initially to distinguish the acute reversible effects of oxygen deprivation of the brain from the subsequent effects of anoxic neuronal damage. Similar widespread cerebral damage may be produced by disorders that occlude small blood vessels throughout the brain; examples include cerebral malaria, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and hyperviscosity. Diffuse white matter damage from cranial trauma or inflammatory demyelinating diseases can cause a similar coma syndrome. APPROACH TO THE PATIENT: A video examination of the comatose patient is shown in Chap. 329e."

            "content": "Astrocytomas of the brainstem are relatively slow-growing tumors that infiltrate tracts and nuclei. They produce a variable clinical picture depending on their location in the medulla, pons, or midbrain. Most often, this tumor begins in childhood (peak age of onset is 7 years), and 80 percent appear before the 21st year. Symptoms have usually been present for 3 to 5 months before coming to medical notice. In most patients the initial manifestation is a palsy of one or more cranial nerves, usually the sixth and seventh on one side, followed by long tract signs\u2014hemiparesis, unilateral ataxia, ataxia of gait, paraparesis, and hemisensory and gaze disorders in addition to pseudobulbar dysarthria and palsy. In the remaining patients the symptoms occur in the reverse order\u2014that is, long tract signs precede the cranial nerve abnormalities. Patients in the latter group survive longer than those whose illness begins with cranial nerve palsies. Headache, vomiting, and papilledema may occur,"
