The recognized complications of CF include chronic lung infections, pancreatic insufficiency, liver cirrhosis, and male infertility, among others.\\n\\nOption A, cancer of the oesophagus, is not a commonly recognized complication of CF. However, it is essential to note that CF patients are at increased risk for various types of cancer, including lung, liver, and pancreatic cancer.\\n\\nOption B, congenital absence of the vas deferens, is a recognized complication of CF, particularly in males. This condition is due to the absence of the vas deferens, a muscular tube that carries sperm from the testes to the penis.\\n\\nOption C, diabetes mellitus, is also a recognized complication of CF. CF patients often develop insulin-resistant diabetes due to pancreatic insufficiency and chronic inflammation.\\n\\nOption D, liver cirrhosis, is another recognized complication of CF, particularly in advanced stages of the disease.

Owing to mutations of the epithelial cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), individuals with cystic fibrosis have defects in intestinal and pancreatic ductal ion transport. This abnormality interferes with bicarbonate, sodium, and water secretion, ultimately resulting in inadequate luminal hydration. The viscous luminal contents may result in meconium ileus, which is present in up to 10% of newborns with cystic fibrosis. In the pancreas the ducts are plugged by thick mucus. This leads to obstruction, low-grade chronic autodigestion of the pancreas, and eventual exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in more than 80% of patients. The result is failure of the intraluminal phase of nutrient absorption, which can be effectively treated in most patients with oral enzyme supplementation."

Although the most common CFTR gene mutation associated with classic cystic fibrosis (CF) is the .F508 mutation, more than 2000 mutations have been identiied (Cystic Fibrosis Mutation Database, 2016). CF may develop from either homozygosiy or compound heterozygosiy for mutations in the CFTR gene. In other words, one mutation must be present in each copy of the gene, but they need not be the same mutation. As expected, this results in a tremendous range of clinical disease severity. Median survival is approximately 37 years, but approximately 15 percent have milder disease and can survive for decades longer. Care for the pregnant woman with CF is discussed in Chapter 51 (p. 998)."

            "content": "Cystic fibrosis (CF, mucoviscidosis) is a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of children and young adults. It is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in a gene called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) located on chromosome 7. The product of this gene the Cl channel protein is involved in final alteration of mucus and digestive secretions, sweat, and tears. All mutations of CFTR gene results in abnormal epithelial transport of Cl that affects the viscosity of the secretion of the exocrine glands. Almost all exocrine glands secrete abnormally viscid mucus that obstructs the glands and their excretory ducts. The course of the disease is largely determined by the the CFTR gene could lead to the use of gene therapy in degree of pulmonary involvement. At birth, the lungs are the near future."

At birth, the lungs are the near future. FIGURE F19.2.1 \u2022 Schematic diagram of pathology in cystic fibrosis. In cystic fibrosis, secretion of Cl anions into the lumen of the bronchial tree is markedly decreased because of a defective or nonexistent chloride channel protein. Na resorption from the lumen of the bronchial tree is then increased, causing movement of water into the cell. As a result, the mucous layer within the bronchial tree becomes dehydrated and viscous. This thick mucus is difficult to move by the mucociliary escalator mechanism, and it clogs the lumen of the bronchial tree, obstructing airflow."

            "content": "B. Cystic fibrosis CF is the most common lethal genetic disease in Caucasians of Northern European ancestry and has a prevalence of ~1:3,300 births in the United States. CF is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by mutations to the gene for the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein that functions as a chloride channel on epithelium in the pancreas, lungs, testes, and sweat glands. Defective CFTR results in decreased secretion of chloride and increased uptake of sodium and water. In the pancreas, the depletion of water on the cell surface results in thickened mucus that clogs the pancreatic ducts, preventing pancreatic enzymes from reaching the intestine, thereby leading to pancreatic insufficiency. Treatment includes replacement of these enzymes and supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins. [Note: CF also causes chronic lung infections with progressive pulmonary disease and male infertility.] C. Emulsification in the small intestine"
