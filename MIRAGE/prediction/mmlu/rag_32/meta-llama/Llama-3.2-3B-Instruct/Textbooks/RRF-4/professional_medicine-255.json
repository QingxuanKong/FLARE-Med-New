    "question": "A previously healthy 24-year-old woman who is a college student comes to the office because of a 6-month history of abdominal bloating, upper abdominal discomfort, and constipation. The symptoms are more severe when she is preparing for examinations but improve after bowel movements. She takes no medications. She does not smoke or use illicit drugs. She drinks alcoholic beverages occasionally. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 100/72 mm Hg. Physical examination, including digital rectal examination, shows no other abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A urease breath test result is negative. Upper and lower endoscopies show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with symptoms of abdominal bloating, upper abdominal discomfort, and constipation, which are more severe when preparing for examinations but improve after bowel movements. These symptoms are characteristic of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). The patient's physical examination, complete blood count, serum electrolyte concentrations, urease breath test, and endoscopy results are all within normal limits, ruling out other potential causes of her symptoms. Given the diagnosis of IBS, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be a medication that targets the symptoms of IBS, such as constipation, without affecting the gut microbiome or causing systemic side effects. Lubiprostone is a chloride channel activator that increases intestinal fluid secretion, which helps to soften stool and promote bowel movements, making it an effective treatment for constipation-predominant IBS. Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant used to treat inflammatory bowel disease, which is not indicated in this case. Infliximab is a biologic medication used to treat inflammatory bowel disease, and mesalamine is an aminosalicylate used to treat inflammatory bowel disease, neither of which is appropriate for IBS treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

In the vast majority of cases (probably >90%), there is no underlying cause (e.g., cancer, depression, or hypothyroidism), and constipation responds to ample hydration, exercise, and supplementation of dietary fiber (15\u201325 g/d). A good diet and medication history and attention to psychosocial issues are key. Physical examination and, particularly, a rectal examination should exclude fecal impaction and most of the important diseases that present with constipation and possibly indicate features suggesting an evacuation disorder (e.g., high anal sphincter tone, failure of perineal descent, or paradoxical puborectalis contraction during straining to"

The diagnosis of IBS is usually based on history and physical examination, and although suggestive, especially in young women, the findings are not specific. A CBC, thyroid function study, stool sample to test for white cells and occult blood, and sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy or barium enema are usually required, particularly in older individuals and in young individuals who have not responded to initial treatment. The results of these studies are all normal in patients with IBS."

Recent travel and exposures should be documented, dietary factors should be investigated, and a list of medications recently used should be obtained. Factors that seem to worsen or improve the diarrhea should be determined. Physical examination should be thorough, evaluating for abdominal distention, tenderness, quality of bowel sounds, presence of blood in the stool or a large fecal mass on rectal examination, and anal sphincter tone."

Which of the eicosanoid agonists have been demonstrated to reduce both morbidity and mortality in patients with such a diagnosis? What are the modes of action? A 40-year-old woman presented to her doctor with a 6-month history of increasing shortness of breath. This was associated with poor appetite and ankle swell-ing. On physical examination, she had elevated jugular venous distention, a soft tricuspid regurgitation murmur, clear lungs, and mild peripheral edema. An echocardio-gram revealed tricuspid regurgitation, severely elevated"

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

Women are diagnosed with IBS two to three times as often as men and make up 80% of the population with severe IBS. As indicated in Table 352-1, pain or abdominal discomfort is a key symptom for the diagnosis of IBS. These symptoms should be improved with defecation and/or have their onset associated with a change in frequency or form of stool. Painless diarrhea or constipation does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria to be classified as IBS. Supportive symptoms that are not part of the diagnostic criteria include defecation straining, urgency or a feeling of incomplete bowel movement, passing mucus, and bloating."

A repeat EEG showed occasional right temporal spikes. What is one possible strategy for controlling her present symptoms? A 23-year-old woman presents to the office for consultation regarding her antiseizure medications. Seven years ago, this otherwise healthy young woman had a tonic-clonic seizure at home.

The American Gastroenterological Association has delineated factors to be considered when determining the aggressiveness of the diagnostic evaluation. These include the duration of symptoms, the change in symptoms over time, the age and sex of the patient, the referral status of the patient, prior diagnostic studies, a family history of colorectal malignancy, and the degree of psychosocial dysfunction. Thus, a younger individual with mild symptoms requires a minimal diagnostic evaluation, while an older person or an individual with rapidly progressive symptoms should undergo a more thorough exclusion of organic disease. Most patients should have a complete blood count and sigmoidoscopic examination; in addition, stool specimens should be examined for ova and parasites in those who have diarrhea. In patients with persistent diarrhea not"
