She finds hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis and suspects Addison\u2019s disease. She performs a standard ACTH 1\u201324 stimulation test, which reveals an insufficient plasma cortisol response compatible with primary adrenal insuf-ficiency. The diagnosis of autoimmune Addison\u2019s disease is made, and the patient must start replacement of the hormones he cannot produce himself. How should this patient be treated? What precautions should he take?"

It accounts for 1\u20132% of all small lymphocytic leukemias. Most patients present with elevated WBC count (often >100,000/\u03bcL), hepatosplenomegaly, and adenopathy. Skin involvement occurs in 20%. The diagnosis is made from peripheral blood smear, which shows cells about 25% larger than those in small lymphocytes, with cytoplasmic blebs and nuclei that may be indented. The cells express T-cell markers like CD2, CD3, and CD7; two-thirds of patients have cells that are CD4+ and CD8\u2013, and 25% have cells that are CD4+ and CD8+. T-cell receptor \u03b2 chains are clonally rearranged. In 80% of patients, inversion of chromosome 14 occurs between q11 and q32. Ten percent have t(14;14) translocations that bring the T-cell receptor alpha/beta gene locus into juxtaposition with oncogenes TCL1 and TCL1b at 14q32.1."

            "content": "AML primarily affects older adults; the median age is 50 years. It is very heterogeneous, as discussed later. The clinical signs and symptoms closely resemble those produced by ALL and usually are related to the replacement of normal marrow elements by leukemic blasts. Fatigue, pallor, abnormal bleeding, and infections are common in newly diagnosed patients, who typically present within a few weeks of the onset of symptoms. Splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy generally are less prominent than in ALL, but on rare occasions AML mimics a lymphoma by manifesting as a discrete tissue mass (a so-called \u201cgranulocytic sarcoma\u201d). The diagnosis and classification of AML are based on morphologic, histochemical, immunophenotypic, and karyotypic findings. Of these, the karyotype is most predictive of outcome."

Presentation can be as either leukemia or lymphoma. The major clinical characteristics of B-cell CLL/ small lymphocytic lymphoma are presented in Table 134-10. The diagnosis of typical B-cell CLL is made when an increased number of circulating lymphocytes (i.e., >4 \u00d7 109/L and usually Malignancies of Lymphoid Cells Abbreviation: MALT, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue."
