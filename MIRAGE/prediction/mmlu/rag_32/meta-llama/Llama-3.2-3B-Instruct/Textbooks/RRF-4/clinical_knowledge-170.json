    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's first understand the characteristics of bronchial breathing. Bronchial breathing refers to a type of breathing pattern that is typically seen in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other restrictive lung diseases. In these conditions, the lungs are stiff and have reduced elastic recoil, making it difficult to fully deflate the lungs during exhalation. As a result, the expiratory phase of breathing is prolonged, and the inspiratory phase is shallow. Additionally, the expiratory component of breathing is louder and longer due to the increased effort required to exhale. Furthermore, there is often a gap between the end of expiration and the start of inspiration, as the individual may take a few extra breaths to fully refill their lungs. Based on this understanding, let's evaluate the options: A. Inspiratory component louder and longer with a gap between expiration and inspiration: This option correctly describes the characteristics of bronchial breathing. B. Expiratory component louder and longer with a gap between inspiration and expiration: This option is incorrect as the gap is typically between expiration and inspiration, not between inspiration and expiration. C. Inspiratory component louder and longer with a gap between inspiration and expiration: This option is incorrect as the inspiratory component is typically shallow, not louder and longer. D. Expiratory component louder and longer with a gap between expiration and inspiration: This option is partially correct, but it does not mention the shallow inspiratory phase, which is a key characteristic of bronchial breathing. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

In the presence of diseases such as cystic fibrosis, the bronchial arteries, which normally receive only 1% to 2% of cardiac output, increase in size (hypertrophy) and receive as much as 10% to 20% of the cardiac output. The erosion of inflamed tissue into these vessels as a result of bacterial infection is responsible for the hemoptysis (coughing up blood) that can occur in this disease. Breathing is automatic and under control of the central nervous system (CNS). The lungs are innervated by the autonomic nervous system of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which is under CNS control ( Fig. 20.8). The autonomic nervous system has four distinct components: parasympathetic, sympathetic, nonadrenergic noncholinergic inhibitory, and nonadrenergic noncholinergic stimulatory."

Patients with acute bronchoconstriction also report a sense of tightness, which can exist even when lung function is still within the normal range. These patients are commonly tachypneic; this condition leads to hyperinflation and reduced respiratory system compliance and also limits tidal volume.

An important anatomic feature of the pulmonary airways is its treelike branching structure. While the individual airways in each successive generation, from most proximal (trachea) to most distal (respiratory bronchioles), are smaller than those of the parent generation, their number increases exponentially such that the summed cross-sectional area of the airways becomes very large toward the lung periphery. Because flow (volume/time) is constant along the airway tree, the velocity of airflow (flow/summed cross-sectional area) is much greater in the central airways than in the peripheral airways.

Furthermore, severe airflow obstruction can functionally reduce the compliance of the respiratory system by leading to dynamic hyperinflation. In this scenario, expiratory flows slowed by the obstructive airways disease may be insufficient to allow complete exhalation during the expiratory phase of tidal breathing; as a result, the \u201cfunctional residual capacity\u201d from which the next breath is inhaled is greater than the static FRC. With repetition of incomplete exhalations of each tidal breath, the operating FRC becomes dynamically elevated, sometimes to a level that approaches TLC.

Any air present gradually becomes absorbed, and alveolar collapse follows. The most common cause of resorption collapse is obstruction of a bronchus. Resorption atelectasis most frequently occurs postoperatively due to intrabronchial mucous or mucopurulent plugs, but also may result from foreign body aspiration (particularly in children), bronchial asthma, bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, or intrabronchial tumor, in which it may be the first sign of malignancy."

            "content": "An attack of asthma is characterized by severe dyspnea and wheezing due to bronchoconstriction and mucus plugging, which leads to trapping of air in distal airspaces and progressive hyperinflation of the lungs. In the usual case, attacks last from 1 to several hours and subside either spontaneously or with therapy. Intervals between attacks are characteristically free from overt respiratory difficulties, but persistent, subtle deficits can be detected by pulmonary function tests. Occasionally a severe paroxysm occurs that does not respond to therapy and persists for days and even weeks (status asthmaticus). The associated hypercapnia, acidosis, and severe hypoxia may be fatal, although in most cases the condition is more disabling than lethal. Standard therapies include anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly glucocorticoids, and bronchodilators such as beta-adrenergic drugs and leukotriene inhibitors (recall that leukotrienes are potent bronchoconstrictors).

Upon completion of this chapter, the student should be able to answer the following questions: 1. Describe the components of the mucociliary clearance system and their role in the removal of xenobiotic substances and particulates. 2. Explain how particle characteristics and properties influence their deposition and clearance. 3. Compare and contrast the major mechanisms of particle deposition. 4. Compare and contrast the mucosal and systemic immune responses. 5."

            "content": "4. The equal pressure point is the point at which the pressure inside and surrounding the airway is the same. The location of the equal pressure point is dynamic. Specifically, as lung volume and elastic recoil decrease, the equal pressure point moves toward the alveolus in normal individuals. In individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the equal pressure point at any lung volume is closer to the alveolus. Expiratory flow limitation occurs at the equal pressure point. 5. Energy is expended during breathing to overcome the inherent mechanical properties of the lung. Respiratory muscle fatigue is the most common cause of respiratory failure. Individuals breathe at a respiratory rate to minimize work. For individuals with increased airway resistance, work is minimized by breathing at lower frequencies. For individuals with restrictive lung diseases, work is minimized by shallow breathing at high frequencies. 6."
