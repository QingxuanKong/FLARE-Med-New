    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the cohesion-tension theory for the ascent of water in the xylem step by step.\\n\\nFirst, we need to understand the main components of the theory. The cohesion-tension theory proposes that water is transported in the xylem through a combination of two forces: cohesion and tension.\\n\\nCohesion refers to the attractive forces between water molecules, which allows them to stick together and form a continuous column.\\n\\nTension, on the other hand, refers to the force that pulls water upwards through the xylem, driven by the evaporation of water from the leaves and the resulting negative pressure.\\n\\nNow, let's examine each option in light of this understanding:\\n\\nA. The evaporation of water from leaf mesophyll cells generates tension in the water column.\\nThis statement is correct, as the evaporation of water from the leaf's surface creates a negative pressure that pulls water upwards through the xylem.\\n\\nB. Water moves from a source region with high hydrostatic pressure to a sink region with low hydrostatic pressure.\\nThis statement is also correct, as the cohesion-tension theory proposes that water moves from an area of high hydrostatic pressure (the source, such as the roots) to an area of low hydrostatic pressure (the sink, such as the leaves).\\n\\nC. The cohesion of water molecules is responsible for the formation of embolisms (air bubbles) in the water column.\\nThis statement is incorrect, as embolisms are actually caused by the formation of air bubbles in the xylem, which can block the flow of water.\\n\\nD. Living cells of the xylem provide the main conduit for the ascent of water.\\nThis statement is incorrect, as the xylem is a dead tissue that provides a conduit for water, but it is not the living cells themselves that drive the ascent of water.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is B, as it accurately describes the movement of water in the xylem through the combination of cohesion and tension.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Although the fluid in the plant cell wall contains more solutes than does the water in the plant\u2019s external milieu (for example, soil), it is still hypotonic in comparison with the cell interior. This osmotic imbalance causes the cell to develop a large internal hydrostatic pressure, or turgor pressure, which pushes outward on the cell wall, just as an inner tube pushes outward on a tire. The turgor pressure increases just to the point where the cell is in osmotic equilibrium, with no net influx of water despite the salt imbalance. The turgor pressure generated in this way may reach 10 or more atmospheres, about five times that in the average car tire.

The letters A through D designate certain regions on the curve below. A. Point A represents the region where the amino acid is deprotonated. B. Point B represents a region of minimal buffering. C. Point C represents the region where the net charge on the amino acid is zero. D. Point D represents the pK of the amino acid\u2019s carboxyl group. E. The amino acid could be lysine. Correct answer = C. Point C represents the isoelectric point, or pI, and as such is midway between pK1 and pK2 for a nonpolar amino acid. The amino acid is fully protonated at Point A. Point B represents a region of maximum buffering, as does Point D. Lysine is a basic amino acid, and free lysine has an ionizable side chain in addition to the ionizable \u03b1-amino and \u03b1-carboxyl groups."

B. Carbon dioxide increases the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin by binding to the C-terminal groups of the polypeptide chains. C. The oxygen affinity of hemoglobin increases as the percentage saturation increases. D. The hemoglobin tetramer binds four molecules of 2,3bisphosphoglycerate. E. Oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin have the same affinity for protons."

It is a ketose and usually exists as a furanose ring in solution. C. It is produced from dietary starch by the action of \u03b1-amylase. D. It is utilized in biological systems only in the L-isomeric form. Correct answer = A. Because glucose and galactose differ only in configuration around carbon 4, they are C-4 epimers that are interconvertible by the action of an epimerase. Glucose is an aldose sugar that typically exists as a pyranose ring in solution. Fructose, however, is a ketose with a furanose ring. \u03b1-Amylase does not produce monosaccharides. The D-isomeric form of carbohydrates is the form typically found in biologic systems, in contrast to amino acids that typically are found in the L-isomeric form."
