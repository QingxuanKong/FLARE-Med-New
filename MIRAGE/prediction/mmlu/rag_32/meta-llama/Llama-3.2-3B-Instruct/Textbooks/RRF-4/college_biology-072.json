Both phyla have a similar body structure and are segmented, but there are other characteristics that distinguish them. The question asks what they have in common, so we should look for similarities. The key to answering this question is to identify the common features of annelids and arthropods. One of the key features that annelids and arthropods share is that they both have a segmented body structure. This is a key characteristic of both phyla. Segmentation is a feature that is found in many animals, but it is particularly well-developed in annelids and arthropods. The segmented body structure in these phyla is thought to have evolved independently in each group, but it has many similarities. Therefore, the correct answer is A. have segmented bodies.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Remarkably, however, research in the past 30 years has revealed that much of the basic machinery of development is essentially the same in all animals\u2014not just in all vertebrates, but in all the major phyla of invertebrates too. Recognizably similar, evolutionarily related molecules define the specialized animal cell types, mark the differences between body regions, and help create the animal body pattern. Homologous proteins are often functionally interchangeable between very different species. Thus, a human protein produced artificially in a fly, for example, can perform the same function as the fly\u2019s own version of that protein (Figure 21\u20132). Thanks to an underlying unity of mechanisms, developmental biologists have been making great strides toward"

For more than a century, planarians such as Schmidtea have intrigued biologists because of their extraordinary capacity for regeneration: a small tissue fragment taken from almost any part of the body will reorganize itself and grow to form a complete new animal. This property goes with another: when the animal is starved, it gets smaller and smaller, by reducing its cell numbers while maintaining essentially normal body proportions.

These diverse cell types are organized into tissues and organs, forming a sheet of skin covering the exterior, a mouth for feeding, and an internal gut tube to digest food\u2014with muscles, nerves, and other tissues arranged in the space between the skin and the gut tube. Many animals have clearly defined axes\u2014an anteroposterior axis, with mouth and brain anterior and anus posterior; a dorsoventral axis, with back dorsal and belly ventral; and a left-right axis.

The same is true if we compare different species of nematode worms or insects. But, when we compare vertebrate regulatory regions with those of worms or flies, it is hard to see any such resemblance. The protein-coding sequences are unmistakably similar, but the corresponding regulatory DNA sequences appear mostly very different, suggesting that the differences in body plans mainly reflect differences in regulatory DNA. Although variations in the proteins themselves also contribute, differences in regulatory DNA would be enough to generate radically different tissues and body structures even if the proteins were the same."

Unlike vertebrates, insects have no system of capillary vessels to contain the blood as it percolates through the tissues. Nevertheless, heart development depends on homologous genes in vertebrates and insects, reinforcing the relationship between the two body plans. (after e.L. Ferguson, Curr. Opin. Genet.

In the Drosophila sublineage, this single complex became split into separate Antennapedia and Bithorax complexes.

Hox genes are found in almost every animal species studied, where they are often grouped in complexes similar to the insect Hox complex. In mice and humans, for example, there are four such complexes\u2014called the HoxA, HoxB, HoxC, and HoxD complexes\u2014each on a different chromosome. Individual genes in each complex can be recognized by their sequences as counterparts of specific members of the Drosophila set. Indeed, mammalian Hox genes can function in Drosophila as partial replacements for the corresponding Drosophila Hox genes. It appears that each of the four mammalian Hox complexes is, roughly speaking, the equivalent of one complete insect Hox complex (that is, an Antennapedia complex plus a Bithorax complex) (Figure 21\u201332)."

Evolutionarily, the ficolins may predate the collectins, which are also first seen in the urochordates. Homologs of MBL and of the classical pathway complement component C1q, both collectins, have been identified in the genome of the ascidian urochordate Ciona (sea squirt). Two invertebrate homologs of mammalian MASPs also have been identified in Ciona, and it seems likely that they may be able to cleave and activate C3. Thus, the minimal complement system of the echinoderms appears to have been expanded in the urochordates by the recruitment of a specific activation system that may target C3 deposition onto microbial surfaces. This also suggests that when"

Until very recently, it was thought that invertebrate immunity was limited to an innate system that had a very restricted diversity in recognizing pathogens. This idea was based on the knowledge that innate immunity in vertebrates relied on around 10 distinct Toll-like receptors and a similar number of other receptors that also recognize PAMPs, and also on the assumption that the number of receptors in invertebrates was no greater. Recent studies have, however, uncovered at least two invertebrate examples of extensive diversification of an immunoglobulin superfamily member, which could potentially provide an extended range of recognition of pathogens."

            "content": "The ordering of the genes within each vertebrate Hox complex is essentially the same as in the insect Hox complex, suggesting that all four vertebrate complexes originated by duplications of a single primordial complex and have preserved its basic organization. Most tellingly, when the expression patterns of the Hox genes are examined in the vertebrate embryo, it turns out that the members of each complex are expressed in a head-to-tail series along the axis of the body, just as they are in Drosophila. As in Drosophila, vertebrate Hox gene expression patterns are often aligned with vertebrate segments. This alignment is especially clear in the hindbrain (see Figure 21\u201332), where the segments are called rhombomeres."
