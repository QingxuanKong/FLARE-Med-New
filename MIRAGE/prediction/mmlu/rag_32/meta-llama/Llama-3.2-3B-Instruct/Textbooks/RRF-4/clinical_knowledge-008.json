Three codons do not specify any amino acid but act as termination sites (stop codons), signaling the end of the protein-coding sequence.

This redundancy implies either that there is more than one tRNA for many of the amino acids or that some tRNA molecules can base-pair with more than one codon. In fact, both situations occur. Some amino acids have more than one tRNA and some tRNAs are constructed so that they require accurate base-pairing only at the first two positions of the codon and can tolerate a mismatch (or wobble) at the third position (Figure 6\u201351). This wobble base-pairing explains why so many of the alternative codons for an amino acid differ only in their third nucleotide (see Figure 6\u201348).

The base at the 5\u2032-end of the anticodon (the first base of the anticodon) is not as spatially defined as the other two bases. Movement of that first base allows nontraditional base-pairing with the 3\u2032-base of the codon (the last base of the codon). This movement is called wobble and allows a single tRNA to recognize more than one codon. Examples of these flexible pairings are shown in Figure 32.9.

If the nucleotide listed in the first column is present at the third, or wobble, position of the codon, it can base-pair with any of the nucleotides listed in the second column. Thus, for example, when inosine (I) is present in the wobble position of the tRNA anticodon, the tRNA can recognize any one of three different codons in bacteria and either of two codons in eukaryotes. The inosine in tRNAs is formed from the deamination of adenosine (see Figure 6\u201353), a chemical modification that takes place after the tRNA has been synthesized. The nonstandard base pairs, including those made with inosine, are generally weaker than conventional base pairs. Codon\u2013anticodon base-pairing is more stringent at positions 1 and 2 of the codon, where only conventional base pairs are permitted.

The precise transfer of information from mRNA to protein is governed by genetic code, the set of rules by which codons are translated into an amino acid (Table 15-2). A codon, a triplet of three bases, codes for one amino acid. In this case, random combinations of the four bases form 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4, or 64 codes. Because 64 codes are more than enough for 20 amino acids, most amino acids are coded by more than one codon.

Characteristics of the genetic code include the following. 1. Specificity: The genetic code is specific (unambiguous), because a particular codon always codes for the same amino acid. 2. Universality: The genetic code is virtually universal insofar as its specificity has been conserved from very early stages of evolution, with only slight differences in the manner in which the code is translated.

They join together on an mRNA molecule, usually near its 5\u02b9 end, to initiate the synthesis of a protein. The mRNA is then pulled through the ribosome, three nucleotides at a time. As its codons enter the core of the ribosome, the mRNA nucleotide sequence is translated into an amino acid sequence using the tRNAs as adaptors to add each amino acid in the correct sequence to the growing end of the polypeptide chain. When a stop codon is encountered, the ribosome releases the finished protein, and its two subunits separate again. These subunits can then be used to start the synthesis of another protein on another mRNA molecule. Ribosomes operate with remarkable efficiency: in one second, a eukaryotic ribosome adds 2 amino acids to a polypeptide chain; the ribosomes of bacterial cells operate even faster, at a rate of about 20 amino acids per second."

Prokaryotic mRNA often have several coding regions (that is, they are polycistronic; see p. 434). Each coding region has its own initiation and termination codon and produces a separate species of polypeptide. In contrast, each eukaryotic mRNA has only one coding region (that is, it is monocistronic). The process of translation is divided into three separate steps: initiation, elongation, and termination.

            "content": "A second principle used to increase the specificity of complementary base-pairing is called kinetic proofreading. We have seen that after the initial codon\u2012anticodon pairing and conformational change of the ribosome, GTP is hydrolyzed. This creates an irreversible step and starts the clock on a time delay during which the aminoacyl-tRNA moves into the proper position for catalysis. During this delay, those incorrect codon\u2013anticodon pairs that have somehow slipped through the induced-fit scrutiny have a higher likelihood of dissociating than correct pairs. There are two reasons for this: (1) the interaction of the wrong tRNA with the codon is weaker, and (2) the delay is longer for incorrect than correct matches."

Together, they cover three neighboring codons. During translation, the A site binds an incoming aminoacyl-tRNA as directed by the codon currently occupying this site. This codon specifies the next amino acid to be added to the growing peptide chain. The P site is occupied by peptidyl-tRNA. This tRNA carries the chain of amino acids that has already been synthesized. The E site is occupied by the empty tRNA as it is about to exit the ribosome. (See Fig. 32.13 for an illustration of the role of the A, P, and E sites in translation.) 4."

Most of these animal mitochondrial DNas encode precisely the same genes as humans, with the gene order being identical for animals ranging from fish to mammals. allows one tRNA to pair with any one of four codons and permits protein synthesis with fewer tRNA molecules. 3. Variant genetic code. Perhaps most surprising, comparisons of mitochondrial gene sequences and the amino acid sequences of the corresponding proteins indicate that the genetic code is different: 4 of the 64 codons have different \u201cmeanings\u201d from those of the same codons in other genomes (Table 14\u20133)."
