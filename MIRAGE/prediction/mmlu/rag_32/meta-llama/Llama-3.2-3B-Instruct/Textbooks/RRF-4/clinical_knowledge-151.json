A tracheostomy tube is inserted into the trachea through a surgical incision in the neck, and the cuff is inflated to prevent leakage of air and saliva or gastric contents into the esophagus. The cuff is placed around the trachea, above the vocal cords, and below the level of the stoma. The primary purpose of the cuff is to create an air seal within the trachea and prevent leakage, which reduces the risk of aspiration. This is a critical function, especially in patients who are at risk of aspiration, such as those with neurological disorders or those who are mechanically ventilated. The other options are not accurate descriptions of the primary function of the cuff on a tracheostomy tube. Swallowing and talking are not directly related to the function of the cuff, and reducing local oedema is not a primary purpose of the cuff.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Tracheomalacia improves with airway growth as the lumen increases in diameter and the tracheal wall becomes more firm. The treatment of older symptomatic children is geared toward treating any precipitating cause for cough and providing supportive care. Antibiotics may be necessary to treat concurrent infection. Children, especially infants, with severe tracheomalacia may require tracheostomy tubes to administer continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), which serves to stent open the airway. Custom-length tracheostomy tubes have been used to stent open the airway when CPAP fails. Surgically placed airway stents are problematic in children because the stents cannot grow and thus serve as a source of fixed stenosis and obstruction. SEE CHAPTER 128."

            "content": "The presence of oropharyngeal weakness as a result of the underlying neuromuscular disease may leave the patient\u2019s airway unprotected and require endotracheal intubation before mechanical ventilation becomes necessary. It is even difficult to decide when to remove an endotracheal tube in a patient with oropharyngeal weakness. Because the safety of the swallowing mechanism cannot be assessed with the tube in place, one must be prepared to reintubate the patient or to have a surgeon prepared to perform a tracheostomy after extubation, in the event that aspiration occurs."

            "content": "Endotracheal tubes can damage the larynx and the airways if the tubes are of improper size and are not carefully maintained. The cricoid ring is the narrowest segment of a child\u2019s airway and is completely surrounded by cartilage, which makes it vulnerable to damage, and may lead to subglottic stenosis. If the pressure created by the tube against the airway mucosa exceeds capillary filling pressure (roughly 35 cm H2O), mucosal ischemia develops, leading to necrosis. Therefore, a small air leak should be maintained around the endotracheal tube to minimize the risk of mucosal damage."

The airway may be stabilized before incision of the membrane using a tracheostomy hook; the hook should be placed under the thyroid cartilage to elevate the airway. A 6.0 endotracheal tube (maximum diameter in adults) is then advanced through the cricothyroid opening and sutured into place. In patients under the age of 11, cricothyroidotomy is rela-tively contraindicated due to the risk of subglottic stenosis, and tracheostomy should be performed.Emergent tracheostomy is indicated in patients with laryn-gotracheal separation or laryngeal fractures, in whom cricothy-roidotomy may cause further damage or result in complete loss of the airway. This procedure is best performed in the operating room (OR) where there is optimal lighting and availability of advanced equipment (e.g., sternal saw). In these cases, often after a \u201cclothesline\u201d injury, direct visualization and instrumenta-tion of the trachea usually"

            "content": "Artificial airways must be kept clear of secretions asobstruction with mucous plugs can be fatal. Providing adequate humidification of inspired air and appropriate suctioning of the tube reduce the probability of occlusion by secretions. In addition to endotracheal tubes, the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) can be used to provide mechanical ventilation. This device consists of a tube with a soft mask at the distal end that is placed over the larynx, creating a seal without the trachea being instrumented. Although less invasive,the LMA is less secure, so it is generally limited to proceduralanesthesia."

Mild subglottic stenosis can be managed conservatively and may improve sufficiently with airway growth alone. More severe cases require surgical intervention. Depending on the nature of the lesion, endoscopic laser treatment may be effective. Other surgical options include tracheoplasty and cricoid split procedures. A tracheostomy tube may be required to bypass the subglottic space until the airway is patent enough to allow adequate airflow."
