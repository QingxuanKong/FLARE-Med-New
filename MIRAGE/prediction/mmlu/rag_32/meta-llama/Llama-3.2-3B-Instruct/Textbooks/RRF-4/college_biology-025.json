Succession refers to the process of change in the species composition of a biological community over time. There are two main types of succession: primary and secondary. Primary succession occurs in areas where no soil or vegetation existed before, such as after a volcanic eruption or the glacial retreat. Secondary succession occurs in areas where the soil and vegetation were previously present but were disturbed or destroyed, such as after a forest fire or the clearing of a forest. Pioneer species are the first organisms to colonize a bare substrate, and their presence marks the beginning of the succession process. The correct answer should be related to the process of colonization of a bare substrate by pioneer species.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

After the last ice age ended about 10,000 years ago, marine sticklebacks colonized many newly formed freshwater streams and lakes. Marine sticklebacks extend sharp spines from their pelvic skeleton. These spines are thought to help protect the fish from soft-mouthed fish predators. In contrast, several populations of freshwater sticklebacks have lost these spines, usually in lakes that lack such predators. The different morphologies reflect differences in control of the expression of a transcription regulator called Pitx1. Whereas marine sticklebacks express the Pitx1 gene in the pelvic bone precursor cells that will form the spikes,"

In the simplest case, if we denote the enzyme by E, the substrate by S, and the product by P, the basic reaction path is E + S \u2192 ES \u2192EP \u2192 E + P. There is a limit to the amount of substrate that a single enzyme molecule can process in a given time. Although an increase in the concentration of substrate increases the rate at which product is formed, this rate eventually reaches a maximum value (Figure 3\u201346). At that point the enzyme molecule is saturated with substrate, and the rate of reaction (Vmax) depends only on how rapidly the enzyme can process the substrate molecule. This maximum rate divided by the enzyme concentration is called the turnover number. Turnover numbers are often about 1000 substrate molecules processed per second per enzyme molecule, although turnover numbers between 1 and 10,000 are known."

The whole control system governing the switch to flowering is thus of vital importance for agriculture, especially in an era of rapid climate change. The example of vernalization suggests a general point about the role of chromatin modification in developmental timing. The plant uses changes in chromatin to record its experience of prolonged cold. It may be that in other organisms\u2014animals as well as plants\u2014slow, progressive changes in chromatin structure provide long-term timers for those mysterious developmental processes that unfold slowly, over a period of days, weeks, months, or years. Such chromatin timers may be among the most important clocks in the embryo, but as yet we understand very little about them."

Before we can discuss these differences and understand their relevance to human disease, it is important to understand some basic terms and ecologic principles."

            "content": "Paralytic shellfish poisoning is induced by ingestion of any of a variety of feral or aquacultured filter-feeding organisms, including clams, oysters, scallops, mussels, chitons, limpets, starfish, and sand crabs. The origin of their toxicity is the chemical toxin they accumulate and concentrate by feeding on various planktonic dinoflagellates (e.g., Protogonyaulax, Ptychodiscus, and Gymnodinium) and protozoan organisms. The unicellular phytoplanktonic organisms form the foundation of the food chain, and in warm summer months these organisms \u201cbloom\u201d in nutrient-rich coastal temperate and semitropical waters. In the United States, paralytic shellfish poisoning is acquired primarily from seafood harvested in the Northeast, the Pacific Northwest, and Alaska. These planktonic species can release massive amounts of toxic metabolites into the water and cause mortality in bird and marine populations. The paralytic shellfish toxins are water soluble as well as heat and acid stable; they"
