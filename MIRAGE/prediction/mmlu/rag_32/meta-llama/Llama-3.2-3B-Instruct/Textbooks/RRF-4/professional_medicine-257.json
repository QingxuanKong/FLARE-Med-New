He also has had a 10.4-kg (23-lb) weight loss over the past 4 months despite no change in appetite. He has smoked one and a half packs of cigarettes daily for 50 years. He drinks 4 oz of alcohol daily. He has peptic ulcer disease and emphysema. Medications include cimetidine, theophylline, and low-dose prednisone. Examination shows mild ptosis. He has a barrelshaped chest. Breath sounds are distant. There is moderate weakness of proximal muscles of the lower extremities. Reflexes are absent. He has difficulty rising from a chair. Sensory examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray shows a hyperinflated chest and a 3 x 4-cm mass in the right hilum. His neurologic findings are most likely due to a lesion involving which of the following?",

    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the patient's symptoms and examination findings. The patient presents with leg weakness, dry eyes and mouth, weight loss, mild ptosis, barrel-shaped chest, distant breath sounds, moderate weakness of proximal muscles of the lower extremities, absent reflexes, and difficulty rising from a chair. The x-ray shows a hyperinflated chest and a 3 x 4-cm mass in the right hilum. These findings suggest a possible thoracic lesion affecting the nerves or muscles. The patient's symptoms of dry eyes and mouth, mild ptosis, and absent reflexes suggest a cranial nerve involvement. The hyperinflated chest and mass in the right hilum suggest a possible thoracic tumor. Considering these findings, the most likely location of the lesion is the peripheral nerve or the nerve roots, as it can cause cranial nerve involvement and thoracic muscle weakness. The peripheral nerve or nerve root lesion can be caused by a thoracic tumor, such as a neurogenic tumor or a tumor that compresses the nerve roots. The most common type of thoracic tumor that can cause this presentation is a neurogenic tumor, such as a neurofibroma or a schwannoma. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings are more suggestive of a peripheral nerve or nerve root lesion, such as a Pancoast tumor, which is a type of lung cancer that can cause nerve root compression and cranial nerve involvement. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. Peripheral nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

The major clinical manifestation is weakness that evolves more or less symmetrically over a period of several days to a week or two, or somewhat longer. The proximal as well as distal muscles of the limbs are involved, usually the lower extremities before the upper (thus the older term Landry ascending paralysis); the trunk, intercostal, neck, and cranial muscles may be affected later. Weakness progresses in approximately 5 percent of patients to total motor paralysis with respiratory failure within a few days.

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."

His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor.

These complaints are new since she used to always feel \u201chot,\u201d noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to \u201cprotect her bones\u201d and omeprazole for \u201cheartburn.\u201d On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm. Her weight is 136 lb (61.8 kg), an increase of 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the last year. Her thyroid gland is not palpable and her reflexes are delayed.

A 33-year-old man was playing cricket for his local Sunday team. As the new bowler pitched the ball short, it bounced higher than he anticipated and hit him on the side of his head. He immediately fell to the ground unconscious, but after about 30 seconds he was helped to his feet and felt otherwise well. It was noted he had some bruising around his temple. He decided not to continue playing and went to watch the match from the side. Over the next hour he became extremely sleepy and was eventually unrousable. He was rushed to hospital. When he was admitted to hospital, the patient\u2019s breathing was shallow and irregular and it was necessary to intubate him. A skull radiograph demonstrated a fracture in the region of the pterion. No other abnormality was demonstrated other than minor soft tissue bruising over the left temporal fossa. A CT scan was performed."

Review of the past history and growth chart demonstrates normal birth weight and birth length, but a progressive decrease in height per-centiles relative to age-matched normal ranges starting at 6 months of age, and orthostasis with febrile illnesses. Physical examination demonstrates short stature and mild generalized obesity. Genital examination reveals descended but small testes and a phallic length of \u20132 SD. Laboratory evaluations demonstrate growth hormone (GH) deficiency and a delayed bone age of 18 months. The patient is started on replacement with recombinant human GH at a dose of 40 mcg/kg per day subcutaneously. After 1 year of treatment, his height velocity has increased from 5 cm/y to 11 cm/y.

            "content": "A 45-year-old man came to his physician complaining of pain and weakness in his right shoulder. The pain began after a fall on his outstretched hand approximately 6 months previously. The patient recalled having some minor shoulder tenderness but no other specific symptoms. He was otherwise fit and well. On examination of the shoulder, there was marked wasting of the muscles in the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae. The patient found initiation of abduction difficult and there was a weakness of lateral rotation of the humerus. The wasted muscles were the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The cause of the muscle wasting was disuse. Muscle atrophy (wasting) occurs through a variety of disorders. Disuse atrophy is one of the most common causes. Examples of disuse atrophy include the loss of muscle bulk after fracture immobilization in a plaster cast. The opposite effect can also be demonstrated\u2014when muscles are overused they become bulkier (hypertrophy)."
