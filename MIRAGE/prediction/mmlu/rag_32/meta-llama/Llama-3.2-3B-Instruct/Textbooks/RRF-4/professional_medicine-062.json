    "question": "A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. He was delivered at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. His birth weight was 3500 g (7 lb 11 oz), and Apgar scores were 8 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. At the age of 15 months, physical examination showed no abnormalities, but he was not yet talking. Both of his parents had learning difficulties in school, and his mother stopped attending after the 10th grade. He has a maternal uncle with cognitive disabilities. He is at the 25th percentile for height, 15th percentile for weight, and 90th percentile for head circumference. He appears irritable, he resists making eye contact, and he is flapping his hands. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",

        "A": "Frameshift mutation",
        "B": "Missense mutation",
        "C": "Nonsense mutation",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's analyze the symptoms and growth patterns presented in the case study and correlate them with the potential genetic causes listed in the options. The child is 2 years old, has a head circumference at the 90th percentile, and is not yet talking at 15 months, which suggests a potential issue with language development. He also has a family history of learning difficulties and a maternal uncle with cognitive disabilities. The child's physical examination reveals irritability, resistance to eye contact, and hand flapping, which are common symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Considering the child's growth pattern, particularly the large head circumference, it is essential to evaluate the possibility of a genetic disorder that affects growth and development. The options provided include frameshift mutation, missense mutation, nonsense mutation, and trinucleotide repeat expansion. Frameshift mutations typically result in the deletion or insertion of nucleotides that changes the reading frame of the genetic code, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence. Missense mutations involve a single nucleotide change that results in a different amino acid being incorporated into the protein, which may or may not cause a significant phenotype. Nonsense mutations involve a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. Trinucleotide repeat expansions are associated with several genetic disorders, including Fragile X syndrome, which is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability. Fragile X syndrome is caused by an expansion of the CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene, leading to a lack of functional FMRP protein, which is essential for normal brain development and function. The symptoms described in the case study, including large head circumference, delayed language development, and ASD-like behaviors, are consistent with Fragile X syndrome. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a trinucleotide repeat expansion, specifically an expansion of the CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}}",

Allowances must be made for prematurity; weight corrections are needed until 24 months of age, height corrections until 40 months of age, and head circumference corrections until 18 months of age. Although some growth variants can be difficult to distinguish from FTT, growth velocity and height-for-weight determinations can be useful in distinguishing the cause. In children with FTT, malnutrition initially results in wasting (deficiency in weight gain). Stunting (deficiency in linear growth) generally occurs after months of malnutrition, and head circumference is spared except with chronic, severe malnutrition. FTT that is symmetric (proportional weight, height/length, and head circumference) suggests long-standing malnutrition, chromosomal abnormalities, congenital infection, or teratogenic"

Slow habituation of orienting reactions to novel auditory and visual stimuli and the presence of \u201cfine motor deficits\u201d (as previously discussed under \u201cDelays in Motor Development\u201d) are other early warnings of developmental delay."

He is then switched to celecoxib, 200 mg twice daily, and on this regimen his joint symptoms and heartburn resolve. Two years later, he returns with increased joint symptoms. His hands, wrists, elbows, feet, and knees are all now involved and appear swollen, warm, and tender. What therapeutic options should be considered at this time? What are the possible complications? A 48-year-old man presents with complaints of bilateral morning stiffness in his wrists and knees and pain in these joints on exercise. On physical examination, the joints are slightly swollen. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. His laboratory findings are also negative except for slight anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedi-mentation rate, and positive rheumatoid factor. With the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, he is started on a regimen"

            "content": "Sonographic estimates of fetal weight and actual weight may be discordant by 20 percent or more, leading to both false-positive and false-negative indings. Dashe and associates (2000) studied 8400 live births at Parkland Hospital in which fetal sonographic evaluation had been performed within 4 weeks of delivery. They reported that 30 percent of growth-restricted fetuses were not detected. In a study of 2586 women with low-risk pregnancies randomly assigned to sonography at 32 or 36 weeks' gestation, sensitivity to identiy grow restriction was improved at the later gestational age (Roma, 2015). Still, nearly 40 percent of cases of growth restriction deined as birthweight <3rd percentile were missed. A Cochrane database analysis of 13 trials with 34,980 women concluded that routine late pregnancy ultrasound for a low-risk or an unselected population is not associated with maternal or fetal benefit (Bricker, 2015)."

            "content": "The term macrosomia is used rather imprecisely to describe a very large fetus or newborn. Although there is general agreement among obstetricians that neonates weighing < 4000 g are not excessively large, a similar consensus has not been reached for the definition of macrosomia. Newborn weight rarely exceeds 11 pounds (5000 g), and excessively large infants are a curiosity. The largest newborn cited in the Guinness Book of World Records was a 23-lb 12-oz (10,800 g) infant boy born in 1879 to a Canadian woman (Barnes, 1957). In the United States in 2015, of more than 4 million births, 6.9 percent weighed 4000 to 4499 g; 1 percent weighed 4500 to 4999 g; and 0.1 percent were born weighing 5000 g or more 4500-4649 3221 (Martin, 2017) .

Centers of ossiication have appeared in most fetal bones, and the fingers and toes have become diferentiated. Skin and nails develop, and scattered rudiments of hair appear. he external genitalia are beginning to show deinitive signs of male or female gender. he fetus begins to make spontaneous movements. Fetal growth slows at this time. The crown-rump length is 12 cm, and the fetal weight approximates 150 g (Hadlock, 1991). Practically speaing, the sonographic crown-rump length is not measured beyond 13 weeks, which corresponds to approximately 8.4 cm. Instead, biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length are measured. Fetal weight in the second and third trimesters is estimated from a combination of these measurements (Chap. 10, p. 184)."

Each is discussed in this chapter. This principle is not inviolable; in certain maldevelopments of the brain that must have originated in the embryonal period, all other organs are normal. One can assume that the brain was more vulnerable than any other organ to prenatal as well as natal influences. Perhaps this occurs because the nervous system, of all organ systems, requires the longest time for its development and maturation, during which it is susceptible to disease. Low birth weight and gestational age, indicative of premature birth, increase the risk of cognitive or sensory developmental delay, seizures, and cerebral palsy."

Microcephaly and macrocephaly represent an occipitofrontal circumference 2 standard deviations (SDs) below or above the mean, respectively. Measurements plotted over time may show an accelerating pattern (hydrocephalus) or decelerating pattern (brain injury, degenerative neurologic disorder). The anterior fontanelle is slightly depressed and pulsatile when a calm infant is placed upright. A tense or bulging fontanelle may indicate increased intracranial pressure (ICP) but may also be seen in a crying or febrile infant. Premature closure of one or more sutures (craniosynostosis) results in an unusual shape of the head. Abnormal shape, location, and condition of the face, eyes, nares, philtrum, lips, or ears are found in many genetic syndromes."

Congenital heart disease is seen in 80% of affected children, with supravalvar aortic-valve and pulmonic-valve stenosis and peripheral pulmonic stenosis being the most common anomalies. Although these children often have normal birth weight, they have growth delay, manifesting short stature. They have a distinctive facial appearance (\u201celfin facies\u201d), with median flare of the eyebrows, fullness of the perioral and periorbital region, blue irides with a stellate pattern of pigment, and depressed nasal bridge with anteversion of the nares. Moderate intellectual disability (average IQ in the 50 to 60 range) is common, but developmental testing reveals strength in personal social skills and deficiencies in cognitive areas. Hypercalcemia is present in neonates."
