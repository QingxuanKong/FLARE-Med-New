The correct order of tissues that the larvae would encounter as they eat their way toward the outside of the twig can be determined by tracing the flow of water and nutrients from the center of the twig to the outside. The central cylinder of the twig is composed of the pith, surrounded by the vascular cambium, which produces secondary xylem and secondary phloem. The primary xylem and primary phloem are located just outside the vascular cambium. The cortex is the outermost layer of the twig. The larvae would encounter these tissues in this order as they move outward from the center of the twig.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Consider the epidermis, for example\u2014the outer, epithelial covering of the body. The epidermis undergoes continual renewal, but, unlike the lining of the gut, it is multilayered or stratified. Stem cells are located in the basal layer, and their progeny move outward toward the exposed surface, differentiating as they go. They end up as lifeless scales or squames, which are eventually shed from the surface of the skin (Figure 22\u201310). Even though the architecture of this tissue is very different from that of the intestine, many of the same basic principles apply. The stem cells depend for their existence on signals from a specific niche, in this case the basal lamina and underlying connective tissue. The daughters of stem cells that are committed to differentiation undergo several divisions as transit amplifying cells (while still in the basal layer) before differentiating. Finally, a"

After humans ingest the eggs, embryos escape from the eggs, penetrate the intestinal mucosa, enter the portal circulation, and are carried to various organs, most commonly the liver and lungs. Larvae develop into fluid-filled unilocular hydatid cysts that consist of an external membrane and an inner germinal layer. Daughter cysts develop from the inner aspect of the germinal layer, as do germinating cystic structures called brood capsules.

Assuming that it takes eight photons to fix one molecule of CO2 as carbohydrate under optimal conditions (8\u201310 photons is the currently accepted value), calculate how long it would take a tomato plant with a leaf area of 1 square meter to make a mole of glucose from CO2. Assume that photons strike the leaf at the rate calculated above and, furthermore, that all the photons are absorbed and used to fix CO2. D. If it takes 468 kJ/mole to fix a mole of CO2 into carbohydrate, what is the efficiency of conversion of light energy into chemical energy after photon capture? Assume again that eight photons of red light (680 nm) are required to fix one molecule of CO2."

            "content": "Trichinellosis, Trichinosis (See Also Chap. 45) This disease is caused by the intestinal nematode Trichinella spiralis. Infection in humans results from the ingestion of uncooked or undercooked pork (occasionally bear meat) containing the encysted larvae of T. spiralis. The larvae are liberated from their cysts by the gastric juices and develop into adult male and female worms in the duodenum and jejunum. After fertilization, the female burrows into the intestinal mucosa, where she deposits several successive batches of larvae. These make their way\u2014via the lymphatics, regional lymph nodes, thoracic duct, and bloodstream\u2014into all parts of the body. The new larvae penetrate all tissues but survive only in striated muscle, where they become encysted and eventually calcify. Animals are infected in the same way as humans, and the cycle can be repeated only if a new host ingests the encysted larvae. Gould has written an authoritative review of this subject."

            "content": "The root sheath (RS) has two parts: the outer root sheath, which is continuous with the epidermis of the skin, and the inner root sheath, which extends only as far as the level at which sebaceous glands enter the hair follicle. The inner root sheath is further divided into three layers: Henle\u2019s layer, Huxley\u2019s layer, and the cuticle of the inner root sheath. These layers are seen in the growing hair follicle and are shown at higher magnification in the inset with numbers 1 to 5: 1, cells of the outer root sheath; 2, Henle\u2019s layer; 3, Huxley\u2019s layer; 4, cuticle of the inner root sheath; and 5, future cuticle of the hair. Many of the cells of the growing hair follicle contain pigment that contributes to the color of the hair. Most of this pigment is inside the cell (inset); however, in very dark hair some pigment is also extracellular. The connective tissue surrounding the hair follicle forms a distinct layer referred to as the sheath, or dermal sheath (DS), of the hair follicle."
