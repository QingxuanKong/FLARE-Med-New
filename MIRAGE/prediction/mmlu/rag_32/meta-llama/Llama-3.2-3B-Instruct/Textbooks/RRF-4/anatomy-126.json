Physiologically, these modalities share the singular attribute of responding primarily to chemical stimuli; that is, the end organs that mediate olfaction and gustation are chemoreceptors. Also, taste and smell are interdependent clinically, as the appreciation of the flavor of food and drink depends to a large extent on its aroma, and an abnormality of one of these senses is frequently misinterpreted as an abnormality of the other. In comparison to sight and hearing, taste and smell play a less critical role in the life of the individual. However, chemical stimuli in communication between humans are probably very important for some functions that have not been fully explored. Pheromones (pherein, \u201cto carry\u201d; hormon, \u201cexciting\u201d), that is, odorants exuded from the body, as well as perfumes, play a part in sexual attraction; noxious body odors may repel.

Dysfunctions of the eye and ear are, of course, the domain of the ophthalmologist and otorhinolaryngologist, but they also are of great interest to the neurologist. Some defects in the special sensory apparatus reflect the presence of systemic disease and others represent the initial or leading manifestation of neurologic disease. In keeping with the general scheme of this text, the disorders of the special senses and of ocular movement are discussed in a particular sequence: first, certain facts of anatomic and physiologic importance, followed by cardinal clinical manifestations of disease, and then the syndromes of which these manifestations are a part."

The effect of aging is most evident in relation to vibratory sense, but proprioception, the perception of touch, and fast pain are also diminished with age. Sweating and vasomotor reflexes are reduced as well. These aging changes, which are discussed further in Chap. 28, are probably caused by neuronal loss in dorsal root ganglia and are reflected in a progressive depletion of fibers in the posterior columns. Receptors in the skin and special sense organs (taste, smell) also atrophy with age.

Pain that arises from distention of the middle meningeal artery is projected to the back of the eye and temporal area. Pain from the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery and proximal parts of the middle and anterior cerebral arteries is felt in the eye and orbitotemporal regions. The pathways whereby cephalic sensory stimuli are transmitted to the central nervous system (CNS) are the trigeminal nerves, particularly their first and, to some extent, second divisions, which convey impulses from the forehead, orbit, anterior and middle fossae of the skull, and the upper surface of the tentorium. The sphenopalatine branches of the facial nerve convey impulses from the nasoorbital region. The ninth and tenth cranial nerves and the first three cervical nerves transmit impulses from the inferior surface of the tentorium and all of the posterior fossa. The"

This can be proved by demonstrating that patients with anosmia but without a complaint of ageusia are able to distinguish the elementary taste sensations on the tongue (sweet, sour, bitter, and salty). The olfactory defect can be verified readily enough by presenting a series of nonirritating olfactory stimuli (vanilla, peanut butter, coffee, tobacco) and asking the patient to sniff once and identify them. If the odors can be detected and described, even if they cannot be named, it may be assumed that the olfactory nerves are relatively intact (humans can distinguish many more odors than they can identify by name). If they cannot be detected, there is an olfactory defect. Ammonia and similar pungent substances are unsuitable"
