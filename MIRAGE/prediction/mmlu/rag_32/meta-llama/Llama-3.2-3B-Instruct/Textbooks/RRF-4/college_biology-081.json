Affinity chromatography (Figure 8\u20139C) takes advantage of the biologically important binding interactions that occur on protein surfaces. If a substrate molecule is covalently coupled to an inert matrix such as a polysaccharide bead, the enzyme that operates on that substrate will often be specifically retained by the matrix and can then be eluted (washed out) in nearly pure form. Likewise, short DNA oligonucleotides of a specifically designed sequence can be immobilized in this way and used to purify DNA-binding proteins that normally recognize this sequence of nucleotides in chromosomes. Alternatively, specific antibodies can be coupled to a matrix to purify protein molecules recognized by the antibodies. Because of the great specificity of all such affinity columns, 1000to 10,000-fold purifications can sometimes be achieved in a single pass."

Although the DNA molecules in a cell can be randomly broken into small pieces by mechanical force, a fragment containing a single gene in a mammalian genome would still be only one among a hundred thousand or more DNA fragments, indistinguishable in their average size. How could such a gene be separated from all the others? Because all DNA molecules consist of an approximately equal mixture of the same four nucleotides, they cannot be readily separated, as proteins can, on the basis of their different charges and biochemical properties. The solution to this problem began to emerge with the discovery of restriction nucleases. These enzymes, which are purified from bacteria, cut the DNA double helix at specific sites defined by the local nucleotide sequence, thereby cleaving a long, double-stranded DNA molecule into fragments of strictly defined sizes."

The Shine-Dalgarno sequence facilitates the binding of the large ribosomal subunit to eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA). Q2. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a two-tier testing procedure for Lyme disease that involves a screening enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) followed by a confirmatory western blot analysis on any sample with a positive or equivocal ELISA result. Which of the following statements about these testing procedures is correct? A. Both techniques are used to detect specific mRNA. B. Both techniques involve the use of antibodies. C. ELISA requires the use of electrophoresis."

            "content": "The size of the resulting fragments depends on the length of the target sequences of the restriction nucleases. As shown in Figure 8\u201324, the enzyme HaeIII cuts at a sequence of four nucleotide pairs; a sequence this long would be expected to occur purely by chance approximately once every 256 nucleotide pairs (1 in 44). In comparison, a restriction nuclease with a target sequence that is eight nucleotides long would be expected to cleave DNA on average once every 65,536 nucleotide pairs (1 in 48). This difference in sequence selectivity makes it possible to cleave a long DNA molecule into the fragment sizes that are most suitable for a given application.

Although low copy number genes are usually poorly detected, scRNA-seq on a large number of cells can reveal rare cell subpopula-tions and uncommon RNA expression patterns among different subpopulations.ChIP-seq is always used to map the location of a DNA-binding protein in the genome. Prior to library construction, ChIP is performed to enrich DNA bound by the protein of interest (POI). First, POI and DNA are cross-linked before sonication. Then, a specific antibody is used to pull down POI and attached DNA fragments. After the protein and DNA are reverse cross-linked, DNA is purified to make the ChIP-seq library. If using an antibody against particular transcription fac-tor (TF), DNA sequences bound by this TF are pulled down CellisolationPrimaryculturePropagationTissuesampleProduction of recombinant proteinsAnalysis of gene"

            "content": "Molecular recognition in biology generally relies on an exact fit between the surfaces of two molecules, and the study of transcription regulators has provided some of the clearest examples of this principle. A transcription regulator recognizes a specific cis-regulatory sequence because the surface of the protein is extensively complementary to the special surface features of the double helix that displays that sequence. Each transcription regulator makes a series of contacts with the DNA, involving hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and hydrophobic interactions. Although each individual contact is weak, the 20 or so contacts that are typically formed at the protein\u2013DNA interface add together to ensure that the interaction is both highly specific and very strong (Figure 7\u20138). In fact, DNA\u2013protein"

            "content": "2. Microarrays: DNA microarrays contain thousands of immobilized ssDNA sequences organized in an area no larger than a microscope slide. These microarrays are used to analyze a sample for the presence of gene variations or mutations (genotyping) or to determine the patterns of mRNA production (gene expression analysis), analyzing thousands of genes at the same time. For genotyping analysis, the sample is from genomic DNA. For expression analysis, the population of mRNA molecules from a particular cell type is converted to cDNA and labeled with a fluorescent tag (Fig. 34.23). This mixture is then exposed to a gene (or, DNA) chip, which is a glass slide or membrane containing thousands of tiny spots of DNA, each corresponding to a different gene. The amount of fluorescence bound to each spot is a measure of the amount of that particular mRNA in the sample. DNA microarrays are used to determine the differing patterns of gene expression in two different types of cell (for example, normal"
