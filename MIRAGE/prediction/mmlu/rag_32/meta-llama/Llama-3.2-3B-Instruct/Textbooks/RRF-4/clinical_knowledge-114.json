In genetics, an allele is masked when it is not expressed due to various reasons such as epigenetic modifications, gene silencing, or other mechanisms. In the context of haplotype mapping, a masked allele is an allele that is present in a haplotype but is not expressed due to these mechanisms. The term masked is not directly related to the terms recessive, redundant, repressed, or reclusive. However, the term masked can be associated with the concept of gene silencing or epigenetic modifications. The correct answer can be inferred from the context of haplotype mapping and the concept of gene silencing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

However, there can be many different alleles in the population. The normal or common allele is usually referred to as wild type. When alleles at a given locus are identical, the individual is homozygous. Inheriting identical copies of a mutant allele occurs in many autosomal recessive disorders, particularly in circumstances of consanguinity or isolated populations. If the alleles are different on the maternal and the paternal copy of the gene, the individual is heterozygous at this locus (Fig. 82-10). If two different mutant alleles are inherited at a given locus, the individual is said to be a compound heterozygote. Hemizygous is used to describe males with a mutation in an X chromosomal gene or a female with a loss of one X chromosomal locus."

The principles of allelic segregation, and the transmission of alleles from parents to children, are illustrated in Fig. 82-12.

It is believed that the polymorphism of MHC genes evolved to enable display of and response to any conceivable microbial peptide encountered in the environment. As a result of the polymorphism, a virtually infinite number of combinations of HLA molecules exists in the population. The HLA genes are closely linked on chromosome 6, so they are passed from parent to offspring en bloc and behave like a single locus with respect to their inheritance patterns.

Allele frequencies may vary because certain allelic variants confer a selective advantage. For example, heterozygotes for the sickle cell mutation, which is particularly common in West Africa, are more resistant to malarial infection because the erythrocytes of heterozygotes provide a less favorable environment for Plasmodium parasites. Although homozygosity for the sickle cell mutation is associated with severe anemia and sickle crises (Chap. 127), heterozygotes have a higher probability of survival because of the reduced morbidity and mortality from malaria; this phenomenon has led to an increased frequency of the mutant allele.

In either case, cleavage with an endonuclease results in fragments of lengths that differ from the normal and can be detected by DNA hybridization (see Fig. 34.13). The altered restriction site can be either at the site of a disease-causing mutation (rare) or at a site some distance from the mutation. [Note: The HapMap, developed by The International Haplotype Map Project, is a catalog of common SNP in the human genome. The data are being used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify those alleles that affect health and disease.] 2. Tandem repeats: Polymorphisms in chromosomal"

In a case where there are only two alleles, A and a, the frequency of the genotypes will be p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1, with p2 corresponding to the frequency of AA, 2pq to the frequency of Aa, and q2 to aa. When the frequency of an allele is known, the frequency of the genotype can be calculated. Alternatively, one can determine an allele frequency if the genotype frequency has been determined."

The identification of the ~10 million SNPs estimated to occur in the human genome has generated a catalogue of common genetic variants that occur in human beings from distinct ethnic backgrounds (Fig. 82-3). SNPs are the most common type of sequence variation and account for ~90% of all sequence variation. They occur on average every 100 to 300 bases and are the major source of genetic heterogeneity. Remarkably, however, the primary DNA sequence of humans has ~99.9% similarity compared to that of any other human. SNPs that are in close proximity are inherited together (e.g., they are linked) and are referred to as haplotypes(Fig. 82-4). The HapMap describes the nature and location of these SNP haplotypes and how they are distributed among individuals within and among populations. The haplotype map information, referred to as HapMap, is greatly facilitating GWAS designed to elucidate the complex"

This is known as the Philadelphia-chromosome abnormality (discovered in Philadelphia) and was initially identified as a shortened chromosome, later identified to be chromosome 22 (22q\u2013) (Fig. 133-1). Some patients may have complex translocations (variant Ph) involving three or more translocations that include chromosomes 9 and 22 and one or more other chromosomes. Others may have a \u201cmasked Ph,\u201d involving translocations between chromosome 9 and a chromosome other than 22. The prognosis of these patients and their response to TKI therapy are similar to those in patients with Ph. About 5\u201310% of patients may have additional chromosomal abnormalities in the Ph-positive cells. These usually involve trisomy 8, a double Ph, isochromosome 17 or 17p deletion, 20q\u2013, or others. This is referred to as clonal evolution and was historically a sign"
