According to the provided documents, the correct positioning of an ileostomy is crucial for its proper functioning and healing. The Brooke technique, which is a widely used method for creating an ileostomy, involves bringing the end of the small intestine through the abdominal wall defect and maturing it. The stoma should be brought through the abdominal wall approximately 2 cm proximal to the edge, and then through the serosa, approximately 2 cm proximal to the edge, and then through the dermis (Brooke technique). The stoma is then everted, and the mucocutaneous junction is sutured circumferentially with interrupted absorbable suture. The ideal stoma should be flush with the skin, allowing for easy access for cleaning and care. This positioning helps to prevent irritation and promotes healing. Therefore, the correct answer is A. flush with the skin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Crohn\u2019s disease of the large intestine may present as fulminant colitis or toxic megacolon. In this set-ting, treatment is identical to treatment of fulminant colitis and toxic megacolon secondary to ulcerative colitis. Resuscitation and medical therapy with bowel rest, broad-spectrum antibiot-ics, and parenteral corticosteroids should be instituted. If the patient\u2019s condition worsens or fails to rapidly improve, total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy is recommended. An elective proctectomy may be required if the patient has refrac-tory Crohn\u2019s proctitis. Alternatively, if the rectum is spared, an ileorectal anastomosis may be appropriate once the patient has recovered.Other indications for surgery in chronic"

            "content": "colorectal Disease A greater percentage of patients with Crohn\u2019s colitis require surgery for intractability, fulminant disease, and anorectal disease. Several alternatives are available, ranging from the use of a temporary loop ileostomy to resection of segments of diseased colon or even the entire colon and rectum. For patients with segmental involvement, segmental colon resection with primary anastomosis can be performed. In 20\u201325% of patients with extensive colitis, the rectum is spared sufficiently to consider rectal preservation. Most surgeons believe that an IPAA is contraindicated in CD due to the high incidence of pouch failure. A diverting colostomy may help heal severe perianal disease or rectovaginal fistulas, but disease almost always recurs with reanastomosis. These patients often require a total proctocolectomy and ileostomy."

During pregnancy, colectomy and ostomy creation for fulminant colitis may be needed as a lifesaving measure, and it has been described during each trimester. Dozois (2006) reviewed 42 such cases and found that, in general, outcomes have been good in recent reports. Most women underwent partial or complete colectomy, but Ooi and colleagues (2003) described decompression colostomy with ileostomy in a 10-and a 16-week pregnancy. Parenteral nutrition discussed on page 1043 is occasionally necessary for women with prolonged exacerbations."

Pancreatic pseudocysts in patients man-aged nonoperatively suggest a missed injury, and ERCP should be done to evaluate the integrity of the pancreatic duct. Late pseudocysts may be a complication of operative management and are treated much like those in patients with pancreatitis (see Chapter 33). Intra-abdominal abscesses are common and rou-tinely managed with percutaneous drainage.Colon and Rectum. Currently, three methods for treating colonic injuries are used: primary repair, end colostomy, and primary repair with diverting loop ileostomy. Primary repairs include lateral suture repair or resection of the damaged seg-ment with reconstruction by ileocolostomy or colocolostomy. All suturing and anastomoses are performed using a running single-layer technique (Fig. 7-67).55 The advantage of defini-tive treatment must be balanced against the possibility of anas-tomotic leakage if suture lines are created under suboptimal"

The surgical principles described earlier apply, and an attempt should be made to resect the involved segment along with its lymphovascular supply. If the resection involves the right colon or proximal transverse colon (right or extended right colectomy), a primary ileocolonic anastomosis can usually be performed safely as long as the remaining bowel appears healthy and the patient is stable. For left-sided tumors, the traditional approach has involved resection of the involved bowel and end colostomy, with or without a mucus fistula. However, there is an increasing body of data to suggest that a primary anasto-mosis without a bowel preparation or with an on-table lavage, with or without a diverting ileostomy, may be equally safe in this setting.

If surgical intervention is required because of failure of contrast enemas to relieve obstruction, operative irrigation with dilute contrast agent, N-acetylcysteine, or saline through a purse-string suture may be successful. Alternatively, resection of the distended ter-minal ileum is performed, and the meconium pellets are flushed from the distal small bowel. At this point, an end ileostomy may be created. The distal bowel may be brought up as a mucus fistula or sewn to the side of the ileum as a classic Bishop-Koop anastomosis.
