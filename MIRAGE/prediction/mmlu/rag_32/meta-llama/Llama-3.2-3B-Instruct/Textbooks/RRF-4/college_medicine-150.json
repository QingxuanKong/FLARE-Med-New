The HPA axis is a complex system that regulates the body's response to stress. The hypothalamus releases CRF in response to stress, which stimulates the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which in turn stimulates the adrenal cortex to release cortisol. Cortisol then acts as a negative feedback inhibitor on the HPA axis, suppressing the release of CRF and ACTH. This negative feedback loop is crucial for maintaining a balance between the body's stress response and its homeostasis. Therefore, the correct answer is related to the negative feedback loop of cortisol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

The hypothalamus and pituitary stimulate cortisol production, and cortisol negatively feeds back on the hypothalamus and pituitary to maintain its set point. Both neurogenic (e.g., fear) and systemic (e.g., hypoglycemia, hemorrhage, cytokines) forms of stress stimulate release of CRH. CRH is also under strong diurnal rhythmic regulation emerging from the suprachiasmatic nucleus, such that cortisol levels surge during the early predawn and morning hours and then continually decline throughout the day and evening. CRH acutely stimulates release of ACTH and chronically increases proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression and corticotrope hypertrophy and proliferation. Some parvicellular neurons coexpress CRH and ADH, which potentiates the actions of CRH."

In severe acute stress such as trauma or shock, the sympathetic nervous system is activated and catecholamines are released, leading to increased cardiac output and a primed musculoskeletal system. Catecholamines also increase mean blood pressure and stimulate glucose production. Multiple stress-induced pathways converge on the hypothalamus, stimulating several hormones, including vasopressin and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). These hormones, in addition to cytokines (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, interleukin [IL] 2, IL-6) increase ACTH and GH production.

Cortisol also decreases glucose uptake by muscle and adipose tissue and has permissive actions on glucagon and catecholamines. Cortisol has multiple effects on other tissue. From a pharmacological point of view, the most important is the immunosuppressive/ antiinflammatory effect. 7."

            "content": "Besides the brain effects of opioids on sedation and euphoria and the combined brain and peripheral nervous system effects on analgesia, a wide range of other organs can be affected. The cough reflex is inhibited through the brain, leading to the use of some opiates as an antitussive, and nausea and vomiting are due to effects on the medulla. The release of several pituitary hormones is inhibited, including corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and luteinizing hormone, which reduces levels of cortisol and sex hormones and can lead to impaired stress responses and reduced libido. An increase in prolactin also contributes to the reduced sex drive in males. Two other hormones affected are thyrotropin, which is reduced, and growth hormone, which is increased. Respiratory depression results from opiate-induced insensitivity of brainstem neurons to increases in carbon dioxide, and in patients with pulmonary disease, this can result in clinically significant complications. In overdoses,"

Similarly, pituitary hormones may feed back to the hypothalamus and serve important regulatory functions in short-loop feedback. Finally, hypothalamic secretions may directly feed back to the hypothalamus itself in an ultrashort feedback loop. The major secretory products of the hypothalamus are the pituitary-releasing factors (Fig. 7.3): 1. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which controls the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 2.
