The documents discuss the embryology of the lip and palate, which is crucial for understanding the causes of cleft lip and palate. According to the documents, the primary palate forms from the fusion of the medial nasal and maxillary prominences during weeks 4-7 of gestation, while the secondary palate forms posterior to the incisive foramen and the soft palate during weeks 8-12 of gestation. The secondary palate includes the hard palate and the soft palate. The documents also mention that the palatine shelves rotate into a horizontal orientation around week 8, bringing their free edges into close proximity with the nasal septum, and midline fusion commences, proceeding posteriorly from the incisive foramen. This process is critical for the formation of the secondary palate, which is involved in the development of the hard palate and the soft palate. Therefore, the correct answer should involve the fusion of the palatine and frontonasal processes, as well as the secondary nasal processes, which are all involved in the formation of the secondary palate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

When present, palatal defects allow direct communication between the nasal and oral cavities, creating problems with speech and feeding. Management includes squeeze-bottle feedings, special nipples, nipples with attached shields to seal the palate, and gastrostomy in severe cases. Surgical closure of the cleftlip is usually done by 3 months of age. Closure of the palate follows, usually before 1 year of age. Missing teeth are replaced by prostheses. Cosmetic results are often good, but depend on the severity of the defect. Speech is nasal as a result of the cleft palate. Surgical treatment is effective, but sometimes does not restore palatal function completely. Speech therapy or, occasionally, the use of a speech-assisting appliance may help. Frequent episodes of otitis media are common, as are defects of teeth and the alveolar ridge."

The abnormally placed tongue blocks the fusion of the palatal shelves, which normally come together in the midline to produce the hard and soft palate; this leads to the presence of a U-shaped cleft palate. After delivery, the normal-sized tongue in the smaller than normal oral cavity leads to airway obstruction, a potentially life-threatening complication. Pierre Robin sequence comprises a triad of anomalies (micrognathia, U-shaped cleft palate, and obstructive apnea) which results from a single malformation, the failure of the jaw to grow at a critical time during gestation.

The two most com-mon techniques employed for soft palate repair are intravelar veloplasty (IVV) and Furlow double-opposing Z-plasty. Para-mount to each technique is the complete release of aberrant levator muscle insertions from the posterior edge of the hard palate.

Metabolic derangements and vascular disturbances have also been hypothesized to play a role.27While CL/P can be logically explained as an embryologic failure of fusion between facial processes, the location of the atypical craniofacial clefts is not well-accounted for by this theory. In the 1960s, Weston and Johnston used animal mod-els to demonstrate the vast contributions of neural crest cells to mesynchymal development of the face. They postulated that failure of these cells to penetrate into the developing face could lead to breakdown of the surrounding epithelia and result in atypical craniofacial clefts. The last 30 years has seen contin-ued refinement of this theory. Most recent evidence suggests that neural crest cells form developmental rests or ossification centers within the well-known facial processes. An abnormal number or impaired differentiation of these ossification centers may better"

An abnormal number or impaired differentiation of these ossification centers may better explain the locations of clefts that seem to follow no known embryologic fusion plane.33In 1974, Paul Tessier published detailed anatomic obser-vations of a large series of children with atypical craniofacial clefts. He introduced a simple numbering system to classify these clefts based strictly on involved anatomy.28 Clefts were assigned numbers 0 to 14 as they radiate around the orbit. Num-bers 0 to 7 describe facial clefts, while 8 to 14 described cranial clefts. Fig. 45-34 illustrates the paths of soft tissue clefts (above) and their corresponding skeletal clefts (below).33,35A number 0 facial cleft and its number 14 cranial extension are midline clefts, which may be characterized by tissue defi-ciency or excess.

Sound epide-miologic studies of these atypical craniofacial clefts have been precluded by their extreme rarity, but rough estimates place them on the order of 100 times less common than CL/P. As a result, definitive causality has not been established. With the exception of some well-defined syndromes that include atypical craniofacial clefts, genetics does not appear to play a significant part in their pathogenesis. Some extrinsic factors that have been implicated include radiation, prenatal infections, early gesta-tional exposure to teratogenic drugs or chemicals, and amniotic bands. Metabolic derangements and vascular disturbances have also been hypothesized to play a role.27While CL/P can be"

The soft palate, or velum, together with lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls, can be conceptualized as a valve that regulates the passage of air through the nasopharynx. The paired levator veli palatini muscles descend from the cranial base and decussate in the midline to form a sling within the soft palate. This sling acts to elevate the velum against the posterior pharyngeal wall, effectively closing the velopharyngeal port. In patients with cleft palate, the levator muscles are unable to cross the midline. Instead, they run parallel to the cleft margin and insert aberrantly into the posterior edge of the hard palate (Fig. 45-28A,B). Air is allowed to leak through the nose dur-ing attempts to suck or speak. This inability to build negative or"

Reported fistula rates vary widely in the literature, but increased incidence has been correlated with less experienced surgeons, wider clefts, and bilateral clefts.21,22 Few oronasal fistulae are amenable to closure with simple local tissue rearrangement. More commonly, a complete reelevation of palatal mucosa is required in order to obtain a tension-free layered closure. In the case of large or recurrent fistulae, there may be insufficient tissue available locally, and recruitment of regional healthy tissue from the buccal mucosa or tongue may be necessary.32Velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) is caused by incom-plete closure of the velopharyngeal port, which results in air leaking through the nose during speech.

However, when syndactylism is more severe and is accompanied by premature closure of cranial sutures, the nervous system usually proves to be abnormal as well. The general term acrocephalosyndactyly is used to describe the several combinations of craniosynostotic and facial deformities and fusion of digits. Several of these disorders are a consequence of mutations in genes encoding one of two fibroblast growth factors or proteins related to them. The following descriptions include only the major features; most have, in addition, distinctive malformations of the orbits, ears, and palate."
