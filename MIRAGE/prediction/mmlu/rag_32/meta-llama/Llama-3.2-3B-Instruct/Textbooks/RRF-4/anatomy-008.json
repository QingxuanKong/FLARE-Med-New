According to Document [25], the development of the hard palate and soft palate, collectively known as the \"secondary palate,\" occurs during weeks 6-12 of gestation. Specifically, it is mentioned that the lateral palatine processes initially hang vertically on either side of the developing tongue and then rotate into a horizontal orientation around week 8. This rotation brings their free edges into close proximity with the nasal septum, marking the beginning of midline fusion. Therefore, the palatine processes begin to fuse at around 8 weeks post-fertilization.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}}",

The two maxillae contribute substantially to the architecture of the roof of the oral cavity. The parts involved are the alveolar and palatine processes (Fig. 8.248A). The palatine process is a horizontal shelf that projects from the medial surface of each maxilla. It originates just superior to the medial aspect of the alveolar process and extends to the midline where it is joined, at a suture, with the palatine process from the other side.

The three types of fibers leave the ganglion as orbital, palatine, nasal, and pharyngeal branches. Orbital branches. The orbital branches are small and pass through the inferior orbital fissure to contribute to the supply of the orbital wall and of the sphenoidal and ethmoidal sinuses. Greater and lesser palatine nerves. The greater and lesser palatine nerves (Fig. 8.156) pass inferiorly from the pterygopalatine ganglion, enter and pass through the palatine canal, and enter the oral surface of the palate through the greater and lesser palatine foramina. The greater palatine nerve passes forward on the roof of the oral cavity to innervate mucosa and glands of the hard palate and the adjacent gingiva, almost as far forward as the incisor teeth."

The roof of the nasal cavity is narrow and is highest in central regions where it is formed by the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone (Fig. 8.238). Anterior to the cribriform plate the roof slopes inferiorly to the nares and is formed by: the nasal spine of the frontal bone and the nasal bones, and the lateral processes of the septal cartilage and major alar cartilages of the external nose. Posteriorly, the roof of each cavity slopes inferiorly to the choana and is formed by: the anterior surface of the sphenoid bone, the ala of the vomer and adjacent sphenoidal process of the palatine bone, and the vaginal process of the medial plate of the pterygoid process."

Lymphatic vessels from the palate drain into deep cervical nodes (Fig. 8.275).
