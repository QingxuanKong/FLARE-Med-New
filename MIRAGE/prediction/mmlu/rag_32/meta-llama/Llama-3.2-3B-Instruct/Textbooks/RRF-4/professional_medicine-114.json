    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the risk of hemophilia in the infant, we need to understand the genetic basis of the condition. Hemophilia is an X-linked recessive disorder, meaning that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome. Since the patient's father had classic hemophilia, it is likely that he was homozygous recessive for the mutation, which means he had two copies of the mutated gene (XX or XY). This is because hemophilia is almost exclusively found in males, who have one X and one Y chromosome. Females can be carriers of the condition, but they usually do not express the symptoms due to the presence of a second X chromosome with a normal gene. Given that the patient is a carrier, she has one normal X chromosome and one X chromosome with the mutated gene (XX). The risk of passing the mutated gene to the infant is 50% for each pregnancy, as the mother contributes one X chromosome to the offspring. Since the karyotype obtained from the amniotic fluid sample shows that the fetus is XY, the infant will be a male. Therefore, the risk of the infant having hemophilia is 50% if the mother is a carrier and the father is homozygous recessive for the mutation. The risk of the infant being a carrier is also 50% if the mother is a carrier and the father is heterozygous for the mutation, which is the case here. Options A and D are incorrect because the infant has a 50% risk of having hemophilia, not 0% or 75%. Option C is partially correct, but it is more accurate to say that the infant has a 50% risk of having hemophilia and a 50% risk of being a carrier, rather than a 75% risk of being a carrier.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Desmopressin has been shown in selected cases to reduce obstetrical bleeding complications (Trigg, 2012). If a male fetus has hemophilia, the risk of hemorrhage increases after delivery in the neonate. his is especially true if circumcision is attempted. If a mother has hemophilia A or B, all of her sons will have the disease, and all of her daughters will be carriers. If she is a carrier, half of her sons will inherit the disease, and half of her daughters will be carriers. Prenatal diagnosis of hemophilia is possible in some families using chorionic villus biopsy (Chap. 14, p. 293)."

Based on the risk of having a chromosomally abnormal fetus in comparison to the risk for an adverse event from amniocentesis or CVS, the recommendation is that women over the age of 35 consider prenatal testing if they want to know the chromosomal status of their fetus. The precise mechanism for the maternal age effect is not known, but it is believed that it involves a breakdown in the process of chromosome segregation. A similar effect is not seen for trisomy and paternal age. This difference may reflect the fact that oocytes are generated early in ovary development in the female, whereas spermatogonia are generated continuously after puberty in the male."

            "content": "A 59-year-old woman presents to an urgent care clinic with a 4-day history of frequent and painful urination. She has had fevers, chills, and flank pain for the past 2 days. Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

            "content": "Historically, serum screening has required the use of invasive testing follow-up to confirm findings. Because invasive testing carries a small but real risk of pregnancy loss, many women were not willing to submit to an amniocentesis or CVS. What has been needed is a noninvasive definitive test, one in which fetal risk is negligible. Recently, the search for such a noninvasive test has been successful. Prenatal diagnosis using cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood offers the ability to detect trisomies in fetuses using nothing more than a sample of the mother\u2019s blood. Although still in the research stage, this technique is being piloted in high-risk pregnancies. It is common for pregnant women to have a screening sonogram at 18 weeks\u2019 gestation. An anatomy scan is done to look for congenital anomalies. Brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and spine are examined."

The patient had Crohn\u2019s disease and was maintained on 6-mercaptopurine and prednisone. She presented with abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, and small-bowel obstruction. The image reveals a 7to 10-cm long stricture at the terminal ileum (white arrows) causing obstruction and significant dilatation of the proximal small bowel (white asterisk). A fetus is seen in the uterus (dashed white arrows). (Courtesy of Drs. J. F. B. Chick and"
