Patients are randomly assigned to receive the new drug or standard treatment. The alpha and beta values for calculating probability are 0.05 and 0.20, respectively.

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the concepts of type I error, type II error, power of the study, and sensitivity of the study. Type I error occurs when a true null hypothesis is rejected, while type II error occurs when a false null hypothesis is not rejected. Power of the study refers to the probability of detecting a statistically significant effect if there is one to be detected. Sensitivity of the study refers to the proportion of true positives correctly identified by the test. Given that the alpha value (0.05) is the probability of a type I error, and the beta value (0.20) is the probability of a type II error, we need to consider how these values change when the sample size is reduced from 1000 to 500. Reducing the sample size from 1000 to 500 would increase the standard error of the estimate, which in turn would increase the width of the confidence interval. This would make it more difficult to detect a statistically significant effect, which means that the power of the study would decrease. On the other hand, the sensitivity of the study would not be directly affected by the sample size. The sensitivity of the study refers to the proportion of true positives correctly identified by the test, which is determined by the test itself and the population being studied, not by the sample size. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Power of the study, as reducing the sample size from 1000 to 500 would decrease the power of the study, making it less likely to detect a statistically significant effect.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",

In addition, individuals were randomly assigned to different antihypertensive regimens. Individuals in the intensive treatment arm achieved an HbA1c of 7%, compared to a 7.9% HbA1c in the standard treatment group.

First, the terms insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) are obsolete. Because many individuals with type 2 DM eventually require insulin treatment for control of Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosis, Classification, and Pathophysiology 2400 glycemia, the use of the term NIDDM generated considerable confusion. A second difference is that age or treatment modality is not a criterion. Although type 1 DM most commonly develops before the age of 30, an autoimmune beta cell destructive process can develop at any age. It is estimated that between 5 and 10% of individuals who develop DM after age 30 years have type 1 DM. Although type 2 DM more typically develops with increasing age, it is now being diagnosed more frequently in children and young adults, particularly in obese adolescents."

Powers The goals of therapy for type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) are to (1) eliminate symptoms related to hyperglycemia, (2) reduce or eliminate the long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications of DM (Chap. 419), and (3) allow the patient to achieve as normal a lifestyle as possible. To reach these goals, the physician should identify a target level of glycemic control for each patient, provide the patient with the educational and pharmacologic resources necessary to reach this level, and monitor/treat DM-related complications. Symptoms of diabetes usually resolve when the plasma glucose is <11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), and thus most DM treatment focuses on achieving the second and third goals. This chapter first reviews the ongoing treatment of diabetes in the outpatient setting and then discusses the treatment of severe hyperglycemia, as well as the treatment of diabetes in hospitalized patients."

There was a relation between strict glucose control by means of an intravenous insulin infusion system and a reduction or delay in the occurrence of painful neuropathic symptoms, retinopathy, and nephropathy.

In fact, in the context of a randomized clinical trial, strict glycemic control was associated with a higher mortality rate. Thus, a more reasonable goal for hemoglobin A1c is 7% or slightly below. Treatment goals are altered further in frail older adults who have a high risk of complications of hypoglycemia and a life expectancy of <5 years. In these cases, an even less stringent target (e.g., 7\u20138%) should be considered, with A1c monitored every 6 or 12 months.

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of improved glycemic control in individuals of different ethnicity and, presumably, a different etiology of DM (i.e., phenotypically different from those in the DCCT and UKPDS). The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) and Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trials also found that improved glycemic control reduced microvascular complications."

In the intensively treated group, mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 7.2% (normal <6%) and mean blood glucose of 155 mg/dL were achieved, whereas in the conventionally treated group, HbA1c averaged 8.9% with mean blood glucose of 225 mg/dL. Over the study period, which aver-aged 7 years, a reduction of approximately 60% in risk of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy was noted in the tight control group compared with the standard control group. The DCCT study, in addition, introduced the concept of glycemic memory, which comprises the long-term benefits of any significant period of"

Random assignment helps ensure that the two groups are truly comparable. The control group may be treated with a placebo or with the accepted standard of care. The study may be masked in one of two ways: single-masked, in which patients do not know which treatment group they are in, or double-masked, in which neither the patients nor their physicians know who is in which group. Double-masked studies are the gold standard for studying treatment effects. Advantages of randomized controlled trials are as follows: They involve minimal bias. They have the potential to demonstrate causal relationships. Disadvantages include the following: They are costly and time intensive. Informed consent may be diffcult to obtain. Some interventions (e.g., surgery) are not amenable to masking. Ethical standards cannot allow all variables to be controlled."

Somewhat surprisingly, all three studies found little or no benefit of intensive glucose control to reduce macrovascular events in T2DM. In fact, the ACCORD study was ended early because of the increased mortality rate in the intensive glucose control arm. Whether iatrogenic hypoglycemia was the cause of the increased mortality risk is not known. In light of these findings, some new recommendations and paradigms have been formulated. Whereas there is little debate regarding the need to reduce hyperglycemia in the hospital, the glycemic maintenance goals have been modified to lie between 140 and 180 mg/dL. Accordingly, the benefits of insulin therapy and reduced hyperglycemia can be obtained while the prevalence of hypoglycemia is reduced."

Assuming that maximal benefit of MNT and increased physical activity has been realized, patients with mild to moderate hyperglycemia (FPG <11.1\u201313.9 mmol/L [200\u2013250 mg/dL]) often respond well to a single, oral glucose-lowering agent. Patients with more severe hyperglycemia (FPG >13.9 mmol/L [250 mg/dL]) may respond partially but are unlikely to achieve normoglycemia with oral monotherapy. A stepwise approach that starts with a single agent and adds a second agent to achieve the glycemic target can be used (see \u201cCombination therapy with glucose-lowering agents,\u201d below). Insulin can be used as initial therapy in individuals with severe hyperglycemia (FPG <13.9\u201316.7 mmol/L [250\u2013300 mg/dL]) or in those who are symptomatic from the hyperglycemia. This approach is based on the"
