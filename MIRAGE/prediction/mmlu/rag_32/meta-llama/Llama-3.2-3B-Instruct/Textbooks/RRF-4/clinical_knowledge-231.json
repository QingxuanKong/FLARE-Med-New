Instead, metabolic byproducts seem to be important factors in the onset of fatigue. Fatigue may potentially occur at any of the points involved in muscle contraction, from the brain to the muscle cells, as well as in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems that maintain energy supplies (i.e., fatty acids and glucose) and oxygen delivery to the exercising muscle. Several factors have been implicated in muscle fatigue. During brief periods of tetany, the oxygen supply to the muscle is adequate as long as the circulation is intact.

As stated earlier, the circumstances during exercise are somewhat different. During a short period of intense exercise, the muscle uses carbohydrate derived from glycogen stores; myophosphorylase is the enzyme that initiates the metabolism of glycogen. With longer aerobic exercise, blood flow to muscle and the availability of glucose and fatty acids are increased. At first, glucose is the main source of energy during exercise; later, with exhaustion of glycogen stores, energy is provided by oxidation of fatty acids. Thus, muscle failure at a certain phase of exercise is predictive of the type of energy failure. A rising blood concentration of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate reflects the increasing oxidation of fatty acids, and an increase in blood lactate reflects the anaerobic metabolism of glucose.

These units tend to be active much of the time, if not continuously, and so their lack of fatigability makes good functional sense. As more motor units are recruited for a motor act, motor neurons with progressively larger axons become involved, and these axons synapse onto the fast-twitch fibers. Thus they generate progressively larger amounts of tension.

Skeletal muscle fatigue during intense exercise is associated with depletion of the creatine phosphate store, although as described subsequently, this does not necessarily imply that the fatigue is caused by depletion of the creatine phosphate store.

Regular maximal-strength exercise, such as weightlifting, induces the synthesis of more myofibrils and hence hypertrophy of the active muscle cells.

Fatigue refers to an inherently subjective human experience of physical and mental weariness, sluggishness, and exhaustion. In the context of clinical medicine, fatigue is most typically and practically defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining voluntary mental or physical activity. Nearly everyone who has ever been ill with a self-limited infection has experienced this near-universal symptomatology, and fatigue is usually brought to medical attention only when it is either of unclear cause or the severity is out of proportion with what would be expected for the associated trigger. Fatigue should be distinguished from muscle weakness, a reduction of neuromuscular power (Chap. 30); most patients complaining of fatigue are not truly weak"

            "content": "These disorders are considered together because they are clinically virtually identical and both express themselves by the development of muscle cramps after exercise (actually true physiologic contractures, as described in Chap. 46). In both diseases, an otherwise normal child, adolescent, or adult begins to complain of weakness and stiffness and sometimes pain on using the limbs. Muscle contraction and relaxation are normal when the patient is in repose, but strenuous exercise, either isometric (carrying heavy weights) or dynamic (climbing stairs or walking uphill), causes the muscles to shorten (contracture), a result of their inability to relax. After vigorous exercise, episodes of myoglobinuria are common, in some cases resulting in renal failure. With mild sustained activity, the patient experiences progressive muscle fatigue and weakness, which diminish following a brief pause. The patient can then resume his activities at the original pace (\u201csecond-wind\u201d phenomenon). During"
