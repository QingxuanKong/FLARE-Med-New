    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze each statement and determine which one is not true. Let's evaluate each option: A. Muscle glycogen is broken down enzymatically to glucose-1-phosphate - This statement is true. Muscle glycogen breakdown is a process called glycogenolysis, which involves the enzymatic breakdown of glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate. B. Elite endurance runners have a high proportion of Type I fibres in their leg muscles - This statement is true. Type I fibers are slow-twitch fibers that are well-suited for endurance activities, such as distance running. C. Liver glycogen is important in the maintenance of the blood glucose concentration - This statement is true. The liver stores glycogen and can break it down to glucose when blood glucose levels are low, helping to maintain blood glucose homeostasis. D. Insulin promotes glucose uptake by all tissues in the body - This statement is false. Insulin primarily promotes glucose uptake by tissues such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, but not all tissues. For example, insulin has little effect on glucose uptake in the brain and red blood cells. \", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
