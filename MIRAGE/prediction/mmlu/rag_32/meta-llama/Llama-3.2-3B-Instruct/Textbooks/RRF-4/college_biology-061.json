As Darwin showed, we can readily interpret such close family resemblances in terms of evolution from common ancestors, and we can find the remains of many of these ancestors preserved in the fossil record. In this way, it has been possible to begin to draw a family tree of living organisms, showing the various lines of descent, as well as branch points in the history, where the ancestors of one group of species became different from those of another."

And for an ancestor that has produced a large number of different organisms alive today, the DNA sequences of many species can be compared simultaneously to unscramble much of the ancestral sequence, allowing scientists to derive DNA sequences much farther back in time.

Although a modern organism such as the horseshoe crab looks remarkably similar to fossil ancestors that lived 200 million years ago, there is every reason to believe that the horse-shoe-crab genome has been changing during all that time in much the same way as in other evolutionary lineages, and at a similar rate. Selection must have maintained key functional properties of the horseshoe-crab genome to account for the morphological stability of the lineage.

Before the advent of the microscope, cancer was believed to be composed of aggregates of mucus or other noncellular matter. By the middle of the nineteenth century, it became clear that tumors were masses of cells and that these cells arose from the normal cells of the tissue from which the cancer originated. However, the molecular basis for the uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells was to remain a mystery for another century. During that time, a number of theories for the origin of cancer were postulated. The great biochemist Otto Warburg proposed the combustion theory of cancer, which stipulated that cancer was due to abnormal oxygen metabolism. In addition, some believed that all cancers were caused by viruses, and that cancer was in fact a contagious disease."

Although called Charcot disease in France, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (the term recommended by Charcot) has been preferred in the English-speaking world. Duchenne had earlier (1858) described labioglossolaryngeal paralysis, a term that Wachsmuth in 1864 changed to progressive bulbar palsy. In 1869, Charcot called attention to the nuclear origin of progressive bulbar palsy, and in 1882 Dejerine established its relationship to ALS.

Perhaps the eukaryotic way of life has made large size an advantage: predators typically need to be bigger than their prey, and cell size generally increases in proportion to genome size. Whatever the reason, aided by a massive accumulation of DNA segments derived from parasitic transposable elements (discussed in Chapter 5), the genomes of most eukaryotes have become orders of magnitude larger than those of bacteria and archaea (Figure 1\u201332). The freedom to be extravagant with DNA has had profound implications. Eukaryotes not only have more genes than prokaryotes; they also have vastly more DNA that does not code for protein. The human genome contains 1000 times as many nucleotide pairs as the genome of a typical bacterium, perhaps 10 times as Figure 1\u201331 The origin of chloroplasts."

Although we lack a direct record of changes over time, scientists can reconstruct the process of genome evolution from detailed comparisons of the genomes of contemporary organisms. The basic organizing framework for comparative genomics is the phylogenetic tree. A simple example is the tree describing the divergence of humans from the great apes (Figure 4\u201363). The primary support for this tree comes from comparisons of gene or protein sequences. For example, comparisons between the sequences of human genes or proteins and those of the great apes typically reveal the fewest differences between human and chimpanzee and the most between human and orangutan."

For example, individual species have often lost some of the ancestral genes; other genes have almost certainly been acquired by horizontal transfer from another species and therefore are not truly ancestral, even though shared. In fact, genome comparisons strongly suggest that both lineage-specific gene loss and horizontal gene transfer, in some cases between evolutionarily distant species, have been major factors of evolution, at least among prokaryotes. Finally, in the course of 2 or 3 billion years, some genes that were initially shared will have changed beyond recognition through mutation."

To explain the findings, however, we need to consider a little more closely how new genes arise and genomes evolve. The raw material of evolution is the DNA sequence that already exists: there is no natural mechanism for making long stretches of new random sequence. In this sense, no gene is ever entirely new. Innovation can, however, occur in several ways (Figure 1\u201319): 1.

            "content": "Arabidopsis has Been chosen out of 300,000 species As a model Plant The large multicellular organisms that we see around us\u2014the flowers and trees and animals\u2014seem fantastically varied, but they are much closer to one another in their evolutionary origins, and more similar in their basic cell biology, than the great host of microscopic single-celled organisms. Thus, while bacteria and archaea are separated by perhaps 3.5 billion years of evolution, vertebrates and insects are separated by about 700 million years, fish and mammals by about 450 million years, and the different species of flowering plants by only about 150 million years."
