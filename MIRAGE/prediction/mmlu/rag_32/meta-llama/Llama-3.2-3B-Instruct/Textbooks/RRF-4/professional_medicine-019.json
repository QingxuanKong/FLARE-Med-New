The pain was initially on the right but now has become generalized. His temperature is 38.8\u00b0C (101.8\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 143/83 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows guarding with diffuse rebound tenderness. There are no palpable masses. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a perforated appendix. Examination of peritoneal fluid from this patient will most likely show which of the following organisms?",

    "predict": "To approach this question, let's consider the key points: 1. The patient has a perforated appendix, which is a complication of appendicitis. 2. The patient is a 16-year-old boy. 3. The appendix is a common site for peritoneal contamination with fecal flora, which can lead to various infections. 4. The most common sites for abscesses to develop are the pelvis and the hepatorenal recess. Given these points, the most likely organism to be found in the peritoneal fluid of a patient with a perforated appendix is a Gram-negative rod. Step-by-step thinking: - The appendix is a common site for peritoneal contamination with fecal flora, which is more likely to contain Gram-negative bacteria. - The most common Gram-negative rod found in the human gut is Escherichia coli (E. coli). - E. coli is a common cause of peritonitis and abscesses in patients with a perforated appendix. Conclusion: The answer is C. Escherichia coli. Here's the output in the required json format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The appendix is a common site for peritoneal contamination with fecal flora, which is more likely to contain Gram-negative bacteria.

It was noted at operation that the appendix had perforated and there was pus within the abdominal cavity. The appendix was removed and the stump tied. The abdomen was washed out with warm saline solution. The patient initially made an uneventful recovery, but by day 7 she had become unwell, with pain over her right shoulder and spiking temperatures. This patient had developed an intraabdominal abscess. Any operation on the bowel may involve peritoneal contamination with fecal contents and fecal flora. This may not be appreciated at the time of the operation. Over the postoperative period an inflammatory reaction ensued and an abscess cavity developed, filling with pus. Typically, the observation chart revealed a \u201cswinging\u201d pyrexia (fever). The most common sites for abscess to develop are the pelvis and the hepatorenal recess."

Contrast-enhanced CT is useful in identifying an intraabdominal source for infection. It may be difficult to recover organisms from cultures of peritoneal fluid, presumably because the burden of organisms is low. However, the yield can be improved if 10 mL of peritoneal fluid is placed directly into a blood culture bottle. Because bacteremia frequently accompanies PBP, blood should be cultured simultaneously. To maximize the yield, culture samples should be collected prior to administration of antibiotics. No specific radiographic studies are helpful in the diagnosis of PBP. A plain film of the abdomen would be expected to show ascites. Chest and abdominal radiography should be performed in patients with abdominal pain to exclude free air, which signals a perforation (Fig. 159-2)."

Within the obstructed appendix, bacteria proliferate and invade the appendix wall, which becomes damaged by pressure necrosis. In some instances, this may resolve spontaneously; in other cases, inflammatory change (Figs. 4.86 and 4.87) continues and perforation ensues, which may lead to localized or generalized peritonitis. Most patients with acute appendicitis have localized tenderness in the right groin. Initially, the pain begins as a central, periumbilical, colicky type of pain, which tends to come and go. After 6 to 10 hours, the pain tends to localize in the right iliac fossa and becomes constant. Patients may develop a fever, nausea, and vomiting.

Examination of the patient reveals a tender right lower quadrant. Voluntary guarding is present initially, progressing to rigidity, then to rebound tenderness with rupture and peritonitis.

            "content": "A 45-year-old man with no significant medical history was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 10 days ago after suffering third-degree burns over 40% of his body. He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 55-year-old man noticed shortness of breath with exer-tion while on a camping vacation in a national park. He has a 15-year history of poorly controlled hypertension. The shortness of breath was accompanied by onset of swelling of the feet and ankles and increasing fatigue. On physical examination in the clinic, he is found to be mildly short of breath lying down but feels better sitting upright. Pulse is 100 bpm and regular, and blood pressure is 165/100 mm Hg. Crackles are noted at both lung bases, and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. The liver is enlarged, and there is 3+ edema of the ankles and feet. An echocardiogram shows an enlarged, poorly contracting heart with a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of about 30% (normal: 60%). The presumptive diagnosis is stage C, class III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. What treatment is indicated?"

Splenomegaly is found in ~50% of cases. Fever and leukocytosis are generally present; the development of fever preceded diagnosis by an average of 20 days in one series. Left-sided chest findings may include abnormalities to auscultation, and chest radiographic findings may include an infiltrate or a left-sided pleural effusion. CT scan of the abdomen has been the most sensitive diagnostic tool. Ultrasonography can yield the diagnosis but is less sensitive. Liver-spleen scan or gallium scan may also be useful. Streptococcal species are the most common bacterial isolates from splenic abscesses, followed by S. aureus\u2014presumably reflecting the associated endocarditis. An increase in the prevalence of gram-negative aerobic isolates from splenic abscesses has been reported; these organisms often derive from a urinary tract focus, with"

He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?"

In <25% of cases, patients may present with generalized peritonitis indicating the presence of a diverticular perforation. If a pericolonic abscess has formed, the patient may have abdominal distention and signs of localized peritonitis. Laboratory investigations will demonstrate a leukocytosis. Rarely, a patient may present with an air-fluid level in the left lower quadrant on plain abdominal film. This is a giant diverticulum of the sigmoid colon and is managed with resection to avoid impending perforation."
