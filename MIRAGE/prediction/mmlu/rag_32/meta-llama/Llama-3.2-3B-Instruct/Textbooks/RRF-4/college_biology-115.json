Irreversible inhibitors bind to enzymes through covalent bonds. Lead, for example, forms covalent bonds with the sulfhydryl side chain of cysteine in proteins. Ferrochelatase, an enzyme involved in heme synthesis (see p. 279), is irreversibly inhibited by lead. [Note: An important group of irreversible inhibitors are the mechanism-based inhibitors that are converted by the enzyme itself to a form that covalently links to the enzyme, thereby inhibiting it. They also are referred to as \u201csuicide\u201d inhibitors.] Reversible inhibitors bind to enzymes through noncovalent bonds and, thus, dilution of the enzyme\u2013inhibitor complex results in dissociation of the reversibly bound inhibitor and recovery of enzyme activity. The two most commonly encountered types of reversible inhibition are competitive and noncompetitive."

The noncompetitive inhibitor can bind either free enzyme or the enzyme\u2013substrate complex, thereby preventing the reaction from occurring (Fig. 5.15). 1. Effect on Vmax: Noncompetitive inhibition cannot be overcome by increasing the concentration of substrate. Therefore, noncompetitive inhibitors decrease the apparent Vmax of the reaction. 2. Effect on Km: Noncompetitive inhibitors do not interfere with the binding of substrate to enzyme. Therefore, the enzyme shows the same Km in the presence or absence of the noncompetitive inhibitor, that is, Km is unchanged. 3."

In addition, if identical receptors mediate both effects, a competitive antagonist will inhibit both responses with the same Ki; a second competitive antagonist will inhibit both responses with its own characteristic Ki.

This diagram illustrates how the conformation of one subunit can influence that of its neighbor. The binding of a single molecule of an inhibitory ligand (yellow) to one subunit of the enzyme occurs with difficulty because it changes the conformation of this subunit and thereby disrupts the symmetry of the enzyme. Once this conformational change has occurred, however, the energy gained by restoring the symmetric pairing interaction between the two subunits makes it especially easy for the second subunit to bind the inhibitory ligand and undergo the same conformational change. Because the binding of the first molecule of ligand increases the affinity with which the other subunit binds the same ligand, the response of the enzyme to changes in the concentration of the ligand is much steeper than the response of an enzyme with only one subunit (see Figure 3\u201359 and Movie 3.10)."

Responses of this type are apparently not sharp enough for optimal cell regulation, and most enzymes that are turned on or off by ligand binding consist of symmetric assemblies of identical subunits.

If the concentration of G increases (for example, because it is not used as rapidly as it is synthesized), the first irreversible step unique to the pathway is typically inhibited. Feedback inhibition provides the cell with appropriate amounts of a product it needs by regulating the flow of substrate molecules through the pathway that synthesizes that product. Heterotropic effectors are commonly encountered. For example, the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 is allosterically inhibited by citrate, which is not a substrate for the enzyme (see p. 99).

In such approaches, large collections of small chemical compounds are simultaneously tested, either on living cells or in cell-free assays. Once an inhibitor is identified, it can be used as a probe to identify, through affinity chromatography or other means, the protein to which the inhibitor binds. This general strategy, sometimes called chemical biology, has successfully identified inhibitors of many proteins that carry out key processes in cell biology. An inhibitor of a kinesin protein that functions in mitosis, for"

For example, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, by slowing the destruction of endogenous acetylcholine, cause cholinomimetic effects that closely resemble the actions of cholinoceptor agonist molecules even though cholinesterase inhibitors do not bind or only incidentally bind to cholinoceptors (see Chapter 7). Because they amplify the effects of physiologically released agonist ligands, their effects are sometimes more selective and less toxic than those of exogenous agonists. C. Agonists, Partial Agonists, and Inverse Agonists"
