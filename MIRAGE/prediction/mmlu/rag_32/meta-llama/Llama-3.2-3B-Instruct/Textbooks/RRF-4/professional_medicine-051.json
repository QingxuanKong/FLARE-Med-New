    "question": "A 73-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of diffuse weakness and tingling of her arms and legs. Neurologic examination shows weakness of the extensor and flexor muscles of the lower extremities. Knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes are exaggerated. Sensation to vibration and position is decreased in all extremities, but the decrease is more prominent in the lower extremities than in the upper extremities. This patient most likely has a deficiency of which of the following vitamins?",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the symptoms and examination findings presented in the scenario and correlate them with the potential vitamin deficiencies listed in the options. The patient presents with diffuse weakness and tingling of the arms and legs, weakness of the extensor and flexor muscles of the lower extremities, exaggerated knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes, and decreased sensation to vibration and position in all extremities but more prominent in the lower extremities. The clinical presentation is suggestive of a subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, which is a condition associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. This condition typically presents with weakness, spasticity, and sensory loss, particularly in the lower extremities, and is characterized by a loss of vibration and position sense. The exaggerated deep tendon reflexes and the presence of extensor plantar responses (Babinski sign) also support this diagnosis. The other options can be ruled out based on the following: * Vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency is associated with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which typically presents with confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia, not the symptoms described in this scenario. * Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) deficiency is associated with dermatitis, cheilosis, and corneal vascularization, not the neurological symptoms described. * Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) deficiency can cause peripheral neuropathy, but it typically presents with sensory symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and pain, especially in the feet, but not the combination of diffuse weakness, spasticity, and sensory loss seen in this patient. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a deficiency of vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), which is a well-established cause of subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord and presents with the symptoms and examination findings described in the scenario.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Later, examination discloses a disorder of the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord, predominantly of the former. Loss of vibration sense is the most consistent sign; it is more pronounced in the feet and legs than in the hands and arms and frequently extends over the trunk. Position sense is usually impaired in parallel. The motor signs, usually limited to the legs, include a mild symmetrical loss of strength in proximal limb muscles, spasticity, enhanced tendon reflexes, clonus, and extensor plantar responses. At first, the patellar and Achilles reflexes are diminished as frequently as they are increased; they may even be absent. This is most likely the result of a neuropathy due to multiple vitamin deficiencies as cases of pure cobalamin loss, for example due to nitrous oxide, almost never obliterate the tendon reflexes.

Symptoms of tingling of the extremities and tight band-like sensations around the trunk or limbs are commonly associated and are probably the result of involvement of the posterior columns of the spinal cord. The symptoms generally appear over hours or days, at times being so trifling that they are ignored, and other times coming on so acutely and prominently as to bring the patient urgently to the doctor. The resulting clinical syndromes vary from a mere dragging or poor control of one or both legs to a spastic or ataxic paraparesis. The tendon reflexes are retained and later become hyperactive with extensor plantar reflexes; varying degrees of deep and superficial sensory loss may be associated.

It is characterized by a steadily progressive, painless muscular weakness and modest atrophy, which is usually distal in the arms and both proximal and distal in the legs. In approximately 20 percent of cases, the disease begins with focal weakness of the quadriceps, finger or wrist flexors, or lower leg muscles on one or both sides, and gradually spreads to other muscle groups after many months or years. Selective weakness of the flexor pollicis longus is a particularly characteristic pattern of involvement, and isolated quadriceps weakness or neck extensor weakness should also bring the diagnosis to mind, although IBM is not the exclusive cause of these patterns. In most patients, the deltoids are spared and the thumb flexors are weak, the opposite pattern to PM and DM.

The entire leg or the quadriceps feels stiff and heavy and gives out quickly after exercise. Mobility of the ankle may be reduced, and the advancing toe of the shoe scrapes the floor. On examination, slight hypertonicity of the legs is usually more evident than weakness, and the tendon reflexes are increased (ankle jerks may not share in this change in the elderly). Although the patient may believe that only one leg is affected, it is commonly found that both plantar reflexes are extensor, the one on the side of the stiffer leg being more clearly so. Less often, both legs are equally affected. As the compression continues, walking becomes unsteady because of the addition of sensory ataxia."

            "content": "The peroneal and tibial nerves are the earliest and most severely affected. Most often, complaints begin in the preschool to early adolescent years, with weakness of the ankles and frequent tripping. Examination shows pes cavus deformity of the feet (high-arched feet), bilateral weakness of foot dorsiflexors, and normal sensation despite occasional complaints of paresthesia. Peripheral nerves can become markedly enlarged and may be palpable on exam. Progression of HMSN is slow, extending over years and decades. Eventually, patients develop weakness and atrophy of the entire lower legs and hands and mild to moderate sensory loss in the hands and feet. Some patients never have more than a mild foot deformity, loss of ankle reflexes, and electrophysiologic abnormalities. Others in the same family may be confined to a wheelchair and have difficulties performing everyday tasks with their hands."

            "content": "Symptoms of nervous system disease occur in the majority of patients with pernicious anemia and in most with B12 deficiency of other sources. The patient first notices mild general weakness and paresthesias consisting of tingling, \u201cpins and needles\u201d feelings, or other vaguely described sensations. The paresthesias involve the hands and feet, more often and first in the hands, and tend to be constant and steadily progressive and the source of much distress. As the illness progresses, the gait becomes unsteady and stiffness and weakness of the limbs, especially of the legs, develop. If the disease remains untreated, an ataxic paraplegia evolves with variable degrees of spasticity."

            "content": "A primarily neurologic problem may characterize the thoracic outlet syndrome. There is slight wasting and weakness of the hypothenar, interosseous, adductor pollicis, and deep flexor muscles of the fourth and fifth fingers (i.e., the muscles innervated by the lower trunk of the brachial plexus and ulnar nerve). Weakness of the flexor muscles of the forearm may be present in advanced cases. Tendon reflexes are usually preserved. In addition, most patients complain of an intermittent aching of the arm, particularly of the ulnar side, and about half of them complain also of numbness and tingling along the ulnar border of the forearm and hand. A loss of superficial sensation in these areas is variable. It may be possible to reproduce the sensory symptoms by firm pressure just above the clavicle or by traction on the arm. Vascular features are often absent or minimal in patients with the neurologic form of the syndrome."

            "content": "Peripheral neuropathy usually becomes clinically evident after the patient reaches stage 4 CKD, although electrophysiologic and histologic evidence occurs earlier. Initially, sensory nerves are involved more than motor, lower extremities more than upper, and distal parts of the extremities more than proximal. The \u201crestless leg syndrome\u201d is characterized by ill-defined sensations of sometimes debilitating discomfort in the legs and feet relieved by frequent leg movement. If dialysis is not instituted soon after onset of sensory abnormalities, motor involvement follows, including muscle weakness. Evidence of peripheral neuropathy without another cause (e.g., diabetes mellitus) is an indication for starting renal replacement therapy. Many of the complications described above will resolve with dialysis, although subtle nonspecific abnormalities may persist."

            "content": "Most patients, however, are symptomatic and have weakness, paresthesias, and pain as the usual complaints. The symptoms are insidious in onset and slowly progressive, but occasionally they seem to evolve or to worsen rapidly over a matter of days. The initial symptoms are usually referred to the distal portions of the limbs and progress proximally if the illness remains untreated. The feet are always affected earlier and more severely than the hands. Usually some aspect of motor disability is part of the chief complaint, but in about one-third of the patients the main complaints are pain and paresthesias. It is this painful syndrome that has been the most prominent feature in the patients we have encountered. The discomfort takes several forms: a dull, constant ache in the feet or legs; sharp and lancinating pains, momentary in duration, like those of tabes dorsalis; sensations of cramping or tightness in the muscles of the feet and calves; or band-like feelings around the legs."
