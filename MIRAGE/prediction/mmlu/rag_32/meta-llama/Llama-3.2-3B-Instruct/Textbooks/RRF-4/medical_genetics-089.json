Document [1] also mentions that the amniocentesis-related fetal loss rate is comparable to that of amniocentesis. Document [13] defines recurrent pregnancy loss as three or more consecutive pregnancy losses before 20 weeks' gestation or with a fetal weight less than 500 g, and notes that the risk for a subsequent miscarriage is similar whether following two or three prior pregnancy losses. However, Document [11] does not provide a specific risk for miscarriage associated with amniocentesis. However, Document [11] states that the amniocentesis procedure-related loss rate approximates 0.1 to 0.3 percent when performed by an experienced provider, which is roughly equivalent to 1 in 333 to 1 in 667.

Amniocentesis, which has been the most commonly used test to date, is usually performed between 15 and 17 weeks of gestational age and carries a small but significant risk for miscarriage. Amniocentesis can be performed as early as 12 weeks, but because there is a lower volume of fluid, the risks for fetal injury or miscarriage are greater. Chorionic villous sampling (CVS) or placental biopsy is routinely carried out earlier than amniocentesis, between 10 and 12 weeks, but a reported increase in limb defects when the procedure is carried out earlier than"

This is because of background spontaneous losses, that is, losses that would have occurred between the first and second trimester in the absence of a fetal procedure. he procedurerelated fetal loss rate is comparable with that of amniocentesis. Caughey and colleagues (2006) found that the overall loss rate following CVS was approximately 2 percent compared with less than 1 percent following amniocentesis. However, the adjusted procedure-related loss rate approximated 1 per 400 for either procedure. The indication for CVS will also afect the loss rate. For example, fetuses with increased NT thickness have a greater likelihood of demise. Finally, there is a learning curve associated with safe performance of CVS (Silver, 1990; Wijnberger, 2003)."

Among women with recurrent pregnancy loss who are age 35 or older, the aneuploidy rate is much higher (8). The majority of chromosomal abnormalities identified in miscarriages are autosomal trisomies and considered to result from maternal nondisjunction. Maternal age appears as a consistent and important risk factor for trisomy in the majority of studies. There are several options for patients who suffer from recurrent pregnancy loss who have an identified miscarriage due to trisomy. The first is to conceive again without any specific change in medical management, as these abnormalities are sporadic and unlikely to recur. Studies examining patients with recurrent pregnancy loss show that women who miscarry chromosomally abnormal conceptions are more likely to achieve a live birth with subsequent pregnancy"

Other complications of amniocentesis include amnionic fluid leakage or transient vaginal spotting in 1 to 2 percent. Following leakage of amnionic luid, which generally occurs within 48 hours of the procedure, fetal survival exceeds 90 percent (Borgida, 2000). Needle injuries to the fetus are rare. Amnionic fluid culture is successul in more than 99 percent of cases, although cells are less likely to grow if the fetus is abnormal (Persutte, 1995)."

With severe hydramnios, therapeutic amniocentesis may provide relief for the mother, may improve obstructive uropathy, and possibly may lower the preterm delivery risk that follows preterm labor or prematurely ruptured membranes. Unfortunately, hydramnios is often characterized by acute onset remote from term and by rapid reaccumulation despite amniocentesis. Miscarriage is more likely with multifetal gestation. In one 16-year study, the spontaneous abortion rate per live birth in singleton pregnancies was 0.9 percent compared with 7.3 percent in multifetal ones (Joo, 2012). Also, twins achieved through ART are at greater risk for abortion compared with those conceived spontaneously (Szymusik, 2012)."

However, it may not be clinically signiicant because it often does not relect the actual embryonic chromosomal complement. In addition, among women 35 years or older, pregnancy rates following PGS with FISH are significantly lower than rates observed following IVF without PGS (Mastenbroek, 2007,2011). Because the number of chromosome pairs per cell nucleus that can be evaluated with FISH is limited, more recent eforts have focused on the use of chromosomal comprehensive screening with CMA (Dahdouh, 2015).

Occasionally, severe hydramnios may result in early preterm labor or the development of maternal respiratory compromise. In such cases, large-volume amniocentesis-termed amnioreduction-may be needed. he technique is similar to that for genetic amniocentesis, described in Chapter 14 (p. 292). One diference is that it is generally done with a larger needle, 18-or 20-gauge, and uses either an evacuated container bottle or a larger syringe. Approximately 1000 to 2000 mL of luid is slowly withdrawn over 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the severity of hydramnios and gestational age. he goal is to restore amnionic fluid volume to the upper normal range. Hydramnios severe enough to necessitate amnioreduction almost invariably has an underlying cause, and subsequent amnioreduction procedures may be required as oten as weekly or even semiweekly."

Fetal blood sampling (percutaneous umbilical blood sampling [PUBS]) is a riskier procedure that is carried out in the second or third trimester of pregnancy, usually to follow up on an unclear finding from an amniocentesis (such as mosaicism) or an ultrasound abnormality that was detected later in pregnancy. One of the far-reaching recent advances in prenatal diagnosis of chromosome and other genetic disorders is the utilization of cell free fetal DNA that can be identified in maternal serum. The obvious advantages of using fetal DNA obtained from maternal serum is that the DNA can be obtained at minimal risk to the pregnancy, because it requires a maternal blood sample, rather than amniotic fluid which is obtained by puncturing the uterine membranes and carries a risk of miscarriage or infection. Although cell free fetal DNA screening, also called noninvasive prenatal"

            "content": "Selected anomalies and the likely mechanism by which they cause hydramnios are shown in Table 11-3. Many of these abnormalities are depicted and discussed in Chapter 10. Because of this association, targeted sonography is indicated whenever hydramnios is identiied. If a fetal abnormality is encountered concurrent with hydramnios, amniocentesis with chromosomal microarray analysis should be ofered, because the aneuploidy risk is signiicantly elevated (Dashe, 2002; Pri-Paz, 2012)."

            "content": "Rarely, in some twin pregnancies, one chromosomally normal fetus is paired with a complete diploid molar pregnancy. Importantly, these cases must be distinguished from a single partial molar pregnancy with its associated abnormal fetus. Amniocentesis and fetal karyotyping aid confirmation. Several unique pregnancy problems complicate such twin pregnancies. And, many women may choose to terminate the gestation, if diagnosed early. In those with continuing pregnancy, survival of the normal fetus varies and depends on associated comorbidity from the molar component. The most worrisome are preeclampsia or hemorrhage, which frequently necessitate preterm delivery. Wee and Jauniaux (2005) reviewed outcomes in 174 women, of whom 82 chose termination. Of the remaining 92 pregnancies, 42 percent either miscarried or had a perinatal death; approximately 60 percent delivered preterm; and only 40 percent delivered at term."
