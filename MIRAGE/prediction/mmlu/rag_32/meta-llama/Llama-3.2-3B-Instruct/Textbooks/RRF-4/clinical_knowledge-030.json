Schober's test is a clinical test used to assess the flexibility of the lumbar spine.\\n\\nOption C: Ankylosing spondylitis is a cause of hypermobility of the spine - This is incorrect. Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis that can cause stiffness and rigidity of the spine, rather than hypermobility.\\n\\nOption D: Pregnancy is a cause of loss of lordosis of the lumbar spine - This is incorrect. Pregnancy can actually cause an increase in lordosis of the lumbar spine due to the weight gain and changes in posture.\\n\\nSo, the correct answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Up to 80 percent of adults have low back pain at some time in their lives and, according to Kelsey and White, an even larger percentage will be found at autopsy to have degenerative disc disease. The diagnosis of pain in these parts of the body often requires the assistance of a neurologist. One task is to determine whether a disease of the spine has compressed the spinal cord or the spinal roots. To do this effectively, a clear understanding of the structures involved and some knowledge of orthopedics and rheumatology is necessary."

Industrial accidents most often involved the thoracolumbar vertebrae. Impact to the head with the neck flexed or sharply retroflexed, as mentioned earlier, was the main cause of injuries to the cervical region. These are not only the most mobile portions of the vertebral column but also the regions in which the cervical and lumbar enlargements of the cord greatly reduce the space between neural and bony structures. The thoracic cord is relatively small and its spinal canal is capacious; additional protection is provided by the high and overlapping articular facets, making dislocation difficult, and by limitations in anterior displacement"

As a result, the spinal cord does not extend the entire length of the vertebral canal (Fig. 2.11). In the adult, the spinal cord typically ends between vertebrae LI and LII, although it can end as high as vertebra TXII and as low as the disc between vertebrae LII and LIII. Spinal nerves originate from the spinal cord at increasingly oblique angles from vertebrae CI to Co, and the nerve roots pass in the vertebral canal for increasingly longer distances. Their spinal cord level of origin therefore becomes increasingly dissociated from their vertebral column level of exit. This is particularly evident for lumbar and sacral spinal nerves. Each spinal nerve exits the vertebral canal laterally through an intervertebral foramen (Fig. 2.12). The foramen is formed between adjacent vertebral arches and is closely related to intervertebral joints:"

All the interest was in the acute ruptured disc. Finally, it was Russell Brain who, in 1948, put cervical spondylosis on the neurologic map, so to speak. He drew a distinction between acute rupture and protrusion of the cervical disc (often traumatic and more likely to compress the nerve roots than the spinal cord) and chronic spinal cord and root compression consequent to disc degeneration and associated osteophytic outgrowths (hard disc), as well as changes in the surrounding joints and ligaments. In 1957, Payne and Spillane documented the importance of a developmentally smaller-than-normal spinal canal in the genesis of myelopathy in patients with cervical spondylosis.

            "content": "Congenital Anomalies of the Lumbar Spine Anatomic variations of the spine are frequent and, though infrequently themselves the source of pain and functional derangement, they predispose an individual to discogenic and spondylotic complications by virtue of altering the mechanics and alignment of the vertebrae, joints, or size of the spinal canal or by giving rise to traumatic fractures of the pedicles. Congenital scoliosis in particular is a complex matter in relation to secondary spinal disease and entire textbooks have been devoted to the analysis of this subject. It is not therefore discussed here except to point out that there is no obligatory relationship between mild degrees of scoliosis that carries over into adulthood and back derangements, and further that some instances of scoliosis occur in parallel with congenital anomalies of the spine and base of the brain such as Chiari malformation and syringomyelia."

LT-\u03b1 can substitute for CD40 ligand in macrophage activation C. TNFR-I activation is antagonized by activated TH1 cells D. Macrophages are sensitized to IFN-\u03b3 by small amounts of bacterial LPS 11.6 Short Answer: How do M2 macrophages stimulate collagen production in order to promote tissue repair? 11.7 Multiple Choice: Which of the following is not true concerning type 3 responses? A. The primary innate effector cells are neutrophils, which are recruited by CXCL8 and CXCL2 and have an increased output due to G-CSF and GM-CSF B. At homeostasis, TH17 cells are present almost exclusively in the intestinal mucosa C. IL-17 is the central cytokine D. IL-22 is produced to induce antimicrobial peptide production and epithelial cell proliferation and shedding of natural killer cells"

            "content": "Neck pain, which usually arises from diseases of the cervical spine and soft tissues of the neck, is common. Neck pain arising from the cervical spine is typically precipitated by movement and may be accompanied by focal tenderness and limitation of motion. Many of the prior com-121 ments made regarding causes of low back pain also apply to disorders of the cervical spine. The text below will emphasize differences. Pain arising from the brachial plexus, shoulder, or peripheral nerves can be confused with cervical spine disease (Table 22-4), but the history and examination usually identify a more distal origin for the pain. Cervical spine trauma, disk disease, or spondylosis with intervertebral foraminal narrowing may be asymptomatic or painful and can produce a myelopathy, radiculopathy, or both. The same risk factors for serious causes of low back pain also apply to neck pain with the additional feature that neurologic signs of myelopathy (incontinence, sensory level, spastic legs)"
