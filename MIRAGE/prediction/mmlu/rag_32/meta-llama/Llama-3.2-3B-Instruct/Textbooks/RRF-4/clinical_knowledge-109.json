Platelet concentrates, which are stored at room temperature, are more likely to contain skin contaminants such as gram-positive organisms, including coagulase-negative staphylococci.\" However, this document does not provide information about the storage time for blood units. Document [2] also states that \"typically, the transfused unit has been stored for >20 days, and it is believed that small numbers of yersiniae from an apparently healthy donor with subclinical bacteremia are amplified to very high numbers by growth inside the bag at \u22644\u00b0C, with consequent septic shock after transfusion.\" This suggests that blood units should not be stored at room temperature for extended periods. Document [12] states that \"Hypothermia Refrigerated (4\u00b0C) or frozen (-18\u00b0C or below) blood components can result in hypothermia when rapidly infused.\" This suggests that blood units should be stored in the refrigerator at a temperature below 4\u00b0C.

Most donated blood is processed into components: PRBCs, platelets, and fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) or cryoprecipitate (Table 138e-2). Whole blood is first separated into PRBCs and platelet-rich plasma by slow centrifugation. The platelet-rich plasma is then centrifuged at high speed to yield one unit of random donor (RD) platelets and one unit of FFP. Cryoprecipitate is produced by thawing FFP to precipitate the plasma proteins and then separated by centrifugation. Apheresis technology is used for the collection of multiple units of platelets from a single donor. These single-donor apheresis platelets (SDAP) contain the equivalent of at least six units of RD platelets and have fewer contaminating leukocytes than pooled RD platelets."

Plasma derivatives such as albumin, intravenous immunoglobulin, antithrombin, and coagulation factor concentrates are prepared from pooled plasma from many donors and are treated to eliminate infectious agents. Whole blood provides both oxygen-carrying capacity and volume expansion. It is the ideal component for patients who have sustained acute hemorrhage of \u226525% total blood volume loss. Whole blood is stored at 4\u00b0C to maintain erythrocyte viability, but platelet dysfunction and degradation of some coagulation factors occurs. In addition, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate levels fall over time, leading to an increase in the oxygen affinity of the hemoglobin and a decreased capacity to deliver oxygen to the tissues, a problem with all red cell storage. Fresh whole blood avoids these problems, but it is typically used only in emergency settings (i.e., military). Whole blood is not readily available, because it is routinely processed into components."

            "content": "Of serious known risks, transfusion of an incompatible blood component may result in acute hemolysis. If severe, this can cause DIC, acute kidney injury, and death. Preventable errors responsible for most of such reactions frequently include mislabeling of a specimen or incorrectly transfusing a patient not slated for those products. The rate of such errors in the United States is estimated to be 1 in 14,000 units, but these events are likely underreported (Lerner, 2010). A transfusion reaction is characterized by fever, hypotension, tachycardia, dyspnea, chest or back pain, lushing, severe anxiety, and hemoglobinuria. Immediate supportive measures include stopping the transfusion, treating hypotension and hyperkalemia, provoking diuresis, and alkalinizing the urine."

One key advantage of whole blood ver-sus component therapy is that platelets are often unavailable in the remote and austere settings. Two retrospective studies of military casualties treated at a combat support hospital and forward surgical teams found that whole blood was associated with improved survival compared to component (plasma and RBC) therapy.137,138 Whole blood has higher hematocrit, clotting factor activity, and platelet count compared to 1:1:1 component therapy due to relatively less diluent volume in whole blood. During the Vietnam War, low anti-A and anti-B titer whole blood was transfused universally with a low incidence of hemo-lytic reactions (1 per 9600 units).139 An in vitro study found that the hemostatic potential of whole blood was preserved for up to 14 days with cold storage.140 Pilot trials have reported success-ful use of"

Once sampling is completed, the needle is capped and the syringe transported, on ice, to the laboratory. Although eforts should be made for prompt transport, neither the pH nor partial pressure of CO2 (pC02) values change significantly in blood kept at room temperature for up to 60 minutes (Lynn, 2007). Mathematical models have been developed that allow reasonable prediction of birth acid-base status in properly collected cord blood samples analyzed as late as 60 hours after delivery (Chauhan, 1994). Acid-base measurements can show signiicant variances between diferent analyzing devices (vlokarami,r2012)."

In patients known to have clinically significant cold agglutinins, blood should be administered through a blood warmer. If these antibodies are present in high titer, hypother-mia is contraindicated.In patients who have been multiply transfused and who have developed alloantibodies or who have autoimmune hemo-lytic anemia with pan-red blood cell antibodies, typing and crossmatching is often difficult, and sufficient time should be allotted preoperatively to accumulate blood that might be required during the operation. Crossmatching should always be performed before the administration of dextran because it inter-feres with the typing procedure.81aBanked Whole Blood. Interest in whole blood as an ideal therapy for acute traumatic hemorrhagic shock has increased in the last several years with multiple reports of successful use in military and civilian trauma patients."
