    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the symptoms and test results provided and match them with the potential diagnoses. The patient has a 6-month history of progressive irritability, palpitations, heat intolerance, frequent bowel movements, and a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss. She has had a neck mass for more than 10 years. The 131I scan shows an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake. This suggests a multinodular goiter, which is a condition where multiple nodules form in the thyroid gland. Graves' disease (B) is a condition that causes hyperthyroidism, which is characterized by an enlarged thyroid gland, but the 131I scan results do not support this diagnosis. A defect in thyroxine (T4) biosynthesis (A) is a condition that affects the production of thyroid hormones, but it does not typically cause a multinodular goiter. Riedel's thyroiditis (D) is a condition that causes inflammation of the thyroid gland, but it does not typically cause a multinodular goiter. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is C. Multinodular goiter, which is a common condition that can cause a multinodular goiter and the symptoms described in the patient's history. The presence of multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake on the 131I scan further supports this diagnosis, as it is consistent with the presence of multiple nodules in the thyroid gland. In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis is Multinodular goiter, which is a common condition that can cause a multinodular goiter and the symptoms described in the patient's history.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Some patients inevitably relapse after a single dose because the biologic effects of radiation vary between individuals, and hypothyroidism cannot be uniformly avoided even using accurate dosimetry. A practical strategy is to give a fixed dose based on clinical features, such as the severity of thyrotoxicosis, the size of the goiter (increases the dose needed), and the level of radioiodine uptake (decreases the dose needed). 131I dosage generally ranges between 370 MBq (10 mCi) and 555 MBq (15 mCi).

Scintigraphy is the preferred diagnostic test; however, TRAb measurement can be used to assess autoimmune activity. In secondary hyperthyroidism due to a 2296 TSH-secreting pituitary tumor, there is also a diffuse goiter.

There may be an overlying bruit or thrill over the thyroid gland and a loud venous hum in the supraclavicular space.Diagnostic Tests. The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is made by a suppressed TSH with or without an elevated free T4 or T3 level. If eye signs are present, other tests are generally not needed. However, in the absence of eye findings, an 123I uptake and scan should be performed. An elevated uptake, with a dif-fusely enlarged gland, confirms the diagnosis of Graves\u2019 disease and helps to differentiate it from other causes of hyperthyroid-ism. Technetium scintigraphy (using pertechnetate, which is trapped by the thyroid, but not organified) can also be used to determine etiology. While technetium scans result in low range of normal uptake and high background activity, total-body radi-ation exposure is less than that of 123I scans. If free T4 levels are normal, free T3"

            "content": "Thyrotoxicosis is usually mild. The disorder is suggested by a subnormal TSH level; the presence of the thyroid nodule, which is generally large enough to be palpable; and the absence of clinical features suggestive of Graves\u2019 disease or other causes of thyrotoxicosis. A thyroid scan provides a definitive diagnostic test, demonstrating focal uptake in the hyperfunctioning nodule and diminished uptake in the remainder of the gland, as activity of the normal thyroid is suppressed."

In children and young adults, the most common cause is the presence of a piriform sinus, a remnant of the fourth branchial pouch that connects the oropharynx with the thyroid. Such sinuses are predominantly left-sided. A long-standing goiter and degeneration in a thyroid malignancy are risk factors in the elderly. The patient presents with thyroid pain, often referred to the throat or ears, and a small, tender goiter that may be asym-metric.

            "content": "In the clinic Most cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, larynx, sinuses, and salivary glands arise from the epithelial cells that line them, resulting in squamous cell carcinoma. The majority of these are related to cell damage caused by smoking and alcohol use. Certain viruses are also related to cancers in the head and neck, including human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). A 50-year-old overweight woman came to the doctor complaining of hoarseness of voice and noisy breathing. She was also concerned at the increase in size of her neck. On examination she had a slow pulse rate (45 beats per minute). She also had an irregular knobby mass in the anterior aspect of the lower neck, which deviated the trachea to the right. A clinical diagnosis of a multinodular goiter and hypothyroidism was made."

Toxic adenomas appear as focal areas of increased uptake, with suppressed tracer uptake in the remainder of the gland. In toxic MNG, the gland is enlarged\u2014often with distorted architecture\u2014and there are multiple areas of relatively increased (functioning nodules) or decreased tracer uptake (suppressed thyroid parenchyma or nonfunctioning nodules). Subacute, viral, and postpartum thyroiditis are associated with very low uptake because of follicular cell damage and TSH suppression. Thyrotoxicosis factitia is also associated with low uptake. In addition, if there is excessive circulating exogenous iodine (e.g., from dietary sources of iodinated contrast dye), the radionuclide uptake is low even in the presence of increased thyroid hormone production."

In young patients there may be paradoxical weight gain from an increased appetite. Thyrotoxicosis may cause vomiting in pregnant women, which may be confused with hyperemesis gravidarum (50). Tachycardia, lid lag, tremor, proximal muscle weakness, and warm moist skin are classic physical findings. The most dramatic physical changes are ophthalmologic and include lid retraction, periorbital edema, and proptosis. These eye findings occur in less than one-third of women. In elderly adults, symptoms are often more subtle, with presentations of unexplained weight loss, atrial fibrillation, or new onset angina pectoris.
