    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's consider the physiological changes that occur during high-intensity exercise, particularly intermittent exercise. During high-intensity exercise, the body's primary energy source is glucose, which is metabolized rapidly in the muscles. However, the liver also plays a crucial role in maintaining blood glucose levels by releasing glucose through gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. The key point to consider is that during high-intensity exercise, the body's energy demands are high, and the liver works to maintain blood glucose levels by releasing glucose into the bloodstream. This process is often referred to as the 'glucose counter-regulatory response.' The glucose concentration during high-intensity exercise is typically maintained within a narrow range, and it is unlikely to fall to hypoglycemic levels during 80-90 minutes of exercise, especially in individuals with normal glucose metabolism. In fact, studies have shown that glucose levels may actually rise during intense exercise due to the increased glucose counter-regulatory response. Therefore, option D is incorrect. Option A suggests that glucose levels rise by 1-3 mM, which is consistent with the glucose counter-regulatory response during high-intensity exercise. Options B and C are incorrect because they suggest that glucose levels remain unchanged or fall, respectively, which is not typically observed during high-intensity exercise. Based on the physiological responses to high-intensity exercise, the most likely answer is option A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

A primary way by which insulin promotes glucose tolerance is activation of glucose transporters in skeletal muscle. Insulin stimulates translocation of preexisting GLUT4 transporters to the cell membrane (reaction 1D). Insulin also promotes storage of glucose in muscle as glycogen (reaction 2D) and promotes oxidation of glucose through glycolysis (reaction 3D). During the fasting phase, low insulin results in a low number of GLUT4 transporters at the membrane (reaction 1F), so these cells consume less glucose (glucose sparing). Skeletal muscle fibers with mitochondria switch to the use of FFAs from adipocytes and KBs from hepatocytes (reaction 3F). Skeletal myocytes do not express glucagon receptors.

Skeletal muscle is a major site for metabolic fuel consumption in the resting state, and the increased muscle activity during vigorous, aerobic exercise greatly increases fuel requirements. Individuals with type 1 DM are prone to either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia during exercise, depending on the preexercise plasma glucose, the circulating insulin level, and the level of exercise-induced catecholamines. If the insulin level is too low, the rise in catecholamines may increase the plasma glucose excessively, promote ketone body formation, and possibly lead to ketoacidosis. Conversely, if the circulating insulin level is excessive, this relative hyperinsulinemia may reduce hepatic glucose production (decreased glycogenolysis, decreased gluconeogenesis) and increase glucose entry into muscle,"

As stated earlier, the circumstances during exercise are somewhat different. During a short period of intense exercise, the muscle uses carbohydrate derived from glycogen stores; myophosphorylase is the enzyme that initiates the metabolism of glycogen. With longer aerobic exercise, blood flow to muscle and the availability of glucose and fatty acids are increased. At first, glucose is the main source of energy during exercise; later, with exhaustion of glycogen stores, energy is provided by oxidation of fatty acids. Thus, muscle failure at a certain phase of exercise is predictive of the type of energy failure.

Glucose levels are checked hourly using a bedside meter allowing for adjustment in the insulin or glucose infusion rate. Regular (short-acting) insulin is administered by intravenous infusion at a rate of 1n.25 U/h if glucose levels exceed 100 mg/dL. Data from Coustan DR. Delivery: timing, mode, and management. In: Reece EA, Coustan DR, Gabbe SG, editors. Diabetes in women: adolescence, pregnancy, and menopause. 3rd ed. Philadelphia (PA): Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 2004; and Jovanovic L, Peterson CM.

According to the most recent data from the GBD project, mean fasting plasma glucose levels have increased globally between 1980 and 2008. An estimated 346 million people worldwide have diabetes. The International Diabetes Foundation predicts that this number will reach 522 million by 2030, a yearly rate of growth that is higher than that of the world\u2019s adult population. Nearly 50% of people with diabetes are undiagnosed, and 80% live in LMICs. The highest regional prevalence for diabetes occurs in the Middle East and North Africa, where an estimated 12.5% of the adult population has diabetes. Future growth will also largely occur in this region, along with other LMICs in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. There appear to be clear genetic susceptibilities to diabetes mellitus of"

            "content": "Several large-scale prospective studies have convincingly demonstrated that the microvascular complications, and the associated morbidity and mortality, from diabetes are attenuated by strict glycemic control. For patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin replacement therapy is the mainstay of treatment, while nonpharmacologic approaches such as dietary restrictions and exercise (which improves insulin sensitivity) are often the \u201cfirst line of defense\u201d for type 2 diabetes. Most patients with type 2 diabetes eventually require therapeutic intervention to reduce hyperglycemia. Glycemic control is assessed clinically by measuring the percentage of glycosylated hemoglobin, also known as HbA1C, which is formed by nonenzymatic addition of glucose moieties to hemoglobin in red cells. Unlike blood glucose levels, HbA1C is a measure of glycemic control over long periods of time (2\u20133 months) and is relatively unaffected by day-to-day variations. The ADA recommends maintenance of HbA1C levels at"

            "content": "Treatment The main treatment is a planned reduction and intermittency in physical activity. Sucrose, taken as 75 g in a beverage, has been shown by Vissing and Haller to cause a short-lived improvement in exercise tolerance, and they propose that exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis can be avoided by a well-timed drink. Fructose and creatine taken orally are also said to be helpful in some cases, but the reported results are not as impressive as they are for sucrose. Improvement has also been described after the administration of glucagon (Kono et al) and with a high-protein diet (Slonim and Goans), but these effects are not consistent. Other Forms of Glycogenosis (See Table 45-5)"
