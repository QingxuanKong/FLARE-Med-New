    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with complaints of a pounding heart, poor sleep, and a generalized feeling of restlessness. He has recently experienced a significant life change with the relocation for a promotion, which may have contributed to his symptoms. The patient's worries about his ability to adapt to his increased responsibility at work and his recent absenteeism from work are also relevant to the diagnosis. The patient's symptoms of poor sleep and restlessness are common symptoms of anxiety disorders. Adjustment disorder with anxious mood is a diagnosis that is often considered in cases where an individual experiences significant life changes and develops emotional or behavioral symptoms as a result. Major depressive disorder is also a possibility, but the patient's symptoms do not appear to be severe enough to meet the diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms do not appear to be driven by obsessive or compulsive behaviors. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is adjustment disorder with anxious mood.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Information from a bed partner or family member is often helpful because some patients may be unaware of symptoms such as heavy snoring or may underreport symptoms such as falling asleep at work or while driving. Physicians should inquire about when the patient typically goes to bed, when they fall asleep and wake up, whether they awaken during sleep, whether they feel rested in the morning, and whether they nap during the day. Depending on the primary complaint, it may be useful to ask about snoring, witnessed apneas, restless sensations in the legs, movements during sleep, depression, anxiety, and behaviors around the sleep episode.

Case 4: Hypoglycemia, Hyperketonemia, and Liver Dysfunction Patient Presentation: AK, a 59-year-old male with slurred speech, ataxia (loss of skeletal muscle coordination), and abdominal pain, was dropped off at the Emergency Department (ED). Focused History: AK is known to the ED staff from previous visits. He has a 6year history of chronic, excessive alcohol consumption. He is not known to take illicit drugs.

Individuals with hobbies, nonwork interests, and athletic pursuits seem to be less subject to this problem. A common problem in diagnosis, however, is to ascribe fatigue to overwork when actually it is a manifestation of anxiety or depression, as described just below."

Following a sleepless night with significant dyspnea, the patient develops nausea and vomiting and collapses. He presents to the emergency department in cardiac arrest and is unable to be resuscitated. His autopsy shows a posterior wall myocardial infarction and a fresh thrombus in an atherosclerotic right coronary artery. What went wrong? The clinician had decided, based on the patient\u2019s appearance, even before starting the history, that the patient\u2019s complaints were not serious. Therefore, he felt confident that he could perform an abbreviated and focused examination by using the URI assessment protocol rather than considering the broader range of possibilities and performing appropriate tests to confirm or refute his initial hypotheses. In particular, by concentrating on the URI, the clinician failed to elicit the full dyspnea history, which would have"

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."
