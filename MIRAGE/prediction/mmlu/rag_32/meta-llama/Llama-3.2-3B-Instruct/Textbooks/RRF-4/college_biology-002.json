The question asks about the fluid secreted by the embryo to prevent desiccation and injury. Let's analyze each option given: A. amnion: The amnion is a membrane that encloses the embryo and fetus in the uterus, providing a protective environment and allowing for the exchange of gases and fluids. However, it is not directly responsible for secreting a fluid to prevent desiccation and injury. B. chorion: The chorion is a membrane that surrounds the embryo outside of the amnion, providing additional protection. Like the amnion, it does not secrete a fluid to prevent desiccation and injury. C. allantois: The allantois is a structure that develops in the early embryo and is involved in the formation of the urinary bladder and the umbilical cord. It also produces a fluid that can help to regulate the embryo's water balance and provide nutrients. This fluid is a possible candidate for preventing desiccation and injury. D. yolk sac: The yolk sac is a structure that provides nutrients to the embryo before the placenta develops. While it does contain nutrients, it is not directly involved in secreting a fluid to prevent desiccation and injury. Based on the analysis, the structure that secretes a fluid to prevent desiccation and injury is the allantois. The allantois produces a fluid that can help to regulate the embryo's water balance and provide nutrients, which can help to prevent desiccation and injury. answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

The first two cleavages take about 2 days, and the embryo reaches a 16-cell morula by 3 days. The outer cells of the morula become tightly adhesive with each other and begin transporting fluid into the embryonic mass. During days 4 and 5 the transport of fluid generates a cavity called the blastocyst cavity, and the embryo is now called a blas Fig. 44.33 ). The blastocyst is composed of two subpopulations of cells: an eccentric inner cell mass and an outer epithelial-like layer of trophoblasts. The region of the trophoblast layer immediately adjacent to the inner cell mass is referred to as the embryonic pole, and it is this region that attaches to the uterine endometrium at Fig. 44.33"

After fertilization, the zygote usually divides rapidly, or cleaves, to form many smaller cells; during this cleavage, the embryo, which cannot yet feed, does not grow. This phase of development is initially driven and controlled entirely by the material deposited in the egg by the mother. The embryonic genome remains inactive until a point is reached when maternal mRNAs and proteins rather abruptly begin to be degraded. The embryo\u2019s genome is activated, and the cells cohere to form a blastula\u2014typically a solid or a hollow fluid-filled ball of cells. Complex cell rearrangements called gastrulation (from the Greek \u201cgaster,\u201d meaning \u201cbelly\u201d) then transform the blastula into a multilayered structure containing a rudimentary internal gut (Figure 21\u20133).

Predatory amoebae crawl continuously in search of food, and they can easily be observed to attack and devour smaller ciliates and flagellates in a drop of pond water (see Movie 1.4). In animals, almost all cell locomotion occurs by crawling, with the notable exception of swimming sperm. During embryogenesis, the structure of an animal is created by the migrations of individual cells to specific target locations and by the coordinated movements of whole epithelial sheets (discussed in Chapter 21). In vertebrates, neural crest cells are remarkable for their long-distance migrations from their site of origin in the neural tube to a variety of sites throughout the embryo (see Movie 21.5). Long-distance crawling is fundamental to the construction of the entire nervous system: it is in this way that the actin-rich growth cones at the advancing tips of developing axons travel to their eventual synaptic"

Capture the cumulus-oocyte complex at ovulation and transfer the complex to a midway point (the ampullary-isthmus junction), where fertilization takes place. Oviductal secretions coat and infuse the cumulusoocyte complex and are likely required for viability and fertilizability. 2. Provide a site for sperm storage. Women who ovulate up to 5 days after sexual intercourse can get pregnant. Sperm remain viable by adhering to the epithelial cells lining the isthmus. The secretions of the oviduct also induce capacitation and hyperactivity of sperm. 3. Secrete fluids that provide nutritional support to the preimplantation embryo. The timing of movement of the embryo into the uterus is critical because the uterus has an implantation window of about 3 days. The oviduct needs to hold the early embryo until it reaches the blastocyst stage (5 days after fertilization) and then allow it to pass into the uterine cavity."

These epithelia provide both physical and chemical barriers to invasion by pathogens: tight junctions between epithelial cells bar entry between the cells, and a variety of substances secreted by the cells discourage the attachment and entry of pathogens. The keratinized epithelial cells of the skin, for example, form a thick physical barrier, and the sebaceous glands in the skin secrete fatty acids and lactic acid, which inhibit bacterial growth. In addition, epithelial cells in all tissues, including those in plants and invertebrates, secrete antimicrobial molecules called defensins. Defensins are positively charged, amphipathic peptides that bind to and disrupt the membranes of many pathogens, including enveloped viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites."

These diverse cell types are organized into tissues and organs, forming a sheet of skin covering the exterior, a mouth for feeding, and an internal gut tube to digest food\u2014with muscles, nerves, and other tissues arranged in the space between the skin and the gut tube. Many animals have clearly defined axes\u2014an anteroposterior axis, with mouth and brain anterior and anus posterior; a dorsoventral axis, with back dorsal and belly ventral; and a left-right axis.

These antagonize the action of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs; members of yet another subclass of the TGF\u03b2 family), which themselves are secreted throughout the embryo. In this way, Chordin and Noggin form a dorsal-to-ventral gradient that blocks BMP signaling on the dorsal side but allows it to remain high on the ventral side (Figure 21\u201330B).

A basal lamina lies at the interface with the underlying tissue, mediating the attachment, while the apical surface of the epithelium is generally bathed by extracellular fluid. Thus, all epithelia are structurally polarized, and so are their individual cells: the basal end of a cell, adherent to the basal lamina below, differs from the apical end, exposed to the medium above. Correspondingly, all epithelia have at least one function in common: they serve as selective permeability barriers, separating the fluid that permeates the tissue on their basal side from fluid with a different chemical composition on their apical side. This barrier function requires that the adjacent cells be sealed together by tight junctions, so that molecules cannot leak freely across the cell sheet."

Affected individuals make antibodies against one of their own desmosomal cadherin proteins. These antibodies bind to and disrupt the desmosomes that hold their epidermal cells (keratinocytes) together. This results in a severe blistering of the skin, with leakage of body fluids into the loosened epithelium. Sheets of epithelial cells enclose and partition the animal body, lining all its surfaces and cavities, and creating internal compartments where specialized processes occur. The epithelial sheet seems to be one of the inventions that lie at the origin of animal evolution, diversifying in a huge variety of ways but retaining an organization based on a set of conserved molecular mechanisms."

Early theories proposed that amniarterial pressure is 65 mm Hg (Society for Maternal-Fetal onic fluid and debris entered maternal circulation and obstructed pulmonary artery flow, which led to hypoxia, right heart failure, and death. However, during normal delivery, amnionic fluid commonly enters the maternal circulation through venous channels at the placental implantation site or from small lacerations. Accordingly, squames, fetal cells, and trophoblasts can oten be identiied in maternal peripheral blood at delivery (Clark, 1986; Lee, 1986). And, infused amnionic luid is generally innocuous, even in large amounts (Adamsons, 1971; Stolte, 1967)."

            "content": "Skin grafts are secured with staples, sutures, fibrin glue, or even skin glue. It is important to bolster every skin graft. This prevents shearing loss and also keeps the skin graft in contact with the wound bed, preventing fluid collections that can lead to graft loss. A bol-ster may consist of a tie-over bolster and a splint or a negativepressure dressing. The hand should be splinted in intrinsic plus for 7 days after skin grafting. Once the graft is adherent, hand therapy should begin, consisting of active and passive range-of-motion exercises and modalities.103ReconstructionReconstruction of burn wounds can begin as early as the acute setting and continue into the subacute and late stages. Burns may initially be superficial but later convert to deep burns (especially with grease, oil, and alkali burns) due to infection, tissue desiccation, or continued trauma, or they may be deep from the outset of injury. Debridement or excision of burns may result in exposure of viable muscle,"
