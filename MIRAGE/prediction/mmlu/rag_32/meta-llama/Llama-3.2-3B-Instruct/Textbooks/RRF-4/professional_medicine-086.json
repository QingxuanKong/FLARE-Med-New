The patient is a healthy 4-year-old girl, which means we should consider congenital heart defects that are more common in children. 2. A grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is heard along the upper left sternal border, which suggests increased blood flow across the pulmonary valve. 3. S2 is widely split and does not vary with respiration, which is a characteristic of a left-to-right shunt, such as an atrial septal defect (ASD). 4. A soft mid-diastolic murmur is heard along the lower left sternal border, which could indicate increased flow across the tricuspid valve due to the shunt. 5. The absence of other abnormalities on examination suggests that the defect is likely small and not causing significant hemodynamic compromise. Considering these points, the most likely diagnosis is an atrial septal defect (ASD), which is a common congenital heart defect in children that can cause a left-to-right shunt and lead to the observed findings.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Give indomethacin unless the PDA is needed for survival (e.g., transposition of the great vessels, tetralogy of Fallot, hypoplastic left heart) or if indomethacin is contraindicated (e.g., intraventricular hemorrhage). If indomethacin fails or if the child is > 6\u20138 months of age, surgical closure is required. In Eisenmenger\u2019s syndrome, left-to-right shunt leads to pulmonary hypertension and shunt reversal. In infants presenting in a shocklike state within the f rst few weeks of life, look for: 1. 2.

Permission granted courtesy of Antony and Julie Wood.) effort. A grade 2 murmur is easily heard but not particularly loud. A grade 3 murmur is loud but is not accompanied by a palpable thrill over the site of maximal intensity. A grade 4 murmur is very loud and is accompanied by a thrill. A grade 5 murmur is loud enough to be heard with only the edge of the stethoscope touching the chest, whereas a grade 6 murmur is loud enough to be heard with the stethoscope slightly off the chest. Murmurs of grade 3 or greater intensity usually signify important structural heart disease and indicate high blood flow velocity at the site of murmur production. Small ventricular septal defects (VSDs), for example, are accompanied by loud, usually grade 4 or greater, systolic murmurs as blood is ejected at high velocity from the left ventricle to the right"

            "content": "A congenital, small muscular VSD (Chap. 282) may be associated with an early systolic murmur. The defect closes progressively during septal contraction, and thus, the murmur is confined to early systole. It is localized to the left sternal border (Fig. 51e-2) and is usually of grade 4 or 5 intensity. Signs of pulmonary hypertension or left ventricular volume overload are absent. Anatomically large and uncorrected VSDs, which usually involve the membranous portion of the septum, may lead to pulmonary hypertension. The murmur associated with the left-to-right shunt, which earlier may have been holosystolic, becomes limited to the first portion of systole as the elevated pulmonary vascular resistance leads to an abrupt rise in right ventricular pressure and an attenuation of the interventricular pressure gradient during the remainder of the cardiac cycle. In such instances, signs of pulmonary hypertension (right ventricular lift, loud and single or closely split S2) may predominate. The"

            "content": "Associated Lesions With severe pulmonary hypertension, a pansystolic murmur produced by functional TR may be audible along the left sternal border. This murmur is usually louder during inspiration and diminishes during forced expiration (Carvallo\u2019s sign). When the CO is markedly reduced in MS, the typical auscultatory findings, including the diastolic rumbling murmur, may not be detectable (silent MS), but they may reappear as compensation is restored. The Graham Steell murmur of PR, a high-pitched, diastolic, decrescendo blowing murmur along the left sternal border, results from dilation of the pulmonary valve ring and occurs in patients with mitral valve disease and severe pulmonary hypertension. This murmur may be indistinguishable from the more common murmur produced by aortic regurgitation (AR), although it may increase in intensity with inspiration and is accompanied by a loud and often palpable P2."

            "content": "Additional clues to the etiology and importance of a heart murmur can be gleaned from the history and other physical examination findings. Symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, neurologic, or pulmonary disease help focus the differential diagnosis, as do findings relevant to the jugular venous pressure and waveforms, the arterial pulses, other heart sounds, the lungs, the abdomen, the skin, and the extremities. In many instances, laboratory studies, an ECG, and/or a chest x-ray may have been obtained earlier and may contain valuable information. A patient with suspected infective endocarditis, for example, may have a murmur in the setting of fever, chills, anorexia, fatigue, dyspnea, splenomegaly, petechiae, and positive blood cultures. A new systolic murmur in a patient with a marked fall in blood pressure after a recent MI suggests myocardial rupture. By contrast, an isolated grade 1 or 2 mid-systolic murmur at the left sternal border in a healthy, active, and asymptomatic young"
