In addition, saliva serves several other roles in protecting the teeth. Proteins in saliva cover the teeth with a protective coat called the acquired pellicle. Antibodies and other antibacterial agents retard bacterial action that would otherwise lead to tooth decay. Patients whose salivary glands are irradiated, as in the treatment of salivary gland tumors, fail to produce normal amounts of saliva; these patients typically develop rampant caries.

In chronic gingivitis, this is accompanied by gingival erythema, edema, and bleeding. Gingivitis may occur at any age but is most prevalent and severe in adolescence, where it is present in 40% to 60% of individuals, after which the incidence tapers off.

In adults, there are 32 teeth, 16 in the upper jaw and 16 in the lower jaw. On each side in both maxillary and mandibular arches are two incisor, one canine, two premolar, and three molar teeth. The incisor teeth are the \u201cfront teeth\u201d and have one root and a chisel-shaped crown, which \u201ccuts.\u201d The canine teeth are posterior to the incisors, are the longest teeth, have a crown with a single pointed cusp, and \u201cgrasp.\u201d The premolar teeth (bicuspids) have a crown with two pointed cusps, one on the buccal (cheek) side of the tooth and the other on the lingual (tongue) or palatal (palate) side, generally have one root (but the upper first premolar next to the canine may have two), and \u201cgrind.\u201d The molar teeth are behind the premolar teeth, have three roots and crowns with three to five cusps, and \u201cgrind.\u201d"
