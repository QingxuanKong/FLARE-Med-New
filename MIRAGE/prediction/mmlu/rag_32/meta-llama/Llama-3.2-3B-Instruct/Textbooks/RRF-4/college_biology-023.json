Their only limitation is that they do not give rise to extraembryonic tissues such as those of the placenta. Thus they are classified as pluripotent, rather than totipotent.

To accommodate subsequent cell growth, the walls of the newborn cells, called primary cell walls, are thin and extensible, although tough. Once cell growth stops, the wall no longer needs to be extensible: sometimes the primary wall is retained without major modification, but, more commonly, a rigid secondary cell wall is produced by depositing new layers of matrix inside the old ones.

            "content": "Plants and animals have very different ways of life, and they use different developmental strategies; in this chapter, we focus mainly on animals. Four processes are fundamental to animal development: (1) cell proliferation, which produces many cells from one; (2) cell\u2013cell interactions, which coordinate the behavior of each cell with that of its neighbors; (3) cell specialization, or differentiation, which creates cells with different characteristics at different positions; and (4) cell movement, which rearranges the cells to form structured tissues and organs (Figure 21\u20131). It is on the fourth point that plant development differs radically: plant cells are unable to migrate or move independently through the embryo because each one is contained within a cell wall, through which it is cemented to its neighbors, as discussed in Chapter 19."

            "content": "Cultured Stem Cells It is desirable to culture and expand stem cells in vitro to obtain a sufficient quantity for analysis and potential therapeutic use. Although the derivation of stem cells in vitro has been a major obstacle in stem cell biology, the number and types of cultured stem cells have increased progressively (Table 88-1). Cultured stem cells derived from resident stem cells are often called adult stem cells or somatic stem cells to distinguish them from embryonic stem (ES) and embryonic germ (EG) cells. However, considering the existence of embryo-derived, tissue-specific stem cells (e.g., trophoblast stem [TS] cells) and the possible derivation of similar cells from an embryo/fetus (e.g., neural stem [NS] cells), it is more appropriate to use the term, tissue stem cells."

            "content": "Because defects in genes that are required for fundamental cell processes\u2014 RNA synthesis and processing or cell-cycle control, for example\u2014are usually lethal, the functions of these genes are often studied in individuals with Figure 8\u201344 Insertional mutant of the snapdragon, Antirrhinum. A mutation in a single gene coding for a regulatory protein causes leafy shoots (left) to develop in place of flowers, which occur in the normal plant (right). The mutation causes cells to adopt a character that would be appropriate to a different part of the normal plant, so instead of a flower, the cells produce a leafy shoot.

            "content": "To refine the anatomical pattern within such an organ, the cells interact locally, both by diffusible inductive signals and by short-range mechanisms. Often, the cells compete with one another by lateral inhibition. This process results in activation of the Notch signaling pathway in one cell and inhibition in its neighbors, generating two different cell types. Asymmetric cell divisions, in which daughter cells inherit different molecular determinants from the mother cell, provide an additional way to organize a fine-grained diversity of cell types. Evidence from recent evolutionary events indicates that anatomical changes are mostly driven by changes in regulatory DNA sequences that determine when and where developmental genes are expressed. How the striking diversity in body structures has evolved over longer times remains largely unknown, although it seems likely that similar principles apply."
