    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the location of phosphocreatine in muscle cells. Phosphocreatine is a high-energy compound that provides a small but rapidly mobilized reserve of high-energy phosphates to maintain the intracellular level of ATP during intense muscular contraction. According to the provided documents, phosphocreatine is found in muscle cells and is used to convert ADP to ATP and thus replenish the ATP store during muscle contraction. We need to determine where phosphocreatine is located in muscle cells. The documents mention that phosphocreatine is found in muscle cells, but do not specify the exact location. However, we can make an educated guess based on the function of phosphocreatine. Phosphocreatine is involved in the rapid resynthesis of ATP near the myosin heads during muscle contraction, which suggests that it is located near the myosin heads. The documents also mention that the creatine phosphokinase in the thick filament may participate in the rapid resynthesis of ATP near the myosin heads. Therefore, it is likely that phosphocreatine is located in the thick filament, which is a component of the sarcomere. The sarcomere is the functional unit of striated muscle tissue, and the thick filament is one of its components. Based on this information, we can conclude that phosphocreatine is found in the thick filament, which is located in the sarcomere, and therefore, it is found in the cytoplasm and the thick filament of the sarcomere. Considering the options, the most accurate answer is B. all subcellular compartments, as phosphocreatine is found in the thick filament and the cytoplasm.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The energy stored in these high-energy phosphate bonds comes from the metabolism of fatty acids and glucose. Glucose is the primary metabolic sub-strate in actively contracting muscle. It is derived from the general circulation as well as from the breakdown of glyco-gen, which is normally stored in the muscle fiber cyto-plasm. As much as 1% of the dry weight of skeletal and cardiac muscle may be glycogen. In rapidly contracting muscles, such as the leg muscles in running or the extraocular muscles, most of the energy for contraction is supplied by anaerobic glycolysis of stored glycogen. The buildup of intermediary metabolites from this pathway, particularly lactic acid, can produce an oxygen deficit that causes ischemic pain (cramps) in cases of extreme muscular exertion.

Creatine Creatine phosphate (also called phosphocreatine), the phosphorylated derivative of creatine found in muscle, is a high-energy compound that provides a small but rapidly mobilized reserve of high-energy phosphates that can be reversibly transferred to adenosine diphosphate (Fig. 21.19) to maintain the intracellular level of ATP during the first few minutes of intense muscular contraction. [Note: The amount of creatine phosphate in the body is proportional to the muscle mass.] 1. Synthesis: Creatine is synthesized in the liver and kidneys from glycine and the guanidino group of arginine, plus a methyl group from SAM (see Fig. 21.19). Animal products are dietary sources. Creatine is reversibly phosphorylated to creatine phosphate by creatine kinase, using ATP as the phosphate donor. [Note: The presence of creatine kinase (MB isozyme) in the plasma is indicative of heart damage and is used in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (see p. 65).] 2."

These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and anaerobic phases of metabolism; the fatty acids are metabolized only aerobically."

The creatine phosphokinase in the thick filament may participate in the rapid resynthesis of ATP near the myosin heads during muscle contraction. The phosphate store created, however, is only about five times the size of the ATP store and thus cannot support prolonged periods of contraction (less than a minute of maximal muscle activity). Skeletal muscle fatigue during intense exercise is associated with depletion of the creatine phosphate store, although as described subsequently, this does not necessarily imply that the fatigue is caused by depletion of the creatine phosphate store.

RESTING SKELETAL MUSCLE Skeletal muscle accounts for ~40% of the body mass in individuals of healthy weight, and it can use glucose, amino acids, FA, and ketone bodies as fuel. In the well-fed state, muscle takes up glucose via GLUT-4 (for energy and glycogen synthesis) and amino acids (for energy and protein synthesis). In contrast to liver, there is no covalent regulation of PFK-2 in skeletal muscle. However, in the cardiac isozyme, the kinase domain is activated by epinephrine-mediated phosphorylation (see p. 100). Skeletal muscle is unique in being able to respond to substantial changes in the demand for ATP that accompanies contraction. At rest, muscle accounts for ~25% of the oxygen (O2) consumption of the body, whereas during vigorous exercise, it is responsible for up to 90%.

It can also be synthesized from the amino acids lysine and methionine by an enzymatic pathway found in the liver and kidneys but not in skeletal or cardiac muscle. Therefore, these latter tissues are totally dependent on uptake of carnitine provided by endogenous synthesis or the diet and distributed by the blood. [Note: Skeletal muscle contains ~97% of all carnitine in the body.] d."

            "content": "The force of smooth muscle contraction may be maintained for long periods in a \u201clatch state.\u201d In addition to normal phosphorylation of the regulatory light chains of myosin, smooth muscle cells possess a secondary mechanism that allows them to maintain long-term contraction with minimal expenditure of ATP. This mechanism is detected in vascular smooth muscles, for example, and is used to maintain the force of contraction (tone of blood vessels) for an extended time. This so-called latch state of smooth muscle contraction occurs after the initial Ca2-dependent myosin phosphorylation. The myosin head attached to the actin molecule becomes dephosphorylated, causing its ATPase activity to decrease. As a result of the decrease in ATP activity, the myosin head is unable to detach from the actin flament, which maintains the contracted state. The latch state is comparable in many ways to rigor mortis in striated muscle. Functional Aspects of Smooth Muscle"
