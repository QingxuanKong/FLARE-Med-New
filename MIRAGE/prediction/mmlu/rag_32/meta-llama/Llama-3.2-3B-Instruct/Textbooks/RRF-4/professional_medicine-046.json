The patient underwent repair of a Dupuytren contracture four months ago and is now filing a malpractice suit due to decreased range of motion in the affected hand. To determine the most likely precipitating factor, we need to consider the patient's perception of the physician's performance. The patient's perception of the physician's competence and empathy can significantly impact their satisfaction with care and likelihood of filing a malpractice suit. Research has shown that a positive doctor-patient relationship and empathetic communication are essential in reducing malpractice claims. Given the patient's dissatisfaction with the outcome of their surgery and their perception that their hand has not fully healed, it is likely that their perception of the physician's competence and empathy is the primary concern. The patient may feel that the physician did not provide adequate care or was uncaring, leading to their decision to file a malpractice suit. The other options are less likely to be the precipitating factor in this situation. The patient's socioeconomic status and the physician's amount of experience in the medical field are not directly related to the patient's perception of the physician's performance and are unlikely to be the primary concern in this scenario. Therefore, the most likely precipitating factor in this patient's decision to file a malpractice suit is their perception that the physician is uncaring or incompetent.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"B\"",

The pain began after a fall on his outstretched hand approximately 6 months previously. The patient recalled having some minor shoulder tenderness but no other specific symptoms. He was otherwise fit and well. On examination of the shoulder, there was marked wasting of the muscles in the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae. The patient found initiation of abduction difficult and there was a weakness of lateral rotation of the humerus. The wasted muscles were the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The cause of the muscle wasting was disuse. Muscle atrophy (wasting) occurs through a variety of disorders. Disuse atrophy is one of the most common causes. Examples of disuse atrophy include the loss of muscle bulk after fracture immobilization in a plaster cast. The opposite effect can also be demonstrated\u2014when muscles are overused they become bulkier (hypertrophy)."

Multiple factors can contribute to decreased mobility, including complex injuries of soft tissue and bone, noncompliance of the patient with postoperative therapy, and inappropriate splinting. The surgeon performing the initial eval-uation can greatly impact this last factor. The goal of splinting is to keep the collateral ligaments on tension (MPs at 90\u00b0, IP joints straight). For severe cases of stiffness, mobilization sur-geries such as tenolysis and capsulotomies can be performed, but these rarely produce normal range of motion.40 Prevention of joint contractures with appropriate splinting and early, pro-tected mobilization is the best option to maximize mobility at the end of healing.

Peripheral neuropathy results in reduced sensation, and therefore minor injuries can often go unnoticed.

Examina-tion of the hand is based on demonstrating the function or lack thereof of each of these structures.BonesThe hand is highly mobile in space to allow maximum flex-ibility in function. As such, a number of directions particular to the hand are necessary in order to properly describe posi-tion, motion, and so on.1 Palmar (or volar) refers to the anterior surface of the hand in the anatomic position; dorsal refers to the posterior surface in the anatomic position. The hand can rotate at the wrist level; rotation to bring the palm down is called 2Introduction 1925Anatomy of the Hand and Wrist 1925Bones / 1925Muscles Affecting the Hand and Wrist / 1926Tendons and Pulleys / 1929Vascular / 1929Nerve / 1930Hand Examination 1931Emergency Department/Inpatient Consultation / 1931Hand Imaging 1932Plain X-Rays / 1932Computed"

The SRN can be compressed distally in the forearm as it emerges from under the brachioradialis tendon, called Wartenberg\u2019s syndrome. As mentioned previously, any nerve can become compressed in scar at the site of a previous trauma.DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASEAs with other joints in the body, the joints of the hand and wrist can develop degenerative changes. Symptoms typically begin in the fifth decade of life. Symptoms consist of joint pain and stiffness and often are exacerbated with changes in the weather. Any of the joints can become involved. As the articular carti-lage wears out, pain typically increases and range of motion decreases. The patient should always be asked to what degree symptoms are impeding activities.Physical findings are documented in serial fashion from the initial visit and subsequent visits. Pain with axial loading of the joint may be present."

As in other locations, these are potentially limb-threat-ening issues. Principle symptoms are pain in the affected com-partments, tense swelling, tenderness to palpation over the compartment, and pain with passive stretch of the muscles of the compartment.36 Pulse changes are a late finding; normal pulses do not rule out compartment syndrome.There are three compartments in the forearm and four groups of compartments in the hand. The volar forearm is one compartment. On the dorsum of the forearm, there is the dorsal compartment as"

In fact, communication and practice pattern violations were the most common deficiency in care for one third of patients in the Closed Claims Study who received the expected standard of surgical care.54The Importance of Communication in Managing RiskThe manner and tone in which a physician communicates is potentially more important to avoiding a malpractice claim than the actual content of the dialogue. For example, a physician relating to a patient in a \u201cnegative\u201d manner may trigger litigious feelings when there is a bad result, whereas a physician relating in a \u201cpositive\u201d manner may not. Expressions of dominance, in which the voice tone is deep, loud, moderately fast, unaccented, and clearly articulated, may communicate a lack of empathy and understanding for the patient, whereas concern or anxiety in the surgeon\u2019s voice is often positively related to expressing concern and empathy.

The workup proceeds in an orderly fashion until a diagnosis is obtained.

The patient reported prior episodes of a similar nature following ingestion of a significant amount of dairy products. This clinical picture is most probably due to a deficiency in the activity of: A. isomaltase. B. lactase. C. pancreatic \u03b1-amylase. D. salivary \u03b1-amylase. E. sucrase. Correct answer = B. The physical symptoms suggest a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for carbohydrate degradation. The symptoms observed following the ingestion of dairy products suggest that the patient is deficient in lactase as a result of the age-dependent reduction in expression of the enzyme."
