In the context of the atmosphere, respiration refers to the process by which animals, including humans, break down organic molecules to produce energy. This process releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, making it a source of atmospheric carbon.\\n\\nOption B: Photosynthesis - Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert CO2 from the atmosphere into organic compounds, such as glucose. This process removes carbon from the atmosphere, making it NOT a source of atmospheric carbon.\\n\\nOption C: Bacterial decomposition - Bacterial decomposition is the process by which microorganisms break down organic matter. This process also releases CO2 into the atmosphere, making it a source of atmospheric carbon.\\n\\nOption D: Combustion of fossil fuels - Combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, releases CO2 into the atmosphere, making it a source of atmospheric carbon.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is B.

This carboxylation reaction is catalyzed in the chloroplast stroma by a large enzyme called ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, or Rubisco for short. Because the reaction is so slow (each Rubisco molecule turns over only about 3 molecules of substrate per second, compared to 1000 molecules per second for a typical enzyme), an unusually large number of enzyme molecules are needed. Rubisco often constitutes more than 50% of the chloroplast protein mass, and it is thought to be the most abundant protein on Earth. In a global context, Rubisco also keeps the amount of the greenhouse gas CO2 in the atmosphere at a low level."

Although the CO2 in the atmosphere provides an abundant potential carbon source, to convert it into an organic molecule such as a carbohydrate requires reducing the fixed CO2 with a strong electron donor, such as NADPH, which can generate (CH2O) units from CO2 (see Figure 14\u201341). Early in cellular evolution, strong reducing agents (electron donors) are thought to have been plentiful.

The biological consequences of this evolutionary step were far-reaching. For the first time, there would have been organisms that could survive on water, CO2, and sunlight (plus a few trace elements). These cells would have been able to spread and evolve in ways denied to the earlier photosynthetic bacteria, which needed H2S or organic acids as a source of electrons.

The binding of oxygen at one heme group increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining heme groups in the same molecule. A rise in pH results in increased oxygen affinity. Carbon dioxide decreases oxygen affinity because it lowers the pH. Moreover, binding of carbon dioxide to the N-termini stabilizes the taut, deoxy form. Hemoglobin binds one molecule of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Deoxyhemoglobin has a greater affinity for protons than does oxyhemoglobin. .4. \u03b2-Lysine 82 in HbA is important for the binding of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. In Hb Helsinki, this amino acid has been replaced by methionine. Which of the following should be true concerning Hb Helsinki? A. It should be stabilized in the taut, rather than the relaxed, form."

            "content": "Chloroplasts require only water and carbon dioxide as inputs for their light-driven photosynthesis reactions, and they produce the nutrients for most other organisms on the planet. Each oxidation of two water molecules by a photochemical reaction center in the thylakoid membrane produces one molecule of oxygen, which is released into the atmosphere. at the same time, protons are concentrated in the thylakoid space. these protons create a large electrochemical gradient across the thylakoid membrane, which is utilized by the chloroplast atp synthase to produce atp from aDp and phosphate. the electrons withdrawn from water are transferred to a second type of photochemical reaction center to produce NaDph from NaDp+. as indicated, the NaDph and atp are fed into the carbon-fixation cycle to reduce carbon dioxide, thereby producing the precursors for sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids. the CO2 that is taken up from the atmosphere here is the source of the carbon atoms for most organic"
