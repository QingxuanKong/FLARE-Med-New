    "question": "A 3-year-old white girl is brought to the office by her parents for a follow-up visit 48 hours after receiving a 5-TU PPD skin test. The test was done as part of a routine screening for enrollment in a homeless shelter. Physical examination shows 10 mm of induration at the puncture site; the examination is otherwise normal. The parents tell you they are shocked by this finding since both of their skin tests were nonreactive. They say they were born in this country and tell you that their daughter has always been in good health. She has not had much medical care in the past 2 years but she has been healthy. Until moving into this shelter they had been \"squatters\" in vacant buildings. Which of the following is the most appropriate step at this time?",
    "options": {
        "A": "Call her previous physician to obtain more history",
        "B": "Order a chest x-ray",
        "C": "Order a test for HIV antibody",
        "D": "Repeat the PPD skin test"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking for the given question: The child is 3 years old, and she received a 5-TU PPD skin test 48 hours ago. The test showed 10 mm of induration, which is a positive result. According to the provided document (Pediatrics_Nelson), a 10 mm induration is considered a positive test for latent tuberculosis (TB) in individuals with no known risk factors. Since the child has no known risk factors (she was born in the country, has always been healthy, and has not had much medical care in the past 2 years), the most appropriate step at this time is to follow the recommended guidelines for latent TB infection. The document states that children with latent TB infection should be treated with isoniazid (INH) for 6 months. The child should be referred to a pediatrician or a public health department for further evaluation and treatment. However, since the question is asking for the most appropriate step at the initial visit, the most appropriate action would be to: \"Call her previous physician to obtain more history\" This is because the child's previous physician may have more information about her medical history, including any previous TB testing or exposure to TB, which could inform the decision on how to proceed with treatment. Here is the output in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The child has a positive PPD test result, which indicates latent TB infection. Since she has no known risk factors, the next step is to call her previous physician to obtain more history to determine if she has any previous TB testing or exposure to TB. This information will help inform the decision on how to proceed with treatment.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

For HIV-positive patients,those with recent tuberculosis contacts, patients with evidenceof old healed tuberculosis on chest film, or immunosuppressedpatients, 5 mm is a positive test (see Chapter 124). The CDC hasapproved (in adults) the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test, whichhas the advantage of needing one office visit only."

            "content": "Annual office visits are recommended for adolescents. A full adolescent psychosocial history should be obtained in confidential fashion (see Section 12). Part of this evaluation is acomprehensive sexual history that often requires creative questioning. Not all adolescents identify oral sex as sex, and some adolescents misinterpret the term sexually active to mean that one has many sexual partners or is very vigorous during intercourse. The questions, \u201cAre you having sex?\u201d and \u201cHave youever had sex?\u201d should be asked. In the Bright Futures guidelines, any child or adolescent who has had any form of sexualintercourse should have at least an annual evaluation (moreoften if there is a history of high-risk sex) for sexually transmitted diseases by physical examination (genital warts, genitalherpes, and pediculosis) and laboratory testing (chlamydia,gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV) (see Chapter 116). Youngwomen should be assessed for human papillomavirus and precancerous lesions by Papanicolaou"

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

Pyodermas, sunburn, insect bites, skin ulcers, and cutaneous larva migrans are the most common skin conditions affecting travelers after their return home. In those with persistent skin ulcers, a diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis, mycobacterial infection, or fungal infection should be considered. Careful, complete inspection of the skin is important in detecting the rickettsial eschar in a febrile patient or the central breathing hole in a \u201cboil\u201d due to myiasis."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital because of suspected aspirin overdose. She has taken aspirin for joint pain for many years without incident, but during the past year, she has exhibited many signs of cognitive decline. Her caregiver finds her confused, hyperventilating, and vomiting. The care-giver finds an empty bottle of aspirin tablets and calls 9-1-1. In the emergency department, samples of venous and arterial blood are obtained while the airway, breathing, and circulation are evaluated. An intravenous (IV) drip is started, and gastro-intestinal decontamination is begun. After blood gas results are reported, sodium bicarbonate is administered via the IV. What is the purpose of the sodium bicarbonate?"

The TST response to tuberculin antigen is a manifestation of a T cell\u2212mediated delayed hypersensitivity. The Mantoux test, an intradermal injection of 5 TU (tuberculin units) of purified protein derivative standard (PPD-S), usually on the volar surface of the forearm, is the standard TST. It is usually positive 2 to 6 weeks after onset of infection (occasionally 3 months) and at the time of symptomatic illness. This test is preferred in children less than 5 years of age. It may also be used in other settings such as contact investigations or in older patients. Only persons at high risk should be offered a Mantoux test (Table 124-1). False-negative responses may occur early in the illness, with use of inactivated antigen (as a result of poor storage practice or inadequate administration), or as a result of"

These complaints are new since she used to always feel \u201chot,\u201d noted difficulty sleeping, and could eat anything that she wanted without gaining weight. She also would like to become preg-nant in the near future. Because of poor medication adherence to methimazole and propranolol, she received radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, developed hypothyroidism, and was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg daily. Other medications include calcium carbonate three times daily to \u201cprotect her bones\u201d and omeprazole for \u201cheartburn.\u201d On physical exami-nation, her blood pressure is 130/89 mm Hg with a pulse of 50 bpm. Her weight is 136 lb (61.8 kg), an increase of 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the last year. Her thyroid gland is not palpable and her reflexes are delayed.
