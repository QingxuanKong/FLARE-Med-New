However, the question asks for the proportion of babies that have an abnormality identifiable at birth. This information is not explicitly provided in the document, but we can make an educated estimate based on the information provided. Let's analyze the options given: A. 1 in 10, B. 1 in 40, C. 1 in 100, D. 1 in 500. We can see that option C (1 in 100) is the closest estimate based on the information provided in Document [10]. Although the document does not provide a direct answer, it does state that 2% to 4% of infants have congenital malformations, which is approximately 1 in 25 to 1 in 50, but since 1 in 100 is the closest estimate, it is a reasonable choice. However, it is also worth noting that the document mentions that 7% of infants have congenital malformations at 1 year of age, which is approximately 1 in 14.5, which is closer to option A (1 in 10). But since 1 in 100 is a more conservative estimate and is closer to the range provided in the document, it is a more reasonable choice.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Some of these babies are born at term; others are premature, and the birth process may or may not have been abnormal. One must then consider the possibility, originally pointed out by Sigmund Freud, that the abnormality of the birth process, instead of being causal, was actually the consequence of prenatal pathology. The latter might include preterm intrauterine hypoxia-ischemia."

However, this principle requires qualification: The abnormality may have affected parts of the brain that have not matured at birth, so that an interval of time must elapse postnatally before the defect can express itself. Many of the teratologic conditions that cause birth defects pass unrecognized because they end in spontaneous abortions. For example, defects caused by chromosomal abnormalities occur in approximately 0.6 percent of live births, but such defects are found in more than 5 percent of spontaneous abortuses at 5 to 12 weeks\u2019 gestational age."

Usher and McLean (1969) suggested that fetal growth standards should be based on mean weights-for-age, with normal limits deined by \u00b12 standard deviations. This definition would limit SGA infants to 3 percent of births instead of 10 percent. In a population-based analysis of 122,754 births at Parkland Hospital, McIntire and colleagues (1999) showed this definition to be clinically meaningful. Also, as shown in Figure 44-3, most adverse outcomes are in newborns smaller than the 3rd percentile.

At 1 year of age, the number approaches 7%, because some anomalies may not be identifiable until after the neonatal period. The prevalence of congenital malformations is much greater in inpatient pediatric populations; 30% to 50% of hospitalized children have congenital anomalies or genetic disorders. The clinical geneticist attempts to identify the etiology, mode of inheritance, and risk that a disorder might occur in the affected child\u2019s siblings. In evaluating children with congenital malformations, the patient\u2019s condition may be classified into one of five different categories: 1.

The malformation rate in monochorionic twins was almost twice that of dichorionic twin gestations. This increase has been attributed to the higher incidence of structural defects in monozygotic twins. Indeed, one large population-based study between 1998 and 2010 found that twins had a 73-percent greater risk of congenital heart disease than singletons. The risk was substantially higher among monochorionic twins (Best, 2015).

Infants born at a weight greater than the 90th percentile for age are considered large for gestational age. Among therisks associated with being large for gestational age are all the risks of the infant of a diabetic mother and risks associated with postmaturity. Infants born at a weight less than 10th percentile for age (some growth curves use <2 standard deviations or the 5th percentile) are small for gestational age and have IUGR. Problems associated with small for gestational age infants include congenital malformations, in addition to the problems listed in Table 58-2."

Gestational age at deliveryand the risk of neonatal morbidity and mortality are inversely related (Frey, 2016). Namely, neonates born in the early-preterm period make up the smallest proportion of births, but these infants experience disproportionately higher rates of prematurity-related complications (Table 42-1)."

Bromley and colleagues (2014) similarly found that late irst-trimester sonography identiied major abnormalities in 0.5 percent of pregnancies, representing approximately 40 percent of pregnancies with anomalies detected prenatally. Detection rates are very high for anencephaly, alobar holoprosencephaly, and ventral wall defects. But, in one analysis of more than 60,000 pregnancies with these early scans, only a third of major cardiac anomalies were identiied, and no cases of microcephaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebellar abnormalities, congenital pulmonary airway malformations, or bowel obstruction were detected (Syngelaki, 2011). In another study of low-risk or unselected pregnancies, 32 percent of anomalies were"
