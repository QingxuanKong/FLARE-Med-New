In the simplest case, if we denote the enzyme by E, the substrate by S, and the product by P, the basic reaction path is E + S \u2192 ES \u2192EP \u2192 E + P. There is a limit to the amount of substrate that a single enzyme molecule can process in a given time. Although an increase in the concentration of substrate increases the rate at which product is formed, this rate eventually reaches a maximum value (Figure 3\u201346). At that point the enzyme molecule is saturated with substrate, and the rate of reaction (Vmax) depends only on how rapidly the enzyme can process the substrate molecule. This maximum rate divided by the enzyme concentration is called the turnover number. Turnover numbers are often about 1000 substrate molecules processed per second per enzyme molecule, although turnover numbers between 1 and 10,000 are known."

Carboxypeptidase, for example, an enzyme that cuts polypeptide chains, carries a tightly bound zinc ion in its active site. During the cleavage of a peptide bond by carboxypeptidase, the zinc ion forms a transient bond with one of the substrate atoms, thereby assisting the hydrolysis reaction. In other enzymes, a small organic molecule serves a similar purpose. Such organic molecules are often referred to as coenzymes.

Peptide bonds, for example, can be hydrolyzed in the absence of an enzyme by exposing a polypeptide to either a strong acid or a strong base.

Thus, whenever large quantities of the final product begin to accumulate, this product binds to the enzyme and slows down its catalytic action, thereby limiting the further entry of substrates into that reaction pathway (Figure 3\u201355). Where pathways branch or intersect, there are usually multiple points of control by different final products, each of which works to regulate its own synthesis (Figure 3\u201356).

More importantly, however, some of the binding energy contributes directly to the catalysis. Substrate molecules must pass through a series of intermediate states of altered geometry and electron distribution before they form the ultimate products of the reaction. The free energy required to attain the most unstable intermediate state, called the transition state, is known as the activation energy for the reaction, and it is the major determinant of the reaction rate.

Southern blots are used to analyze DNA, not the products of DNA expression. 4.4. A 2-week-old infant is diagnosed with a urea cycle defect. Enzymic analysis showed no activity for ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC), an enzyme of the cycle. Molecular analysis revealed that the messenger RNA (mRNA) product of the gene for OTC was identical to that of a control. Which of the techniques listed below was most likely used to analyze mRNA? A. Dideoxy chain termination B. Northern blot C. Polymerase chain reaction D. Southern blot"

            "content": "The amount of product produced by an enzyme will depend on the concentration of both the enzyme and its substrate. If a sequence of reactions is to occur extremely rapidly, each metabolic intermediate and enzyme involved must be present in high concentration. However, given the enormous number of different reactions performed by a cell, there are limits to the concentrations that can be achieved. In fact, most metabolites are present in micromolar (10\u20136 M) concentrations, and most enzyme concentrations are much lower. How is it possible, therefore, to maintain very fast metabolic rates?"

Exons 2 and 3 must each contain a number of nucleotides that when divided by 3 leaves the same remainder (that is, 0, 1, or 2). 6\u20139 After treating cells with a chemical mutagen, you isolate two mutants. One carries alanine and the other carries methionine at a site in the protein that normally contains valine (Figure Q6\u20134). After treating these two mutants again with the mutagen, you isolate mutants from each that now carry threonine at the site of the original valine (Figure Q6\u20134). Assuming that all mutations involve single-nucleotide changes, deduce the codons that are used for valine, methionine, threonine, and alanine at the affected site. Would you expect to be able to isolate valineto-threonine mutants in one step? 6\u201310 Which of the following mutational changes would you predict to be the most deleterious to gene function? Explain your answers."

            "content": "The two pathways differ in the way in which they remove the damage from DNA. The first pathway, called base excision repair, involves a battery of enzymes called DNA glycosylases, each of which can recognize a specific type of altered base in DNA and catalyze its hydrolytic removal. There are at least six types of these enzymes, including those that remove deaminated Cs, deaminated As, different types of alkylated or oxidized bases, bases with opened rings, and bases in which a carbon\u2013carbon double bond has been accidentally converted to a carbon\u2013carbon single bond. How is an altered base detected within the context of the double helix? A key step is an enzyme-mediated \u201cflipping-out\u201d of the altered nucleotide from the helix, which allows the DNA glycosylase to probe all faces of the base for damage (Figure 5\u201342). It is thought that these enzymes travel along DNA using base-flipping to evaluate the status of each base. Once an enzyme finds the damaged base that it recognizes, it"

            "content": "Animals and plants that have been genetically engineered by gene deletion or gene replacement are called transgenic organisms, and any foreign or modified genes that are added are called transgenes. We discuss transgenic plants later in this chapter and, for now, concentrate our discussion on transgenic mice, as enormous progress has been made in this area. If a DNA molecule carrying a mutated mouse gene is transferred into a mouse cell, it often inserts into the chromosomes at random, but methods have been developed to direct the mutant gene to replace the normal gene by homologous recombination. By exploiting these \u201cgene targeting\u201d events, any specific gene can be altered or inactivated in a mouse cell by a direct gene replacement. In the case in which both copies of the gene of interest are completely inactivated or deleted, the resulting animal is called a \u201cknockout\u201d mouse. The technique is summarized in Figure 8\u201353."
