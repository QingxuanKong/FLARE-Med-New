The funduscopic examination shows pallor of the optic disk, which is a common finding in optic neuritis. The absence of diplopia and normal external ocular movements suggests that the lesion is likely located in the optic nerve rather than the oculomotor nerve or other cranial nerves. The medial longitudinal fasciculus is a structure involved in internuclear ophthalmoplegia, which can cause diplopia, but it is not directly related to the optic nerve. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is demyelination of the optic nerve.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Optic Neuritis (See Chap. 35) This inflammatory process causes unilateral acute impairment of vision that may appear in one or both eyes, either simultaneously or successively. It develops in a number of clinical settings, but has a special relationship to multiple sclerosis. The most common situation is one in which an adolescent or young adult woman has a rapid diminution of vision in one eye as though a veil had covered the eye, progressing within hours or days. Pain on movement of the globe is a common, but not universal reported symptom (Table 12-2). The swinging flashlight test usually confirms a relative afferent pupillary defect on the affected side, unless the fellow eye has previously been affected."

These symptoms can be mild or may progress to severe visual loss. Rarely, there is complete loss of light perception. Visual symptoms are generally monocular but may be bilateral. Periorbital pain (aggravated by eye movement) often precedes or accompanies the visual loss. An afferent pupillary defect (Chap. 39) is usually present. Funduscopic examination may be normal or reveal optic disc swelling (papillitis). Pallor of the optic disc (optic atrophy) commonly follows ON. Uveitis is uncommon and should raise the possibility of alternative diagnoses such as sarcoid or lymphoma. Visual blurring in MS may result from ON or diplopia (double vision); if the symptom resolves when either eye is covered, the cause is diplopia."

Conversely, in approximately 15 percent of patients with multiple sclerosis, the history discloses that retrobulbar neuritis was the first symptom. A proportion of patients with acute optic neuritis are found at the time of an acute attack to have characteristic subclinical radiographic features of multiple sclerosis on MRI of the cerebrum and spine. The treatment of optic neuritis is taken up with multiple sclerosis in Chap. 35. Optic neuritis is also a main component of neuromyelitis optica (Devic disease; see Chap. 35); the vision loss is often more severe and the prognosis for recovery is poorer than for optic neuritis in multiple sclerosis."

However, the ONTT showed that the 15-year cumulative probability of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis after optic neuritis is 50%. A brain magnetic resonance (MR) scan is advisable in every patient with a first attack of optic neuritis. If two or more plaques are present on initial imaging, treatment should be considered to prevent the development of additional demyelinating lesions (Chap. 458). This disease usually affects young men, causing gradual, painless, severe central visual loss in one eye, followed weeks to years later by the same process in the other eye. Acutely, the optic disc appears mildly plethoric with surface capillary telangiectasias but no vascular leakage on fluorescein angiography. Eventually optic atrophy ensues.

Of practical value is the observation, in the study by Beck and colleagues (2003), that the risk of relapsing-remitting MS is also considerably lower (22 percent at 10 years) if the initial brain MRI fails to reveal other demyelinating lesions."

There are variations in the appearance of the normal macula and optic disc, and these may prove difficult to distinguish from disease. A normal macula may be called abnormal because of a slight aberration of the retinal pigment epithelium or a few drusen. With experience, the examiner can visualize the unmyelinated nerve-fiber layer of the retina by using bright-green (red-free) illumination. This is most often helpful in detecting demyelinating, toxic, or hereditary lesions of the optic nerve, which produce a loss of discrete bundles of axons as they converge to the disc."

Rarely, sudden expansion of a pituitary adenoma from infarction and bleeding (pituitary apoplexy) causes acute retrobulbar visual loss, with headache, nausea, and ocular motor nerve palsies. In any patient with visual field loss or optic atrophy, CT or MR scanning should be considered if the cause remains unknown after careful review of the history and thorough examination of the eye."

She is feeling well overall but reports a 25-pack-year smoking history. She drinks 3\u20134 beers per week and has no known medication allergies. She has a history of heroin use and is currently receiving methadone. Physical examination reveals normal vital signs and no abnormalities. White blood cell count is 5800 cells/mm3 with a normal differential, hemoglobin is 11.8 g/dL, all liver tests are within normal limits, CD4 cell count is 278 cells/mm3, and viral load (HIV RNA) is 110,000 copies/mL. What other laboratory tests should be ordered? Which antiretroviral medica-tions would you begin?"

These common modes of onset are (1) optic neuritis, (2) transverse myelitis, (3) cerebellar ataxia, and (4) brainstem syndromes (vertigo, facial pain or numbness, dysarthria, diplopia). When these are unaccompanied by other features of MS, they are termed \u201cclinically isolated syndrome\u201d (CIS) but they are often components of the established disease as well. In the initial phases of the illness, they may pose diagnostic questions, as they also certainly occur with numerous diseases other than MS."

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet.

On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy.
