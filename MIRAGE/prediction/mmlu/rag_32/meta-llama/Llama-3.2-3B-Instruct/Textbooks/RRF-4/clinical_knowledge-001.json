Also, the degree of customary physical activity at work and during recreation should be considered.

This process in essence With adequate access to water, the thirst mechanism can prevent development of hyperosmolality. This mechanism is responsible for the polydipsia seen in response to the polyuria of both central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Most individuals ingest water/beverages even in the absence of the thirst sensation. Normally the kidneys are able to excrete this excess water because they can excrete up to 18 L/day of urine. However, in some instances, the volume of water ingested exceeds the kidneys\u2019 capacity to excrete water, especially over short periods of time. When this occurs, body fluids become hypoosmotic. An example of how water intake can exceed the capacity of the kidneys to excrete water is long-distance running.

For example, persons who have already sustained major knee injuries are at increased risk of progressive knee OA as a consequence of running. In addition, compared to nonrunners, elite runners (professional runners and those on Olympic teams) have high risks of both knee and hip OA.

A frequent error is to omit the number of fractions and the duration of treatment. This is analogous to saying that a runner completed a race in 20 s; without knowing how far he or she ran, the result is difficult to interpret. The time could be very good for a 200-m race or very poor for a 100-m race. Thus, a typical course of radiation therapy should be described as 4500 cGy delivered to a particular target (e.g., mediastinum) over 5 weeks in 180-cGy fractions. Most curative radiation treatment programs are delivered once a day, 5 days a week, in 150to 200-cGy fractions."

Patients with iliotibial band syndrome most commonly present with aching or burning pain at the site where the band courses over the lateral femoral condyle of the knee; pain may also radiate up the thigh, toward the hip. Predisposing factors for iliotibial band syndrome include a varus alignment of the knee, excessive running distance,poorlyfittedshoes,orcontinuousrunningonuneventerrain. Treatment consists of rest, NSAIDs, physical therapy, and addressing risk factors such as shoes and running surface.
