    "question": "A 63-year-old woman comes to the physician 1 day after the sudden onset of pain and swelling of her right knee. She has had no injury. Her medications include occasional ibuprofen for mild osteoarthritis of both knees. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 97/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 129/79 mm Hg. Examination of the right knee shows warmth, erythema, and effusion. Exquisite tenderness is produced with minimal range-of-motion testing. Examination of synovial fluid obtained via joint aspiration shows that it is clear, with positively birefringent rhomboids observed under polarized light microscopy. Deposition of which of the following substances is the most likely cause of these findings?",

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to analyze the given information and apply our knowledge of joint diseases and their characteristics. The patient presents with sudden onset of pain and swelling in the right knee, warmth, erythema, and exquisite tenderness, which suggests an inflammatory or infectious process. The key findings are the clear synovial fluid with positively birefringent rhomboids observed under polarized light microscopy. This finding is characteristic of crystal-induced arthritis. Now, we need to determine which type of crystal is most likely responsible for these findings. The options are: A. Ammonium urate, B. Calcium oxalate, C. Calcium pyrophosphate, and D. Calcium urate. We know that monosodium urate crystals (MSU) are seen in gout, are long, needle-shaped, negatively birefringent, and usually intracellular. However, the question mentions positively birefringent rhomboids, which is more characteristic of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals (CPPD) found in pseudogout. But pseudogout typically involves calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals, which are short and rhomboid-shaped and positively birefringent. The key here is the positively birefringent rhomboids, which points towards CPPD crystals. But we should also consider the patient's age and the fact that pseudogout is more common in older adults. Given the age of the patient and the description of the crystals, the most likely diagnosis is pseudogout, which is caused by the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals. So, the correct answer is C. Calcium pyrophosphate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Systemic findings of fever, leukocytosis, and elevated sedimentation rate are common. In 90% of nongonococcal cases, the infection involves only a single joint, most commonly the knee, followed in decreasing frequency by the hip, shoulder, elbow, wrist, and sternoclavicular joints. The axial joints are more often involved in drug users. Joint aspiration is diagnostic if it yields purulent fluid in which the causative agent can be identified. As mentioned earlier, cartilage has limited repair potential, so prompt recognition and effective anti-microbial therapy is vital to prevent permanent joint destruction."

Similarly, the number of swollen joints (0\u201328) can be counted and recorded. Careful examination should distinguish between true articular swelling (caused by bony hypertrophy, synovial effusion or proliferation) and nonarticular (or periarticular) involvement, which usually extends beyond the normal joint margins.

Modest synovitis develops in many but not all osteoarthritic joints. Some diseased joints have no synovitis, whereas others have synovial inflammation that approaches the severity of joints with rheumatoid arthritis (Chap. 380). The presence of synovitis on MRI is correlated with the presence and severity of knee pain. Capsular stretching from fluid in the joint stimulates nociceptive fibers there, inducing pain. Increased focal loading as part of the disease not only damages cartilage but probably also injures the underlying bone. As a consequence, bone marrow edema appears on the MRI; histologically, this edema signals the presence of microcracks and scar, which are the consequences of trauma. These lesions may stimulate bone nociceptive fibers."

            "content": "OA is the most common cause of chronic knee pain in persons over age 45, but the differential diagnosis is long. Inflammatory arthritis is likely if there is prolonged morning stiffness and many other joints are affected. Bursitis occurs commonly around knees and hips. A physical examination should focus on whether tenderness is over the joint line (at the junction of the two bones around which the joint is articulating) or is outside of it. Anserine bursitis, medial and distal to the knee, is an extremely common cause of chronic knee pain that may respond to a glucocorticoid injection. Prominent nocturnal pain in the absence of end-stage OA merits a distinct workup. For hip pain, OA can be detected by loss of internal rotation on passive movement, and pain isolated to an area lateral to the hip joint usually reflects the presence of trochanteric bursitis. No blood tests are routinely indicated for workup of patients with OA unless symptoms and signs suggest inflammatory arthritis."

Her physician advised her to come immediately to the clinic for evaluation. In the clinic she is febrile (38.5\u00b0C [101.3\u00b0F]) but otherwise stable and states she is not experiencing any nausea or vomiting. Her urine dipstick test is positive for leukocyte esterase. Urinalysis and urine culture are ordered. Her past medical history is significant for three urinary tract infections in the past year. Each episode was uncom-plicated, treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and promptly resolved. She also has osteoporosis for which she takes a daily calcium supplement. The decision is made to treat her with oral antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection with close follow-up. Given her history, what would be a reasonable empiric antibiotic choice? Depending on the antibiotic choice are there potential drug"

She had returned home 2 weeks earlier after leaving the USA for the first time to spend 3 weeks with her grandparents in Nigeria. She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome. Examination reveals a lethargic child, with a temperature of 39.8\u00b0C (103.6\u00b0F) and splenomegaly. She has no skin rash or lymphadenopathy. Ini-tial laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit 29.8%, platelets 45,000/mm3, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL (220 \u03bcmol/L), and mildly elevated bilirubin and transaminases.

Normal synovial fluid contains <180 cells (predominantly mononuclear cells) per microliter. Synovial cell counts averaging 100,000/\u03bcL (range, 25,000\u2013250,000/\u03bcL), with >90% neutrophils, are characteristic of acute bacterial infections.
