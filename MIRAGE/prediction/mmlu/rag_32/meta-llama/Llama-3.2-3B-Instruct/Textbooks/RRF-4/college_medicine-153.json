The primary transcript is the initial RNA molecule produced from a gene. This transcript can then undergo processing, including splicing, to produce different mRNAs. These mRNAs can then be translated into different proteins. Therefore, the correct answer is related to the process of alternative RNA splicing, which allows for the production of different proteins from the same gene. Let's evaluate the options: A) Selective transcription of different parts of the DNA in the gene is not accurate, as this would imply that different regions of the gene are being transcribed separately, which is not the case. B) Doubling or tripling the length of the mRNA molecule is not a known method for producing different proteins from the same gene. C) Alternative RNA splicing is a well-known process that allows for the production of different mRNAs from the same primary transcript, which can then be translated into different proteins. D) Splicing of the mRNA molecule after it has been formed from the primary transcript is not accurate, as splicing typically occurs before the mRNA is formed.

Because many identical RNA copies can be made from the same gene, and each RNA molecule can direct the synthesis of many identical protein molecules, cells can synthesize a large amount of protein from a gene when necessary. But genes can be transcribed and translated with different efficiencies, allowing the cell to make vast quantities of some proteins and tiny amounts of others (Figure 6\u20133). Moreover, as we see in the next chapter, Figure 6\u20133 Genes can be expressed with different efficiencies. In this example, gene A is transcribed much more efficiently than gene B and each RNA molecule that it produces is also translated more frequently. This causes the amount of protein A in the cell to be much greater than that of protein B."

Through sequence comparisons, we can assign the products of at least 40% of our protein-coding genes to known protein structures, belonging to more than 500 different protein families. Most of the proteins in each family have evolved to perform somewhat different functions, as for the enzymes elastase and chymotrypsin illustrated previously in Figure 3\u201312.

Although the DNA molecules in a cell can be randomly broken into small pieces by mechanical force, a fragment containing a single gene in a mammalian genome would still be only one among a hundred thousand or more DNA fragments, indistinguishable in their average size. How could such a gene be separated from all the others? Because all DNA molecules consist of an approximately equal mixture of the same four nucleotides, they cannot be readily separated, as proteins can, on the basis of their different charges and biochemical properties. The solution to this problem began to emerge with the discovery of restriction nucleases. These enzymes, which are purified from bacteria, cut the DNA double helix at specific sites defined by the local nucleotide sequence, thereby cleaving a long, double-stranded DNA molecule into fragments of strictly defined sizes."

A more sensible alternative is to modify the original definition to count a DNA sequence that is transcribed as a single unit and encodes one set of closely related polypeptide chains (protein isoforms) as a single protein-coding gene. This definition also accommodates those DNA sequences that encode protein variants produced by post-transcriptional processes other than RNA splicing, such as transcript cleavage and RNA editing (discussed below).

The genome of a cell contains in its DNA sequence the information to make many thousands of different protein and RNA molecules.

Moreover, cells can change the pattern of genes they express in response to changes in their environment, such as signals from other cells.

Perhaps the most important concept, one that applies to all species on Earth, is based on a group of proteins known as transcription regulators. These proteins recognize specific sequences of DNA (typically 5\u201310 nucleotide pairs in length) that are often called cis-regulatory sequences, because they must be on the same chromosome (that is, in cis) to the genes they control. Transcription regulators bind to these sequences, which are dispersed throughout genomes, and this binding puts into motion a series of reactions that ultimately specify which genes are to be transcribed and at what rate. Approximately 10% of the protein-coding genes of most organisms are devoted to transcription regulators, making them one of the largest classes of proteins in the cell.

Many years of experimentation can be saved by discovering that a new protein has an amino acid sequence similarity with a protein of known function. Such sequence relationships, for example, first indicated that certain genes that cause mammalian cells to become cancerous encode protein kinases (discussed in Chapter 20)."

            "content": "Figure 6\u201326 Alternative splicing of the \u03b1-tropomyosin gene from rat. \u03b1-Tropomyosin is a coiled-coil protein (see Figure 3\u20139) that carries out several tasks, most notably the regulation of contraction in muscle cells. The primary transcript can be spliced in different ways, as indicated in the figure, to produce distinct mRNAs, which then give rise to variant proteins. Some of the splicing patterns are specific for certain types of cells. For example, the \u03b1-tropomyosin made in striated muscle is different from that made from the same gene in smooth muscle. The arrowheads in the top part of the figure mark the sites where cleavage and poly-A addition form the 3\u02b9 ends of the mature mRNAs."

They also transport ions and various small molecules across plasma mem-branes. Proteins make up the key structural components of cells and the extracellular matrix and are responsible for cell motility. The unique functional properties of proteins are largely deter-mined by their structure (Fig. 15-5).Regulation of Gene Expression. The human organism is made up of a myriad of different cell types that, despite their vastly different characteristics, contain the same genetic mate-rial. This cellular diversity is controlled by the genome and is accomplished by tight regulation of gene expression. This leads to the synthesis and accumulation of different complements of RNA and, ultimately, to the proteins found in different cell types. For example, muscle and bone express different genes or the same genes at different times. Moreover, the"
