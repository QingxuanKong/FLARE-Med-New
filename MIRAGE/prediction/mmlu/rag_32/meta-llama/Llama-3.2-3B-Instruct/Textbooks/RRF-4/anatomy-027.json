The facial artery is a branch of the external carotid artery and runs along the side of the face, supplying blood to the face and nasal cavity. It is located anterior to the external auditory meatus and crosses the face from the parotid gland to the nasal cavity. The superficial temporal artery, on the other hand, is also a branch of the external carotid artery, but it runs along the side of the head, above the ear, and does not cross the face. The maxilla and orbital rim are not directly related to the main blood vessels of the face. Therefore, the facial artery is the most likely candidate to be palpable on the face, and it crosses the mandible, which is the bone of the lower jaw. This location is consistent with the description of a pulse being felt on the face.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The term convulsive syncope has been used to describe this phenomenon, but it has also been used for an authentic seizure caused by a prolonged period of brain hypoxia. These movements, which are often mistaken for a seizure, usually take the form of brief clonic jerks of the limbs and trunk and twitchings of the face or a tonic extension of the trunk, clenching of the jaw or turning of the eyes to either direction or upward.

At first, there is a mild generalized tremor, which is, in effect, a repetitive relaxation of the tonic contraction. It begins at a rate of approximately 8 per second and coarsens to 4 per second; then it rapidly gives way to brief, violent flexor spasms that come in rhythmic salvos and agitate the entire body. If prolonged, the face becomes violaceous and contorted by a series of grimaces. Autonomic signs are prominent: the pulse is rapid, blood pressure is elevated, pupils are dilated, and salivation and sweating are prominent; bladder pressure may increase sixfold during this phase. The clonic jerks decrease in amplitude and frequency over a period of about 30 s. The patient remains apneic until the end of the clonic phase, which is often marked by a deep inspiration. Instead of the whole dramatic sequence described above, the seizures may be abbreviated or limited in scope by medications."

Blushing, in response to embarrassment or anger, and blanching, in response to fear or anxiety, are examples of cerebral inhibition and stimulation, respectively, of the sympathetic nerve fibers to the affected cutaneous regions. In contrast to AV anastomoses in the skin, the resistance vessels display autoregulation of blood flow and reactive hyperemia. If the arterial inflow to a limb is stopped briefly by inflation of a blood pressure cuff, the skin becomes bright red below the point of vascular occlusion when the cuff is subsequently deflated. The increased cutaneous blood flow (reactive hyperemia) is also manifested by distention of the superficial veins in the affected extremity.

            "content": "Confirmation that a sudden collapse with loss of consciousness (LOC) is due to a cardiac arrest includes prompt observations of the state of consciousness, respiratory movements, skin color, and the presence or absence of pulses in the carotid or femoral arteries. For lay responders, the pulse check is no longer recommended because it is unreliable. As soon as a cardiac arrest is suspected, confirmed, or even considered to be impending, calling an emergency rescue system (e.g., 911) is the immediate priority. With the development of AEDs that are easily used by nonconventional emergency responders, an additional layer for response has evolved (see below)."

Occasionally, the compensatory tachy-cardia that develops with chronic AI will cause palpitations, and the increased pulse pressure will cause a sensation of pound-ing in the patient\u2019s head. Peripherally, the widened pulse pres-sure causes a forceful, bounding, and quickly collapsing pulse known as Corrigan\u2019s water-hammer pulse. Premature ventricu-lar contractions have been reported to cause particularly trou-bling symptoms, owing to the heave of the volume-loaded left ventricle during the postextrasystolic beat. The classic ausculta-tory finding associated with AI is a high-pitched decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best in the left third intercostal space; an associated S3 gallop is often indicative of late disease. The Austin Flint murmur has also been described, and it is heard as a middiastolic rumble at the apex that simulates mitral stenosis and occurs in severe"

            "content": "CHAPTER 51e Approach to the Patient with a Heart Murmur Palpitations Joseph Loscalzo Palpitations are extremely common among patients who present to their internists and can best be defined as an intermittent \u201cthumping,\u201d \u201cpounding,\u201d or \u201cfluttering\u201d sensation in the chest. This sensation can be either intermittent or sustained and either regular or irregular. Most 52254 patients interpret palpitations as an unusual awareness of the heartbeat and become especially concerned when they sense that they have had \u201cskipped\u201d or \u201cmissing\u201d heartbeats. Palpitations are often noted when the patient is quietly resting, during which time other stimuli are minimal. Palpitations that are positional generally reflect a structural process within (e.g., atrial myxoma) or adjacent to (e.g., mediastinal mass) the heart."
