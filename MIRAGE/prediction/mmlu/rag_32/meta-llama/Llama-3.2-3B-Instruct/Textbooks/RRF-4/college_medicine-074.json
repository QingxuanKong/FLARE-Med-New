    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the expected phenotypic ratios of the offspring, we need to understand the inheritance pattern of MERRF, which is caused by a mutation in mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited, meaning that only egg cells contribute mitochondria to the fertilized egg. As a result, all offspring from an affected mother will inherit the mutation, but the father will not be able to pass it on to his children. This is because sperm cells do not inherit mitochondria from the father. Therefore, the offspring will be affected if they inherit the mutated mtDNA from their mother. The amount of mutated mtDNA in each child can vary, leading to a range of symptoms, from asymptomatic to severe. The severity and presence of symptoms in the offspring depend on the ratio of mutant to wild-type mtDNA present in a particular tissue. However, the key point here is that all offspring from an affected mother will be affected, and the father will not be able to pass on the mutation to his children.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Metabolically active tissues that use large amounts of ATP such as muscle cells and neurons are most affected. For example, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fbers (MERRF) is characterized by muscle weakness, ataxia, seizures, and cardiac and respiratory failure. Microscopic examination of muscle tissue from affected patients shows aggregates of abnormal mitochondria, providing a ragged appearance of red muscle fbers. MERRF is caused by mutation of the mitochondrial DNA gene encoding tRNA for lysine. This defect produces two abnormal complexes in the electron-transport chain of respiratory enzymes affecting ATP production. Mitochondria undergo morphologic changes related to their functional state."

Two characteristics traceable to mitochondrial abnormalities are particularly common: one is a special change in muscle fibers termed ragged red fibers, a clumping of mitochondria in muscle fibers described in more detail further on, and the other is a systemic lactic acidosis. Other than these, each of the mitochondrial diseases has distinctive features and in their main elements they do not resemble each other.

Mendel's irst law is that genes are passed unchanged from parent to progeny, and barring new mutations, this is true for many genes or traits. However, certain genes are unstable, and their size, and thus function, may be altered during parentto-child transmission. This is manifested clinically by anticipation-a phenomenon in which disease symptoms seem to be more severe and to appear at an earlier age in each successive generation.

If an abundance of mutant mitochondria exists in tissue that has high energy requirements (brain, muscle, and liver), clinical symptoms occur. If fewer mutant mitochondria are present, few clinical symptoms may be seen."
