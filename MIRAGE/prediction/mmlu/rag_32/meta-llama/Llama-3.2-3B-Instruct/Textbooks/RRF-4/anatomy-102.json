The ductus arteriosus is a vessel that connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta, allowing blood to bypass the lungs in the fetus. In the fetus, the ductus arteriosus plays a crucial role in directing blood flow between the pulmonary artery and the aorta. The correct answer can be deduced by understanding the direction of blood flow in the fetal circulation. Blood from the right ventricle flows through the pulmonary artery and then through the ductus arteriosus to the aorta, bypassing the lungs. Therefore, the ductus arteriosus passes blood from the pulmonary artery to the aorta. This can be inferred from Document [1] (Title: Physiology_Levy), which states that the pulmonary vascular resistance in the fetus is high, and the remainder of the right ventricular output passes from the pulmonary artery through the ductus arteriosus to the aorta. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Most of the blood in the ascending aorta goes to the fetal head, upper thorax, and arms; the remainder joins blood from the ductus arteriosus and supplies the rest of the body. The amount of blood pumped by the left ventricle is approximately half that pumped by the right ventricle. The major fraction of the blood that passes down the descending aorta comes from the ductus arteriosus and right ventricle and flows by way of the two umbilical arteries to the placenta. Oxygen saturation of fetal blood occurs at various loci (see Fig. 17.44 ). Thus the fetal tissues that receive the most highly saturated blood are the liver, heart, and upper parts of the body, including the head."

The remainder passes from the fetal pulmonary artery through the ductus arteriosus to the aorta at a point distal to the origins of the arteries to the fetal head and upper extremities.

High pulmonary vascular resistance and comparatively lower resistance in the ductus arteriosus and the umbilical-placental vasculature ensure that only about 8 percent of right ventricular output goes to the lungs (Fineman, 2014). Thus, one third of the blood passing through the ductus arteriosus is delivered to the body. The remaining right ventricular output returns to the placenta through the two hypogastric arteries. These two arteries course from the level of the bladder along the abdominal wall to the umbilical ring and into the cord as the umbilical arteries. In the placenta, this blood picks up oxygen and other nutrients and is recirculated through the umbilical vein."

During intrauterine life, it permits blood to flow from the pulmonary artery to the aorta, bypassing the unoxygenated lungs. Within 1 to 2 days of birth in healthy term infants, the ductus constricts and closes; these changes occur in response to increased arterial oxygenation, decreased pulmonary vascular resistance, and declining local levels of prostaglandin E2. Complete obliteration occurs within the first few months of extrauterine life, leaving only a strand of residual fibrous tissue known as the ligamentum arteriosum. Ductal closure can be delayed (or even absent) in infants with hypoxia (related to respiratory distress or heart disease). PDAs account for about 7% of congenital heart lesions (see Table 11.1 Fig. 11.2 ); the great majority of these (90%) are isolated defects."

Blood then takes a path of least resistance via two routes within the fetus. One is the ductus venosus, which empties directly into the inferior vena cava (Fig. 7-9, p. 130). The other route consists of numerous smaller openings into the hepatic circulation. Blood from the liver flows into the inferior vena cava via the hepatic vein.

The increased blood flow to the lungs increases the volume of pulmonary venous blood returning to the left atrium; left atrial pressure now exceeds right atrial pressure, and the foramen ovale closes. As the flow through the pulmonary circulation increases and arterial oxygen tensions rise, the ductus arteriosus begins to constrict.

This change in pressure, coupled with a slight increase in aortic pressure, reverses the flow of blood through the ductus arteriosus. However, within several minutes, the large ductus arteriosus begins to constrict. This constriction produces turbulent flow, which is manifested as a murmur in newborn infants. Constriction of the ductus arteriosus is progressive and usually complete within 1 to 2 days after birth. Closure of the ductus arteriosus appears to be initiated by the high PO2 of the arterial blood passing through it; pulmonary ventilation with O2 closes the ductus, whereas ventilation with air low in O2 opens this shunt vessel. Whether O2 acts directly on the ductus or through the release of a vasoconstrictor substance is not known."

After birth, the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus and is discharged along with the contiguous membranes of the amniotic cavity. The umbilical cord connects the fetus to the placenta. It contains two arteries that carry blood from the fetus to the placenta and a vein that returns blood from the placenta to the fetus. The umbilical arteries have thick muscular walls. These are arranged as two layers, an inner longitudinal layer and an outer circular layer. Elastic lamellae are poorly developed in these vessels and, indeed, may be absent. The umbilical vein is similar to the arteries, also having a thick muscular wall arranged as"

            "content": "As discussed, the ventricles of the fetal heart work in parallel, not in series. Well-oxygenated blood enters the left ventricle, which supplies the heart and brain, and less oxygenated blood enters the right ventricle, which supplies the rest of the body. These two separate circulations are maintained by the right atrial structure, which efectively directs entering blood to either the left atrium or the right ventricle, depending on its oxygen content. his separation of blood according to its oxygen content is aided by the pattern of blood flow in the inferior vena cava. The well-oxygenated blood tends to course along the medial aspect of the inferior vena cava and the less oxygenated blood flows along the lateral vessel wall. This aids their shunting into opposite sides of the heart. Once this blood enters the right atrium, the configuration of the upper interatrial septum-the crista dividens-preferentially shunts the well-oxygenated blood from the medial side of the inferior vena"

Fetal position poses more of a challenge in imaging the ductus venosus than it does with either the umbilical artery or the middle cerebral artery. he waveform is biphasic and normally has forward flow throughout the cardiac cycle. The irst peak reflects ventricular systole, and the second is ventricular diastolic illing. These are followed by a nadir during atrial contraction-termed the a-wave."

            "content": "The developing fetus is maintained by the placenta, which develops from fetal and maternal tissues. The placenta consists of a fetal portion, formed by the chorion, and a maternal portion, formed by the decidua basalis. The two parts are involved in physiologic exchange of substances between the maternal and fetal circulations. The uteroplacental circulatory system begins to develop around day 9, with development of vascular spaces called trophoblastic lacunae within the syncytiotrophoblast. Maternal sinusoids, which develop from capillaries of the maternal side, anastomose with the trophoblastic lacunae (Fig. 23.23). The differential pressure between the arterial and venous channels that communicate with the lacunae establishes directional flow from the arteries into the veins, thereby establishing a primitive uteroplacental circulation. Numerous pinocytotic vesicles present in the syncytiotrophoblast indicate the transfer of nutrients from the maternal vessels to the embryo."

Ostium primum type is associated with Down syndrome. C. Results in left-to-right shunt and split S2 on auscultation (increased blood in right heart delays closure of pulmonary valve) D. Paradoxical emboli are an important complication. IV. A. Failure of ductus arteriosus to close; associated with congenital rubella B. Results in left-to-right shunt between the aorta and the pulmonary artery 1. During development, the ductus arteriosus normally shunts blood from the pulmonary artery to the aorta, bypassing the lungs. C. Asymptomatic at birth with continuous 'machine-like' murmur; may lead to Eisenmenger syndrome, resulting in lower extremity cyanosis D. Treatment involves indomethacin, which decreases PGE, resulting in PDA closure (PGE maintains patency of the ductus arteriosus). V."
