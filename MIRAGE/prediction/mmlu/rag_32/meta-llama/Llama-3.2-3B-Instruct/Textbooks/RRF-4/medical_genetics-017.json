Current 427 estimates predict 20,687 protein-coding genes in the human genome with an average of about four different coding transcripts per gene. Remarkably, the exome only constitutes 1.14% of the genome. In addition, thousands of noncoding transcripts (RNAs of various length such as microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs), which function, at least in part, as transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression, have been identified. Aberrant expression of microRNAs has been found to play a pathogenic role in numerous diseases."

As discussed above, a typical gene carries in its linear sequence of nucleotides the information for the linear sequence of the amino acids of a protein. Only about 1300 nucleotide pairs are required to encode a protein of average size (about 430 amino acids in humans). Most of the remaining sequence in a gene consists of long stretches of noncoding DNA that interrupt the relatively short segments of DNA that code for protein. As will be discussed in detail in Chapter 6, the coding sequences are called exons; the intervening (noncoding) sequences in genes are called introns (see Figure 4\u201315 and Table 4\u20131). The majority of human genes thus consist of a long string of alternating exons and introns, with most of the gene consisting of introns. In contrast, the majority of genes from organisms with concise genomes lack introns. This accounts for the much smaller size of their genes"

Although we lack a direct record of changes over time, scientists can reconstruct the process of genome evolution from detailed comparisons of the genomes of contemporary organisms. The basic organizing framework for comparative genomics is the phylogenetic tree. A simple example is the tree describing the divergence of humans from the great apes (Figure 4\u201363). The primary support for this tree comes from comparisons of gene or protein sequences. For example, comparisons between the sequences of human genes or proteins and those of the great apes typically reveal the fewest differences between human and chimpanzee and the most between human and orangutan."

Although a sequence match does not guarantee similarity in function, it has proved to be an excellent clue. Thus, it is often possible to predict the function of genes in humans for which no biochemical or genetic information is available simply by comparing their nucleotide sequences with the sequences of genes that have been characterized in other more readily studied organisms. In general, the sequences of individual genes are much more tightly conserved than is overall genome structure. Features of genome organization such as genome size, number of chromosomes, order of genes along chromosomes, abundance and size of introns, and amount of repetitive DNA are found to differ greatly when comparing distant organisms, as does the number of genes that each organism contains."

Thus, the presence of numerous introns in DNA allows genetic recombination to readily combine the exons of different genes, enabling genes for new proteins to evolve more easily by the combination of parts of preexisting genes. The observation, described in Chapter 3, that many proteins in present-day cells resemble patchworks composed from a common set of protein domains, supports this idea (see pp. 121\u2013122). RNA splicing also has a present-day advantage. The transcripts of many eukaryotic genes (estimated at 95% of genes in humans) are spliced in more than one way, thereby allowing the same gene to produce a corresponding set of dif-ferent proteins (Figure 6\u201326). Rather than being the wasteful process it may have seemed at first sight, RNA splicing enables eukaryotes to increase the coding potential of their genomes.

            "content": "By compiling the data for different types of cancer, each with its own range of identified driver mutations, we can develop a comprehensive catalog of genes that are strongly suspected to be cancer-critical. Current estimates put the total number of such genes at about 300, about 1% of the genes in the human genome. These cancer-critical genes are amazingly diverse. Their products include secreted signal proteins, transmembrane receptors, GTP-binding proteins, protein kinases, transcription regulators, chromatin modifiers, DNA repair enzymes, cell\u2013cell adhesion molecules, cell-cycle controllers, apoptosis regulators, scaffold proteins, metabolic enzymes, components of the RNA splicing machinery, and more besides. All these are susceptible to mutations that can contribute, in one way or another, in one tissue or another, to the evolution of cells with the cancerous properties that we listed earlier on page 1103."

Thousands of genomes have been sequenced, and we know from comparative genomics that many organisms share the same basic set of proteins. However, the functions of a very large number of identified proteins remain unknown. Depending on the organism, approximately one-third of the proteins encoded by a sequenced genome do not clearly resemble any protein that has been studied biochemically. This observation underscores a limitation of the emerging field of genomics: although comparative analysis of genomes reveals a great deal of information about the relationships between genes and organisms, it often does not provide immediate information about how these genes function, or what roles they have in the physiology of an organism.

The process of genome annotation attempts to mark out all the genes (both protein-coding and noncoding) in a genome and ascribe a role to each. It also seeks to understand more subtle types of genome information, such as the cis-regulatory sequences that specify the time and place that a given gene is expressed and whether its mRNA undergoes alternative splicing to produce different protein isotypes. Clearly, this is a daunting task, and we are far short of completing it for any form of life, even the simplest bacterium. For many organisms, we know the approximate number of genes, and, for very simple organisms, we understand the functions of about half their genes."
