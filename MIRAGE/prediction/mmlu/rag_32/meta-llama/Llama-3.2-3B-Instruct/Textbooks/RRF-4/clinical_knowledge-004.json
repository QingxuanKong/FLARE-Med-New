Closed pouches are typically used in procedures such as ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, which is a type of surgery for patients with ulcerative colitis. The question asks in what situation closed pouches are applied. Let's evaluate the options given. Option A, \"The patient has a semi-formed or liquid output,\" is not directly related to the application of closed pouches. This output is more related to the function of the pouch itself, not the situation in which it is applied. Option B, \"The patient has a colostomy,\" is also not directly related to the application of closed pouches. A colostomy is a type of surgical procedure that involves diverting the colon to an opening in the abdomen, but it does not necessarily involve the use of a closed pouch. Option D, \"The patient has a urostomy,\" is also not directly related to the application of closed pouches. A urostomy is a type of surgical procedure that involves diverting the ureters to an opening in the abdomen, but it does not involve the use of a closed pouch. Option C, \"In the immediate post-operative period,\" is the most relevant option. In the context of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, closed pouches are often applied in the immediate post-operative period to provide support and protection to the newly created pouch. Therefore, the correct answer is C. In the immediate post-operative period.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Care must be taken to avoid creating an artificial internal opening (thus often converting a simple fistula into a complex fistula).Simple intersphincteric fistulas can often be treated by fistulotomy (opening the fistulous tract), curettage, and healing by secondary intention (see Fig. 29-40A). \u201cHorseshoe\u201d fistulas usu-ally have an internal opening in the posterior midline and extend anteriorly and laterally to one or both ischiorectal spaces by way of the deep postanal space. Treatment of a transsphincteric fistula depends on its location in the sphincter complex. Fistulas that include less than 30% of the sphincter muscles can often be treated by sphincterotomy without significant risk of major incontinence (see Fig. 29-40B). High transsphincteric fistulas, which encircle a greater amount of muscle, are more safely treated by initial place-ment of a seton. Similarly, suprasphincteric fistulas are usually treated with seton placement (see Fig. 29-40C). Extrasphincteric"

For example, although the removal of a gallbladder through a Kocher incision is certainly effective, it creates a great deal of disability, pain, and scarification. As a result of those issues, many patients with very symptomatic biliary colic delayed operation until life-threatening complications occurred. Clearly, there was a need for developing a less inva-sive approach (Fig. 14-30).Once the opportunity has been established, the next step involves a search through other disciplines for technologies and techniques that might be applied. Again, this is analogous to the drug industry, where secondary drug indications have often turned out to be more therapeutically important than the primary indication for drug development. The third step is in vivo stud-ies in the most appropriate animal model. These types of studies are controversial because of the resistance to animal experimen-tation, and yet without such studies, many humans would be injured or"

In stable patients, treat-ment consists of repair of the esophageal anomaly and correc-tion of the duodenal atresia if the infant is stable during surgery. If not, a staged approach should be utilized consisting of ligation of the fistula and placement of a gastrostomy tube. Definitive repair can then be performed at a later point in time.Primary esophageal atresia (type A) represents a chal-lenging problem, particularly if the upper and lower ends are too far apart for an anastomosis to be created.

Gellhorn and cube pessaries are typically more difficult to insert and remove by the patient. They are held in place by significant space occupation and suction and offer strong support. The suction of the cube pessary needs to be broken, facilitating removal. Cube pessaries should be removed daily; Gelhorns can stay in longer (up to 6\u20138 weeks). Donut pessaries, which are very popular, are considered a space-fitting pessary for large vaginal vault prolapse, complete procidentia with decreased perineal support, and good introital integrity. The patient should be questioned about a latex allergy and instructed to remove and clean the device every 2 to 3 days. Continence pessaries, rings, and dishes with support typically also are easy to fold, insert, and remove (50)."

Care should be taken to avoid injuring and causing bleeding from the inferior epigastric artery and vein. The size of the defect depends on the size of the bowel used to create the stoma, but it should be as small as possible without compromising the intestinal blood supply (usually the width of two to three fingers). The bowel is then brought through the defect and secured with sutures. The abdominal incision is usually closed and dressed prior to maturing the stoma to avoid contaminating the wound. In order to make appliance use easier, a protruding nipple is fashioned by everting the bowel. Three or four interrupted absorbable sutures are placed through the edge of the bowel, then through the serosa, approximately 2 cm proximal to the edge, and then through the dermis (Brooke tech-nique). After the stoma is everted, the mucocutaneous junction is sutured"

The overlying rectus fascia is closed by a continuous, nonlocking technique with a delayed-absorbable suture.

A gap in an anastomotic ring suggests that the circular staple line is incomplete and the anastomosis should be reinforced with suture circumferentially, if technically feasible. A temporary proximal ileostomy may be indicated as well. Most surgeons will also leak test an anastomosis by instilling water or saline into the pelvis and insufflating the rectum with air via a proc-toscope to looking or alternatively instilling methylene blue or betadine into the rectum to look for extravasation. A leak test strongly suggests a defect and/or disruption of the anastomosis. As such, the suture should line reinforced and sometimes may require reanastomosis.23Brunicardi_Ch29_p1259-p1330.indd 127423/02/19 2:29 PM 1275COLON, RECTUM, AND ANUSCHAPTER 29Ostomies and Preoperative Stoma PlanningDepending on the clinical situation, a stoma may be temporary or permanent.

The term is typically used when the left or sigmoid colon is resected and the closed off rectum is left in the pelvis. If the distal colon is long enough to reach the abdominal wall, a mucus fistula can be created by opening the defunctioned bowel and suturing the open lumen to the skin.Abdominoperineal Resection. An abdominoperineal resec-tion (APR) involves removal of the entire rectum, anal canal, and anus with construction of a permanent colostomy from the descending or sigmoid colon. The abdominal-pelvic portion of this operation proceeds in the same fashion as described for an extended low anterior resection. The perineal dissection can be performed with the patient in lithotomy position (often by a second surgeon) or in the prone position after closure of the abdomen and creation of the colostomy. For cancer, the perineal dissection is designed to excise the anal canal with a"
