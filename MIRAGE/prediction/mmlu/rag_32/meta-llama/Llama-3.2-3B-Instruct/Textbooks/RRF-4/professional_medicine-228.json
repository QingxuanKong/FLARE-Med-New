Examination of the right upper extremity shows no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness. The pain is reproduced when the patient is asked to externally rotate the shoulder against resistance; there is no weakness. In addition to the teres minor, inflammation of which of the following tendons is most likely in this patient?",

    "predict": "Here's my step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: Step 1: The patient's symptoms began after chopping wood, which is a physical activity that involves repetitive overhead movements of the arm. Step 2: The patient's pain is reproduced when externally rotating the shoulder against resistance, which suggests that the affected tendon is involved in external rotation of the arm. Step 3: The patient has no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness, which suggests that the pain is likely due to a soft tissue injury rather than a fracture or bone-related condition. Step 4: The patient's pain is not accompanied by weakness, which suggests that the affected tendon is not a major rotator cuff tendon like the supraspinatus or infraspinatus. Step 5: The teres minor is mentioned as one of the muscles involved in external rotation of the arm, which suggests that the affected tendon is likely the teres minor's associated tendon. Step 6: Based on the patient's symptoms and the muscles involved in external rotation of the arm, the most likely affected tendon is the teres minor's associated tendon, which is the long head of the biceps tendon. Step 7: The long head of the biceps tendon is often involved in cases of bicipital tendinitis or tenosynovitis, which is inflammation of the tendon and its surrounding synovial sheath. Step 8: Considering the options provided, the most likely affected tendon is the long head of the biceps tendon, which is associated with the teres minor muscle. The final answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest that the affected tendon is the long head of the biceps tendon, which is associated with the teres minor muscle. The teres minor is not a tendon itself, but rather a muscle involved in external rotation of the arm. The long head of the biceps tendon is the tendon associated with the teres minor muscle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The pain began after a fall on his outstretched hand approximately 6 months previously. The patient recalled having some minor shoulder tenderness but no other specific symptoms. He was otherwise fit and well. On examination of the shoulder, there was marked wasting of the muscles in the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae. The patient found initiation of abduction difficult and there was a weakness of lateral rotation of the humerus. The wasted muscles were the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The cause of the muscle wasting was disuse. Muscle atrophy (wasting) occurs through a variety of disorders. Disuse atrophy is one of the most common causes. Examples of disuse atrophy include the loss of muscle bulk after fracture immobilization in a plaster cast. The opposite effect can also be demonstrated\u2014when muscles are overused they become bulkier (hypertrophy)."

Nearly 30 percent of the elderly will have shoulder pain, with rotator cuff tendinitis or tear as the primary cause. The rotator cuff is formed by four tendons that attach the scapula to the proximal humerus (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis tendons). Of these, the supraspinatus muscle is the most commonly damaged. Rotator cuff tendinitis is suggested by pain on active abduction (but not passive abduction), pain over the lateral deltoid muscle, nightpain,andevidenceoftheimpingementsigns(painwithoverhead arm activities). The Neer test for impingement is performed by the examiner raising the patient\u2019s arm into forced flexion while stabilizing and preventing rotation of the scapula. A positive sign is present if pain develops before 180\u00b0 of forward flexion. Tear of the rotator cuff is common in the elderly and often results from trauma; it may manifest in the same manner as tendinitis."

Subacromial bursitis is a frequent cause of shoulder pain. Anterior to the subacromial bursa, the bicipital tendon traverses the bicipital groove. This tendon is best identified by palpating it in its groove as the patient rotates the humerus internally and externally. Direct pressure over the tendon may reveal pain indicative of bicipital tendinitis. Palpation of the acromioclavicular joint may disclose local pain, bony hypertrophy,or,uncommonly,synovialswelling.WhereasOAandRA commonly affect the acromioclavicular joint, OA seldom involves the glenohumeral joint, unless there is a traumatic or occupational cause."

When the inflammation is acute, patients experience anterior shoulder pain that radiates down the biceps into the forearm. Abduction and external rotation of the arm are painful and limited. The bicipital groove is very tender to palpation. Pain may be elicited along the course of the tendon by resisting supination of the forearm with the elbow at 90\u00b0 (Yergason\u2019s supination sign). Acute rupture of the tendon may occur with vigorous exercise of the arm and is often painful. In a young patient, it should be repaired surgically. Rupture of the tendon in an older person may be associated with little or no pain and is recognized by the presence of persistent swelling of the biceps produced by the retraction of the long head of the biceps. Surgery is usually not necessary in this setting."

Mechanical pain is often worse at night, associated with local shoulder tenderness and aggravated by passive abduction, internal rotation, or extension of the arm.

For example, irritation of the peritoneum on the inferior surface of the diaphragm, which is innervated by the phrenic nerve, can be referred to the skin on the top of the shoulder, which is innervated by other somatic nerves arising at the same spinal cord level. A young man sought medical care because of central abdominal pain that was diffuse and colicky. After some hours, the pain began to localize in the right iliac fossa and became constant. He was referred to an abdominal surgeon, who removed a grossly inflamed appendix. The patient made an uneventful recovery."

Tear of the rotator cuff is common in the elderly and often results from trauma; it may manifest in the same manner as tendinitis. The drop arm test is abnormal with supraspinatus pathology and is demonstrated by passive abduction of the arm to 90\u00b0 by the examiner. If the patient is unable to hold the arm up actively or unable to lower the arm slowly without dropping, the test is positive. Tendinitis or tear of the rotator cuff is best confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound."

It often is associated with nausea and sometimes vomiting. Patients generally suffer discrete, recurrent attacks of pain, between which they feel well. Physical examination may reveal mild right upper quadrant tenderness during an episode of pain. If the patient is pain free, the physical examination is usually unremarkable. Labora-tory values, such as WBC count and liver function tests, are usu-ally normal in patients with uncomplicated gallstones.Atypical presentations of gallstone disease are common and a high index of suspicion for biliary disease must be main-tained when evaluating patients with abdominal complaints. Association with meals is present in only about 50% of patients. Some patients report milder attacks of pain but relate it to meals. The pain may be located primarily in the back or the left upper or right"

The pain tends to be severe and extends toward the neck and down the arm into the hand. The dorsum of the hand may tingle without other signs of nerve involvement. Immobility of an arm following myocardial infarction may be associated with pain in the shoulder and arm and with vasomotor changes and secondary arthropathy of the hand joints (shoulder\u2013hand syndrome); after a time, osteoporosis and atrophy of cutaneous and subcutaneous structures occur (Sudeck atrophy or Sudeck-Leriche syndrome). Similar changes may occur in the foot and leg, or all articular structures on the side of a hemiplegia, or in association with the painful lesions described in the first part of this chapter.

Although the distribution of pain from each of these sources may overlap, the patient can usually indicate its site of origin. Pain arising from the cervical part of the spine is felt in the neck or back of the head and is projected to the shoulder and upper arm; it is evoked or enhanced by certain movements or positions of the neck and is accompanied by limitation of motion of the neck and by tenderness to palpation over the cervical spine."
