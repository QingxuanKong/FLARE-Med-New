Emphysema is a condition affecting the lungs, not the liver.\\n\\nOption B: The liver enlarges downwards from the left hypochondrium - The documents do not provide information on the direction of liver enlargement. Hepatomegaly can occur in various directions and is not limited to a specific direction.\\n\\nOption C: The presence of jaundice, spider naevi and purpura suggest alcohol as a cause - The presence of spider naevi and purpura can be associated with liver disease, including cirrhosis, but this is not exclusive to alcohol-related liver disease. The documents do not explicitly state that these findings are specific to alcohol-related hepatomegaly.\\n\\nOption D: The liver is usually resonant to percussion - The documents state that hepatomegaly is not a highly reliable sign of liver disease due to variability in liver size and shape, and physical impediments to assessment of liver size by percussion and palpation. Therefore, the liver may not be resonant to percussion in cases of hepatomegaly.\\n\\nBased on the evaluation of each option, the correct answer is D.

            "content": "Hepatomegaly is not a highly reliable sign of liver disease because of variability in the liver\u2019s size and shape and the physical impediments to assessment of liver size by percussion and palpation. Marked hepatomegaly is typical of cirrhosis, veno-occlusive disease, infiltrative disorders such as amyloidosis, metastatic or primary cancers of the liver, and alcoholic hepatitis. Careful assessment of the liver edge may also reveal unusual firmness, irregularity of the surface, or frank nodules. Perhaps the most reliable physical finding in the liver examination is hepatic tenderness. Discomfort when the liver is touched or pressed upon should be carefully sought with percussive comparison of the right and left upper quadrants. Splenomegaly, which occurs in many medical conditions, can be a subtle but significant physical finding in liver disease. The availability of ultrasound methods for assessment of the spleen allows confirmation of the physical finding."

In dark-skinned individuals, examination of the mucous membranes below the tongue can demonstrate jaundice. Jaundice is rarely detectable if the serum bilirubin level is <43 \u03bcmol/L (2.5 mg/dL) but may remain detectable below this level during recovery from jaundice (because of protein and tissue binding of conjugated bilirubin)."

            "content": "Hypoglycemia is characterized by low blood glucose accompanied by adrenergic and neuroglycopenic symptoms that are rapidly resolved by the administration of glucose. Insulin-induced, postprandial, and fasting hypoglycemia result in release of glucagon and epinephrine. The rise in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) that accompanies ethanol metabolism inhibits gluconeogenesis, leading to hypoglycemia in individuals with depleted stores. Alcohol consumption also increases the risk for hypoglycemia in patients using insulin. Chronic alcohol consumption can cause fatty liver disease. Choose the ONE best answer. 3.1. Which of the following statements is true for insulin but not for glucagon? A. It is a peptide hormone secreted by pancreatic cells. B. Its actions are mediated by binding to a receptor found on the cell membrane of liver cells. C. Its effects include alterations in gene expression. D. Its secretion is decreased by the catecholamines."

Ascites is best appreciated by attempts to detect shifting dullness by careful percussion. Ultrasound examination will confirm the finding of ascites in equivocal cases. Peripheral edema can occur with or without ascites. In patients with advanced liver disease, other factors frequently contribute to edema formation, including hypoalbuminemia, venous insufficiency, heart failure, and medications."

In endemic areas of the Americas and the Mediterranean basin, immunocompetent infants and small children as well as immunodeficient adults are affected especially often. The most common presentation of VL is an abrupt onset of moderateto high-grade fever associated with rigor and chills. Fever may continue for several weeks with decreasing intensity, and the patient may become afebrile for a short period before experiencing another bout of fever. The spleen may be palpable by the second week of illness and, depending on the duration of illness, may become hugely enlarged (Fig. 251-3). Hepatomegaly (usually moderate in degree) soon follows. Lymphadenopathy is common in most endemic regions of the world except the Indian subcontinent, where it is rare. Patients lose weight and feel weak, and the skin gradually develops dark discoloration due to hyperpigmentation that is most"
