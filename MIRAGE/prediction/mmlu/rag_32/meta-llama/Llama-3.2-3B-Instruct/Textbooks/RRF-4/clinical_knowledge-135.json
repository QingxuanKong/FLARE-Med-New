The title itself suggests that it is related to the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. The NHS is primarily funded by the government and is intended to provide healthcare services to the general public. Therefore, the most likely target audience for this publication would be the general public. We can rule out options A (GPs) and D (patients admitted to hospital) as they are more specific groups within the healthcare system. Option B (patient lobby groups) is also unlikely as the publication is not specifically aimed at advocacy or campaigning for patients. The only remaining option is C (the general public).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Many of the surgical journals now require completion of a CONSORT checklist prior to submission of the RCT manu-script (Fig. 51-3). Establishing this requirement has standard-ized the way articles are presented and analyzed. The two key aspects to focus on when assessing a RCT are internal and external validity.Internal ValidityDetermining the degree that the results of the RCT are accurate and consistent for the sample patients is called internal validity. Without internal validity, a study cannot be properly appraised, as the study was not constructed properly to answer the hypoth-esis without avoiding bias or confounding factors.21 The internal validity of a RCT requires the evaluation of several properties: randomization, blinding, equivalence among groups, complete-ness of follow-up, and"
