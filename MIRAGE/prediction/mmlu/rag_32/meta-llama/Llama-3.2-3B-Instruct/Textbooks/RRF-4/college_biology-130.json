The xylem is a type of vascular tissue in plants that is responsible for transporting water and minerals from the roots to the rest of the plant. There are several types of xylem cells, but the two types that provide support and conduct water and minerals are tracheids and vessel elements. Tracheids are dead cells that provide support and are typically found in soft woods, while vessel elements are also dead cells that are longer and more narrow, and are typically found in hardwoods. Companion cells are also found in the xylem and are responsible for loading and unloading sugars produced by photosynthesis into the xylem. Sieve tube members are also found in the xylem and are responsible for conducting sugars produced by photosynthesis, but they are not primarily responsible for providing support. Collenchyma and sclerenchyma are types of parenchyma cells that are found in the cortex and pericarp of plants, and are not typically found in the xylem. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

When plant cells become specialized, they generally adopt a specific shape and produce specially adapted types of walls, according to which the different types of cells in a plant can be recognized and classified. We focus here, however, on the primary cell wall and the molecular architecture that underlies its remarkable combination of strength, resilience, and plasticity, as seen in the growing parts of a plant. the tensile Strength of the Cell Wall allows plant Cells to Develop turgor pressure"

            "content": "All cell walls in plants have their origin in dividing cells, as the cell plate forms during cytokinesis to create a new partition wall between the daughter cells (discussed in Chapter 17). The new cells are usually produced in special regions called meristems, and they are generally small in comparison with their final size. To accommodate subsequent cell growth, the walls of the newborn cells, called primary cell walls, are thin and extensible, although tough. Once cell growth stops, the wall no longer needs to be extensible: sometimes the primary wall is retained without major modification, but, more commonly, a rigid secondary cell wall is produced by depositing new layers of matrix inside the old ones. These new layers generally have a composition that is significantly different from that of the primary wall. The most common additional polymer in secondary walls is lignin, a complex network of covalently linked phenolic compounds found in the walls of the xylem vessels and fiber"

Although the fluid in the plant cell wall contains more solutes than does the water in the plant\u2019s external milieu (for example, soil), it is still hypotonic in comparison with the cell interior. This osmotic imbalance causes the cell to develop a large internal hydrostatic pressure, or turgor pressure, which pushes outward on the cell wall, just as an inner tube pushes outward on a tire. The turgor pressure increases just to the point where the cell is in osmotic equilibrium, with no net influx of water despite the salt imbalance. The turgor pressure generated in this way may reach 10 or more atmospheres, about five times that in the average car tire. This pressure is vital to plants because it is the main driving force for cell expansion during growth, and it provides much of the mechanical rigidity of living plant tissues.

Although plants produce abundant amounts of both ATP and NADPH in their chloroplasts, this organelle is isolated from the rest of its plant cell by a membrane that is impermeable to both types of activated carrier molecules. Moreover, the plant contains many cells\u2014such as those in the roots\u2014 that lack chloroplasts and therefore cannot produce their own sugars. Thus, sugars are exported from chloroplasts to the mitochondria present in all cells of the plant. Most of the ATP needed for general plant cell metabolism is synthesized in these mitochondria, using exactly the same pathways for the oxidative breakdown of sugars as in nonphotosynthetic organisms; this ATP is then passed to the rest of the cell (see Figure 14\u201342)."

The manner of this expansion determines the final shape of each cell, and hence the final form of the plant as a whole. Turgor pressure inside the cell drives the expansion, but it is the behavior of the cell wall that governs its direction and extent. Complex wall-remodeling activities are required, as well as the deposition of new wall materials. Because of their crystalline structure, the individual cellulose microfibrils in the wall are unable to stretch, and this gives them a crucial role in the process. For the cell wall to stretch or deform, the microfibrils must either slide past one another or become more widely separated, or both. The orientation of the microfibrils in the innermost layers of the wall governs the direction in which the cell expands. Cells in plants therefore anticipate their future morphology by controlling the"

            "content": "Cell culture is not limited to animal cells. When a piece of plant tissue is cul-50 \u00b5m tured in a sterile medium containing nutrients and appropriate growth regulators, many of the cells are stimulated to proliferate indefinitely in a disorganized manner, producing a mass of relatively undifferentiated cells called a callus. If the nutrients and growth regulators are carefully manipulated, one can induce the formation of a shoot and then root apical meristems within the callus, and, in many species, regenerate a whole new plant. Similar to animal cells, callus cultures can be mechanically dissociated into single cells, which will grow and divide as a suspension culture (see Figure 8\u20133D).

            "content": "light energy and power the transfer of electrons, not unlike a photocell in a solar panel. The chloroplasts drive electron transfer in the direction opposite to that in mitochondria: electrons are taken from water to produce O2, and these electrons are used (via NADPH, a molecule closely related to the NADH used in mitochondria) to synthesize carbohydrates from CO2 and water. These carbohydrates then serve as the source for all other compounds a plant cell needs. Thus, both mitochondria and chloroplasts make use of an electron-transfer chain to produce an H+ gradient that powers reactions that are critical for the cell. However, chloroplasts generate O2 and take up CO2, whereas mitochondria consume O2 and release CO2 (see Figure 14\u20134)."
