Triacylglycerides are a type of lipid that consists of a glycerol backbone with three fatty acid chains attached to it via ester linkages. The glycerol backbone is a key component of TAGs, not a ribose backbone. Ribose is a component of nucleic acids, not lipids. The correct options for the structure of triacylglycerides are therefore glycerol backbone and ester linkages. However, the question asks for the incorrect options, so we need to find the opposite. The correct answer is not among the options A, B, or C. The only option that is the opposite of the correct answer is D. II and IV. This is because triacylglycerides consist of a glycerol backbone and three ester linkages, not ribose backbone and three phosphodiester linkages.

PHOSPHOLIPID STRUCTURE There are two classes of phospholipids: those that have glycerol (from glucose) as a backbone and those that have sphingosine (from serine and palmitate). Both classes are found as structural components of membranes, and both play a role in the generation of lipid signaling molecules. A. Glycerophospholipids Phospholipids that contain glycerol are called glycerophospholipids (or phosphoglycerides). Glycerophospholipids constitute the major class of phospholipids and are the predominant lipids in membranes. All contain (or are derivatives of) phosphatidic acid (PA), which is DAG with a phosphate group on carbon 3 (Fig. 17.1B). PA is the simplest phosphoglyceride and is the precursor of the other members of this group. 1.

The resulting long, unbranched chain has polarity, with both a 5\u2032-end (the end with the free phosphate) and a 3\u2032-end (the end with the free hydroxyl) that are not attached to other nucleotides. By convention, the bases located along the resulting deoxyribose-phosphate backbone are always written in sequence from the 5\u2032-end of the chain to the 3\u2032-end. For example, the sequence of bases in the DNA shown in Figure 30.2D (5\u2032-TACG-3\u2032) is read \u201cthymine, adenine, cytosine, guanine.\u201d Phosphodiester linkages between nucleotides can be hydrolyzed enzymatically by a family of nucleases, deoxyribonucleases for DNA and ribonucleases for RNA, or cleaved hydrolytically by chemicals.

            "content": "The plasma lipoproteins (see Fig. 18.29) include chylomicrons, verylow-density lipoproteins (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). They function to keep lipids (primarily triacylglycerol [TAG] and cholesteryl esters) soluble as they transport them between tissues. Lipoproteins are composed of a neutral lipid (TAG, cholesteryl esters, or both) core surrounded by a shell of amphipathic apolipoproteins, phospholipid, and nonesterified cholesterol. Chylomicrons are assembled in intestinal mucosal cells from dietary lipids (primarily TAG). Each nascent chylomicron particle has one molecule of apolipoprotein (apo) B-48. They are released from the cells into the lymphatic system and travel to the blood, where they receive apo C-II and apo E from HDL. Apo C-II activates endothelial lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which degrades the TAG in chylomicrons to FA and glycerol. The FA that are released are stored (in adipose"

            "content": "A. Structure The bile acids contain 24 carbons, with two or three hydroxyl groups and a side chain that terminates in a carboxyl group. The carboxyl group has a pKa (see p. 6) of ~6. In the duodenum (pH ~6), this group will be protonated in half of the molecules (the bile acids) and deprotonated in the rest (the bile salts). The terms bile acid and bile salt are frequently used interchangeably, however. Both forms have hydroxyl groups that are \u03b1 in orientation (they lie below the plane of the rings) and methyl groups that are \u03b2 (they lie above the plane of the rings). Therefore, the molecules have both a polar and a nonpolar surface and can act as emulsifying agents in the intestine, helping prepare dietary fat (triacylglycerol [TAG]) and other complex lipids for degradation by pancreatic digestive enzymes.

            "content": "The mixture of lipids absorbed by the enterocytes migrates to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) where biosynthesis of complex lipids takes place. The long-chain FA are first converted into their activated form by fatty acyl coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase (thiokinase), as shown in Figure 15.6. Using the fatty acyl CoA derivatives, the 2-MAG absorbed by the enterocytes are converted to TAG through sequential reacylations by two acyltransferases, acyl CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase and acyl CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase. Lysophospholipids are reacylated to form phospholipids by a family of acyltransferases, and cholesterol is acylated primarily by acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (see p. 232). [Note: Virtually all long-chain FA entering the enterocytes are used in this fashion to form TAG, phospholipids, and cholesteryl esters. Short-and medium-chain FA are not converted to their CoA derivatives and are not reesterified to 2-MAG. Instead, they are released into the"
