    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up of sarcoidosis. His only new complaint is pain in his legs that increases with weight-bearing. He has been taking glucocorticoid therapy for the past 6 months. Vital signs now are temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 78/min, respirations 14/min, and blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg. The patient is thin and is in no acute distress. Auscultation of the chest discloses scattered bilateral basilar crackles. There is mild left hip pain present with both active and passive range of motion. Dorsalis pedis pulse is intact. Neurologic examination is normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of sarcoidosis and is taking glucocorticoid therapy, which can increase the risk of osteoporosis. The patient's symptoms of pain in the legs that increases with weight-bearing, mild left hip pain, and scattered bilateral basilar crackles on chest auscultation are consistent with osteoporosis. The patient's thinness and lack of acute distress also support this diagnosis. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (A) is a possible complication of steroid use, but it typically presents with a more sudden onset of pain and limited mobility, which is not the case here. Herniated nucleus pulposus (B) would likely cause lower back pain and neurological symptoms, which are not present in this patient. Narrowing of the hip joint (C) could cause hip pain, but it is not directly related to the patient's weight-bearing pain and is not a common complication of sarcoidosis. Osteoporosis (D) is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms, given the patient's history of glucocorticoid therapy and symptoms consistent with osteoporosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

This subject is mentioned briefly in other sections of this book in relation to back and extremity pain (see Chap. 10) and to temporal arteritis, to which it is closely connected (see Chap. 9). The muscular soreness may be diffuse or asymmetrical, particularly in the proximal arms and shoulders. Every movement is reported as stiff and painful. The periarticular tissues and their muscular attachments are affected primarily and may be tender, but this is difficult to interpret, because tenderness in these regions may be found in healthy individuals. The sedimentation rate is elevated in the majority of patients, and a 48-h trial of prednisone, by completely alleviating muscle pain, confirms the diagnosis. In the context of muscle pain, systemic symptoms such as weight loss, headache, and fatigue, as well as mild anemia, are particularly suggestive of"

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis? Does the patient have a heightened risk of developing medication toxicity? If so, which medication(s) would be likely to cause toxicity?"
