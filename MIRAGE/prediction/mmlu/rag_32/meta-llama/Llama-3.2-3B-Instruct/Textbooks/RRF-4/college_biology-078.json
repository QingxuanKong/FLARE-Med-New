The key concept here is that the activity of an enzyme can be affected by the pH level, as it can influence the ionization state of ionizable groups on the enzyme. If the enzyme activity is constant over a broad range of pH values, it suggests that the ionizing groups on the enzyme are not participating in the reaction. This is because changes in pH would affect the ionization state of these groups, leading to changes in enzyme activity.

C. pH 1. pH effect on active site ionization: The concentration of protons ([H+]) affects reaction velocity in several ways. First, the catalytic process usually requires that the enzyme and substrate have specific chemical groups in either an ionized or unionized state in order to interact. For example, catalytic activity may require that an amino group of the enzyme be in the protonated form (\u2212NH3+). Because this group is deprotonated at alkaline pH, the rate of the reaction declines. 2."

Maximal velocity: The rate or velocity of a reaction (v) is the number of substrate molecules converted to product per unit time. Velocity is usually expressed as \u00b5mol of product formed per minute.

Enzymes not only bind tightly to a transition state, they also contain precisely positioned atoms that alter the electron distributions in the atoms that participate directly in the making and breaking of covalent bonds. Peptide bonds, for example, can be hydrolyzed in the absence of an enzyme by exposing a polypeptide to either a strong acid or a strong base. Enzymes are unique, however, in being able to use acid and base catalysis simultaneously, because the rigid framework of the protein constrains the acidic and basic residues and prevents them from combining with each other, as they would do in solution (Figure 3\u201349)."

There is a limit to the amount of substrate that a single enzyme molecule can process in a given time. Although an increase in the concentration of substrate increases the rate at which product is formed, this rate eventually reaches a maximum value (Figure 3\u201346). At that point the enzyme molecule is saturated with substrate, and the rate of reaction (Vmax) depends only on how rapidly the enzyme can process the substrate molecule.

Turnover numbers are often about 1000 substrate molecules processed per second per enzyme molecule, although turnover numbers between 1 and 10,000 are known."

But as any favorable reaction proceeds, the concentrations of the products will increase as the concentration of the substrates decreases. This change in relative concentrations will cause [X]/[Y] to become increasingly large, making the initially favorable \u2206G less and less negative (the logarithm of a number x is positive for x > 1, negative for x < 1, and zero for x =1). Eventually, when \u2206G = 0, a chemical equilibrium will be attained; here there is no net change in free energy to drive the reaction in either direction, inasmuch as the concentration effect just balances the push given to the reaction by \u2206G\u00b0. As a result, the ratio of product to substrate reaches a constant value at chemical equilibrium (Figure 2\u201330)."

            "content": "2. Rate of reaction: For molecules to react, they must contain sufficient energy to overcome the energy barrier of the transition state. In the absence of an enzyme, only a small proportion of a population of molecules may possess enough energy to achieve the transition state between reactant and product. The rate of reaction is determined by the number of such energized molecules. In general, the lower the Ea, the more molecules have sufficient energy to pass through the transition state and, therefore, the faster the rate of the reaction. 3. Alternate reaction pathway: An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower Ea (see Fig. 5.4). The enzyme does not change the free energies of the reactants (substrates) or products and, therefore, does not change the equilibrium of the reaction (see p. 70). It does, however, accelerate the rate by which equilibrium is reached."

Shape of the enzyme kinetics curve: Most enzymes show Michaelis-Menten kinetics (see p. 58), in which the plot of initial reaction velocity (vo) against substrate concentration is hyperbolic (similar in shape to that of the oxygen-dissociation curve of myoglobin; see p. 29). In contrast, allosteric enzymes do not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics and show a sigmoidal curve (see Fig. 5.6) that is similar in shape to the oxygen-dissociation curve of hemoglobin (see p. 29). B. Temperature 1. Velocity increase with temperature: The reaction velocity increases with temperature until a peak velocity is reached (Fig. 5.7). This increase is the result of the increased number of substrate molecules having sufficient energy to pass over the energy barrier and form the products of the reaction. 2."

In this way, one can predict the direction of a reaction and thereby readily check the feasibility of any proposed mechanism. Thus, for example, from the observed values for the magnitude of the electrochemical proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane and the \u02dcG for ATP hydrolysis inside the mitochondrion, one can be certain that ATP synthase requires the passage of more than one proton for each molecule of ATP that it synthesizes. The value of \u02dcG for a reaction is a direct measure of how far the reaction is from equilibrium. The large negative value for ATP hydrolysis in a cell merely refects the fact that cells keep the ATP hydrolysis reaction as much as 10 orders of magnitude away from equilibrium. If a reaction reaches equilibrium, \u02dcG = 0, the reaction then proceeds at"
