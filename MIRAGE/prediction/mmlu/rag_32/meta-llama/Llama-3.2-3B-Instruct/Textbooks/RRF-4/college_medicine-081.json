Like most enzymes, these have names ending in ase\u2014such as isomerase and dehydrogenase\u2014to indicate the type of reaction they catalyze. Although no molecular oxygen is used in glycolysis, oxidation occurs, in that electrons are removed by NAD+ (producing NADH) from some of the carbons derived from the glucose molecule. The stepwise nature of the process releases the energy of oxidation in small packets, so that much of it can be stored in activated carrier molecules rather than all of it being released as heat (see Figure 2\u201345). Thus, some of the energy released by oxidation drives the direct synthesis of ATP molecules from ADP and Pi, and some remains with the electrons in the electron carrier NADH."

Glycolysis is at the hub of carbohydrate metabolism because virtually all sugars, whether arising from the diet or from catabolic reactions in the body, can ultimately be converted to glucose (Fig. 8.9A). Pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis in cells with mitochondria and an adequate supply of O2. This series of ten reactions is called aerobic glycolysis because O2 is required to reoxidize the NADH formed during the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (Fig. 8.9B). Aerobic glycolysis sets the stage for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, a major fuel of the TCA cycle. Alternatively, pyruvate is reduced to lactate as NADH is oxidized to NAD+ (Fig. 8.9C).

For each glucose molecule, two molecules of ATP are hydrolyzed to provide energy to drive the early steps, but four molecules of ATP are produced in the later steps.

Uridine diphosphate\u2013galactose formation Galactose 1-phosphate cannot enter the glycolytic pathway unless it is first converted to uridine diphosphate (UDP)-galactose (Fig. 12.6). This occurs in an exchange reaction, in which UDP-glucose reacts with galactose 1phosphate, producing UDP-galactose and glucose 1-phosphate (see Fig. 12.5). The reaction is catalyzed by galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT). [Note: The glucose 1-phosphate product can be isomerized to glucose 6-phosphate, which can enter glycolysis or be dephosphorylated.] C. UDP-galactose conversion to UDP-glucose For UDP-galactose to enter the mainstream of glucose metabolism, it must first be isomerized to its C-4 epimer, UDP-glucose, by UDP-hexose 4epimerase. This \u201cnew\u201d UDP-glucose (produced from the original UDPgalactose) can participate in biosynthetic reactions (for example, glycogenesis) as well as in the GALT reaction.

            "content": "The nonoxidative reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway occur in all cell types synthesizing nucleotides and nucleic acids. These reactions catalyze the interconversion of sugars containing three to seven carbons (see Fig. 13.2). These reversible reactions permit ribulose 5-phosphate (produced by the oxidative portion of the pathway) to be converted either to ribose 5-phosphate (needed for nucleotide synthesis; see p. 293) or to intermediates of glycolysis (that is, fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate). For example, many cells that carry out reductive biosynthetic reactions have a greater need for NADPH than for ribose 5-phosphate. In this case, transketolase (which transfers two-carbon units in a thiamine pyrophosphate [TPP]-requiring reaction) and transaldolase (which transfers three-carbon units) convert the ribulose 5phosphate produced as an end product of the oxidative phase to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate, which are glycolytic"

This phenomenon, called the Warburg effect and also known as aerobic glycolysis, has been recognized for many years (indeed, Otto Warburg received the Nobel Prize in 1931 for its discovery). Clinically, the \u201cglucose-hunger\u201d of tumors is used to visualize tumors via positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, in which patients are injected with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, a glucose derivative that is preferentially taken up into tumor cells (as well as normal, actively dividing tissues such as the bone marrow). Most tumors are PET-positive, and rapidly growing ones are markedly so."

A detailed study of the rates of the chemical reactions that are catalyzed by a purifed enzyme\u2014more specifcally how these rates change with changes in conditions such as the concentrations of substrates, products, inhibitors, and regulatory ligands\u2014allows biochemists to fgure out exactly how each enzyme works. For example, this is the way that the ATP-producing reactions of glycolysis, shown previously in Figure 2\u201348, were deciphered\u2014allowing us to appreciate the rationale for this critical enzymatic pathway.

Summary of the reactions of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis Of the 11 reactions required to convert pyruvate to free glucose, 7 are catalyzed by reversible glycolytic enzymes (Fig. 10.7). The 3 irreversible reactions (catalyzed by hexokinase/glucokinase, PFK-1, and PK) are circumvented by reactions catalyzed by glucose 6-phosphatase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, PC, and PEPCK. In gluconeogenesis, the equilibria of the reversible glycolytic reactions are pushed toward glucose synthesis as a result of the essentially irreversible formation of PEP, fructose 6-phosphate, and glucose by the gluconeogenic enzymes. [Note: The stoichiometry of gluconeogenesis from two pyruvate molecules couples the cleavage of six high-energy phosphate bonds and the oxidation of two NADH with the formation of one glucose molecule (see Fig. 10.7).] IV.
