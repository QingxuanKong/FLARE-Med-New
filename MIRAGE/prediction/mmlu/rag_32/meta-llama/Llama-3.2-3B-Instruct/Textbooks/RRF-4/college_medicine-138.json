According to the provided documents, hematopoietic stem cells differentiate into multipotent progenitor cells (MPPs) that can produce both lymphoid and myeloid cells. However, in AML, myeloid progenitor cells become rapidly dividing and retain their semi-stem cell state. This suggests that they are committed to the myeloid lineage. Further down the lineage, myeloid progenitor cells give rise to specific lineage-restricted progenitors, such as granulocytes, erythrocytes, and megakaryocytes. Since the question asks about the cell type that would arise from the stem cell, we need to look for the most basic cell type that is directly derived from the stem cell in the myeloid lineage. Based on the documents, the common myeloid progenitors mature into either monocytes and granulocytes or erythrocytes and megakaryocytes, but not both. This suggests that the correct answer is a cell type that is directly derived from the myeloid progenitor cell, which is the granulocyte.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Acute and chronic myeloid leukemias (AML and CML) have a small population of cells (<1%) that have properties of stem cells, such as unlimited self-renewal and the capacity to cause leukemia when serially transplanted in mice. These cells have an undifferentiated phenotype (Thy1\u2212 CD34+CD38\u2013 and do not express other differentiation markers) and resemble normal stem cells in many ways, but are no longer under homeostatic control (Fig. 102e-7). Solid tumors may also contain a population of stem cells. Cancer stem cells, like their normal counterparts, have unlimited proliferative capacity and paradoxically traverse the cell cycle at a very slow rate; cancer growth occurs largely due to expansion of the stem cell pool, the unregulated proliferation of an amplifying population, and failure of apoptosis"

Our knowledge of the details remains incomplete. As stem cells mature to progenitors, precursors, and, finally, mature effector cells, they undergo a series of functional changes. These include the obvious acquisition of functions defining mature blood cells, such as phagocytic capacity or hemoglobin synthesis. They also include the progressive loss of plasticity (i.e., the ability to become other cell types).

These 132 leukemias comprise a spectrum of malignancies that, untreated, range from rapidly fatal to slowly growing. In 2013, the estimated number of new AML cases in the United States was 14,590. The incidence of AML is ~3.5 per 100,000 people per year, and the age-adjusted incidence is higher in men than in women (4.5 vs 3.1). AML incidence increases with age; it is 1.7 in individuals age <65 years and 15.9 in those age >65 years. The median age at diagnosis is 67 years."

Any single genetic event is unlikely to be sufficient to enable full transformation of a normal cell to a frankly malignant one.

            "content": "The four oncologic emergencies: hypercalcemia, spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, and leukostasis. Acute myelogenous and lymphocytic leukemias are clonal disorders of early hematopoietic stem cells. They are characterized by rapid growth of immature blood cells (blasts), which overwhelms the ability of bone marrow to produce normal cells. Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) affect children as well as adults. ALL is the most common childhood malignancy. Disease onset and progression are rapid; patients present with signs and symptoms of anemia (pallor, fatigue) and thrombocytopenia (petechiae, purpura, bleeding). Medullary expansion and periosteal involvement may lead to bone pain (common in ALL). On exam, patients may have hepatosplenomegaly and swollen/bleeding gums from leukemic infiltration and \u2193 platelets. Leukemic cells also infiltrate the skin and CNS."

            "content": "http://ebooksmedicine.net In myeloproliferative neoplasms, the neoplastic clone continues to undergo terminal differentiation but exhibits increased or dysregulated growth. Commonly, these are associated with an increase in one or more of the formed elements (red cells, platelets, and/or granulocytes) in the peripheral blood. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), terminal differentiation occurs but in a disordered and ineffective fashion, leading to the appearance of dysplastic marrow precursors and peripheral blood cytopenias. Although these three categories provide a useful starting point, the divisions between the myeloid neoplasms sometimes blur. Both MDS and myeloproliferative neoplasms often transform to AML, and some neoplasms have features of both myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Because all myeloid neoplasms arise from early multipotent progenitors, the close relationship among these disorders is not surprising."

            "content": "The natural history of CML initially is one of slow progression. Even without treatment, the median survival is 3 years. After a variable (and unpredictable) period, approximately half of CML cases enter an accelerated phase marked by increasing anemia and new thrombocytopenia, the appearance of additional cytogenetic abnormalities, and finally transformation into a picture resembling acute leukemia (blast crisis). In the remaining 50% of cases, blast crisis occurs abruptly, without an accelerated phase. Of note, in 30% of cases the blast crisis resembles precursor-B cell ALL, further attesting to the origin of CML from hematopoietic stem cells. In the remaining 70% of cases, the blast crisis resembles AML. Less commonly, CML progresses to a phase of extensive bone marrow fibrosis resembling primary myelofibrosis."
