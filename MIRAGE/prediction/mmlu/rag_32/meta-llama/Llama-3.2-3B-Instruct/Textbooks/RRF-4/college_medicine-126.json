Oxidative phosphorylation involves the transfer of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen, resulting in the production of ATP and water.\\n\\nIn the absence of oxygen, cells use anaerobic glycolysis to produce ATP. Anaerobic glycolysis is a less efficient process that produces only 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule, compared to the 36-38 ATP molecules produced by oxidative phosphorylation in the presence of oxygen.\\n\\nConsidering the options provided, we can infer that the molecule that will stop being produced first when oxygen is no longer supplied to the cell is pyruvate. This is because pyruvate is a product of glycolysis, which is an anaerobic process that occurs in the absence of oxygen. When oxygen is no longer supplied, the cell will switch to anaerobic glycolysis, resulting in a decrease in pyruvate production.\\n\\nThe other options are not directly affected by the presence or absence of oxygen:\\n\\n* Oxaloacetate is a key intermediate in the citric acid cycle, which occurs in the presence of oxygen.\\n\\n* Water is a byproduct of oxidative phosphorylation, which occurs in the presence of oxygen.\\n\\n* Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the primary energy currency of the cell and is produced through both oxidative phosphorylation and anaerobic glycolysis.

Only when deprived of oxygen will these cells generate most of their ATP from glycolysis, converting the pyruvate produced to lactate in order to regenerate the NAD+ that they need to keep glycolysis going (see Figure 2\u201347). (B) Tumor cells, by contrast, will generally produce abundant lactate even in the presence of oxygen. This results from a greatly increased rate of glycolysis that is fed by a very large increase in the rate of glucose import. In this way, tumor cells resemble the rapidly proliferating cells in embryos (and during tissue repair), which likewise require for biosynthesis a large supply of the small-molecule building blocks that can be produced from imported glucose (see also Figure 20\u201326)."

Thus, the evolution of cellular respiration, in which O2 is converted to water, enabled organisms to harness much more energy than can be derived from anaerobic metabolism. As we discuss later, the availability of the large amount of energy released by the reduction of molecular oxygen to form water is thought to have been essential to the emergence of multicellular life: this would explain why all large organisms respire. The ability of biological systems to use O2 in this way, however, requires sophisticated chemistry. Once a molecule of O2 has picked up one electron, it forms a superoxide radical anion (O2\u2022\u2013) that is dangerously reactive and rapidly takes up an additional three electrons wherever it can get them, with destructive effects on its immediate environment.

One hypothesis is that peroxisomes are a vestige of an ancient organelle that performed all the oxygen metabolism in the primitive ancestors of eukaryotic cells.

Peroxisomes might have lowered the intracellular concentration of oxygen, while also exploiting its chemical reactivity to perform useful oxidation reactions. According to this view, the later development of mitochondria rendered peroxisomes largely obsolete because many of the same biochemical reactions\u2014which had formerly been carried out in peroxisomes without producing energy\u2014were now coupled to ATP formation by means of oxidative phosphorylation.

Because two molecules of aTp are hydrolyzed in the early, energy-investment phase, glycolysis results in the net synthesis of 2 aTp and 2 naDh molecules per molecule of glucose (see also panel 2\u20138).

In this way, one can predict the direction of a reaction and thereby readily check the feasibility of any proposed mechanism. Thus, for example, from the observed values for the magnitude of the electrochemical proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane and the \u02dcG for ATP hydrolysis inside the mitochondrion, one can be certain that ATP synthase requires the passage of more than one proton for each molecule of ATP that it synthesizes. The value of \u02dcG for a reaction is a direct measure of how far the reaction is from equilibrium. The large negative value for ATP hydrolysis in a cell merely refects the fact that cells keep the ATP hydrolysis reaction as much as 10 orders of magnitude away from equilibrium. If a reaction reaches equilibrium, \u02dcG = 0, the reaction then proceeds at"
