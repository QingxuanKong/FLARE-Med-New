He also has a 1-week history of progressive fatigue. He recently began having unprotected sexual intercourse with one partner. He appears ill. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F).

    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To approach this question, let's consider the symptoms and signs presented by the 14-year-old boy: a 2-day history of sore throat and fever that peaks in the late afternoon, progressive fatigue over the past week, cervical lymphadenopathy, and pharyngeal erythema with a creamy exudate. These symptoms are suggestive of an infectious etiology. The recent onset of unprotected sexual intercourse is also a significant clue. Let's evaluate each option: A. Candidiasis is unlikely as it typically presents with white plaques on the mucous membranes, not a creamy exudate. B. Herpangina is a viral infection that presents with small, painful ulcers on the soft palate and tonsils, which doesn't match the description of a creamy exudate. C. Infectious mononucleosis is a possibility given the sore throat, fever, fatigue, and cervical lymphadenopathy, especially in a teenager. The creamy exudate on the pharynx is also consistent with this diagnosis. D. Mumps is less likely as it typically presents with swelling of the parotid glands, not cervical lymphadenopathy. Given the symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is infectious mononucleosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

A prodrome of fatigue, malaise, and myalgia may last for 1\u20132 weeks before the onset of fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy. Fever is usually low-grade and is most common in the first 2 weeks of the illness; however, it may persist for >1 month. Common signs and symptoms are listed along with their frequencies in Table 218-1. Lymphadenopathy and pharyngitis are most prominent during the first 2 weeks of the illness, while splenomegaly is more prominent during the second and third weeks. Lymphadenopathy most often affects the posterior cervical nodes but may be generalized. Enlarged lymph nodes are frequently tender and symmetric but are not fixed in place. Pharyngitis, often the most prominent sign, can be accompanied by enlargement of the tonsils with an exudate resembling that of streptococcal pharyngitis. A morbilliform or papular rash, usually on the arms or trunk, develops in ~5% of cases (Fig. 218-1). Many patients"

            "content": "The physician will be aided in the pursuit of an explanation for the lymphadenopathy by a careful medical history, physical examination, selected laboratory tests, and perhaps an excisional lymph node biopsy. The medical history should reveal the setting in which lymphadenopathy is occurring. Symptoms such as sore throat, cough, fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, or pain in the nodes should be sought. The patient\u2019s age, sex, occupation, exposure to pets, sexual behavior, and use of drugs such as diphenylhydantoin are other important historic points. For example, children and young adults usually have benign (i.e., nonmalignant) disorders that account for the observed lymphadenopathy such as viral or bacterial upper respiratory infections; infectious mononucleosis; toxoplasmosis; and, in some countries, tuberculosis. In contrast, after age 50, the incidence of malignant disorders increases and that of benign disorders decreases."

The onset of streptococcal pharyngitis is often rapid and associated with prominent sore throat and moderate to high fever. Headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are frequent. In a typical, florid case, the pharynx is distinctly red. The tonsils are enlarged and covered with a yellow, blood-tinged exudate. There may be petechiae or doughnut-shapedlesions on the soft palate and posterior pharynx. The uvula may be red, stippled, and swollen. Anterior cervical lymph nodes are enlarged and tender to touch.

            "content": "he incubation period from exposure to clinical disease averages 3 to 6 weeks. Acute HIV infection is similar to many other viral syndromes and usually lasts less than 10 days. Common symptoms, if any, include fever, fatigue, rash, headache, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, myalgias, nausea, and diarrhea. After symptoms abate, the level of viremia usually decreases to a set point, and patients with the highest viral burden at this time progress more rapidly to AIDS and death (Fauci, 2007). According to the CDC, AIDS is defined by a CD4 T-cell count <200 cells/lLL, by CD4 T-cells comprising < 14 percent of alirlymphocytes, or one of several AIDS-defining illnesses (Schneider, 2008; Selik, 2014). Route of infection, the pathogenicity of the infecting viral strain, the initial viral inoculum, and the immunological status of the host all afect the rapidity of progression."

A morbilliform or papular rash, usually on the arms or trunk, develops in ~5% of cases (Fig. 218-1). Many patients treated with ampicillin develop a macular rash; this rash is not predictive of future adverse reactions to penicillins. Erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme also have been described (Chap. 72). The severity of the disease correlates with the levels of CD8+ T cells and EBV DNA in the blood. Most patients have symptoms for 2\u20134 weeks, but nearly 10% have fatigue that persists for \u22656 months."

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

Leukemia, lymphoma, and occasionally neuroblastoma may have lymph nodes that areusually painless, uninflamed, matted, and firm (see Chapters 155 and 156). A syndrome of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenitis is an occasional cause of recurrent fever and cervical lymphadenitis (seeChapter 103)."

Important findings include presence or absence of dental disease, oropharyngeal or skin lesions, ocular disease, other nodal enlargement, and any other signs of systemic illness, including hepatosplenomegaly and skin lesions. Acute cervical lymphadenopathy associated with pharyngitis is characterized by small and rubbery lymph nodes in the anterior cervical chain with minimal to moderate tenderness. Suppurative cervical lymphadenitis, frequently caused by S. aureus or group A streptococcus, shows erythema and warmth of the overlying skin with moderate to exquisite tenderness."
