Document [20] states that intravascular device-related bacteremias cause ~10\u201315% of nosocomial infections, and central vascular catheters (CVCs) account for most of these bloodstream infections. Document [20] also mentions that ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) occurs in 1 to >4 patients per 1000 ventilator-days. However, Document [20] does not mention the second commonest hospital-acquired infection. Document [22] states that urinary tract infections accounted for approximately 16% of hospital-acquired infections, but it does not specify if this includes urinary tract infections related to catheter use. Document [20] and Document [22] do not provide enough information to determine the second commonest hospital-acquired infection. However, Document [19] states that the most common hospital-acquired infections are pneumonia, urinary tract infections, wound infections, and bloodstream infections. Based on the information provided, it is reasonable to infer that ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common hospital-acquired infection, but the second commonest hospital-acquired infection is not explicitly stated in the documents. However, based on the information provided in Document [19], we can make an educated guess that the second commonest hospital-acquired infection is likely to be urinary tract infections.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

In the past, pneumonia was typically classified as community-acquired (CAP), hospital-acquired (HAP), or ventilator-associated (VAP). Over the past two decades, however, some persons presenting with onset of pneumonia as outpatients have been found to be infected with the multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens previously associated with HAP. Factors responsible for this phenomenon include the development and widespread use of potent oral antibiotics, earlier transfer of patients out of acute-care hospitals to their homes or various lower-acuity facilities, increased use of outpatient IV antibiotic therapy, general aging of the population, and more extensive immunomodulatory therapies. The potential involvement of these MDR pathogens has led to a designation for a new category of pneumonia\u2014health care\u2013associated pneumonia (HCAP)\u2014that is distinct from CAP.

However, if patients have other risk factors for HCAP, MDR pathogens are a consideration, even early in the hospital course. The relative frequency of individual MDR pathogens can vary significantly from hospital to hospital and even between different critical care units within the same institution. Most hospitals have problems with P. aeruginosa and MRSA, but other MDR pathogens are often institution-specific. Less commonly, fungal and viral pathogens cause VAP, usually affecting severely immunocompromised patients. Rarely, community-associated viruses cause mini-epidemics, usually when introduced by ill health care workers."

In fact, blood cultures yield bacteria or fungi in only ~20\u201340% of cases of severe sepsis and 40\u201370% of cases of septic shock. In a prevalence study of 14,414 patients in intensive care units (ICUs) from 75 countries in 2007, 51% of patients were considered infected. Respiratory infection was most common (64%). Microbiologic results were positive in 70% of individuals considered infected; of the isolates, 62% were gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas species and Escherichia coli were most common), 47% were gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus was most common), and 19% were fungi (Candida species). This distribution is similar to that reported a decade earlier from eight academic centers in the United States (Table 325-2). In patients whose blood cultures are negative, the"

It is transmitted by direct contact. There are two types: Common type: Characterized by pustules and honey-colored crusts on an erythematous base; generally appears on the face (see Figure 2.211). Bullous type: Usually acral; characterized by large stable blisters. Bullous impetigo is almost always caused by S. aureus and can evolve into SSSS. Streptococcal impetigo can be complicated by acute streptococcal glomerulonephritis. FIGURE 2.2-11. Impetigo. What is another skin condition caused by group A strep? Erysipelas, which presents as a small red patch on the cheek that turns into a painful raised, shiny red plaque. Patients often have a history of trauma or pharyngitis. Treat with penicillin."

Such risk factors include prior MRSA infection, hospitalization, dialysis or surgery within the past year, and indwelling catheters or devices (Dantes, 2013). Hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) infections are nosocomial. Most cases of \\1RSA in pregnant women are CA-MRSA."

Results of the German CAPNETZ Study showed that, among cases of community-acquired Legionella pneumonia, ambulatory patients were as common as hospitalized patients. Extrapulmonary Legionellosis Because the portal of entry for Legionella is the lung in virtually all cases, extrapulmonary manifestations usually result from bloodborne dissemination from the lung. Legionella has been identified in lymph nodes, spleen, liver, or kidneys in autopsied cases. Sinusitis, peritonitis, pyelonephritis, skin and soft tissue infection, septic arthritis, and pancreatitis have developed predominantly in immunosuppressed patients. The most severe sequela, neurologic dysfunction, is rare but can be debilitating. The most common neurologic deficits in the long term\u2014ataxia and speech difficulties\u2014result from cerebellar dysfunction."
