It is produced by the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and is involved in fatty acid synthesis. In the presence of high insulin levels, ACC is inhibited, leading to decreased malonyl-CoA production and increased fatty acid oxidation.\\n\\nHowever, in the context of the question, we are told that muscle biopsy specimens show significantly increased concentrations of malonyl-CoA in the resting state. This suggests that insulin levels are low, leading to increased ACC activity and malonyl-CoA production.\\n\\nNow, let's examine the options:\\nA. Fatty acid oxidation: Malonyl-CoA actually inhibits fatty acid oxidation, not promotes it. So, this is not the correct answer.\\nB. Fatty acid synthesis: Malonyl-CoA is a key intermediate in fatty acid synthesis, and its increased concentration would promote fatty acid synthesis, not inhibit it. So, this is not the correct answer.\\nC. Gluconeogenesis: Malonyl-CoA can inhibit gluconeogenesis by inhibiting the enzyme pyruvate carboxylase, which is involved in gluconeogenesis. So, this is a possible answer.\\nD. Glycogenolysis: Malonyl-CoA does not have a direct inhibitory effect on glycogenolysis.

Skeletal muscle is a major site for metabolic fuel consumption in the resting state, and the increased muscle activity during vigorous, aerobic exercise greatly increases fuel requirements. Individuals with type 1 DM are prone to either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia during exercise, depending on the preexercise plasma glucose, the circulating insulin level, and the level of exercise-induced catecholamines. If the insulin level is too low, the rise in catecholamines may increase the plasma glucose excessively, promote ketone body formation, and possibly lead to ketoacidosis. Conversely, if the circulating insulin level is excessive, this relative hyperinsulinemia may reduce hepatic glucose production (decreased glycogenolysis, decreased gluconeogenesis) and increase glucose entry into muscle,"

As stated earlier, the circumstances during exercise are somewhat different. During a short period of intense exercise, the muscle uses carbohydrate derived from glycogen stores; myophosphorylase is the enzyme that initiates the metabolism of glycogen. With longer aerobic exercise, blood flow to muscle and the availability of glucose and fatty acids are increased. At first, glucose is the main source of energy during exercise; later, with exhaustion of glycogen stores, energy is provided by oxidation of fatty acids. Thus, muscle failure at a certain phase of exercise is predictive of the type of energy failure. A rising blood concentration of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate reflects the increasing oxidation of fatty acids, and an increase in blood lactate reflects the anaerobic metabolism of glucose.

As indicated earlier, the additional oxygen used during recovery from exercise represents the energy requirements for restoring normal cellular metabolite levels. The ability of muscle to meet energy needs is a major determinant of the duration of the exercise. However, fatigue is not the result of depletion of energy stores. Instead, metabolic byproducts seem to be important factors in the onset of fatigue. Fatigue may potentially occur at any of the points involved in muscle contraction, from the brain to the muscle cells, as well as in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems that maintain energy supplies (i.e., fatty acids and glucose) and oxygen delivery to the exercising muscle. Several factors have been implicated in muscle fatigue. During brief periods of tetany, the oxygen supply to the muscle is adequate as long as the circulation is intact. However, the force/stress generated during these brief"

The cytochrome oxidative mechanisms are essential in both aerobic and anaerobic muscle metabolism; these mechanisms are considered in Chap. 36 in relation to the mitochondrial diseases in which muscle tissue is prominently involved, and they are referred to here only briefly."

This requirement can substantially increase during severe stress states, such as those seen in patients with burn injuries.In the healthy adult, principal sources of fuel during short-term fasting (<5 days) are derived from muscle protein and body fat, with fat being the most abundant source of energy (Table 2-8). The normal adult body contains 300 to 400 g of carbohydrates in the form of glycogen, of which 75 to 100 g are stored in the liver. Approximately 200 to 250 g of glycogen are stored within skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells. The greater glycogen stores within the muscle are not read-ily available for systemic use due to a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase but are available for the energy needs of muscle cells. Therefore, in the fasting state, hepatic glycogen stores are rapidly and preferentially depleted, which results in a fall of serum glucose concentration within hours (<16"
