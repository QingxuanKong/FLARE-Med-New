The question asks for an intracellular buffer that can limit pH changes when glycolysis is high. Glycolysis produces lactic acid, which can decrease extracellular pH and contribute to the slowdown in cellular metabolism. An intracellular buffer would help regulate pH changes within the cell. Let's evaluate each option: A. Glutamine - It is an amino acid, but it is not typically known for its buffering capacity. B. Glucose - It is a sugar that is involved in glycolysis, but it is not a buffer. C. Carnosine - It is a dipeptide that has been shown to act as a buffer, especially in the brain. It can neutralize excess hydrogen ions and help maintain pH homeostasis. D. Amylase - It is an enzyme that breaks down starch into sugars, but it is not a buffer.

As such, they account for the net yield of two ATP molecules and two NADH molecules per molecule of glucose (see Panel 2\u20138, pp. 104\u2013105). As we have just seen, ATP can be formed readily from ADP when a reaction intermediate is formed with a phosphate bond of higher energy than the terminal phosphate bond in ATP. Phosphate bonds can be ordered in energy by comparing the standard free-energy change (\u2206G\u00b0) for the breakage of each bond by hydrolysis.

Although it seems counterintuitive, rapidly proliferating normal cells and cancer cells rely on aerobic glycolysis to produce much of their energy, a phenomenon referred to as the Warburg effect. The reason for this is that although glycolysis yields less ATP per molecule of glucose burned than oxidative phosphorylation, metabolites generated by glycolysis and the TCA cycle serve as precursors for the synthesis of cellular constituents (e.g., proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids) that are needed for cell growth and division. Alterations in cellular metabolism are frequently seen in cancer cells, so they are discussed in more detail in Chapter 6."

Restoration of the blood pH to its normal value requires correction of the underlying process or processes that produced the acid-base disorder. The body has three general mechanisms to defend against changes in body fluid pH produced by acid-base disturbances: (1) extracellular and intracellular buffering, (2) adjustments in blood PCO2 via alterations in the ventilatory rate of the lungs, and (3) adjustments in RNAE. The first line of defense against acid-base disorders is extracellular and intracellular buffering.

First, the decrease in intracellular pH that occurs with acidosis will create a more favorable cell-to\u2013tubular fluid H+ gradient and thereby make secretion of H+ across the apical membrane more energetically favorable. Second, the decrease in pH may lead to allosteric changes in transport proteins, thereby altering their kinetics. Lastly, transporters may be shuttled to the membrane from intracellular vesicles.

In athletes running a marathon, this figure can go up to several hundred kilograms. The ATP produced in mitochondria is derived from the energy available in the intermediates NADH, FADH2, and GTP. These three energy-rich compounds are produced both by the oxidation of glucose (Table 14\u20131A), and by the oxidation of fats (Table 14\u20131B; see also Figure 2\u201356). Glycolysis alone can produce only two molecules of ATP for every molecule of glucose that is metabolized, and this is the total energy yield for the fermentation processes that occur in the absence of O2 (discussed in Chapter 2). In oxidative Figure 14\u201328 A general model for H+ pumping coupled to electron transport."

            "content": "(A) Cells that are not proliferating will normally oxidize nearly all of the glucose that they import from the blood to produce ATP through the oxidative phosphorylation that takes place in their mitochondria. Only when deprived of oxygen will these cells generate most of their ATP from glycolysis, converting the pyruvate produced to lactate in order to regenerate the NAD+ that they need to keep glycolysis going (see Figure 2\u201347). (B) Tumor cells, by contrast, will generally produce abundant lactate even in the presence of oxygen. This results from a greatly increased rate of glycolysis that is fed by a very large increase in the rate of glucose import. In this way, tumor cells resemble the rapidly proliferating cells in embryos (and during tissue repair), which likewise require for biosynthesis a large supply of the small-molecule building blocks that can be produced from imported glucose (see also Figure 20\u201326)."

When oxidizing glucose to CO2, heart muscle consumes O2 at a rate of 10 \u03bcmol/min per g of tissue, in order to replace the ATP used in contraction and give a steady-state ATP concentration of 5 \u03bcmol/g of tissue.

What are the origins and evolutionary history of photosynthetic complexes? are there undiscovered types of photosynthesis present on Earth to help answer this question? Why is the mutation rate so much higher in mitochondria than in the nucleus (and chloroplasts)? Could this high rate have been useful to the cell?"
