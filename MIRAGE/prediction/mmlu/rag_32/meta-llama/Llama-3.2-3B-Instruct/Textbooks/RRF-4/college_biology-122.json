The mitochondrial matrix has a higher pH than the cytosol, and the pH gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane is generated by the pumping of protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space. When the external pH is low, it means the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) is high. This high H+ concentration in the external solution will increase the concentration gradient of H+ across the inner mitochondrial membrane. As a result, the proton gradient will be maintained or even increased, which is necessary for ATP synthesis. The protons will continue to flow down their electrochemical gradient through the membrane part of ATP synthase, driving the synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi. Therefore, low external pH will increase the ATP production in mitochondria isolated in a buffered solution.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Chemiosmotic hypothesis The chemiosmotic hypothesis (also known as the Mitchell hypothesis) explains how the free energy generated by the transport of electrons by the ETC is used to produce ATP from ADP + Pi. 1. Proton pump: Electron transport is coupled to ADP phosphorylation by the pumping of H+ across the inner mitochondrial membrane, from the matrix to the intermembrane space, at Complexes I, III, and IV. For each pair of electrons transferred from NADH to O2, 10 H+ are pumped. This creates an electrical gradient (with more positive charges on the cytosolic side of the membrane than on the matrix side) and a pH (chemical) gradient (the cytosolic side of the membrane is at a lower pH than the matrix side), as shown in Figure 6.13. The energy (proton-motive force) generated by these gradients is sufficient to drive ATP synthesis. Thus, the H+ gradient serves as the common intermediate that couples oxidation to phosphorylation. 2."

Maximum buffering capacity occurs at a pH equal to the pKa, but a conjugate acid-base pair can still serve as an effective buffer when the pH of a solution is within approximately \u00b11 pH unit of the pKa. If the amounts of HA and A\u2212 are equal, the pH is equal to the pKa. As shown in Figure 1.9, a solution containing acetic acid (HA = CH3 \u2013 COOH) and acetate (A\u2212 = CH3 \u2013 COO\u2212) with a pKa of 4.8 resists a change in pH from pH 3.8 to 5.8, with maximum buffering at pH 4.8. At pH values less than the pKa, the protonated acid form (CH3 \u2013 COOH) is the predominant species in solution."

            "content": "As we have just discussed, the three proton pumps of the respiratory chain each contribute to the formation of an electrochemical proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This gradient drives ATP synthesis by ATP synthase, a large membrane-bound protein complex that performs the extraordinary feat of converting the energy contained in this electrochemical gradient into biologically useful, chemical-bond energy in the form of ATP (see Figure 14\u201310). Protons flow down their electrochemical gradient through the membrane part of this proton turbine, thereby driving the synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi in the extramembranous part of the complex. As discussed in Chapter 2, the formation of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate is highly unfavorable energetically. As we shall see, ATP synthase can produce ATP only because of allosteric shape changes in this protein complex that directly couple ATP synthesis to the energetically favorable flow of protons across its membrane."

            "content": "electrochemical proton gradient. This gradient creates a large proton motive force that causes the movement of H to occur down its electrochemical gradient through a large, membrane-bound enzyme called ATP synthase. ATP synthase provides a pathway across the inner mitochondrial membrane in which H ions are used to drive the energetically unfavorable reactions leading to synthesis of ATP. This movement of protons back to the mitochondrial matrix is referred to as chemiosmotic coupling. The newly produced ATP is transported from the matrix to the intermembrane space by the voltage gradient\u2013driven ATP/ADP exchange protein located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. From here, ATP leaves the mitochondria via voltage-dependent anion channels in the outer membrane to enter the cytoplasm. At the same time, ADP produced in the cytoplasm rapidly enters the mitochondria for recharging."

            "content": "Figure 11\u201312 Three types of aTP-driven pumps. Like any enzyme, all ATP-driven pumps can work in either direction, depending on the electrochemical gradients of their solutes and the ATP/ADP ratio. When the ATP/ADP ratio is high, they hydrolyze ATP; when the ATP/ADP ratio is low, they can synthesize ATP. The F-type ATPase in mitochondria normally works in this \u201creverse\u201d mode to make most of the cell\u2019s ATP. important that the cell maintains a steep Ca2+ gradient across its plasma membrane. Ca2+ transporters that actively pump Ca2+ out of the cell help maintain the gradient. One of these is a P-type Ca2+ ATPase; the other is an antiporter (called a Na+\u2013Ca2+ exchanger) that is driven by the Na+ electrochemical gradient (discussed in Chapter 15)."
