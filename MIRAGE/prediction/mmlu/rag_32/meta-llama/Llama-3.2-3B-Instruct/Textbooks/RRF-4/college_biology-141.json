This process is crucial for plant nutrition and growth.\\n\\nNext, let's examine the options given:\\n\\nA. It is passive. - This option suggests that the loading of sugars into the phloem is a passive process, meaning it doesn't require energy input. However, the loading of sugars into the phloem is an active process that requires energy.\\n\\nB. It depends on DNA. - DNA is not directly involved in the process of loading sugars into the phloem. This process is a physiological function of the plant cells.\\n\\nC. It requires ATP. - This option is correct. The loading of sugars into the phloem requires energy, which is provided by ATP. The energy is used to pump sugars into the phloem against the concentration gradient, allowing them to be transported to other parts of the plant.\\n\\nD. It translocates starch. - While starch is a type of carbohydrate that is stored in plants, the process of loading sugars into the phloem is not primarily about translocating starch. Starch is a separate process that involves the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates in the form of starch granules.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.

For these cells, any attempt to generate an electrochemical H+ gradient would be opposed by a large H+ concentration gradient in the wrong direction (H+ higher inside than outside). Presumably for this reason, some of these bacteria substitute Na+ for H+ in all of their chemiosmotic mechanisms. The respiratory chain pumps Na+ out of the cell, the transport systems and flagellar motor are driven by an inward flux of Na+, and a Na+-driven ATP synthase synthesizes ATP. The existence of such bacteria demonstrates a critical point: the principle of chemiosmosis is more fundamental than the proton-motive force on which it is normally based.

Here the ATP and NADPH generated by the light reactions serve as the source of energy and reducing power, respectively, to drive the conversion of CO2 to carbohydrate. These carbon-fixation reactions begin in the chloroplast stroma, where they generate the three-carbon sugar glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. This simple sugar is exported to the cytosol, where it is used to produce sucrose and many other organic metabolites in the leaves of the plant. The sucrose is then exported to meet the metabolic needs of the nonphotosynthetic plant tissues, serving as a source of both carbon skeletons and energy for growth."

The major lysosomal membrane-specifc proteins, as well as a few other proteins associated H membrane impermeable to enzymes; contains specific lysosomal proteins, lamps, limps, and lgps with membrane transport, are also shown. endosomes. In addition, lysosomes and late endosomes contain proton (H ) pumps that transport H ions into the lysosomal lumen, maintaining a low pH (4.7). The lysosomal membrane also contains transport proteins that transport the final products of digestion (amino acids, sugars, nucleotides) to the cytoplasm, where they are used in the synthetic processes of the cell or are exocytosed."
