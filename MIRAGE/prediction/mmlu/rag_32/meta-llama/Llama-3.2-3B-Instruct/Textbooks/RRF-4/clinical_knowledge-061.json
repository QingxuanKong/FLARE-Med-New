This statement is true. The median groove is a normal anatomical structure in the prostate, but a palpable median groove can be a sign of prostate cancer or other abnormalities. It is considered an adverse finding that warrants further investigation.\\n\\nOption B: Impacted faeces can sometimes be mistaken for a rectal tumour. This statement is true. Impacted faeces can sometimes be mistaken for a rectal tumor due to its hard and irregular shape. This can lead to unnecessary biopsies or surgeries.\\n\\nOption C: A thrombosed haemorrhoid is painless. This statement is false. A thrombosed haemorrhoid is typically painful and can be quite uncomfortable. It is usually associated with pain, swelling, and bleeding.\\n\\nOption D: Peri-anal warts can only be demonstrated on proctoscopy. This statement is false. Peri-anal warts can be demonstrated on anoscopy, which is a procedure that allows for the examination of the anal canal.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the correct answer is A and B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A, B\"}",

The relative risk for developing colorectal cancer increases to 1.75 in such individuals and may be even higher if the relative was afflicted before age 60.

            "content": "Anatomy and Pathophysiology Rectal prolapse (procidentia) is a circumferential, full-thickness protrusion of the rectal wall through the anal orifice. It is often associated with a redundant sigmoid colon, pelvic laxity, and a deep rectovaginal septum (pouch of Douglas). Initially, rectal prolapse was felt to be the result of early internal rectal intussusception, which occurs in the upper to mid rectum. This was considered to be the first step in an inevitable progression to full-thickness external prolapse. However, only 1 of 38 patients with internal prolapse followed for >5 years developed full-thickness prolapse. Others have suggested that full-thickness prolapse is the result of damage to the nerve supply to the pelvic floor muscles or pudendal nerves from repeated stretching with straining to defecate. Damage to the pudendal nerves would weaken the pelvic floor muscles, including the external anal sphincter muscles. Bilateral pudendal nerve injury is more significantly"

            "content": "The diagnosis of hemorrhoidal disease is made on physical examination. Inspection of the perianal region for evidence of thrombosis or excoriation is performed, followed by a careful digital examination. Anoscopy is performed paying particular attention to the known position of hemorrhoidal disease. The patient is asked to strain. If this is difficult for the patient, the maneuver can be performed while sitting on a toilet. The physician is notified when the tissue prolapses. It is important to differentiate the circumferential appearance of a full-thickness rectal prolapse from the radial nature of prolapsing hemorrhoids (see \u201cRectal Prolapse,\u201d above). The stage and location of the hemorrhoidal complexes are defined."

Current American Cancer Society guidelines advocate screening for the average-risk population (asymptomatic, no family history of colorectal carcinoma, no personal history of polyps or colorectal carcinoma, no familial syndrome) beginning at age 50 years.

Although stool tests for occult blood have been shown to decrease mortality rate from colorectal cancer, they do not detect some cancers and many polyps, and direct visualization of the colon is a more effective screening strategy. Either sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy may be used for cancer screening in asymptomatic average-risk individuals. The use of sigmoidoscopy was based on the historical finding that the majority of colorectal cancers occurred in the rectum and left colon and that patients with right-sided colon cancers had left-sided polyps. Over the past several decades, however, the distribution of colon cancers has changed in the United States, with proportionally fewer rectal and left-sided cancers than in the past. Large American studies of colonoscopy for screening of average-risk individuals show that cancers are roughly equally distributed between left and right colon and half of patients with right-sided lesions have"

A prostatic abscess may present with similar complaints, including dysuria. Patients with a prostatic abscess will often have a history of recurrent sexually transmitted diseases. On physical examination, a large fluctuant area is usually readily visible. Routine laboratory evaluation shows an elevated white blood cell count. Diagnostic procedures are rarely necessary unless evaluating a recurrent abscess. A CT scan or MRI has an accuracy of 80% in determining incomplete drainage. If there is a concern about the presence of inflammatory bowel disease, a rigid or flexible sigmoidoscopic examination may be done at the time of drainage to evaluate for inflammation within the rectosigmoid region. A more complete evaluation for Crohn\u2019s disease would include a full colonoscopy and small-bowel series."
