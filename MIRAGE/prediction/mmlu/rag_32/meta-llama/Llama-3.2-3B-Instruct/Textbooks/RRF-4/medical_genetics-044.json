A more accurate method is based on the principles of PCR (Figure 8\u201363). Called quantitative RT-PCR (reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction), this method begins with the total population of RNA molecules purified from a tissue or a cell culture. It is important that no DNA be present in the preparation; it must be purified away or enzymatically degraded. Two DNA primers that specifically match the mRNA of interest are added, along with reverse transcriptase, DNA polymerase, and the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates needed for DNA synthesis. The first round of synthesis is the reverse transcription of the RNA into DNA using one of the primers. Next, a series of heating and cooling cycles allows the amplification of that DNA strand by PCR (see Figure 8\u201336).

A base substitution in one or more nucleotides at a restriction site can render the site unrecognizable by a particular restriction endonuclease. A new restriction site also can be created by the same mechanism. In either case, cleavage with the endonuclease results in fragments of lengths differing from the normal that can be detected by hybridization with a probe. RFLP analysis can be used to diagnose genetic diseases early in the gestation of a fetus.

PCR primers that flank the stretch of DNA to be cloned are added, and many cycles of PCR are completed (see Figure 8\u201336). Because only the DNA between (and including) the primers is amplified, PCR provides a way to obtain selectively any short stretch of chromosomal DNA in an effectively pure form. (B) To use PCR to obtain a cDNA clone of a gene, total mRNA is first purified from cells. The first primer is added to the population of mRNAs, and reverse transcriptase is used to make a DNA strand complementary to the specific RNA sequence of interest. The second primer is then added, and the DNA molecule is amplified through many cycles of PCR."

            "content": "Diagnosis of malignancy. Because each T cell and B cell has unique antigen receptor gene rearrangements, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u2013based detection of rearranged T-cell receptor or immunoglobulin genes allows monoclonal (neoplastic) and polyclonal (reactive) proliferations to be distinguished. Many hematopoietic neoplasms, as well as a few solid tumors, are defined by particular translocations, so the diagnosis can be made by detection of such translocations. For example, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or PCR analysis (Chapter 7) can be used to detect translocations characteristic of Ewing sarcoma and several leukemias and lymphomas. PCR-based detection of BCR-ABL transcripts can confirm the diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (Chapter 12). Finally, certain hematologic malignancies are now defined by the presence of point mutations in particular oncogenes. For example, as mentioned earlier, the diagnosis of another myeloid neoplasm called polycythemia vera requires"

Typically, 20\u201330 cycles are run during this process, amplifying the DNA by a million-fold (220) to a billion-fold (230). [Note: Each extension product includes a sequence at its 5\u2032-end that is complementary to the primer (see Fig. 34.20). Thus, each newly synthesized strand can act as a template for the successive cycles (see Fig. 34.21). This leads to an exponential increase in the amount of target DNA with each cycle, hence, the name \u201cpolymerase chain reaction.\u201d] Probes can be made during PCR by adding labeled nucleotides to the last few cycles."
