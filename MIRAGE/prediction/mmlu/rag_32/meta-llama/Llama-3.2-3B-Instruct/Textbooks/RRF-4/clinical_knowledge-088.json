The key information to consider is that the catheter is likely causing a pneumothorax, as indicated by the fact that it is resisting all attempts to unblock it. This suggests that the catheter is causing air to accumulate in the pleural space, leading to a pneumothorax. The appropriate action would be to remove the catheter to alleviate the pneumothorax and prevent further complications. The other options do not address the underlying cause of the problem, which is the catheter causing the pneumothorax. Therefore, the correct answer is to call for assistance from a medical practitioner to help remove the catheter.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Recanalization is confirmed by advanc-ing the catheter over the guidewire beyond the point of reen-try and obtaining an angiogram. This is followed by a balloon angioplasty. To confirm the patency following balloon dilata-tion, a completion angiogram is performed prior to withdraw-ing the catheter and wire. If flow is impaired, repeat balloon Brunicardi_Ch23_p0897-p0980.indd 96227/02/19 4:15 PM 963ARTERIAL DISEASECHAPTER 23dilatation may be necessary. Frequently, a stent is required to maintain a patent lumen and treat residual stenosis if more than 30% luminal reduction is confirmed on completion angiogram.Multiple studies have demonstrated the efficacy of subin-timal angioplasty. Bolia and colleagues reported their extensive experiences on subintimal angioplasty for treating long-segment occlusions of infrainguinal vessels.154 They achieved a techni-cal success rate of over"

The risk of surgery is far greater than the placement of an image-guided drain.The use of antibiotics when drains are in place is often unnecessary as the drain provides direct source control. Twenty-four to 48 hours of antibiotic use after drain placement is pro-phylactic, and after this period, only specific treatment of positive cultures should be performed to avoid increased drug resistance and superinfection.Urinary Catheters. Several complications of urinary cath-eters can occur that lead to an increased length of hospital stay and morbidity. In general, use of urinary catheters should be minimized and every opportunity to expeditiously remove them should be encouraged. If"
