The documents state that the right and left coronary arteries arise at the root of the aorta behind the right and left cusps of the aortic valve, respectively. This indicates that the coronary arteries arise from the ascending aorta. The documents also mention that the flow in the coronary arteries is similar to that in the left coronary artery, and that the right ventricle does not experience reversal of blood flow during early systole due to lower pressure. This suggests that the coronary arteries fill during diastole. Let's evaluate the options based on this information.\\n\\nOption A: arise from the arch of the aorta and fill during diastole. This is incorrect because the coronary arteries arise from the ascending aorta, not the arch of the aorta.\\n\\nOption B: arise from the ascending aorta and fill during systole.

These arteries provide the entire blood supply to the myocardium. The right coronary artery supplies mainly the right ventricle and atrium. The left coronary artery, which divides near its origin into the anterior descending and the circumflex branches, supplies mainly the left ventricle and atrium. There is some overlap between the regions supplied by the left and right arteries. In humans, the right coronary artery is dominant (supplying most of the myocardium) in approximately 50% of individuals. The left coronary artery is dominant in another 20%, and the flow delivered by each main artery is approximately equal in the remaining 30%.

The distribution pattern described above for both right and left coronary arteries is the most common and consists of a right dominant coronary artery. This means that the posterior interventricular branch arises from the right coronary artery. The right coronary artery therefore supplies a large portion of the posterior wall of the left ventricle and the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery is relatively small. In contrast, in hearts with a left dominant coronary artery, the posterior interventricular branch arises from an enlarged circumflex branch and supplies most of the posterior wall of the left ventricle (Fig. 3.79)."

In addition, vascular communications directly link the myocardial vessels with the cardiac chambers; these communications are the arteriosinusoidal, arterioluminal, and thebesian vessels. The arteriosinusoidal channels consist of small arteries or arterioles that lose their arterial structure as they penetrate the chamber walls, where they divide into irregular, endothelium-lined sinuses.

In addition to graft attrition, progression of disease in the native coronary arteries is not uncommon in symptomatic patients. While CTA provides excellent visualization of the bypass grafts, the native circulation tends to get heavily calcified and is generally not a good target for imaging with CTA. Likewise, blooming artifacts from metallic stents also limit the application of coronary CTA in patients with prior percutaneous coronary intervention. Although newer stent material may change the potential role of CTA in the future, it is probably not the first line of testing in these patients. If an anatomic"

Vasodilation of epicardial Relief of coronary artery spasm coronary arteries Increased collateral flow Improved perfusion of ischemic myocardium Coronary arteriolar resistance tends to decrease, though to a lesser extent. However, nitrates administered by the usual systemic routes may decrease overall coronary blood flow (and myocardial oxygen consumption) if cardiac output is reduced due to decreased venous return. The reduction in oxygen demand is the major mechanism for the relief of effort angina. B. Nitrate Effects in Variant Angina Nitrates benefit patients with variant angina by relaxing the smooth muscle of the epicardial coronary arteries and relieving coronary artery spasm. C.
