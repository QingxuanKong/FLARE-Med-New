According to the provided documents, the development of lung tissue is closely related to the branching of airways and the formation of gas-exchanging units. We need to identify which group of animals was the first to develop lung tissue that could support respiratory requirements without relying on supplementary gas exchange organs. Let's review the development of lung tissue in different animal groups: \\n\\nThe earliest known vertebrates, such as amphibians, developed lung tissue around 360 million years ago. However, their lungs were not yet capable of supporting the respiratory requirements of modern animals. \\n\\nReptiles also developed lung tissue, but their lungs were still not complex enough to support the respiratory needs of modern animals. \\n\\nMammals, on the other hand, developed more complex lungs that were capable of supporting gas exchange and respiratory requirements. This development is thought to have occurred around 160 million years ago. \\n\\nTrematoda, a group of flatworms, do not have lungs and instead use a network of fluid-filled vessels to breathe. They are not considered to have developed lung tissue that could support respiratory requirements.\\n\\nBased on the information provided, it is clear that mammals were the first group of animals to develop lung tissue that could support respiratory requirements without the use of supplementary gas exchange organs.

Furthermore, it must accommodate severalfold increases in the demand for oxygen uptake or CO2 elimination imposed by metabolic needs or acid-base derangement. Given these multiple requirements for normal operation, it is not surprising that many diseases disturb respiratory function. This chapter considers in some detail the physiologic determinants of lung ventilation and perfusion, elucidates how the matching distributions of these processes and rapid gas diffusion allow normal gas exchange, and discusses how common diseases derange these normal functions, thereby impairing gas exchange\u2014or at least increasing the work required"

The inferior division of theleft upper lobe, the lingula, is analogous to the right middle lobe. The pediatric lung has tremendous capacity for growth. A full-term infant has approximately 25 million alveoli; an adult nearly 300 million alveoli. The growth of new alveoli occurs during the first 2 years of life and is complete by 8 years of age. After this time, lung volume increases primarily by increase in alveolar dimensions, with new alveoli rarely formed. The major function of the lungs is to exchange oxygen (O2)and carbon dioxide (CO2) between the atmosphere and the blood. The anatomy of the airways, mechanics of the respiratory muscles and rib cage, nature of the alveolar-capillary interface, pulmonary circulation, tissue metabolism, and neuromuscular control of ventilation all influence gas exchange."

The respiratory system also participates to a lesser degree in endocrine functions (hormone production and secretion), as well as regulation of immune responses to inhaled antigens. The lungs develop in the embryo as a ventral evagination of the foregut; thus, the epithelium of the respiratory system is of endodermal origin. This initial respiratory diverticulum grows into the thoracic mesenchyme. The bronchial cartilages, smooth muscle, and the other connective tissue elements are derived from the thoracic mesenchyme.

The interstitium is composed primarily of lung collagen fibers and is a space in which fluid and cells can potentially accumulate. An adult has approximately 5 \u00d7 108 alveoli ( Fig. 20.6 ), which are composed of type I and type II epithelial cells. Under normal conditions, type I and type II cells exist in a 1 : 1 ratio. The type I cell occupies 96% to 98% of the surface area of the alveolus, and it is the primary site for gas exchange. The thin cytoplasm of type I cells is ideal for optimal gas diffusion. In addition, the basement membrane of type I cells and the capillary endothelium are fused, which minimizes the distance for gas diffusion and thereby facilitates gas exchange."

Where large surfaces are required, they are often organized as branching tubular structures. The lung is an example. It originates from epithelial buds that grow out from the floor of the foregut and invade neighboring mesenchyme to form the bronchial tree, a system of tubes that branch repeatedly as they extend. Endothelial cells that form the lining of blood vessels invade the same mesenchyme, thereby creating a system of closely apposed airways and blood vessels, as required for gas exchange in the lung (Figure 21\u201352). This whole process of branching morphogenesis depends on signals that pass in both directions between the growing epithelial buds and the mesenchyme.

To provide an enormous alveolar surface area (typically 70 m2) for blood-gas diffusion within the modest volume of a thoracic cavity (typically 7 L), nature has distributed both blood flow and ventilation among millions of tiny alveoli through multigenerational branching of both pulmonary arteries and bronchial airways. As a consequence of variations in tube lengths and calibers along these pathways as well as the effects of gravity, tidal pressure fluctuations, and anatomic constraints from the chest wall, the alveoli vary in their relative ventilations and perfusions.

This process occurs in the lung alveoli, where blood flowing through alveolar wall capillaries is separated from alveolar gas by an extremely thin membrane of flattened endothelial and epithelial cells, across which respiratory gases diffuse and equilibrate. Blood flow through the lung is unidirectional via a continuous vascular path, along which venous blood absorbs oxygen from and loses CO2 to inspired gas. The path for airflow, in contrast, reaches a dead end at the alveolar walls; thus the alveolar space must be ventilated tidally, with inflow of fresh gas and outflow of alveolar gas alternating periodically at the respiratory rate (RR).

First, the pseudoglandular stage entails growth of the intrasegmental bronchial tree between the 5th and 17th weeks. During this period, the lung looks microscopically like a gland. Second, during the canalicular stage, from 16 to 25 weeks, the bronchial cartilage plates extend peripherally.

The effect of a physiological shunt on oxygenation is similar to the effect of an anatomical shunt; that is, deoxygenated blood bypasses a gas-exchanging unit and admixes with arterial blood. Clinically, atelectasis (which is obstruction to ventilation of a gas-exchanging unit with subsequent loss of volume) is an example of a situation in which the lung region has a V\u0307 /Q\u0307 of 0. Causes of atelectasis include mucous plugs, airway edema, foreign bodies, and tumors in the airway. Mismatching between ventilation and perfusion is the most frequent cause of arterial hypoxemia in individuals with respiratory disorders. In the most common example, the composition of mixed venous blood, total blood flow (cardiac output), and the distribution of blood flow are normal. However, when alveolar ventilation is distributed unevenly between the two gas-exchange units ("

The conducting portion of the respiratory system consists of those air passages that lead to the sites of respiration within the lung where gas exchange takes place. The conducting passages include those located outside as well as within the lungs. The passages external to the lungs consist of the following: \u0081 Nasal cavities that represent two large air-filled spaces in the uppermost part of the respiratory system (and, during forced breathing, the oral cavity residing inferior to the nasal cavities). \u0081 Nasopharynx that lies behind the nasal cavities and above the level of the soft palate and communicate inferiorly with oropharynx that is posterior to the oral cavity. \u0081 Larynx that is a hollow tubular organ containing cartilaginous framework responsible for producing sounds."

            "content": "o achieve its primary function of gas exchange, air must be moved in and out of the lung. The mechanical properties of the lung and chest wall determine the ease or difficulty of this air movement. Lung mechanics is the study of the mechanical properties of the lung and chest wall (including the diaphragm, abdominal cavity, and anterior abdominal muscles). Lung mechanics is important for how the lungs work both normally and in the presence of disease, inasmuch as most lung diseases affect the mechanical properties of the lungs, chest wall, or both. In addition, death from lung disease is almost always due to respiratory muscle fatigue, which results from an inability of the respiratory muscles to overcome the altered mechanical properties of the lungs, chest wall, or both. Lung mechanics includes static mechanics (the mechanical properties of a lung whose volume is not changing with time) and dynamic mechanics (properties of a lung whose volume is changing with time).

            "content": "Growth of the lungs is similar and relatively proportional to growth in body length and stature. The rate of development is fastest in the neonatal and preadolescent periods (\u224811 years of age), and girls\u2019 lungs mature earlier than boys\u2019. Although the growth rate of the lung slows after adolescence, the body and lung increase in size steadily until adulthood. Improvement in lung function occurs at all stages of growth development; however, once optimal size has been attained in early adulthood (20 to 25 years of age), lung function starts to decline with age. The decrease in lung function with age, estimated at less than 1% per year, appears to begin earlier and proceed faster in individuals who smoke or are exposed to toxic environmental factors. The major physiological insufficiencies caused by aging involve ventilatory capacity and responses, especially during exercise, and they result in abnormal ventilation with normal perfusion. In addition, gas diffusion decreases with age,"
