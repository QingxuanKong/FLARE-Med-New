Document [1] (Title: Physiology_Levy) states that 'Muscle cells convert chemical energy to mechanical energy. ATP is the energy source used for this conversion.' It also mentions that 'The creatine phosphate store represents the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise.' However, it does not suggest that a fall in cell concentration of ADP (A) or inhibition of ATP production (B) is a fundamental cause of fatigue in high-intensity exercise. Document [9] (Title: Physiology_Levy) also mentions that 'The ATP pool in skeletal muscle is small and capable of supporting only a few contractions if not replenished.' This suggests that the ATP supply is not the primary cause of fatigue, but rather the inability to replenish it. Document [3] (Title: Physiology_Levy) states that 'the accumulation of various metabolic products (lactate, Pi, ADP) has been implicated in various forms of exercise-induced muscle fatigue.' This suggests that the failure of the ATP supply to match the demand (C) is a fundamental cause of fatigue in high-intensity exercise. Document [8] (Title: Neurology_Adams) defines fatigue as 'a disorder in behavior, taking the form of a reduced output of work or a lack of endurance.' This definition suggests that fatigue is not just a physical phenomenon, but also a psychological and behavioral one. However, in the context of high-intensity exercise, the physical aspect of fatigue is more relevant. Document [6] (Title: Physiology_Levy) mentions that 'the force/stress generated during brief periods of tetany is adequate as long as the circulation is intact.' This suggests that the cardiovascular system can support the increased demand for oxygen and nutrients during high-intensity exercise. Document [21] (Title: Neurology_Adams) states that 'fatigue is an abstruse symptom, always requiring analysis and interpretation.' This suggests that fatigue is a complex phenomenon that cannot be explained by a single factor. Considering all the above documents, the most appropriate answer is C. failure of the ATP supply to match the demand.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"C\"",

The basis for the perceived discomfort (or even pain) probably involves many factors. These factors may include a decrease in plasma glucose levels and accumulation of metabolites. Motor system function in the central nervous system is not impaired. Highly motivated and trained athletes can withstand the discomfort of fatigue and may exercise to the point at which some motor unit fatigue occurs. Part of the enhanced performance observed after training involves motivational factors."

In view of the reliance of all cells on the availability of ATP to maintain viability, fatigue has been described as a protective mechanism to minimize the risk of muscle cell injury or death. Consequently, it is likely that skeletal muscle cells have developed redundant systems to ensure that ATP levels do not drop to dangerously low levels and hence risk the viability of the cell."

The ability of muscle to meet energy needs is a major determinant of the duration of the exercise. However, fatigue is not the result of depletion of energy stores. Instead, metabolic byproducts seem to be important factors in the onset of fatigue. Fatigue may potentially occur at any of the points involved in muscle contraction, from the brain to the muscle cells, as well as in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems that maintain energy supplies (i.e., fatty acids and glucose) and oxygen delivery to the exercising muscle.

The creatine phosphokinase in the thick filament may participate in the rapid resynthesis of ATP near the myosin heads during muscle contraction. The phosphate store created, however, is only about five times the size of the ATP store and thus cannot support prolonged periods of contraction (less than a minute of maximal muscle activity). Skeletal muscle fatigue during intense exercise is associated with depletion of the creatine phosphate store, although as described subsequently, this does not necessarily imply that the fatigue is caused by depletion of the creatine phosphate store. Because the creatine phosphokinase\u2013catalyzed reaction is reversible, the muscle cell replenishes the creatine phosphate pool during recovery from fatigue by using ATP synthesized through oxidative phosphorylation."

The accumulation of lactic acid, to levels as high as 15 to 26 mmol/L, decreases myoplasmic pH (from \u22487 to \u22486.2) and inhibits actin-myosin interactions. This decrease in pH reduces the sensitivity of the actin-myosin interaction to Ca++ by altering Ca++ binding to troponin C and by decreasing the maximum number of actin-myosin interactions. Pi has also been implicated as an important factor in the development of fatigue during intense exercise, inasmuch as phosphate concentrations can increase from approximately 2 mmol/L at rest to nearly 40 mmol/L in working muscle. Such an elevation in [Pi] can reduce tension by at least the following three different mechanisms: \u2022Fig. 12.19."

The low ATPase activity of myosin in slow motor units, coupled with their high oxidative capacity, facilitates the ability of these slow motor units to maintain posture at low energy cost and thus resist fatigue. The smaller diameter of slow muscle fibers, and the higher capillary density in slow muscle, also helps slow muscle resist fatigue. Fast muscle, in contrast, is recruited for activities that require faster movements, more force, or both (see Fig. 12.15 ). Weightlifting, for example, can require a lot of power for short duration.

As stated earlier, the circumstances during exercise are somewhat different. During a short period of intense exercise, the muscle uses carbohydrate derived from glycogen stores; myophosphorylase is the enzyme that initiates the metabolism of glycogen. With longer aerobic exercise, blood flow to muscle and the availability of glucose and fatty acids are increased. At first, glucose is the main source of energy during exercise; later, with exhaustion of glycogen stores, energy is provided by oxidation of fatty acids. Thus, muscle failure at a certain phase of exercise is predictive of the type of energy failure. A rising blood concentration of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate reflects the increasing oxidation of fatty acids, and an increase in blood lactate reflects the anaerobic metabolism of glucose.

Additional differences between fast and slow muscles include the following: 1. The motor neuron in slow muscle is more easily excited than that in fast muscle, and so slow muscles are typically recruited first.

These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy.

            "content": "If the energy demands of exercise cannot be met by oxidative phosphorylation, an oxygen debt is incurred. After completion of exercise, respiration remains above the resting level in order to \u201crepay\u201d this oxygen debt. The extra oxygen consumption during this recovery phase is used to restore metabolite levels (such as creatine phosphate and ATP) and to metabolize the lactate generated by glycolysis. The increased cardiac and respiratory work during recovery also contributes to the increased oxygen consumption seen at this time and explains why more oxygen has to be \u201crepaid\u201d than was \u201cborrowed.\u201d Some oxygen debt occurs even with low levels of exercise because slow oxidative motor units consume considerable ATP, derived from creatine phosphate or glycolysis, before oxidative metabolism can increase ATP production to meet steady-state requirements. The oxygen debt is much greater with strenuous exercise, when fast glycolytic motor units are used (Fig. 12.18 ). The oxygen debt is"

            "content": "Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms in clinical medicine. It is a prominent manifestation of a number of systemic, neurologic, and psychiatric syndromes, although a precise cause will not be identified in a substantial minority of patients. Fatigue refers to an inherently subjective human experience of physical and mental weariness, sluggishness, and exhaustion. In the context of clinical medicine, fatigue is most typically and practically defined as difficulty initiating or maintaining voluntary mental or physical activity. Nearly everyone who has ever been ill with a self-limited infection has experienced this near-universal symptomatology, and fatigue is usually brought to medical attention only when it is either of unclear cause or the severity is out of proportion with what would be expected for the associated trigger. Fatigue should be distinguished from muscle weakness, a reduction of neuromuscular power (Chap. 30); most patients complaining of fatigue are not truly weak"
