The left ventricle contracts and pumps blood into the aorta, and during this time, the aorta is under high pressure. However, between contractions of the left ventricle, the pressure in the aorta drops. This drop in pressure is not enough to stop blood flow through the vessels completely. Instead, the elastic recoil of the arterial walls helps to maintain blood flow. This is because the arteries are elastic structures that can stretch and then recoil, creating a continuous flow of blood throughout the cardiac cycle. Therefore, between contractions of the left ventricle, the blood continues to flow through the vessels due to the elastic recoil of the arteries.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

This reversal of the ventricular-aortic pressure gradient in the presence of continuous flow of blood from the left ventricle to the aorta is the result of storage of potential energy in the stretched arterial walls. This stored potential energy causes blood flow from the left ventricle into the aorta to decelerate. The peak of the flow curve coincides with the point at which the left ventricular pressure curve intersects the aortic pressure curve during ejection. Thereafter, flow decelerates (continues to decrease) because the pressure gradient has been reversed."

Left ventricular myocardial pressure (pressure within the wall of the left ventricle) is highest near the endocardium and lowest near the epicardium. This pressure gradient does not normally impair endocardial blood flow because the greater blood flow to the endocardium during diastole compensates for the greater blood flow to the epicardium during systole. Measurements of coronary blood flow indicate that the epicardial and endocardial halves of the left ventricle receive approximately equal blood flow under normal conditions. Because extravascular compression is greatest at the endocardial surface of the ventricle, the equality of epicardial and endocardial blood flow indicates that the tone of the endocardial resistance vessels is less than that of the epicardial vessels."

The rapid ventricular filling phase is followed by a phase of slow ventricular filling called diastasis.

Incremental increases in afterload produce progressively higher peak systolic pressures. However, if the afterload continues to increase, it becomes so great that the ventricle can no longer generate enough force to open the aortic valve. At this point, ventricular systole is totally isometric (i.e., there is no ejection of blood), and thus no change occurs in ventricular volume during systole. The maximal pressure developed by the left ventricle under these conditions is the maximal isometric force that the ventricle is capable of generating at a given preload. At preloads below the optimal filling volume, an increase in preload can yield greater maximal isometric force (see Fig. 16.36"

Afterload is the force added to the muscle (see Fig. 16.37C ) against which the contracting muscle must act (see Fig. 16.37D ).

Neural regulation of coronary arterial blood flow is much less important than metabolic regulation. Activation of the cardiac sympathetic nerves constricts the coronary resistance vessels.

The pressure generated by contraction of the ventricles moves the blood through the elastic arteries and along the arterial tree. Simultaneously, it also causes the wall of the large elastic arteries to distend. The distension is limited by the network of collagenous fibers in the tunica media and tunica adventitia (Fig. 13.14).

The intermittently contracting muscles compress the veins that course through them. Because the venous valves are oriented toward the heart, the contracting muscle pumps blood back toward the right atrium (see ).

The sharp decrease in left atrial pressure at the onset of ventricular ejection results from descent of the base of the heart and consequent stretching of the atria. During the reduced ejection period, runoff of blood from the aorta to the peripheral blood vessels exceeds the rate of ventricular output, and aortic pressure therefore declines.

To hold venous return to the right atrium constant, the hydrostatic level of the blood reservoir was maintained. As Starling raised arterial pressure to a new constant level, the left ventricle responded at first to the increased afterload by pumping a diminished stroke volume. Because venous return was held constant, the diminution in stroke volume was accompanied by a rise in ventricular diastolic volume, as well as by an increase in the length of the myocardial fibers.

Blood entering the right ventricle via the right atrium is pumped through the pulmonary arterial system at a mean pressure about one seventh that in the systemic arteries. The blood then passes through the lung capillaries, in which CO2 in the blood is released and O2 is taken up. The O2-rich blood returns via the pulmonary veins to the left atrium, where it is pumped from the ventricle to the periphery, which thus completes the cycle. Blood moves rapidly through the aorta and its arterial branches. As these branches approach the periphery, the branches narrow, and their walls become thinner. They also change histologically.

The Arterial System The systemic and pulmonary arterial systems distribute blood to the capillary beds throughout the body. The arterioles are high-resistance vessels of this system that regulate the distribution of flow to the various capillary beds. The aorta, the pulmonary artery, and their major branches have a large amount of elastin in their walls, which makes these vessels highly distensible (i.e., compliant). This distensibility serves to dampen the pulsatile nature of blood flow that results as the heart pumps blood intermittently. When blood is ejected from the ventricles during systole, these vessels distend, and during diastole, they recoil and propel the blood forward (Fig. 17.11 ). Thus the intermittent output of the heart is converted to a steady flow through the capillaries."

When ventricular filling pressure (preload) is increased, ventricular volume increases progressively, and after several beats, becomes constant and larger. At equilibrium, the volume of blood ejected by the ventricles (stroke volume) with each heartbeat increases to equal the greater quantity of venous return to the right atrium. The increased ventricular volume facilitates ventricular contraction and enables the ventricles to pump a greater stroke volume. This increase in ventricular volume is associated with an increase in length of the individual ventricular cardiac fibers. The increase in fiber length alters cardiac performance mainly by altering the number of myofilament cross-bridges that interact (see Chapter 16)."

Thus when beating resumes, blood is depleted from the veins at the rate of 1 L/minute, and arterial blood volume is replenished from venous blood volume at that same absolute rate. Hence, Pv begins to fall and Pa begins to rise. Because of the difference in arterial and venous compliance, Pa rises at a rate 19 times faster than the rate at which Pv falls. The resultant arteriovenous pressure gradient causes blood to flow through the peripheral resistance vessels. If the heart maintains a constant output of 1 L/minute, Pa continues to rise and Pv continues to fall until the pressure gradient becomes 20 mm Hg. This gradient forces a rate of flow of 1 L/minute through a peripheral resistance of 20 mm Hg/L/minute. This gradient is achieved by a 19\u2013mm Hg rise (to 26 mm Hg) in Pa and a 1\u2013mm Hg fall (to 6 mm Hg)"

            "content": "An arteriovenous pressure difference of 100 mm Hg is sufficient to force a flow rate (Qr) of 5 L/minute through a peripheral resistance of 20 mm Hg/L/minute (see Fig. 19.2A ). Under equilibrium conditions, this flow rate (Qr) is precisely equal to the flow rate (Qh) pumped by the heart. From heartbeat to heartbeat, the volume of blood in the arteries (Va) and the volume of blood in the veins (Vv) remain constant because the volume of blood transferred from the veins to the arteries by the heart is equal to the volume of blood that flows from the arteries through the resistance vessels and into the veins. *Thus if it were necessary to add x mL of blood to the arterial system to produce a 1\u2013mm Hg increase in arterial pressure, 19x mL of blood would need to be added to the venous system to raise venous pressure by the same amount.
