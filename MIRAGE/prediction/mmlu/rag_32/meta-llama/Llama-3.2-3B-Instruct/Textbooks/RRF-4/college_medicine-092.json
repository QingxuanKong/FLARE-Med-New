    "question": "Walking down a street late at night, an adult male pedestrian notices a young female on the ground, not moving. The female is on the opposite side of the street. Crossing the street, the pedestrian notices that the young woman appears both much wealthier than he is and is of a different ethnicity. Seeing no one else present, the pedestrian renders aid. According to the bystander effect, which of the following would change how the pedestrian reacts?",
    "options": {
        "A": "The person requiring aid appearing to be of a lower socioeconomic class rather than a higher one",
        "B": "The presence of another group of people one block up the street",
        "C": "The person requiring aid appearing to be the same ethnicity rather than a different one",
        "D": "The presence of one other person who is already approaching the girl"
    },

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's break down the bystander effect and its components. The bystander effect refers to the phenomenon where individuals are less likely to help someone in distress when there are other people present, especially if they think others will take responsibility for the situation. In this scenario, the pedestrian notices a young woman on the ground and decides to render aid. The bystander effect would likely decrease the pedestrian's willingness to help if one or more of the following factors are present: (1) the presence of another group of people, (2) the person requiring aid appearing to be of a different socioeconomic class, or (3) the presence of another person who is already approaching the girl. However, the bystander effect would not be affected by the person requiring aid appearing to be of the same ethnicity. Therefore, the correct answer is B. The presence of another group of people one block up the street.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Here, both forward and alternating lateral movements must occur. In contrast to walking, running requires that both feet are momentarily off the ground, necessitating a forward drive or thrust by the trailing leg. Because normal body posture and locomotion require intact vestibular function, proprioception, and vision (we see where we are going and adjust our steps), the effects of deficits in these senses are worth noting. A blind person\u2014or a normal one who is blindfolded or walks in the dark\u2014moves cautiously, with arms slightly forward to avoid collisions, and shortens his step slightly on a smooth surface; there is less rocking of the body and the gait is unnaturally stiff and cautious."

Sherlock Holmes expressed pride in his talent for deducing from the manner of gait, an individual\u2019s personality and occupation. It is said that Charcot could often make the correct diagnosis, even before seeing the patient, based on the sound of patient walking down the hallway on the way to the examining room. The changes in stance and gait that accompany aging\u2014the slightly stooped posture and slow, stiff tread as described in Chap. 28, on aging\u2014are so familiar that they are not perceived as abnormalities."

Lost with aging are speed, balance, and many of the quick and graceful adaptive movements that characterize the gait of younger individuals. The main objective characteristics are a slightly stooped posture, varying degrees of slowness and stiffness of walking, shortening of the stride, slight widening of the base, and a tendency to turn en bloc. The shortening of stride and widening of the base provide the support that enables the elderly individual to more confidently maintain his balance, but they result in a somewhat guarded gait, like that of a person walking on a slippery surface or in the dark."

The medial edges of the heels, as they strike the ground with each step, lie almost along a straight line. As each leg moves forward, there is coordinated flexion of the hip and knee, dorsiflexion of the foot, and a barely perceptible elevation of the hip, so that the foot clears the ground. Also, with each step, the thorax advances slightly on the side opposite the swinging lower limb.

Average life expectancy in these countries lags far behind that in high-income countries: whereas the average life expectancy at birth in high-income countries is 74 years, it is only 68 years in middle-income countries and 58 years in low-income countries. This discrepancy has received growing attention over the past 40 years. Initially, the situation in poor countries was characterized primarily in terms of high fertility and high infant, child, and maternal mortality rates, with most deaths and illnesses attributable to infectious or tropical diseases among remote, largely rural populations. With growing adult (and especially elderly) populations and changing lifestyles linked to global forces of urbanization, a new set of health challenges characterized by chronic diseases, environmental overcrowding, and road traffic"

Differentiating clinically significant agoraphobic fears from reasonable fears (e.g., leaving the house dur- ing a bad storm) or from situations that are deemed dangerous (e.g., walking in a parking lot or using public transportation in a high-crime area) is important for a number of reasons."

Interestingly, the height of the patient and the previous lens surgery would suggest a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, and a series of blood tests and review of the family history revealed this was so. A 35-year-old male patient presented to his family practitioner because of recent weight loss (14 lb over the previous 2 months). He also complained of a cough with streaks of blood in the sputum (hemoptysis) and left-sided chest pain. Recently, he noticed significant sweating, especially at night, which necessitated changing his sheets."
