The mutations in the FGFR3 gene causing achondroplasias are unusual in several respects. The same single-base mutation in the gene that converts glycine to arginine at position 380 in the FGFR3 gene is present in over 90% of patients. Most patients harbor sporadic new mutations, and therefore, this nucleotide change must be one of the most common recurring mutations in the human genome.

The disease is caused by gain-of-function mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Normally, FGF inhibits endochondral growth. FGFR3 mutation results in a constitutively active receptor, thereby exaggerating this effect and suppressing growth. Approximately 90% of cases stem from new mutations, almost all of which occur in the paternal allele. Affected individuals have shortened proximal extremities, a trunk of relatively normal length, and an enlarged head with bulging forehead and conspicuous depression of the root of the nose.

However, most patients with craniosynostosis appear to have mutations in the related FGFR2 gene. The similarities between the phenotypes produced by mutations in genes for FGF receptors and mutations in structural proteins of cartilage are probably explained by the observation that the activity of FGFs is regulated in part by binding of FGFs to proteins sequestered in the extracellular matrix. Therefore, the situation parallels the interactions between transforming growth factors (TGFs) and fibrillin in MFS (see below).

Dominant conditions with incomplete penetrance are characterized by skipping of generations with unaffected carriers transmitting the mutant gene. For example, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM) caused by mutations in the myosin-binding protein C gene is a dominant disorder with clinical features in only a subset of patients who carry the mutation (Chap. 283). Patients who have the mutation but no evidence of the disease can still transmit the disorder to subsequent generations.

            "content": "COMPLEMENTATION: MUTATIONS IN TWO DIFFERENT GENES DELETION: deletes a segment of a chromosome TRANSLOCATION: breaks off a segment from one chromosome and attaches it to another gain-of-function mutation: increases the activity of the gene or makes it active in inappropriate circumstances; these mutations are usually dominant. dominant-negative mutation: dominant-acting mutation that blocks gene activity, causing a loss-of-function phenotype even in the presence of a normal copy of the gene. This phenomenon occurs when the mutant gene product interferes with the function of the normal gene product. suppressor mutation: suppresses the phenotypic effect of another mutation, so that the double mutant seems normal. An intragenic suppressor mutation lies within the gene affected by the frst mutation; an extragenic suppressor mutation lies in a second gene\u2014often one whose product interacts directly with the product of the frst."

            "content": "The characteristic age of onset; the longitudinal history of recurrent multiple complaints as outlined earlier; the attitude of the patient and the manner of presenting her symptoms; the incongruity of affect and clinical state; the discrepancy between the neurologic deficit and the signs on examination; the impossibility of explaining the patient\u2019s signs on an anatomic or physiologic basis; and the absence of symptoms and signs of other medical and surgical disease will permit an accurate diagnosis in the majority of cases. Certain tests designed to reveal normal functioning of a limb, of vision, and of gait already have been mentioned. Stone and colleagues (2009) assessed over 1000 patients who were given the diagnosis of a functional disorder and reported that only 0.4 percent were later found to have an organic explanation for their symptoms."

The mutant portion of the laminin \u03b3-1 chain is thought to have no other function than to bind nidogen, and does not affect laminin structure or its ability to assemble into the basal lamina. How would you explain these genetic observations, which are summarized in Table Q19\u20131? What would you predict would be the phenotype of a mouse that was homozygous for knockouts of both nidogen genes?"
