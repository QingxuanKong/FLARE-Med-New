The presence of blood clots can lead to serious complications such as thrombosis, embolism, and infection. Removing the catheter and recatheterizing is a common approach to manage this issue. This method allows for the removal of the clot and the potential source of infection, and it enables the placement of a new catheter in a safer location. Informing the patient or calling for help may be necessary steps in the process, but they are not the primary solution to the problem. Informing the medical staff is also important for ensuring that the situation is properly documented and addressed, but it is not a substitute for taking action to resolve the issue. Therefore, the most appropriate course of action is to remove the catheter and recatheterize.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

            "content": "Unnecessary activation of platelets is prevented because 1) an intact vascular wall is separated from the blood by a monolayer of endothelial cells, preventing the contact of platelets with collagen; 2) endothelial cells synthesize prostaglandin I2 (PGI2, or prostacyclin) and nitric oxide, each of which causes vasodilation; and 3) endothelial cells have a cell surface ADPase that converts ADP to adenosine monophosphate. V. CHAPTER SUMMARY Blood clotting (coagulation) is designed to rapidly stop bleeding from a damaged blood vessel in order to maintain a constant blood volume (hemostasis). Coagulation is accomplished through formation of a clot (thrombus) consisting of a plug of platelets and a meshwork of the protein fibrin (Fig. 35.25)."

Baseline labs should be obtained and creatinine levels noted. A hypercoagula-ble workup should be performed prior to initiation of heparin if there is sufficient suspicion. According to results from random-ized trials, there is no clear superiority for thrombolysis over surgery in terms of 30-day limb salvage or mortality. Access to each treatment option is a major issue in the decision-making process, as time is often critical. National registry data from the United States reveal that surgery is used threeto five-fold more frequently than thrombolysis. Three randomized studies have investigated the role of catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy in the treatment of ALI.145Endovascular TreatmentThe potential to reduce mortality and morbidity while achiev-ing limb salvage is the impetus that makes thrombolysis prefer-able to open"
