    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's first analyze the options and the given documents. The question asks when the pulse can be palpated. The pulse is the rhythmic expansion and contraction of an artery as blood flows through it. Palpation is the technique of feeling the pulse by pressing on the artery with the fingers. According to the documents, palpation of the pulse can be performed on arteries that are close to the surface of the skin. This is mentioned in Document [16] (Title: Anatomy_Gray) where it states that arterial pulses can be felt at four locations in the head and neck. It also states that the carotid pulse is palpable in the anterior triangle of the neck. Similarly, Document [20] (Title: Pediatrics_Nelson) mentions that pulses are assessed for rate, regularity, intensity, symmetry, and timing between upper and lower extremities. It also states that the radial artery is palpable at the wrist anterior to the radius. In all these cases, the pulse is palpable when an artery is close to the surface of the skin. Therefore, the correct answer is D. when an artery is close to the surface of the skin.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Nevertheless, the venous waveform has several characteristic features, and its individual components can be appreciated in most patients (Fig. 267-1). The arterial pulsation is not easily obliterated with palpation; the venous waveform in patients with sinus rhythm is usually biphasic, while the carotid pulse is monophasic; and the jugular venous pulsation should change with changes in posture or inspiration (unless the venous pressure is quite elevated). The venous waveform is divided into several distinct peaks. The a wave reflects right atrial presystolic contraction and occurs just after the electrocardiographic P wave, preceding the first heart sound (S1). A prominent a wave is seen in patients with reduced right ventricular compliance; a cannon a wave occurs with atrioventricular (AV) dissociation and"

Among the cardiovascular causes are premature atrial and ventricular contractions, supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, mitral valve prolapse (with or without associated arrhythmias), aortic insufficiency, atrial myxoma, and pulmonary embolism. Intermittent palpitations are commonly caused by premature atrial or ventricular contractions: the post-extrasystolic beat is sensed by the patient owing to the increase in ventricular end-diastolic dimension following the pause in the cardiac cycle and the increased strength of contraction (post-extrasystolic potentiation) of that beat. Regular, sustained palpitations can be caused by regular supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias. Irregular, sustained palpitations can be caused by atrial fibrillation.

            "content": "Hyperthyroidism Common cardiovascular manifestations of hyperthyroidism include palpitations, systolic hypertension, and fatigue. Sinus tachycardia is present in ~40% of hyperthyroid patients, and atrial fibrillation is present in ~15%. Physical examination may reveal a hyperdynamic precordium, a widened pulse pressure, increases in the intensity of the first heart sound and the pulmonic component of the second heart sound, and a third heart sound. An increased incidence of mitral valve prolapse has been described in hyperthyroid patients, in which case a midsystolic murmur may be heard at the left sternal border with or without a midsystolic click. A systolic pleuropericardial friction rub (Means-Lerman scratch) may be heard at the left second intercostal space during expiration and is thought to result from the hyperdynamic cardiac motion."

            "content": "Femoropopliteal disease: Calf claudication; pulses below the femoral artery are absent. Acute ischemia: Most often caused by embolization from the heart; acute occlusions commonly occur at bifurcations distal to the last palpable pulse. May also be 2\u00b0 to cholesterol atheroembolism (\u201cblue toe syndrome\u201d). \u25a0Severe chronic ischemia: Lack of blood perfusion leads to muscle atrophy, pallor, cyanosis, hair loss, and gangrene/necrosis. Carefully palpate pulses and auscultate for bruits. Measurement of ankle and brachial systolic BP (ankle-brachial index, or ABI) can provide objective evidence of atherosclerosis (rest pain usually occurs with an ABI < 0.4). A high ABI can indicate calcification of the arteries. Doppler ultrasound helps identify stenosis and occlusion. Doppler ankle systolic pressure readings that are > 90% of brachial readings are normal. Arteriography and digital subtraction angiography are necessary for surgical evaluation."

            "content": "David Robertson, MD, & Italo Biaggioni, MD* A 38-year-old man has been experiencing palpitations and headaches. He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"
