    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in relation to the given documents.\\n\\nOption A: increased when intracellular ADP rises. According to document [5], muscle cells convert chemical energy to mechanical energy, and ATP is the energy source used for this conversion. The creatine phosphate store represents the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise. This implies that creatine kinase activity is involved in the conversion of ADP to ATP, which would be increased when intracellular ADP rises.\\n\\nOption B: increased when muscle pH falls below 6.9. According to document [12], muscle biopsy shows vacuoles that stain positive for glycogen; the muscle acid phosphatase level is increased, presumably from a compensatory increase of lysosomal enzymes. However, there is no direct correlation between muscle pH and creatine kinase activity in the provided documents.\\n\\nOption C: always lower in Type II fibres than Type I fibres. According to document [29], each CK isoenzyme is a dimer composed of two polypeptides (called B and M subunits) associated in one of three combinations: CK1 = BB, CK2 = MB, and CK3 = MM. Virtually all CK in the brain is the BB isoform, whereas it is MM in skeletal muscle. This suggests that Type I and Type II fibres may have different creatine kinase isoenzymes, but there is no information on the relative activity of these isoenzymes.\\n\\nOption D: increased after a period of endurance training. According to document [5], the creatine phosphate store represents the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise. This implies that creatine kinase activity is increased after a period of endurance training.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is D. increased after a period of endurance training.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

            "content": "Although much of the creatine phosphokinase is present in the myoplasm, a small amount is located in the thick filament (near the M line). The creatine phosphokinase in the thick filament may participate in the rapid resynthesis of ATP near the myosin heads during muscle contraction. The phosphate store created, however, is only about five times the size of the ATP store and thus cannot support prolonged periods of contraction (less than a minute of maximal muscle activity). Skeletal muscle fatigue during intense exercise is associated with depletion of the creatine phosphate store, although as described subsequently, this does not necessarily imply that the fatigue is caused by depletion of the creatine phosphate store. Because the creatine phosphokinase\u2013catalyzed reaction is reversible, the muscle cell replenishes the creatine phosphate pool during recovery from fatigue by using ATP synthesized through oxidative phosphorylation."

Creatine Creatine phosphate (also called phosphocreatine), the phosphorylated derivative of creatine found in muscle, is a high-energy compound that provides a small but rapidly mobilized reserve of high-energy phosphates that can be reversibly transferred to adenosine diphosphate (Fig. 21.19) to maintain the intracellular level of ATP during the first few minutes of intense muscular contraction. [Note: The amount of creatine phosphate in the body is proportional to the muscle mass.] 1. Synthesis: Creatine is synthesized in the liver and kidneys from glycine and the guanidino group of arginine, plus a methyl group from SAM (see Fig. 21.19). Animal products are dietary sources. Creatine is reversibly phosphorylated to creatine phosphate by creatine kinase, using ATP as the phosphate donor. [Note: The presence of creatine kinase (MB isozyme) in the plasma is indicative of heart damage and is used in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (see p. 65).] 2."

However, they do not necessarily have the same physical properties because of genetically determined differences in amino acid sequence. For this reason, isoenzymes may contain different numbers of charged amino acids, which allows electrophoresis (the movement of charged particles in an electric field) to separate them (Fig. 5.21). Different organs commonly contain characteristic proportions of different isoenzymes. The pattern of isoenzymes found in the plasma may, therefore, serve as a means of identifying the site of tissue damage. For example, the plasma levels of creatine kinase (CK) are commonly determined in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI). They are particularly useful when the electrocardiogram (ECG) is difficult to interpret such as when there have been previous episodes of heart disease. 1."

            "content": "Activity of the disease correlates with elevation of the sedimentation rate, almost always above 40 mm/h and typically higher than 70 mm/h (and corresponding elevation of C-reactive protein); unlike the case in polymyositis, with which it is confused, creatine kinase levels are normal. In many patients, polymyalgia rheumatica is associated with giant cell (temporal, or cranial) arteritis. The precise concordance of these two allied conditions is not known but there is not a high frequency of overlap. The arteritis may affect one or both optic nerves; blindness is the main risk of the disease, as discussed in detail in Chap. 13."
