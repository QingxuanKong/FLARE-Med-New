The patient recently returned from a summer camp with a history of hiking and swimming, which increases the risk of exposure to various pathogens. The public health department reports an outbreak of similar symptoms among other campers and volunteers, suggesting a contagious cause. Adenovirus is a common cause of viral pharyngitis, particularly in children, and can be spread through close contact with an infected person or by contaminated surfaces. The symptoms of conjunctival injection and discharge and oropharyngeal erythema are also consistent with adenoviral pharyngitis. Influenza virus can also cause similar symptoms, but the presence of conjunctival injection and discharge is more characteristic of adenovirus. Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus can also cause pharyngitis, but the symptoms and epidemiology of the outbreak point more towards adenovirus.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Younger children may manifest streptococcal infection with a syndrome of fever, malaise, and lymphadenopathy without exudative pharyngitis. Infection is acquired through contact with another individual carrying the organism. Respiratory droplets are the usual mechanism of spread, although other routes, including food-borne outbreaks, have been well described. The incubation period is 1\u20134 days. Symptoms include sore throat, fever and chills, malaise, and sometimes abdominal complaints and vomiting, particularly in children. Both symptoms and signs are quite variable, ranging from mild throat discomfort with minimal physical findings to high fever and severe sore throat associated with intense erythema and swelling of the"

On occasion, lower respiratory tract disease, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia, also develops. Adenoviruses, particularly types 3 and 7, cause pharyngoconjunctival fever, a characteristic acute febrile illness of children that occurs in outbreaks, most often in summer camps. The syndrome is marked by bilateral conjunctivitis in which the bulbar and palpebral conjunctivae have a granular appearance. Low-grade fever is frequently present for the first 3\u20135 days, and rhinitis, sore throat, and cervical adenopathy develop. The illness generally lasts for 1\u20132 weeks and resolves spontaneously. Febrile pharyngitis without conjunctivitis has also been associated with adenovirus infection. Adenoviruses have been isolated from cases of whooping cough with or without Bordetella pertussis; the significance of adenovirus in that disease is"

She is feeling well overall but reports a 25-pack-year smoking history. She drinks 3\u20134 beers per week and has no known medication allergies. She has a history of heroin use and is currently receiving methadone. Physical examination reveals normal vital signs and no abnormalities. White blood cell count is 5800 cells/mm3 with a normal differential, hemoglobin is 11.8 g/dL, all liver tests are within normal limits, CD4 cell count is 278 cells/mm3, and viral load (HIV RNA) is 110,000 copies/mL. What other laboratory tests should be ordered? Which antiretroviral medica-tions would you begin?"

Myalgias may involve any part of the body but are most common in the legs and lumbosacral area. Arthralgias may also develop. Respiratory symptoms often become more prominent as systemic symptoms subside. Many patients have a sore throat or persistent cough, which may last for \u22651 week and which is often accompanied by substernal discomfort. Ocular signs and symptoms include pain on motion of the eyes, photophobia, and burning of the eyes. In the elderly, influenza may have a relatively subtle presentation. Typical features such as sore throat, myalgia, and even fever may be absent, and general symptoms such as anorexia, malaise, weakness, and dizziness may predominate. Physical findings are usually minimal in uncomplicated influenza. Early in the illness, the patient appears flushed, and the skin is hot and dry, although"

The patient\u2019s temperature was normal. He explained that the episode had occurred following a birthday party at which he had participated in an ice cream\u2013eating contest. The patient reported prior episodes of a similar nature following ingestion of a significant amount of dairy products. This clinical picture is most probably due to a deficiency in the activity of: A. isomaltase. B. lactase. C. pancreatic \u03b1-amylase. D. salivary \u03b1-amylase. E. sucrase. Correct answer = B. The physical symptoms suggest a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for carbohydrate degradation. The symptoms observed following the ingestion of dairy products suggest that the patient is deficient in lactase as a result of the age-dependent reduction in expression of the enzyme."

            "content": "Pertussis is a prolonged coughing illness with clinical manifestations that vary by age (Table 185-1). Although not uncommon among adolescents and adults, classic pertussis is most often seen in preschool and school-age children. After an incubation period averaging 7\u201310 days, an illness develops that is indistinguishable from the common cold and is characterized by coryza, lacrimation, mild cough, low-grade fever, and malaise. After 1\u20132 weeks, this catarrhal phase evolves into the paroxysmal phase: the cough becomes more frequent and spasmodic with repetitive bursts of 5\u201310 coughs, often within a single expiration. Posttussive vomiting is frequent, with a mucous plug occasionally expelled at the end of an episode. The episode may be terminated by an audible whoop, which occurs upon rapid inspiration against a closed glottis at the end of a paroxysm. During a spasm, there may be impressive neck-vein distension, bulging eyes, tongue"

If present, the rash is often transient; may be macular, maculopapular, erythematous, or hemorrhagic (petechial or ecchymotic); and may be misdiagnosed as due to scrub typhus or viral infection. Lung auscultation may reveal crackles, and mild jaundice may be present. The natural course of mild leptospirosis usually involves spontaneous resolution within 7\u201310 days, but persistent symptoms have been documented. In the absence of a clinical diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy, the mortality rate in mild leptospirosis is low."

Early in the illness, the patient appears flushed, and the skin is hot and dry, although diaphoresis and mottled extremities are sometimes evident, particularly in older patients. Examination of the pharynx may yield surprisingly unremarkable results despite a severe sore throat, but injection of the mucous membranes and postnasal discharge are apparent in some cases. Mild cervical lymphadenopathy may be noted, especially in younger individuals. The results of chest examination are largely negative in uncomplicated influenza, although rhonchi, wheezes, and scattered rales have been reported with variable frequency in different outbreaks. Frank dyspnea, hyperpnea, cyanosis, diffuse rales, and signs of consolidation are indicative of pulmonary complications. Patients with apparently uncomplicated influenza have been reported to have a variety of mild ventilatory defects and"

Despite five different antihypertensive drugs, his clinic blood pres-sure is 176/92 mm Hg; he has mild dyspnea on exertion and 2\u20133+ edema on exam. He has been taking furosemide 80 mg twice a day for 1 year now. At the clinic visit, hydrochlorothi-azide 25 mg daily is added for better blood pressure control and also to treat symptoms and signs of fluid overload. Two weeks later, the patient presents to the emergency depart-ment with symptoms of weakness, anorexia, and generalized malaise. His blood pressure is now 91/58 mm Hg, and he has lost 15 kg in 2 weeks. His laboratory tests are signifi-cant for a serum creatinine of 10.8 mg/dL. What has led to the acute kidney injury? What is the reason for the weight loss? What precautions could have been taken to avoid this hospitalization?"

In some cases, the onset is so abrupt that patients can recall the precise time they became ill. However, the spectrum of clinical presentations is wide, ranging from a mild, afebrile respiratory illness similar to the common cold (with either a gradual or an abrupt onset) to severe prostration with relatively few respiratory signs and symptoms. In most of the cases that come to a physician\u2019s attention, the patient has a fever, with temperatures of 38\u00b0\u201341\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0\u2013105.8\u00b0F). A rapid temperature rise within the first 24 h of illness is generally followed by gradual defervescence over 2\u20133 days, although, on occasion, fever may last as long as 1 week."
