    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, we need to understand the process of \\u00d0xidation of palmitic acid (a 16-carbon fatty acid). The \\u00d0xidation of palmitic acid occurs in the mitochondria and involves the removal of two carbons at a time, resulting in the production of acetyl-CoA, NADH, and FADH2. The process consists of multiple steps, including dehydrogenation, hydration, and thiolytic cleavage. The overall equation for the \\u00d0xidation of palmitic acid is: CH3(CH2)14CO2H + 8NAD+ + 8H+ + 8FAD + 8H2O \\u2192 8CO2 + 8NADH + 8FADH2 + 8H+ + 8H2O. However, since the question asks about the net yield, we need to consider the number of acetyl-CoA molecules produced. According to the given document, the oxidation of a molecule of palmitoyl CoA to CO2 and H2O produces 8 acetyl CoA, 7 NADH, and 7 FADH2, from which 131 ATP can be generated. However, activation of the fatty acid requires two ATP. Therefore, the net yield from palmitate is 129 ATP. Since the question asks about the production of acetyl-CoA, we need to consider the number of acetyl-CoA molecules produced. The oxidation of a molecule of palmitic acid produces 8 acetyl-CoA molecules. Therefore, the correct answer is the one that states that the \\u00d0xidation of a molecule of palmitic acid yields 8 molecules of acetyl-CoA.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Long-chain fatty acid transport into mitochondria: After a LCFA enters a cell, it is converted in the cytosol to its CoA derivative by long-chain fatty acyl CoA synthetase (thiokinase), an enzyme of the outer mitochondrial membrane.

Oxidation of fatty acids with an odd number of carbons: This process proceeds by the same reaction steps as that of fatty acids with an even number of carbons, until the final three carbons are reached. This product, propionyl CoA, is metabolized by a three-step pathway (Fig. 16.20). [Note: Propionyl CoA is also produced during the metabolism of certain amino acids (see Fig. 20.11, p. 266).] a. d-Methylmalonyl CoA synthesis: First, propionyl CoA is carboxylated, forming D-methylmalonyl CoA. The enzyme propionyl CoA carboxylase has an absolute requirement for the coenzymes biotin and ATP, as do ACC and most other carboxylases. b. l-Methylmalonyl CoA formation: Next, the D-isomer is converted to the L-form by the enzyme methylmalonyl CoA racemase. c."

Mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA synthase combines a third molecule of acetyl CoA with acetoacetyl CoA to produce HMG CoA. HMG CoA synthase is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of ketone bodies and is present in significant quantities only in the liver. [Note: HMG CoA is also an intermediate in cytosolic cholesterol synthesis (see p. 220). The two pathways are separated by location in, and conditions of, the cell.] 2."

FA synthesis, a cytosolic process, is favored in the absorptive period by availability of the substrates acetyl CoA (from glucose and amino acid metabolism) and NADPH (from glucose metabolism in the pentose phosphate pathway) and by the activation of ACC, both by dephosphorylation and by the presence of its allosteric activator, citrate. [Note: Inactivity of AMPK favors dephosphorylation.] ACC catalyzes the formation of malonyl CoA from acetyl CoA, the rate-limiting reaction for FA synthesis (see p. 183). [Note: Malonyl CoA inhibits carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I) of FA oxidation (see p. 191). Thus, citrate directly activates FA synthesis and indirectly inhibits FA degradation.] a."

Fatty acyl-CoA cannot enter the inner mitochondrial membrane and requires carnitine as a carrier protein (carnitine shuttle). Once inside the mitochondria, carnitine dissociates, and fatty acyl-CoA is reformed. The carnitine molecule is transported back into the cytosol for reuse.
