Intergenerational mobility refers to the movement of individuals across generations, while intragenerational mobility refers to the movement of individuals within the same generation. Horizontal mobility refers to movement within the same social stratum, while upward mobility refers to movement to a higher social stratum. \\n\\nIn this scenario, the son is moving from being the son of a bricklayer to becoming a teacher, professor, and then a tenured professor. This movement is within the same generation (intragenerational mobility) and involves movement to a higher social stratum (upward mobility). Therefore, the correct answer is intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, upward mobility, horizontal mobility.\\n\\nThe other options are incorrect because:\\n\\n* Intergenerational mobility is not applicable in this scenario as the son is not moving across generations.\\n\\n* Horizontal mobility is not applicable in this scenario as the son is moving to a higher social stratum, not within the same social stratum.\\n\\n* Upward mobility is not the only correct answer, as horizontal mobility is also applicable as the son moves to a different location for a new job, but this is not the primary movement in this scenario. However, since the question asks for sequential movement, and the son moves to a higher social stratum and then to a different location, both upward and horizontal mobility are applicable.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is intragenerational mobility with respect to the son, upward mobility, horizontal mobility.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The hidden curricu-lum is the informal social norms learned by students implicitly, based on their observations of resident and attending behavior. The hidden curriculum has always been present in education, for better or worse, and may be unmasked and studied, but cannot be eliminated. Medical students actively engage in seeking out mentors, and naturally and subconsciously look to their men-tors for cues on how to conduct themselves as physicians, the same way in which a child learns how to behave from a parent or older sibling. Whether or not the witnessed behavior is a positive example of professionalism, the student will begin to perceive that behavior as normal and acceptable. For better or worse, the professional norms of medicine (the Hippocratic oath, respect to patients and colleagues, ethical conduct, personal accountability, empathy, and altruism) are modeled in every personal encounter. It is imperative that all resident and attending"

Late adolescents are usually more committed to their sexual partners than are middle adolescents. Unresolved separation anxiety from previous developmental stages may emerge, at this time, as the young person begins to move physically away from the family of origin to college or vocational school, a job, or military service."

Deliberate effortful practice (over an extended period of time, sometimes said to be 10 years or 10,000 practice hours) and personal coaching are two strategies that are often used outside medicine (e.g., music, athletics, chess) to promote expertise. Their use in developing medical expertise and maintaining or enhancing it has not yet been adequately explored."

Impairment occurs across many different domains of life and is asso- ciated with symptom severity. Impairment can be caused by the time spent obsessing and doing compulsions. Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions or compulsions can also severely restrict functioning. In addition, specific symptoms can create specific obstacles. For example, obsessions about harm can make relationships with family and friends feel hazardous; the result can be avoidance of these relationships. Obsessions about symmetry can derail the timely completion of school or work projects because the project never feels \u201cjust right,\u201d potentially resulting in school failure or job loss. Health consequences can also occur. For example, individuals with contamination concerns may avoid doctors\u2019 offices and hospitals (e.g., because of fears of exposure to germs) or develop dermatological"

Focused History: LT is a widower and lives alone in a suburban community on the East Coast. He no longer drives. His two children live on the West Coast and come east infrequently. Since the death of his wife 11 months ago, he has been isolated and finds it hard to get out of the house. His appetite has changed, and he is content with cereal, coffee, and packaged snacks.

Most entries also include Summary Comments that describe the style and utility of each book for studying. Finally, each book receives a Rating. The books are sorted into a comprehensive section as well as into sections corresponding to the six clinical disciplines (internal medicine, neurology, OB/GYN, pediatrics, psychiatry, and surgery). Within each section, books are arranged first by Rating, then by Author, and finally by Title."
