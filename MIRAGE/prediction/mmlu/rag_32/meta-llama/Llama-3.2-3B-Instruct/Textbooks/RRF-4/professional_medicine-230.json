    "question": "A 16-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because she is concerned that she may have contracted meningitis from her soccer teammate, who was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis and admitted to the hospital yesterday. The patient's soccer team traveled to a neighboring state to participate in a tournament 1 week ago and she shared a hotel room with the girl who was hospitalized. The patient feels well but is concerned she may have \"caught the same bug.\" Medical history is remarkable for asthma. Medications include inhaled albuterol. Vital signs are temperature 37.2\u00b0C (98.9\u00b0F), pulse 64/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 107/58 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention for this patient at this time?",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate intervention for this patient, let's analyze the given information step by step. The patient is a 16-year-old girl with a history of asthma, who recently traveled with her soccer team to a neighboring state and shared a hotel room with a teammate who was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. She is concerned that she may have contracted meningitis. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and there are no physical examination abnormalities. Given her recent travel history and potential exposure to meningococcal meningitis, the primary concern is the risk of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent the development of meningococcal meningitis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends PEP for close contacts of someone with meningococcal meningitis, including people who have been in close contact with the patient, such as sharing a hotel room. The CDC also recommends PEP for individuals who have been in the same household as someone with meningococcal meningitis for the past 3 days. Given that the patient shared a hotel room with the patient who was hospitalized with meningococcal meningitis, PEP is indicated. The CDC recommends PEP with rifampin as the first-line treatment for close contacts of someone with meningococcal meningitis. Rifampin is effective in preventing the development of meningococcal meningitis in close contacts within 2 days of exposure. The other options, administering the meningococcal vaccine, prescribing doxycycline, or prescribing penicillin, are not the most appropriate interventions at this time, as they are not indicated for post-exposure prophylaxis in this scenario. Therefore, the most appropriate intervention is to prescribe rifampin as post-exposure prophylaxis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

Assessment of the patient\u2019s general appearance and vital signs, skin and soft tissue examination, and the neurologic evaluation are of particular importance. The patient may appear either anxious and agitated or lethargic and apathetic. Fever is usually present, although elderly patients and compromised hosts (e.g., patients who are uremic or cirrhotic and those who are taking glucocorticoids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be afebrile despite serious underlying infection. Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate helps determine the degree of hemodynamic and metabolic compromise. The patient\u2019s airway must be evaluated to rule out the risk of obstruction from an invasive oropharyngeal infection."

Critically important immediate steps are to administer high-flow oxygen and to start albuterol by nebulization. Adding ipratropium (Atrovent) to the nebulized solution is recom-mended. A corticosteroid (0.5\u20131.0 mg/kg of methylpred-nisolone) should be administered intravenously. It is also advisable to alert the intensive care unit, because a patient with severe bronchospasm who tires can slip into respiratory failure quickly, and intubation can be difficult.

Fever is most often the result of a systemic infection such as pneumonia or bacterial meningitis or viral encephalitis. An excessively high body temperature (42\u00b0C [107.6\u00b0F] or 43\u00b0C [109.4\u00b0F]) associated with dry skin should arouse suspicion of heat stroke or intoxication by a drug with anticholinergic activity. Fever should not be too easily ascribed to a brain lesion that has disturbed the temperature-regulating center, so-called central fever, which is a rare occurrence. Hypothermia is observed in patients with alcohol or barbiturate intoxication, drowning, exposure to cold, peripheral circulatory failure, advanced tuberculous meningitis, and myxedema."
