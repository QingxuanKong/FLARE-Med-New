This translocation leads to the fusion of portions of the BCR gene on chromosome 22 and the ABL gene on chromosome 9, resulting in the creation of a novel tyrosine kinase with potent transforming activity. This is further supported by Document [4] (Title: InternalMed_Harrison), which states that the Philadelphia chromosome is a cytogenetic abnormality that results from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22.

The Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukemia, for example, is the result of a reciprocal translocation between one chromosome 9 and one chromosome 22. The DNA sequence removed from chromosome 9 contains the proto-oncogene c-ABL and inserts into the BCR gene sequence on chromosome 22 (Philadelphia chromosome).

Figure 101e-3 illustrates the generation of the translocation and its protein product. The consequence of expression of the BCR-ABL gene product is the activation of signal transduction pathways leading to cell growth independent of normal external signals. Imatinib (marketed as Gleevec), a drug that specifically blocks the activity of Abl tyrosine kinase, has shown remarkable efficacy with little toxicity in patients with CML.

The fusion of these genes creates a hybrid gene, called Bcr-Abl, that codes for a chimeric protein consisting of the N-terminal fragment of Bcr fused to the C-terminal portion of Abl (Figure 20\u201342). Abl is a tyrosine kinase involved in cell signaling.

Small extra chromosomes are found in a small percentage of the population (0.06%). These \u201cmarker\u201d chromosomes sometimes are associated with mental retardation and other abnormalities, and other times they have no apparent phenotypic effects."

Identiication of a structural chromosomal abnormality raises two primary questions. First, what phenotypic abnormalities or later developmental abnormalities are associated with this finding? Second, is evaluation of parental karyotype indicated-speciically, are the parents at increased risk of carrying this abnormality? If so, what is their risk of having future afected ofspring?"
