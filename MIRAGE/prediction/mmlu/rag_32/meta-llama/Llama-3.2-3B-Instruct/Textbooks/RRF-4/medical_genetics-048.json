Although uncommon in Western countries, more than 1 billion people are estimated to live in countries in which 20 to 50 percent of marriages are consanguineous (Romeo, 2014). In medical genetics, a union is consanguineous if between second cousins or closer relatives. First-degree relatives share half of their genes, second-degree relatives share a fourth, and third-degree relatives-first cousins-share one eighth. Because of the potential for shared deleterious genes, consanguinity confers an increased risk to have ofspring with otherwise rare autosomal recessive diseases or multifactorial disorders. In population-based series, first cousins are reported to have a twofold risk for congenital anomalies (Sheridan, 2013; Stoltenberg, 1997).

This relatedness or consanguinity does not increase the likelihood of offspring having any particular single genetic disorder, but it may increase the chance that a child will be born with a rare autosomal recessive (AR) condition, as the mutated gene segregates through that family. Generally, the closer the relation between the partners, the greater the chance that the couple shares one or more mutated genes in common, increasing the risk that offspring will have an AR disorder. The risk of first cousins producing a child with an AR disorder is 1 in 64. In evaluating these couples, it is important to determine which ethnic group they belong to and to test for conditions commonly found in that group."

Two fundamental principles are essential for understanding the concept of linkage: (1) when two genes are close together on a chromosome, they are usually transmitted together, unless a recombination event separates them (Figs. 82-6); and (2) the odds of a crossover, or recombination event, between two linked genes is proportional to the distance that separates them. Thus, genes that are farther apart are more likely to undergo a recombination event than genes that are very close together. The detection of chromosomal loci that segregate with a disease by linkage can be used to identify the gene responsible for the disease (positional cloning) and to predict the odds of disease gene transmission in genetic counseling."

In fact, genome comparisons strongly suggest that both lineage-specific gene loss and horizontal gene transfer, in some cases between evolutionarily distant species, have been major factors of evolution, at least among prokaryotes.

Most of the remaining sequence in a gene consists of long stretches of noncoding DNA that interrupt the relatively short segments of DNA that code for protein. As will be discussed in detail in Chapter 6, the coding sequences are called exons; the intervening (noncoding) sequences in genes are called introns (see Figure 4\u201315 and Table 4\u20131).

The HLA genes are closely linked on chromosome 6, so they are passed from parent to offspring en bloc and behave like a single locus with respect to their inheritance patterns.

            "content": "As emphasized in Chapter 3, the recognition of sequence similarity has become a major tool for inferring gene and protein function. Although a sequence match does not guarantee similarity in function, it has proved to be an excellent clue. Thus, it is often possible to predict the function of genes in humans for which no biochemical or genetic information is available simply by comparing their nucleotide sequences with the sequences of genes that have been characterized in other more readily studied organisms. In general, the sequences of individual genes are much more tightly conserved than is overall genome structure. Features of genome organization such as genome size, number of chromosomes, order of genes along chromosomes, abundance and size of introns, and amount of repetitive DNA are found to differ greatly when comparing distant organisms, as does the number of genes that each organism contains."

Genetic linkaGe Genetic linkage refers to the fact that genes are physically connected, or linked, to one another along the chromosomes."

In this case, the complete genomes from a family\u2014parents and offspring\u2014were directly sequenced, and a careful comparison revealed that approximately 70 new single-nucleotide mutations arose in the germ lines of each offspring. Normalized to the size of the human genome, the mutation rate is one nucleotide change per 108 nucleotides per human generation. This is a slight underestimate because some mutations will be lethal and will therefore be absent from progeny; however, because relatively little of the human genome carries critical information, this consideration has only a small effect on the true mutation rate. It is estimated that approximately 100 cell divisions occur in the germ line from the time of conception to the time of production of the eggs and sperm that go on to make the next generation. Thus, the human mutation rate,"
