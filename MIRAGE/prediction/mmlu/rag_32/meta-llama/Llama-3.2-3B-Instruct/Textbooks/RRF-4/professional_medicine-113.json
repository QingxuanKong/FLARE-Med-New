This presentation is suggestive of a skin ulcer, likely a pressure ulcer or a decubitus ulcer. The patient is quadriplegic due to multiple sclerosis and is hospitalized for treatment of left lower lobe pneumonia. The most effective intervention for this patient's skin lesion is to prevent further breakdown and promote healing. Turning the patient frequently is essential to redistribute pressure and prevent skin breakdown. Wet to dry dressings may also be used to keep the wound moist and promote healing. Whirlpool therapy and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy may be used to manage associated infections, but they are not the primary intervention for the skin lesion itself. The patient's quadriplegia and immobility increase the risk of pressure ulcers, and frequent turning is the most effective way to prevent further skin breakdown and promote healing.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

Symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, neurologic, or pulmonary disease help focus the differential diagnosis, as do findings relevant to the jugular venous pressure and waveforms, the arterial pulses, other heart sounds, the lungs, the abdomen, the skin, and the extremities. In many instances, laboratory studies, an ECG, and/or a chest x-ray may have been obtained earlier and may contain valuable information. A patient with suspected infective endocarditis, for example, may have a murmur in the setting of fever, chills, anorexia, fatigue, dyspnea, splenomegaly, petechiae, and positive blood cultures.

            "content": "Radiographic techniques such as ultrasonography, CT, and MRI are all useful for detection of the round or oval hypoechoic cyst of an amebic liver abscess. More than 80% of patients who have had symptoms for >10 days have a single abscess of the right lobe of the liver (Fig. 247-4). Approximately 50% of patients who have had symptoms for <10 days have multiple abscesses. Findings associated with complications include large abscesses (>10 cm) in the superior part of the right lobe, which may rupture into the pleural space; multiple lesions, which must be differentiated from pyogenic abscesses; and lesions of the left lobe, which may rupture into the pericardium. Because abscesses resolve slowly and may increase in size in patients who are responding clinically to therapy, frequent follow-up ultrasonography may prove confusing. Complete resolution of a liver abscess within 6 months can be anticipated in two-thirds of patients, but 10% may have persistent abnormalities for a year."

Abnormal pulse oximetry (a >2% difference between finger and cycle. Pulsus alternans is seen in patients with severe left ventricular toe oxygen saturation) can be used to detect lower extremity peripheral systolic dysfunction and is thought to be due to cyclic changes in intra-arterial disease and is comparable in its performance characteristics to cellular calcium and action potential duration. When pulsus alternans the ankle-brachial index. is associated with electrocardiographic T-wave alternans,"

The patient had noted progressive weakness over several days, to the point that he was unable to rise from bed. Past medical history was notable for small-cell lung cancer with metastases to brain, liver, and adrenals. The patient had been treated with one cycle of cisplatin/etoposide 1 year before this admission, which was complicated by acute kidney injury (peak creatinine of 5, with residual chronic kidney disease), and three subsequent cycles of cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, in addition to 15 treatments with whole-brain radiation. On physical examination, the patient was jaundiced. Blood pressure was 130/70 mmHg, increasing to 160/98 mmHg after 1 L of saline, with a JVP at 8 cm. There was generalized muscle weakness.

In more than half of the cases, the CSF shows a mild increase in cells, mainly lymphocytes, and a modest increase in protein content (although lumbar puncture is not performed to establish the diagnosis). The herpetic nature of the eruption can be confirmed by direct immunofluorescence of a biopsied skin lesion, using antibody to VZV, or inferred by finding multinucleated giant cells in scrapings from the base of an early vesicle (Tzanck smear). The spinal fluid also contains antibodies to the virus or evidence of the organism by PCR testing in 35 percent of cases according to a prospective study by Haanp\u00e4\u00e4 and colleagues."

The weakness is generalized but always more severe in the muscles of the shoulders and hips and proximal portions of the limbs. A tiptoe gait, the result of fibrous contractures of flexors of the ankles, is a common late abnormality. Tendon reflexes are depressed or abolished, but only commensurate with the degree of muscle weakness. Intermittent low-grade fever, substernal and abdominal pain (like that of peptic ulcer), melena, and hematemesis from bowel infarction may occur, the result of an accompanying systemic vasculitis."

Anginal \u201cequivalents\u201d such as dyspnea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, or weakness may occur instead of chest pain and appear to be more frequent in women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes mellitus. The physical examination resembles that in patients with stable angina (Chap. 293) and may be unremarkable. If the patient has a large area of myocardial ischemia or a large NSTEMI, the physical findings can include diaphoresis; pale, cool skin; sinus tachycardia; a third and/or fourth heart sound; basilar rales; and, sometimes, hypotension."
