    "question": "A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of persistent nonproductive cough for 6 weeks. She has not had fever or weight loss. She has hypertension treated with enalapril for the past 3 months. She does not smoke. There is no history of lung disease. She weighs 54 kg (120 lb) and is 163 cm (64 in) tall. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination and an x-ray of the chest show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of this patient's cough?",

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the final answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most likely mechanism of the patient's cough, we need to understand the effects of enalapril on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and how it relates to cough. Enalapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. By inhibiting this conversion, enalapril leads to decreased serum angiotensin II concentrations. Angiotensin II stimulates the release of bradykinin, which is a potent vasodilator and a mediator of cough. However, in the absence of angiotensin II, the compensatory mechanism is the release of other peptides, including substance P, which is a potent cough-inducing agent. Therefore, the most likely mechanism of the patient's cough is increased serum bradykinin concentrations due to the blockade of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity by enalapril. The other options are incorrect because: * Decreased plasma renin activity (A) is not directly related to the mechanism of action of enalapril. * Decreased serum angiotensin I concentrations (B) is not a direct consequence of enalapril treatment, as enalapril blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. * Increased serum angiotensin I concentrations (C) is also not a direct consequence of enalapril treatment, as enalapril blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Increased serum bradykinin concentrations.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

His physician initially prescribed hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic commonly used to treat hyper-tension. His blood pressure was reduced by hydrochloro-thiazide but remained at a hypertensive level (145/95 mm Hg), and he was referred to the university hypertension clinic. Because the patient had elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, hydrochlorothiazide was replaced with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril lowered his blood pressure to almost normotensive levels. However, after several weeks on enalapril, the patient returned complaining of a persistent cough. In addition, some signs of angioedema were detected. How does enalapril lower blood pressure? Why does it occasionally cause coughing and angioedema?

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

What therapeutic measures are appropriate for this patient? What drug, or drugs, (if any) would you prescribe? At her annual physical examination, a 53-year-old middle school teacher complains that she has been having difficulty falling asleep, and after falling asleep, she awakens several times during the night. These episodes now occur almost nightly and are interfering with her ability to teach. She has tried various over-the-counter sleep remedies, but they were of little help and she experienced \u201changover\u201d effects on the day following their use. Her general health is good, she is"

A carotid ultrasound was normal. Her mother had a myo-cardial infarction at age 51 and had no known risk factors other than her presumed HeFH. The patient also has ele-vated lipoprotein (a) at 2.5 times normal and low HDL-C (43 mg/dL). She developed muscle symptoms with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin) so they were discontinued although she did not develop elevated levels of creatine kinase. Her untreated LDL-C is 235 mg/dL and triglycerides 125 mg/dL. Her LDL-C goal for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic vascular disease is in the 70-mg/dL range because of her multiple lipopro-tein risk factors and her mother\u2019s history of premature coronary artery disease. She has no other risk factors and her diet and exercise habits are excellent. How would you manage this patient?"

            "content": "In patients whose mitral orifices are large enough to accommodate a normal blood flow with only mild elevations of LA pressure, marked elevations of this pressure leading to dyspnea and cough may be precipitated by sudden changes in the heart rate, volume status, or CO, as, for example, with severe exertion, excitement, fever, severe anemia, paroxysmal AF 1540 and other tachycardias, sexual intercourse, pregnancy, and thyrotoxicosis. As MS progresses, lesser degrees of stress precipitate dyspnea, the patient becomes limited in daily activities, and orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea develop. The development of persistent AF often marks a turning point in the patient\u2019s course and is generally associated with acceleration of the rate at which symptoms progress. Hemoptysis (Chap. 48) results from rupture of pulmonary-bronchial venous connections secondary to pulmonary venous hypertension. It occurs most frequently in patients who have elevated LA pressures without markedly"

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"

Focused History: BE reports that the attacks started ~3 weeks ago. They last from 2 to 10 minutes, during which time she feels quite anxious. During the attacks, it feels as though her heart is skipping beats (arrhythmia). At first, she thought the attacks were related to recent stress at work and maybe even menopause. The last time it happened, she was in a pharmacy and had her blood pressure taken. She was told it was 165/110 mm Hg. BE notes that she has lost weight (~8 lbs) in this period even though her appetite has been good."

Although a dry, persistent cough may presage HAPE and may be followed by the production of blood-tinged sputum, cough in the mountains is almost universal and the mechanism is poorly understood. Tachypnea and tachycardia, even at rest, are important markers as illness progresses. Crackles may be heard on auscultation but are not diagnostic. HAPE may be accompanied by signs of HACE. Patchy or localized opacities (Fig. 476e-2) or streaky interstitial edema may be noted on chest radiography. In the past, HAPE was mistaken for pneumonia due to the cold or for heart failure due to hypoxia and exertion. Kerley B lines or a bat-wing appearance are not seen on radiography. Electrocardiography may reveal right ventricular strain or even hypertrophy. Hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis are consistently present unless the patient is taking acetazolamide, in which case"

Most commonly, physical examination reveals tachypnea and bibasilar end-inspiratory dry crackles, which are common in most forms of ILD associated with inflammation but are less likely to be heard in the granulomatous lung diseases. Crackles may be present in the absence of radiographic abnormalities on the chest radiograph. Scattered late inspiratory high-pitched rhonchi\u2014so-called inspiratory squeaks\u2014are heard in patients with bronchiolitis. The cardiac examination is usually normal except in the middle or late stages of the disease, when findings of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale may become evident (Chap. 304). Cyanosis and clubbing of the digits occur in some patients with advanced disease."
