    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the concepts of homologous and analogous structures, as well as vestigial structures. Homologous structures are similar in both form and function across different species, while analogous structures are similar in form but not necessarily in function. Vestigial structures are remnants of evolutionary ancestors that have lost their original function over time. The wings of a bat and the wings of a butterfly are both aerial organs used for flight, but they have distinct differences in their morphology, structure, and development. The wings of a bat are actually modified forelimbs, with a different skeletal, muscular, and nervous system organization compared to those of a butterfly. The wings of a butterfly, on the other hand, are actually modified limbs with a unique wing-like structure. Given these differences, the wings of a bat and the wings of a butterfly are not homologous structures, and they do not share a common ancestor. They are not vestigial structures either, as they still have a functional role in their respective species. Therefore, the correct answer is that the wings of a bat and the wings of a butterfly are analogous structures, as they are similar in form but not necessarily in function.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Recognizably similar, evolutionarily related molecules define the specialized animal cell types, mark the differences between body regions, and help create the animal body pattern.

Thus, a human protein produced artificially in a fly, for example, can perform the same function as the fly\u2019s own version of that protein (Figure 21\u20132).

These originate from the epidermis covering the surface of the body and extend inward to invade the underlying tissues, branching and narrowing as they go (Figure 21\u201354). The FGF acts on cells at the tips of the advancing tracheae, causing them to extend filopodia and migrate toward the source of the FGF signal. Because the tip cells remain connected to the remainder of the tracheal epithelium, the pulling force that they generate elongates the tracheal tube."

This type of polarity is called planar cell polarity. In the wing of a fly, for example, each epithelial cell has a tiny asymmetrical projection, called a wing hair, on its surface, and the hairs all point toward the tip of the wing. Similarly, in the inner ear of a vertebrate, each mechanosensory hair cell has a precisely oriented asymmetric bundle of actin-filled, rodlike protrusions called stereocilia sticking up from its apical plasma membrane as a detector of sound and of forces such as gravity. Tilting the bundle in one direction causes ion channels in the membrane to open, electrically activating the cell; tilting in the opposite direction has the opposite effect. For"

Evolution has tuned each of these largely independent processes to run at an appropriate rate, matched to the needs of the organism as a whole. For some purposes, however, this is not enough: a global coordinating signal is required. This is especially true where changes have to occur throughout the body in response to a cue that depends on the environment. For example, when an insect or amphibian undergoes metamorphosis\u2014the transition from larva to adult\u2014almost every part of the body is transformed. The timing of metamorphosis depends on external factors such as the supply of food, which determines when the animal reaches an appropriate size.

The New World rattlesnakes possess a series of interlocking keratin plates (the rattle) on the tip of the tail that emits a buzzing sound when the snake rapidly vibrates its tail; this sound serves as a warning signal to perceived threats. Identifying venomous snakes by color pattern is notoriously misleading, as many harmless snakes have color patterns that closely mimic those of venomous snakes found in the same region."

In the Antennapedia mutant, for example, legs sprout from the head in place of antennae, whereas in the Bithorax mutant, portions of an extra pair of wings appear where normally there should be the much smaller appendages called halteres (Figure 21\u201323). These mutations transform parts of the body into structures appropriate to other positions, and they are called homeotic mutations (from the Greek \u201chomoios,\u201d meaning similar) because the transformation is between structures of a recognizably similar general type, changing one kind of limb, or one kind of segment, into another.

Note that the Engrailed pattern, once established, is preserved throughout the animal\u2019s life. (courtesy of tom Kornberg.) Figure 21\u201323 Homeotic mutations."

There is also asynchrony of electrical activity of the two cerebral hemispheres on the electroencephalogram (EEG). In a few of these patients, an autosomal dominant inheritance was found (Lynn et al). Agenesis of the corpus callosum is also part of the Aicardi syndrome (see further on) and the Andermann syndrome, and it has been noted, without explanation, in some cases of nonketotic hyperglycinemia."

What are the functional consequences of the differing numbers of different receptor molecules between olfactory and gustatory receptor cells? he evolution of vertebrates shows a trend called cephalization in which special sensory organs develop in the heads of animals, along with the corresponding development of the brain. These special sensory systems, which include the visual, auditory, vestibular, olfactory, and gustatory systems, detect and analyze light, sound, and chemical signals in the environment, as well as signal the position and movement of the head. The stimuli transduced by these systems are most familiar to humans when they provide conscious awareness of the environment, but they are equally important as the sensory basis for reflexive and subconscious behavior.

A ligand must therefore fit precisely into a protein\u2019s binding site, like a hand into a glove, so that a large number of noncovalent bonds form between the protein and the ligand. (A) Schematic; (B) space-filling model. (PDB code: 1G6N.) Figure 3\u201338 The binding site of a protein. (A) The folding of the polypeptide chain typically creates a crevice or cavity on the protein surface. This crevice contains a set of amino acid side chains disposed in such a way that they can form noncovalent bonds only with certain ligands. (B) A close-up of an actual binding site, showing the hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions formed between a protein and its ligand. In this example, a molecule of cyclic AMP is the bound ligand."
