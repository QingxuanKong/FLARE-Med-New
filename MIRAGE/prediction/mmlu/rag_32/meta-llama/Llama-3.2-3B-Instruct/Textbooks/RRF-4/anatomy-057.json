The rate of antral contractions is set by the gastric pacemaker; however, the magnitude of the contractions is regulated by release of neurotransmitters from enteric neurons, including substance P and acetylcholine, which increase the level of depolarization of the smooth muscle and therefore produce stronger contractions. In this phase of the meal the pylorus is mostly closed. Thus antral contractions will tend to move the contents toward the pylorus; however, because the pylorus is closed, the contents will be returned to the more proximal part of the stomach. In this way the gastric contents will be mixed. In addition, antral contractions can occlude the lumen, and thus larger particles will be dispersed, a process referred to as grinding ( Fig. 29.14"

Treatable dis-eases of the stomach are common, and it is accessible and rela-tively forgiving of surgical manipulation. To provide accurate diagnosis and rational treatment, the physician must under-stand gastric anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology; this includes a sound understanding of the mechanical, secretory, and endocrine processes by which the stomach accomplishes its important functions and a familiarity with the common benign and malignant gastric disorders. Important historical milestones1-6 that influenced the contemporary understand-ing of gastric disease and surgical therapy are summarized in Table 26-1.ANATOMYAnatomic Relationships and Gross MorphologyThe stomach is the most proximal abdominal organ of the diges-tive tract (Fig. 26-1).7 The part of the stomach attached to the esophagus is called the"

            "content": "The GI tract serves two main functions\u2014assimilating nutrients and eliminating waste. The gut anatomy is organized to serve these functions. In the mouth, food is processed, mixed with salivary amylase, and delivered to the gut lumen. The esophagus propels the bolus into the stomach; the lower esophageal sphincter prevents oral reflux of gastric contents. The esophageal mucosa has a protective squamous histology, which does not permit significant diffusion or absorption. Propulsive esophageal activities are exclusively aboral and coordinate with relaxation of the upper and lower esophageal sphincters on swallowing."

            "content": "he gastrointestinal (GI) tract consists of the alimentary tract from the mouth to the anus and includes the associated glandular organs that empty their contents into the tract. The overall function of the GI tract is to absorb nutrients and water into the circulation and eliminate waste products. The major physiological processes that occur in the GI tract are motility, secretion, digestion, and absorption. Most of the nutrients in the diet of mammals are taken in as solids and as macromolecules that are not readily transported across cell membranes to enter the circulation. Thus digestion consists of physical and chemical modification of food such that absorption can occur across intestinal epithelial cells. Digestion and absorption require motility of the muscular wall of the GI tract to move the contents along the tract and to mix the food with secretions. Secretions from the GI tract and associated organs consist of enzymes, biological detergents, and ions that provide an"
