    "question": "A 10-year-old boy is brought for a follow-up examination 2 days after he was seen in the emergency department because of hives, hoarseness, and light-headedness. His symptoms began 15 minutes after he was stung by a bee and lasted approximately 60 minutes; they resolved before he was treated. He has been stung by bees three times over the past year, and each reaction has been more severe. Examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation to prevent future morbidity and mortality from this condition?",

    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presented with hives, hoarseness, and light-headedness after being stung by a bee. The symptoms began within 15 minutes of the sting and lasted for approximately 60 minutes, which is consistent with an anaphylactic reaction. The patient has a history of severe reactions after being stung by bees in the past, which suggests a history of allergies. The most appropriate recommendation to prevent future morbidity and mortality from anaphylaxis is to carry epinephrine auto-injectors, such as EpiPens, which contain epinephrine. This is because epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis and can help alleviate symptoms and prevent further complications. Options A, B, and C are not appropriate because while avoiding areas with bees and wearing protective clothing can help prevent stings, they do not address the underlying issue of anaphylaxis. Carrying diphenhydramine tablets may be used to treat mild to moderate allergic reactions, but it is not a substitute for epinephrine in the event of a severe anaphylactic reaction.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

He is currently living with friends and has been intermittently homeless, spending time in shelters. He reports drinking about 6 beers per day. In the emergency department, a chest x-ray shows a right apical infiltrate. Given the high suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient is placed in respiratory isolation. His first sputum smear shows many acid-fast bacilli, and an HIV test returns with a positive result. What drugs should be started for treatment of presumptive pulmonary tubercu-losis?

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Earlier that evening, he attended a party but was depressed because his girlfriend just broke up with him. Jerry is failing this year at school and has stopped playing soccer. His parents are also worried about a change in his behavior over the last few months. He has lost interest in school, at times seems depressed, and tells his par-ents that his pocket money is not sufficient. When questioned by the intern, he reports that space-cookies were served at the party. He also says that smoking marijuana has become a habit (three to four joints a week) but denies consumption of alcohol and other drugs. How do you explain the state he was found in? What is the difference between hashish and marijuana? What may be the link to his poor performance at school? Are all drug users necessarily using several drugs?"

Classic physical findings include pale pink or bluish gray, swollen, boggy nasal turbinates with clear, watery secretions. Frequent nasal itching and rubbing of the nose with the palm of the hand, the allergic salute, can lead to a transverse nasal crease found across the lower bridge of the nose. Children may produce clucking sounds by rubbing the soft palate with their tongue. Oropharyngeal examination may reveal lymphoid hyperplasia of the soft palate and posterior pharynx or visible mucus or both. Orthodontic abnormalities may be seen in children with chronic mouth breathing. Allergic shiners, dark periorbital swollen areas caused by venous congestion, along with swollen eyelids or conjunctival injection, are often present in children. Retracted tympanic membranes from eustachian tube dysfunction or serous otitis media also"

At presentation, the total white blood cell counts were ~10,000 cells/\u03bcL; transaminases tended to be elevated, and all 11 had abnormal findings on chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT). Radiologic findings included infiltrates, mediastinal widening, and hemorrhagic pleural effusions. For cases in which the dates of exposure were known, symptoms appeared within 4\u20136 days. Death occurred within 7 days of diagnosis in the five fatal cases (overall mortality rate 55%). Rapid diagnosis and prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy were key to survival."

Between 8:30 and approximately midnight, he and several other pledges consumed beer and a bottle of whiskey, and then he consumed most of a bottle of rum at the urging of upperclassmen. The young man complained of feeling nau-seated, lay down on a couch, and began to lose conscious-ness. Two upperclassmen carried him to a bedroom, placed him on his stomach, and positioned a trash can nearby. Approximately 10 minutes later, the freshman was found unconscious and covered with vomit. There was a delay in treatment because the upperclassmen called the college police instead of calling 911. After the call was transferred to 911, emergency medical technicians responded quickly and discovered that the young man was not breathing and that he had choked on his vomit. He was rushed to the hospital, where he remained in a coma for 2 days before ultimately being pronounced dead. The"

Enzymatic analysis revealed a deficiency of \u03b1galactosidase, and enzyme replacement therapy was recommended. The most likely diagnosis is: A. Fabry disease. B. Farber disease. C. Gaucher disease. D. Krabbe disease. E. Niemann-Pick disease. Correct answer = A. Fabry disease, a deficiency of \u03b1-galactosidase, is the only X-linked sphingolipidosis. It is characterized by pain in the extremities, a red-purple skin rash (generalized angiokeratomas), and kidney and cardiac complications. Protein in his urine indicates kidney damage. Enzyme replacement therapy is available. 7.4. Current medical advice for individuals experiencing chest pain is to call emergency medical services and chew a regular strength, noncoated aspirin. What is the basis for recommending aspirin?"
