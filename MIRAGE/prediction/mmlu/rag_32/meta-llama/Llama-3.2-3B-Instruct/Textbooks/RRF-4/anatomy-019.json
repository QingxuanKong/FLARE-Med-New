The respiratory system is responsible for bringing oxygen into the body and removing carbon dioxide. Air enters the lungs through the airway system, which includes the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. The trachea is the tube that carries air from the throat to the lungs. It is the first part of the airway system to bring air into the lungs. The other options, Aorta, Esophagus, and Pancreas, are not directly involved in bringing air into the lungs. The Aorta is the main artery that carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body. The Esophagus is the tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach. The Pancreas is an organ that produces hormones and digestive enzymes. Therefore, the correct answer is the Trachea, which is the tube that allows air to pass into the lungs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

TLC is the sum of VC and RV; it is the total volume of air contained in the lungs at the end of maximal inspiration, and it includes the volume of air that can be moved (VC) and the volume of air that is always present (trapped) in the lungs (RV). Functional residual capacity (FRC) is the volume of air in the lungs at the end of exhalation during quiet breathing and is also called the resting volume of the lungs. FRC is composed of RV and the expiratory reserve volume (the volume of air that can be exhaled from FRC to RV)."

            "content": "Adequacy of Ventilation As noted above, the respiratory control system that sets the rate of ventilation responds to chemical signals, including arterial CO2 and oxygen tensions and blood pH, and to volitional needs, such as the need to inhale deeply before playing a long phrase on the trumpet. Disturbances in ventilation are discussed in Chap. 318. The focus of this chapter is on the relationship between ventilation of the lung and CO2 elimination. At the end of each tidal exhalation, the conducting airways are filled with alveolar gas that had not reached the mouth when expiratory flow stopped. During the ensuing inhalation, fresh gas immediately enters the airway tree at the mouth, but the gas first entering the alveoli at the start of inhalation is that same alveolar gas in the conducting airways that had just left the alveoli. Accordingly, fresh gas does not enter the alveoli until the volume of the conducting airways has been inspired."

            "content": "The air passages of the respiratory system consist of a conducting portion and a respiratory portion. The conducting portion of the respiratory system consists of those air passages that lead to the sites of respiration within the lung where gas exchange takes place. The conducting passages include those located outside as well as within the lungs. The passages external to the lungs consist of the following: \u0081 Nasal cavities that represent two large air-filled spaces in the uppermost part of the respiratory system (and, during forced breathing, the oral cavity residing inferior to the nasal cavities). \u0081 Nasopharynx that lies behind the nasal cavities and above the level of the soft palate and communicate inferiorly with oropharynx that is posterior to the oral cavity. \u0081 Larynx that is a hollow tubular organ containing cartilaginous framework responsible for producing sounds."

Positive-pressure ventilation increases alveolar pressure and compresses these capillaries and thus blocks blood flow. The pulmonary microcirculation comprises the small vessels that participate in liquid and solute exchange in maintenance of fluid balance in the lung."
