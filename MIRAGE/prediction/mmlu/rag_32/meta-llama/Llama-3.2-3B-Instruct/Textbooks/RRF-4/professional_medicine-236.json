    "question": "A 32-year-old man comes to the physician because he has had difficulty focusing on tasks at work and at home during the past 2 months. He works as an automobile mechanic. He has had a lot of energy for work but often is distracted to the point that he does not complete assigned tasks. He frequently stops working on his own tasks to attempt to develop greater efficiency in his shop. He states that he is delighted with his newfound energy and reports that he now needs only 4 hours of sleep nightly. He has no history of psychiatric illness. He always performed well in school. He has a history of drinking alcohol excessively and using methamphetamines and cocaine during his 20s, but he has not consumed alcohol or used illicit drugs for the past 3 years. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 60/min, and blood pressure is 125/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, he describes his mood as \"good.\" He has a labile affect. His speech is rapid in rate but normal in rhythm, and his thought process is organized. Short- and long-term memory are intact. Attention and concentration are fair; he makes no errors when performing serial sevens, and he can repeat seven digits forward and five in reverse sequence. He has had no delusions or hallucinations. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient presents with difficulty focusing on tasks, excessive energy, and a need for only 4 hours of sleep nightly. He has a history of substance use, but has been sober for 3 years. He also exhibits labile affect, rapid speech, and a fair attention and concentration. The patient's mood is described as 'good,' but he has a labile affect, which suggests mood instability. The patient's thought process is organized, and short- and long-term memory are intact. The key features that suggest a diagnosis are the excessive energy, reduced need for sleep, and difficulty focusing on tasks, which are characteristic of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the patient's history of substance use and the presence of labile affect make it essential to consider other possibilities, including bipolar disorder. Nevertheless, the primary symptoms of ADHD are more consistent with the patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"} The final answer is B.",

Otherwise, asking the date and place, repeating and recalling words, and simple arithmetic are adequate screening procedures.

His diabetes was diagnosed 10 years previously on routine testing. He was initially given metformin but when his control deteriorated, the metformin was stopped and insulin treatment initiated. The patient was taking 50 units of insulin glargine and an average of 25 units of insulin aspartate pre-meals. He had never seen a diabetes educator or a dietitian. He was checking his glucose levels 4 times a day. He was smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. On examination, his weight was 132 kg (BMI 39.5); blood pressure 145/71; and signs of mild peripheral neuropathy were present. Laboratory tests noted an HbA1c value of 8.1%, urine albumin 3007 mg/g creatinine (normal <30), serum creatinine 0.86 mg/dL (0.61\u20131.24), total choles-terol 128 mg/dL, triglycerides 86 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol 38 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 73 mg/dL (on atorvastatin 40 mg daily).

Although depressed patients may complain of memory failure, scrutiny of their complaints will show that they can usually remember the details of their illness and that little or no qualitative change in other intellectual functions has taken place. Their difficulty is either a lack of energy and interest or preoccupation with personal worries and anxiety, which prevents the focusing of attention on anything except their own problems. Even during mental tests, their performance may be impaired by \u201cemotional blocking,\u201d in much the same way as the worried student blocks during an examination. When such patients are calmed by reassurance and encouraged to try harder, their mental function improves, indicating that intellectual"

His gait is unsteady, and he walks with support from his colleague. JM has difficulty speaking and swallowing, his vision is blurred, and his eyes are filled with tears. His coworker notes that JM was working in a field that had been sprayed early in the morning with a material that had the odor of sulfur. Within 3 hours after starting his work, JM complained of tightness in his chest that made breathing difficult, and he called for help before becoming disoriented. How would you proceed to evaluate and treat JM? What should be done for his coworker?"

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."

However, folate has no effect on the neurologic damage caused by B12 deficiency. Over time, then, the neurologic effects can become severe and irreversible. Thus, folate can mask a deficiency of B12 and prevent treatment until the neuropathy is apparent. III. Focused Cases Case 1: Microcytic Anemia Patient Presentation: ME is a 24-year-old man who is being evaluated as a follow-up to a preplacement medical evaluation he had prior to starting his new job. Focused History: ME has no significant medical issues. His family history is unremarkable, but he knows little of the health status of those family members who remain in Greece. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination was normal. Routine analysis of his blood included the following results:"

Curiously, even the inflection used in questioning is repeated. Unlike psychomotor epilepsy, the patient is alert, in contact with his surroundings, and capable of high-level intellectual activity and language function during the attack. As soon as the episode has ended, no abnormality of mental function is apparent except for a permanent gap in memory for a large part of the period of the attack and for a brief period (hours or days) preceding it. The patient may be left with a mild headache. It is possible there are incomplete or mild attacks as brief as 1 h in duration but they are not common (we have observed three such patients) and a typical episode is longer. It is difficult to determine when precisely a given attack began and when it ends is difficult. The condition is among the most curious in medicine and may be mistaken for a psychiatric episode."

Following a sleepless night with significant dyspnea, the patient develops nausea and vomiting and collapses. He presents to the emergency department in cardiac arrest and is unable to be resuscitated. His autopsy shows a posterior wall myocardial infarction and a fresh thrombus in an atherosclerotic right coronary artery. What went wrong? The clinician had decided, based on the patient\u2019s appearance, even before starting the history, that the patient\u2019s complaints were not serious. Therefore, he felt confident that he could perform an abbreviated and focused examination by using the URI assessment protocol rather than considering the broader range of possibilities and performing appropriate tests to confirm or refute his initial hypotheses. In particular, by concentrating on the URI, the clinician failed to elicit the full dyspnea history, which would have"
