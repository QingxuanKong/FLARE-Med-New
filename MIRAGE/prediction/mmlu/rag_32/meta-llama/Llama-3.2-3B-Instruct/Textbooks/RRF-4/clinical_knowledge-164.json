If a bolus of an indicator is rapidly and thoroughly mixed with a moving fluid upstream from a detector, then the concentration of the indicator at the detector will increase sharply and then exponentially diminish back to zero.

When the heart first begins to beat, the arteriovenous pressure gradient is 0, and no blood is transferred from the arteries through the capillaries and into the veins. Thus when beating resumes, blood is depleted from the veins at the rate of 1 L/minute, and arterial blood volume is replenished from venous blood volume at that same absolute rate. Hence, Pv begins to fall and Pa begins to rise. Because of the difference in arterial and venous compliance, Pa rises at a rate 19 times faster than the rate at which Pv falls. The resultant arteriovenous pressure gradient causes blood to flow through the peripheral resistance vessels. If the heart maintains a constant output of 1 L/minute, Pa continues to rise and Pv continues to fall until the pressure gradient becomes 20 mm Hg. This gradient forces a rate of flow of 1 L/minute through a peripheral resistance of 20 mm Hg/L/minute. This gradient is achieved by a 19\u2013mm Hg rise (to 26 mm Hg) in Pa and a 1\u2013mm Hg fall (to 6 mm Hg)"
