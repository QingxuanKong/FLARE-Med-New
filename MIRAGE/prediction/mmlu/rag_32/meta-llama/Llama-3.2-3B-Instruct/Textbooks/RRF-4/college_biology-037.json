Other kinds of bees, ants, and wasps have smooth stinging mechanisms and can sting numerous times in succession. Honeybees, bumblebees, and social wasps generally attack only when a colony is disturbed. Africanized honeybees (now present in South and Central America and the southern and western United States) respond to minimal intrusions more aggressively. Whereas the sting of an Africanized bee contains less venom than that of its non-Africanized relatives, victims tend to sustain far more stings and therefore to receive a far greater overall volume of venom.

            "content": "In the process of feeding on vertebrate blood and tissue fluids, adults of certain flies inflict painful bites, produce local allergic reactions, and may transmit pathogenic agents. Bites of mosquitoes, tiny \u201cno-seeum\u201d (ceratopogonid) midges, and phlebotomine sand flies typically produce a wheal and a pruritic papule. Small humpbacked black flies (simuliids) lacerate skin, resulting in a lesion with serosanguineous discharge that is often painful and pruritic. Regional lymphadenopathy, fever, or anaphylaxis occasionally ensues. The widely distributed deerflies and horseflies as well as the tsetse flies of Africa are stout flies measuring \u226425 mm in length that attack during the day and produce large and painful bleeding punctures. Houseflies (Musca domestica) do not consume blood but use rasping mouthparts to scarify skin and feed upon tissue fluids and salt. Beyond direct injury from bites of any kind 2750 of fly, risks include transmission of diverse pathogens and secondary infection"

            "content": "7.2. Which one of the following statements concerning dietary fat is correct? A. Coconut oil is rich in monounsaturated fats, and olive oil is rich in saturated fats. B. Fatty acids containing trans double bonds, unlike the naturally occurring cis isomers, raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. C. The polyunsaturated fatty acids linoleic and linolenic acids are required components. D. Triacylglycerols obtained from plants generally contain less unsaturated fatty acids than do those from animals. Correct answer = C. Humans are unable to make linoleic and linolenic fatty acids. Consequently, these fatty acids are essential in the diet. Coconut oil is rich in saturated fats, and olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats. Trans fatty acids raise plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, not high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Triacylglycerols obtained from plants generally contain more unsaturated fatty acids than do those from animals."
