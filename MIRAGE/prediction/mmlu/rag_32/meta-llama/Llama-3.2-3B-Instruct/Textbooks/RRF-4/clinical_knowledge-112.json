    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the context of skin care and the properties of shampoo. Shampoo is typically designed for cleaning the hair, not the skin. When used for skin washing, it may not be as effective as soap or other cleansers in removing dirt and other substances from the skin. Additionally, shampoo can be drying to the skin, especially if used excessively. This is because shampoos often contain surfactants that are designed to clean the hair, but these surfactants can strip the skin of its natural oils, leading to dryness and irritation. The question asks why shampoo should not be used for washing the skin when showering or bathing. We can evaluate the options given to determine the best answer. Option A suggests that shampoo is more slippery than soap or emollients, which is not relevant to its use on the skin. Option B states that shampoo will not produce sufficient lather, which is not necessarily true as shampoos can still produce lather on the skin. Option C mentions that shampoo is not cost-effective, which is not a relevant factor in this context. Option D states that shampoo can cause dryness of the skin, which aligns with the known properties of shampoos and their potential effects on the skin. Given this analysis, the best answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Plucking, if done unevenly and repeatedly, may cause in\ufb02ammation and damage to hair follicles and render them less amenable to electrolysis. Waxing is a grouped method of plucking in which hairs are plucked out from under the skin surface. The results of waxing last longer (up to 6 weeks) than shaving or depilatory creams (142). Bleaching removes the hair pigment through the use of hydrogen peroxide (usually 6% strength), which is sometimes combined with ammonia. Although hair lightens and softens during oxidation, this method is frequently associated with hair discoloration or skin irritation and is not always effective (141)."

            "content": "tarantulas and Other Spiders Tarantulas are hairy spiders of which 30 species are found in the United States, mainly in the Southwest. The tarantulas that have become popular household pets are usually imported from Central or South America. Tarantulas bite only when threatened and usually cause no more harm than a bee sting, but on occasion the venom causes deep pain and swelling. Several species of tarantulas are covered with urticating hairs that are brushed off in the thousands when a threatened spider rubs its hind legs across its dorsal abdomen. These hairs can penetrate human skin and produce pruritic papules that may persist for weeks. Failure to wear gloves or to wash the hands after handling the Chilean Rose tarantula, a popular pet spider, has resulted in transfer of hairs to the eye with subsequent devastating ocular inflammation. Treatment of bites includes local washing and elevation of the bitten area, tetanus prophylaxis, and analgesic administration. Antihistamines"
