Mast cells are derived from precursors in the bone marrow and widely distributed in tissues, often residing near blood vessels and nerves and in subepithelial locations. Mast cells express a high-affinity receptor for the Fc portion of the \u03b5 heavy chain of IgE, called Fc\u03b5RI. Even though the serum concentration of IgE is very low (in the range of 1 to 100 \u00b5g/mL), the affinity of the mast cell Fc\u03b5RI receptor is so high that the receptors are always occupied by IgE. These antibody-bearing mast cells are sensitized to react if the specific antigen (the allergen) binds to the antibody molecules. Basophils are circulating cells that resemble mast cells. They also express Fc\u03b5RI, but their role in most immediate hypersensitivity reactions is not established (since these reactions occur in tissues and most basophils are in the circulation). The third cell type that expresses Fc\u03b5RI is eosinophils, which often are present in these reactions."

In any given immunoglobulin molecule, the two heavy chains and the two light chains are identical, giving an antibody molecule two identical antigen-binding sites.

It is triggered by the binding of antigen to IgE antibodies bound to the high-affinity IgE receptor Fc\u03b5RI on mast cells and basophils. Mast cells are strategically distributed beneath the mucosal surfaces of the body and in connective tissue. Antigen cross-linking the IgE on the surface of mast cells causes them to release large amounts of inflammatory mediators. The resulting inflammation can be divided into early events that are characterized by short-lived mediators such as histamine, and later events that involve leukotrienes, cytokines, and chemokines, which recruit and activate eosinophils, basophils, and other leukocytes. This response can evolve into chronic inflammation, which is characterized by the presence of effector T cells and eosinophils, and is most clearly seen in chronic allergic asthma."

            "content": "The classes of immunoglobulins are defined by their heavy-chain C regions, with the different heavy-chain isotypes being encoded by different C-region genes. The heavy-chain C-region genes are present in a cluster 3\u02b9 to the V, D, and J gene segments. A productively rearranged V-region exon is initially expressed in association with \u03bc and \u03b4 CH genes, which are coexpressed in naive B cells by alternative splicing of an mRNA transcript that contains both the \u03bc and \u03b4 CH exons. In addition, B cells can express any class of immunoglobulin as a membrane-bound antigen receptor or as a secreted antibody. This is achieved by differential splicing of mRNA to include exons that encode either a hydrophobic membrane anchor or a secretable tailpiece. The antibody that a B cell secretes upon activation thus recognizes the antigen that initially activated the B cell via its antigen receptor. The same V-region exon can subsequently be associated with any one of the other isotypes to direct the"

            "content": "Basophils are functionally related to, but not identical with, mast cells of the connective tissue (see Table 6.6, page 187). Both mast cells and basophils bind an antibody secreted by plasma cells, IgE, through high-affinity Fc receptors expressed on their cell surface. The subsequent exposure to, and reaction with, the antigen (allergen) specific for IgE triggers the activation of basophils and mast cells and the release of vasoactive agents from cell granules. These substances are responsible for the severe vascular disturbances associated with hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis. Furthermore, both basophils and mast cells are derived from the same basophil\u2013mast cell progenitor (BMCP) cell. If a specific BMCP expresses the granulocyte-related transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), the cell becomes committed to differentiate into a basophil progenitor (BaP) cell. Basophils develop and differentiate in the bone marrow and are released to the peripheral"

Antigen binding to this cell-associated IgE triggers mast cells to release powerful chemical mediators that induce reactions such as coughing, sneezing, and vomiting, which in turn can expel infectious agents, as discussed later in this chapter. 10-16 Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor binds to the Fc regions of IgA and IgM and transports them across epithelial barriers."

When pathogens cross epithelial barriers and establish a local focus of infection, the host must mobilize its defenses and direct them to the site of pathogen growth. One way in which this is achieved is to activate the cells known as mast cells. Mast cells are large cells containing distinctive cytoplasmic granules that contain a mixture of chemical mediators, including histamine, that act rapidly to make local blood vessels more permeable. Mast cells have a distinctive appearance after staining with the dye toluidine blue that makes them readily identifiable in tissues (see Fig. 1.8). They are found in particularly high concentrations in vascularized connective tissues just beneath epithelial surfaces, including the submucosal tissues of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and the dermis of the skin."

            "content": "Murine mast cells and basophils can also produce the signals that drive IgE production by B cells. Mast cells and basophils express Fc\u03b5RI, and when they are activated by antigen cross-linking their Fc\u03b5RI-bound IgE, they express cell-surface CD40 ligand and secrete IL-4. Similar data exist for human basophils that have also been primed by inflammatory stimuli (Fig. 14.3). Like TH2 cells, they can induce class switching and IgE production by B cells. Generally, class switching to IgE occurs in lymph nodes (secondary lymphoid organs) that drain the site of antigen entry or in inducible lymphoid follicles (also called tertiary lymphoid tissues) that form in mucosal and other tissues at sites of persistent inflammation. The potential for formation in mucosal tissues of tertiary lymphoid follicles with germinal centers containing B cells that have switched to production of IgE means that mast cells or basophils can amplify the B-cell response close to the site of the allergic reaction.

            "content": "All immunoglobulins have the basic structure of two heavy and two light chains (Fig. 372e-8). Immunoglobulin isotype (i.e., G, M, A, D, E) is determined by the type of Ig heavy chain present. IgG and IgA isotypes can be divided further into subclasses (G1, G2, G3, G4, and A1, A2) based on specific antigenic determinants on Ig heavy chains. The characteristics of human immunoglobulins are outlined in Table 372e-12. The four chains are covalently linked by disulfide bonds. Each chain is made up of a V region and C regions (also called domains), themselves made up of units of ~110 amino acids. Light chains have one variable (VL) and one constant (CL) unit; heavy chains have one variable unit (VH) and three or four constant (CH) units, depending on isotype. As the name suggests, the constant, or C, regions of Ig molecules are made up of homologous sequences and share the same primary structure as all other Ig chains of the same isotype and subclass. Constant regions are involved in"
