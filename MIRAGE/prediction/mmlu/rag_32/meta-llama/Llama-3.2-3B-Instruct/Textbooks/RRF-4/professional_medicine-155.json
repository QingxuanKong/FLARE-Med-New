The key is to identify the correct contraindications for DTaP vaccine. According to the provided documents, we can analyze each option as follows: \\n\\nA. Allergy to eggs: The DTaP vaccine does not contain egg products, making this option unlikely to be a contraindication. \\n\\nB. Apgar scores at birth: Apgar scores are a measure of newborn health, but they are not typically used to determine contraindications for vaccinations. \\n\\nC. Gestational age at birth: The gestational age at birth is not a contraindication for DTaP vaccination. \\n\\nD. Previous seizures: There is no specific information provided in the documents about seizures being a contraindication for DTaP vaccination. However, DTaP vaccine is generally contraindicated in individuals with a history of severe allergic reactions to any component of the vaccine or to any previous dose of DTaP or its components, not specifically seizures.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, none of the options A, B, C, or D are explicitly listed as contraindications for DTaP vaccination in the provided documents. However, the correct answer should be that none of the options are listed as contraindications, but according to the CDC, the DTaP vaccine is generally contraindicated in individuals with a history of severe allergic reactions to any component of the vaccine or to any previous dose of DTaP or its components, not seizures. The best answer is D. However, since D is not explicitly listed in the options, we must choose the best answer from the options provided.\\n\\nGiven the options, the best answer is D. previous seizures, as it is the closest match to a potential contraindication for DTaP vaccine, even though it is not explicitly listed as a contraindication in the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}}",

For this reason, a three-agent tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (T dap) vaccine is recommended and is safe for pregnant women (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013b, 2016; Morgan, 2015). However, as demonstrated by Healy and coworkers (2013), maternal antipertussis antibodies are relatively shortlived, and T dap administration before pregnancy-or even in the first half of the current pregnancy-is not likely to provide a high level of newborn antibody protection.

In the early 1930s, a trial of a killed, whole bacterial cell vaccine on the Faroe Islands provided evidence of a protective effect.

            "content": "Vaccines should be administered after obtaining informed consent. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Actrequires that all health care providers provide parents or patients with copies of Vaccine Information Statements prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/default.htm ) before administering each vaccine dose. Most vaccines are administered by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. The preferred sites for administration are the anterolateral aspect of the thigh in infants and the deltoid region in children and adults. Multiple vaccines can be administered simultaneously at anatomically separate sites (different limbs, or separated by >1 in.) without diminishing the immune response. MMR and varicella vaccines should be administered simultaneously or more than 30 days apart. Administration of blood products and immunoglobulin can diminish response to live virus vaccines if administered before the recommended interval."

The Neisseria meningitidis polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (Menactra or Menveo) also is recommended. In addition, diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, and inactivated polio vaccines can all be given at these same intervals (12 months and, as required, 24 months after transplantation). Some authorities recommend a new primary series for tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis and inactivated poliovirus vaccines beginning 12 months after transplantation. Vaccination to prevent hepatitis B and hepatitis A (both killed vaccines) also seems advisable. A formal recommendation regarding 929 immunization with the tetravalent HPV virus-like particle vaccine (Gardasil) after HSC transplantation has not been issued. However, HPV vaccination, which can prevent genital warts as well as specific cancers, is recommended through age 26 for healthy young adults who previously have not been vaccinated or"

The peak incidence of pertussis in the United States is among those less than 4 months of age\u2014infants too young to be completely immunized and most likely to have severe complications. The annual rate of pertussis was approximately 100 to 200 cases per 100,000 population in the prevaccination era; worldwide there are an estimated 30 to 50 million cases of pertussis and 300,000 deaths annually. In the United States, the incidence of pertussis decreased after the introduction of vaccine but has increased steadily since the 1980s with more than 27,000 cases reported in 2010. Infections in adolescents have also been rising, likely due to waning immunity from previous vaccines. Likewise when vaccination rates are low, pertussis rates increase: there was a steady decline in the incidence of pertussis until the late 1970s in the United Kingdom, when the incidence increased dramatically as"
