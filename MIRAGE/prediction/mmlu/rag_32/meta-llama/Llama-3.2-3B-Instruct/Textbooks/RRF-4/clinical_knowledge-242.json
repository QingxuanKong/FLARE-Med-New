We can start by looking at the provided documents. According to Document [5], eccrine sweat glands and apocrine sweat glands are both types of sweat glands. Eccrine sweat glands are distributed over the entire body surface except for the lips and part of the external genitalia, while apocrine sweat glands are limited to the axilla, areola, and nipple of the mammary gland; skin around the anus; and the external genitalia. This suggests that both eccrine and apocrine glands are types of sweat glands. We can rule out options B (salivary glands) and D (tear ducts) as they are not related to sweat glands. Option C (chemoreceptors) is also incorrect as chemoreceptors are sensory receptors that detect changes in the chemical composition of the blood or tissues, which is not related to eccrine and apocrine glands. Therefore, the correct answer is A. sweat glands.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The secretory portion of apocrine glands has a wider lumen than that of eccrine glands and is composed of a single cell type. The secretory portion of apocrine glands differs in several respects from that of eccrine glands. The most obvious difference, readily noted in the light microscope, is its very wide lumen (Fig. 15.17 and Plate 44, page 519).

The duct of the apocrine gland is similar to that of the eccrine duct; it has a narrow lumen. However, it continues from the secretory portion of the gland in a relatively straight path to empty into the follicle canal. Because of its straight course, the probability of viewing both the duct and the secretory portion of an apocrine gland in the same histologic section is reduced.

At this very high magnification, two cross-sectioned profiles of the secretory segment (SS) and one profile of the duct segment (DS) from the boxed area to the left are shown. When the tubule wall of the secretory segment is cut in a perpendicular plane, the simple columnar nature of the epithelium (Ep) is evident. Because the tubule is so tortuous, more often the epithelium appears to be multilayered. The myoepithelial cells of the secretory segment appear here both as a circumferential band (CB) and in a cross-sectioned array (CA) in which they resemble the teeth of a saw blade. Occasionally, myoepithelial cell nuclei (MyN) are present. Such profiles give the appearance of a pseudostratified epithelium. The duct segment (DS) lacks the myoepithelium and also differs in that it is stratified cuboidal. See next plate."

While distinct from Paget\u2019s cells, immunohistochemical studies have implicated them as a possible source of Paget\u2019s disease of the nipple.17-20Epidermal AppendagesSweat Glands. Sweat glands, like other epidermal appendages, are derived from the embryologic ectoderm, but the bulk of their substance resides within the dermis. Their structure consists of a tubular-shaped exocrine gland and excretory duct. Eccrine sweat glands make up a majority of the sweat glands in the body and are extremely important to the process of thermoregu-lation. Solutes are released into the gland via exocytosis. They are present in greatest numbers on the palms, soles, axillae, and forehead."

            "content": "\u0081 Apocrine glands of eyelashes (glands of Moll) are small sweat glands with unbranched sinuous tubules that begin as a simple spiral. \u0081 Accessory lacrimal glands are compound serous tubuloalveolar glands that have distended lumina. They are located on the inner surface of the upper eyelids (glands of Wolfring) and in the fornix of the lacrimal sac (glands of Krause). All glands of the human eyelid are innervated by neurons of the autonomic nervous system, and their secretion is synchronized with the lacrimal glands by a common neurotransmitter, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). The eyelashes emerge from the most anterior edge of the lid margin, in front of the openings of the Meibomian glands. The lashes are short, stiff, curved hairs and may occur in double or triple rows. The lashes on the same eyelid margin may have different lengths and diameters. The lacrimal gland produces tears that moisten the cornea and pass to the nasolacrimal duct."
