Adenine is paired to thymidine, and guanine is paired to cytosine, by hydrogen bond interactions that span the double helix (Fig. 82-1). DNA has several remarkable features that make it ideal for the transmission of genetic information. It is relatively stable, and the double-stranded nature of DNA and its feature of strict base-pair complementarity permit faithful replication during cell division. Complementarity also allows the transmission of genetic information from DNA \u2192 RNA \u2192 protein (Fig. 82-2). mRNA is encoded by the so-called sense or coding strand of the DNA double helix and is translated into proteins by ribosomes."

This complementary base-pairing enables the base pairs to be packed in the energetically most favorable arrangement in the interior of the double helix. In this arrangement, each base pair is of similar width, thus holding the sugar-phosphate backbones a constant distance apart along the DNA molecule.

The methylated form of cytosine, 5-methyl cytosine (5-methyl C), has the same relation to cytosine that thymine has to uracil, and the modification likewise has no effect on base-pairing (Figure 7\u201343). DNA methylation in vertebrate DNA occurs on cytosine (C) nucleotides largely in the sequence CG, which is base-paired to exactly the same sequence (in opposite orientation) on the other strand of the DNA helix. Consequently, a simple mechanism permits the existing pattern of DNA methylation to be inherited directly by the daughter DNA strands. An enzyme called maintenance methyl transferase acts preferentially on those CG sequences that are base-paired with a CG sequence that is already methylated. As a result, the pattern of DNA methylation on the parental DNA strand serves as a template for the methylation of the daughter DNA strand, causing"

            "content": "The Chemistry of the DNA Bases Facilitates Damage Detection The DNA double helix seems optimal for repair. As noted above, it contains a backup copy of all genetic information. Equally importantly, the nature of the four bases in DNA makes the distinction between undamaged and damaged bases very clear. For example, every possible deamination event in DNA yields an \u201cunnatural\u201d base, which can be directly recognized and removed by a specific DNA glycosylase. Hypoxanthine, for example, is the simplest purine base capable of pairing specifically with C, but hypoxanthine is the direct deamination product of A (Figure 5\u201343A). The addition of a second amino group to hypoxanthine"

The new strand has a nucleotide sequence complementary to that of the old strand, and a backbone with opposite directionality: corresponding to the GTAA... of the original strand, it has ...TTAc. (d) A normal dnA molecule consists of two such complementary strands. The nucleotides within each strand are linked by strong (covalent) chemical bonds; the complementary nucleotides on opposite strands are held together more weakly, by hydrogen bonds. (e) The two strands twist around each other to form a double helix\u2014a robust structure that can accommodate any sequence of nucleotides without altering its basic structure (see movie 4.1)."

            "content": "In its simplest form, this type of base-pairing interaction can be mimicked in a test tube by allowing a DNA double helix to re-form from its separated single strands. This process, called DNA renaturation or hybridization, occurs when a rare random collision juxtaposes complementary nucleotide sequences on two matching DNA single strands, allowing the formation of a short stretch of double helix between them. This relatively slow helix-nucleation step is followed by a very rapid \u201czippering\u201d step, as the region of double helix is extended to maximize the number of base-pairing interactions (Figure 5\u201347)."

(A) DNA polymerase catalyzes the stepwise addition of a deoxyribonucleotide to the 3\u02b9-OH end of a polynucleotide chain, the growing primer strand that is paired to an existing template strand. The newly synthesized DNA strand therefore polymerizes in the 5\u02b9-to-3\u02b9 direction as shown also in the previous figure. Because each incoming deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate must pair with the template strand to be recognized by the DNA polymerase, this strand determines which of the four possible deoxyribonucleotides (A, C, G, or T) will be added. The reaction is driven by a large, favorable free-energy change, caused by the release of pyrophosphate and its subsequent hydrolysis to two molecules of inorganic phosphate. (B) Structure of DNA polymerase complexed wth DNA (orange), as determined by x-ray crystallography (Movie 5.1). The template DNA strand is the longer strand and the newly synthesized DNA is the shorter. (C) Schematic diagram"

(B) Nucleotide excision repair. In bacteria, after a multienzyme complex has recognized a lesion such as a pyrimidine dimer (see Figure 5\u201339), one cut is made on each side of the lesion, and an associated DNA helicase then removes the entire portion of the damaged strand. The excision repair machinery in bacteria leaves the gap of 12 nucleotides shown. In humans, once the damaged DNA is recognized, a helicase is recruited to unwind the DNA duplex locally. Next, the excision nuclease enters and cleaves on either side of the damage, leaving a gap of about 30 nucleotides. The nucleotide excision repair machinery in both bacteria and humans can recognize and repair many different types of DNA damage."

The asparagine (Asn) of helix 3, for example, contacts an adenine, as shown in Figure 7\u20138. A fexible arm attached to helix 1 forms contacts with nucleotide pairs in the minor groove. The leucine zipper motif is named because of the way the two \u02dchelices, one from each monomer, are joined together to form a short coiled-coil. These proteins bind DNA as dimers where the two long \u02dchelices are held together by interactions between hydrophobic amino acid side chains (often on leucines) that extend from one side of each helix. Just beyond the dimerization interface, the two \u02dchelices separate from each other to form a Y-shaped structure, which allows their side chains to contact the major groove of DNA. The dimer thus grips the double helix like a clothespin on a clothesline. recognition helix recognition helix DNA dimerization interface HELIX\u2013TURN\u2013HELIX PROTEINS HOMEODOMAIN PROTEINS LEUCINE"
