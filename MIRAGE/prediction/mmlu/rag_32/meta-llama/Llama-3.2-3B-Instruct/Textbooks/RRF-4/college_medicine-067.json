    "options": {
        "A": "Seek positive feedback from friends.",
        "B": "Put in daily practice on the tasks she wishes to improve on.",

        "D": "Avoid potential pitfalls by withholding from tasks she is not proficient in."
    },
    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine which option would NOT be a strategy to raise Karen's sense of self-efficacy, let's analyze each choice in the context of the given information and the concept of self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is the belief in one's ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a task. A strong sense of self-efficacy is associated with higher levels of motivation, resilience, and overall well-being. The strategies that promote self-efficacy typically involve learning from successes, receiving feedback, and gradually building skills and confidence through practice and experience. Let's examine each option in light of these principles.\\n\\nA. Seek positive feedback from friends: This strategy can be beneficial for building self-efficacy. Positive feedback from others can enhance one's perception of their abilities and reinforce positive behaviors. Therefore, this would be a strategy that her therapist would ask her to employ to raise her sense of self-efficacy.\\n\\nB. Put in daily practice on the tasks she wishes to improve on: This strategy is directly aligned with the concept of self-efficacy. Through daily practice, Karen can develop skills and confidence, which are key components of self-efficacy. This approach allows her to experience success and learn from her mistakes, thereby reinforcing her belief in her ability to perform tasks.\\n\\nC. Find others her age and ability who excel at tasks she is interested in: This strategy also promotes self-efficacy. Observing and learning from others who excel in similar tasks can inspire and motivate Karen, increasing her belief in her own abilities. This approach can also provide her with new perspectives and ideas, which can aid in her personal growth and development.\\n\\nD. Avoid potential pitfalls by withholding from tasks she is not proficient in: This strategy is counterproductive to building self-efficacy. By avoiding tasks that she is not proficient in, Karen may not be challenged to develop her skills, nor will she have the opportunity to learn from her mistakes. Avoidance can lead to stagnation and reinforce negative self-talk, which can erode her confidence and sense of self-efficacy.\\n\\nTherefore, the strategy that would NOT be recommended by her therapist to raise her sense of self-efficacy is avoiding tasks she is not proficient in.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

For example, these individuals may expect great dedication from others and may overwork them without regard for the impact on their lives. They tend to form friendships or romantic relationships only if the other person seems likely to advance their purposes or otherwise enhance their self\u2014esteem. They often usurp special privileges and extra resources that they believe they deserve because they are so special."

            "content": "A 69-year-old retired teacher presents with a 1-month history of palpitations, intermittent shortness of breath, and fatigue. She has a history of hypertension. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Adaptive functioning involves adaptive reasoning in three domains: conceptual, social, and practical. The conceptual (academic) domain involves competence in memory, language, reading, writing, math reasoning, acquisition of practical knowledge, problem solving, and judgment in novel situations, among others. The social do- main involves awareness of others\u2019 thoughts, feelings, and experiences; empathy; interper\u2014 sonal communication skills; friendship abilities; and social judgment, among others. The practical domain involves learning and self-management across life settings, including personal care, job responsibilities, money management, recreation, self\u2014management of behavior, and school and work task organization, among others.

            "content": "A major and often overlooked element of therapy comes from chemosensory testing itself. Confirmation or lack of conformation of loss is beneficial to patients who come to believe, in light of unsupportive family members and medical providers, that they may be \u201ccrazy.\u201d In cases where the loss is minor, patients can be informed of the likelihood of a more positive prognosis. Importantly, quantitative testing places the patient\u2019s problem into overall perspective. Thus, it is often therapeutic for an older person to know that, while his or her smell function is not what it used to be, it still falls above the average of his or her peer group. Without testing, many such patients are simply told they are getting old and nothing can be done for them, leading in some cases to depression and decreased self-esteem. Disorders of Hearing Anil K.
