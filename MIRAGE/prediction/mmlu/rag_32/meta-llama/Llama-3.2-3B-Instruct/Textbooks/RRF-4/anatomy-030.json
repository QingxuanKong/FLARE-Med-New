Abduction refers to the movement of a limb away from the midline of the body. Eversion refers to the movement of the sole of the foot outwards, or the movement of a limb away from the midline of the body in a plane that is perpendicular to the long axis of the limb. Flexion refers to the bending of a limb towards the midline of the body. Pronation refers to the rotation of the forearm so that the palm faces downwards, or the movement of the forearm in a plane that is perpendicular to the long axis of the limb and towards the midline of the body. Given these definitions, the motion of bending the forearm toward the body can be described as flexion, as it involves bending the forearm towards the midline of the body. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Flexion.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Because the hand is articulated with the radius, it can be efficiently moved from a palm-anterior position to a palm-posterior position simply by crossing the distal end of the radius over the ulna (Fig. 7.5B). This movement, termed pronation, occurs solely in the forearm. Supination returns the hand to the anatomical position. At the wrist joint, the hand can be abducted, adducted, flexed, extended, and circumducted (Fig. 7.6).

The distal portions of the radius and the ulna also articulate with each other. This joint allows the end of the radius to flip from the lateral side to the medial side of the ulna during pronation of the hand. The wrist joint is formed between the radius and carpal bones of the hand and between an articular disc, distal to the ulna, and carpal bones. The bones of the hand consist of the carpal bones, the metacarpals, and the phalanges (Fig. 7.7). The five digits in the hand are the thumb and the index, middle, ring, and little fingers. Joints between the eight small carpal bones allow only limited amounts of movement; as a result, the bones work together as a unit. The five metacarpals, one for each digit, are the primary skeletal foundation of the palm (Fig. 7.7)."

Also note that the joint is spanned by a flexor muscle on one side and an extensor muscle on the opposite side of the joint. Thus contraction of the flexor muscle (see the biceps muscle in Fig. 12.1 ) results in a decrease in the angle of the elbow joint (bringing the forearm closer to the shoulder), whereas contraction of the extensor muscle (see the triceps muscle in Fig. 12.1 ) results in the reverse motion (extending the arm)."

A conventional test for hypotonia is to tap the wrists of the outstretched arms and to detect a displacement through a wider range than normal in the affected limb (or both limbs in diffuse cerebellar disease), sometimes causing the limb to oscillate; this is presumably the result of a failure of the hypotonic muscles to fixate the arm at the shoulder. Another test for hypotonia is to shake the affected limb and demonstrate that the flapping movements of the hand are of wider excursion than normal. If the patient places his elbows on the table with the arms flexed and the hands are allowed to hang limply, the hand of the hypotonic limb will sag.

The muscle that initiates, and is the prime cause of, the movement is called the agonist. Muscles that act similarly to the agonist are called synergists, whereas muscles whose activity opposes the action of the agonist are antagonists. In addition, muscles can act as fixators to immobilize a joint and in postural roles. Moreover, the relationship two muscles have to each other may depend on the specific movement being performed. For example, during elbow flexion, the triceps acts an antagonist to the biceps. In contrast, during supination of the forearm without rotation occurring about the elbow, the biceps (which also acts to supinate the forearm) is again an agonist, but the role of the triceps is that of an elbow fixator."

For example, to make a reaching movement with your arm, you must first identify the target (or goal) and locate it in external space. Next, a limb trajectory must be determined on the basis of an internal representation of your arm and, in particular, your hand in relation to the target. Finally, a set of forces necessary to generate the desired trajectory must be computed. This process is often thought of as a series of transformations between coordinate systems. For example, the location of a visually identified target is measured in a retinotopic space, but its location is perceived in an external or world space (i.e., the position of a nonmoving target is perceived as stable, even when the eye, and thus the target\u2019s image on the retina, changes). Next, calculation of a trajectory would involve a body-or hand-centered system, and finally, forces must ultimately be computed in a muscle-based reference frame."

Collateral ligaments have a tendency to contract when not placed on tension; this becomes relevant when splinting the hand (see later \u201cTrauma\u201d section on splinting).The wrist consists of eight carpal bones divided into two rows (see Fig. 44-2B).2 The proximal row consists of the scaph-oid, lunate, and triquetrum. The lunate is the principle axis of motion of the hand onto the forearm. It bears approximately 35% of the load of the wrist onto the forearm. The scaphoid is shaped like the keel of a boat and bears 55% of the load of the hand onto the forearm, but it also serves as the principle link between the proximal and distal rows, allowing for motion while maintaining stability. Both the scaphoid and the lunate articulate with the radius. The triquetrum resides ulnar to the lunate. It does not interact with the ulna proximally; rather, it interacts with a cartilage suspended between the ulnar styloid and the distal radius called with triangular fibrocartilage"

            "content": "Failure to check a movement is a closely related phenomenon. Thus, after strongly flexing one arm against a resistance that is suddenly released, the patient may be unable to check the flexion movement, to the point where the arm may strike the face. This is the result of a delay in contraction of the triceps muscle, which ordinarily would arrest overflexion of the arm. Stewart and Holmes, who first described this test, made the point that when resistance to flexion is suddenly removed, the normal limb moves only a short distance in flexion and then rebounds very briefly in the opposite direction. Thus, although the two are often conflated, there is a subtle difference between the signs of deficient checking and an excessive rebound of the limb that follows."

The maintained posture is interrupted by relatively slow, writhing or twisting, sinuous, purposeless movements that have a tendency to flow into one another. As a rule, the abnormal movements are most pronounced in the digits and hands, face, tongue, and throat, but no group of muscles is spared. One can detect as the basic patterns of movement an alternation between extension\u2013pronation and flexion\u2013supination of the arm and between flexion and extension of the fingers, the flexed and adducted thumb being trapped by the flexed fingers as the hand closes. Other characteristic movements are eversion\u2013inversion of the foot, retraction and pursing of the lips, twisting of the neck and torso, and alternate wrinkling and relaxation of the forehead or forceful opening and closing of the"
