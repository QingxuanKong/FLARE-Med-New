Document [4] mentions that patients often arrive at clinic visits with sophisticated information about their illnesses, and physicians should guide them to high-quality online resources.\\n\\nDocument [22] emphasizes the importance of informed consent, and Document [26] discusses the need for healthcare providers to be aware of the challenges in providing care to older adults, including those with multiple comorbidities and decreased ability to access information.\\n\\nDocument [25] states that global aging will affect economic growth, migration, patterns of work and retirement, family structures, pension and health systems, and even trade and the relative standing of nations, and Document [28] highlights the importance of maintaining professionalism, including ensuring accuracy of information and disclosing conflicts of interest, especially when using social media.\\n\\nGiven these points, the correct answer is not explicitly stated in the provided options, but we can infer that the reason for careful consideration of internet-based information for people over 65 is related to the challenges they face in accessing and utilizing digital technologies. However, the most relevant point is not explicitly mentioned in the options.\\n\\nBut looking at the options, option B states that less than 30% of people over 65 years have access to the internet, which is a relevant point, but not the main reason. The main reason is not explicitly stated in the options, but option B is the closest to the idea that older adults may face challenges in accessing and utilizing digital technologies.\\n\\nHowever, upon re-reading the documents, I found a relevant point that supports option A, which states that older persons may not be as extensively exposed to technology during their lifetime, making them less technologically savvy (Document [8]). This point is closely related to the challenges older adults face in accessing and utilizing digital technologies.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is not explicitly stated in the options, but option A is the closest to the idea that older adults may face challenges in accessing and utilizing digital technologies, which is supported by Document [8].\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

            "content": "No single theory accounts for all the key features of expertise in medical diagnosis. Experts have more knowledge about more things and a larger repertoire of cognitive tools to employ in problem solving than do novices. One definition of expertise highlights the ability to make powerful distinctions. In this sense, expertise involves a working knowledge of the diagnostic possibilities and what features distinguish one disease from another. Memorization alone is insufficient. Memorizing a medical textbook would not make one an expert. But having access to detailed and specific relevant information is critically important. Clinicians of the past primarily accessed their own remembered experience. Clinicians of the future will be able to access the experience of large numbers of clinicians using electronic tools, but, as with the memorized textbook, the data alone will not create an instant expert. The expert adds these data to an extensive internalized database of knowledge and"

As today\u2019s physicians strive to integrate copious amounts of scientific knowledge into everyday practice, it is critically important that they remember two things: first, that the ultimate goal of medicine is to prevent disease and treat patients; and second, that despite more than 60 years of scientific advances since the first edition of this text, cultivation of the intimate relationship between physician and patient still lies at the heart of successful patient care."

Furthermore, users of social media content must be aware of the potential for bias introduced by undisclosed conflicts of interest and per-form due diligence in assessing the reliability of the source. Lastly, regulatory bodies and professional organizations should publish standardized guidelines for disclosing on social media or develop mechanisms by which disclosure can be publicly accessed (such as the Open Payments database).Fifth, professionalism must always be maintained. Sur-geons posting content on the web or on social media must be aware that information will be widely disseminated and avail-able for posterity; messages posted on social media cannot be fully retracted. As already mentioned, surgeons must strive to maintain patient privacy, ensure accuracy of information, and disclose conflicts of interest. Furthermore, surgeons must be aware of unintentional interpretations of messages (i.e., as discriminatory"
