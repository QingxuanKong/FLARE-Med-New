These involve atoms in the polypeptide backbone, as well as atoms in the amino acid side chains. There are three types of these weak bonds: hydrogen bonds, electrostatic attractions, and van der Waals attractions, as explained in Chapter 2 (see p. 44). Individual noncovalent bonds are 30\u2013300 times weaker than the typical covalent bonds that create biological molecules. But many weak bonds acting in parallel can hold two regions of a polypeptide chain tightly together. In this way, the combined strength of large numbers of such noncovalent bonds determines the stability of each folded shape (Figure 3\u20134)."

All such proteins are directly exposed to extracellular conditions. To help maintain their structures, the polypeptide chains in such proteins are often stabilized by covalent cross-linkages. These linkages can either tie together two amino acids in the same protein, or connect different polypeptide chains in a multisubunit protein. Although many other types exist, the most common cross-linkages in proteins are covalent sulfur\u2013 sulfur bonds. These disulfide bonds (also called S\u2013S bonds) form as cells prepare newly synthesized proteins for export. As described in Chapter 12, their formation is catalyzed in the endoplasmic reticulum by an enzyme that links together two pairs of \u2013SH groups of cysteine side chains that are adjacent in the folded protein (Figure 3\u201325).

If protein folding forces together a number of negatively charged side chains against their mutual repulsion, for example, the affinity of the site for a positively charged ion is greatly increased. In addition, when amino acid side chains interact with one another through hydrogen bonds, normally unreactive groups (such as the \u2013CH2OH on the serine shown in Figure 3\u201339) can become reactive, enabling them to be used to make or break selected covalent bonds. The surface of each protein molecule therefore has a unique chemical reactivity that depends not only on which amino acid side chains are exposed, but also on their exact orientation relative to one another. For this reason, two slightly different conformations of the same protein molecule can differ greatly in their chemistry."

Each amino acid is built around the same core structure through which it can be linked in a standard way to any other amino acid in the set; attached to this core is a side group that gives each amino acid a distinctive chemical character. Each of the protein molecules is a polypeptide, created by joining its amino acids in a particular sequence. Through billions of years of evolution, this sequence has been selected to give the protein a useful function. Thus, by folding into a precise three-dimensional form with reactive sites on its surface (Figure 1\u20137A), these amino-acid polymers can bind with high specificity to other molecules and can act as enzymes to catalyze reactions that make or break covalent bonds. In this way they direct the vast majority of chemical processes in the cell (Figure 1\u20137B)."

            "content": "The SH2 domain functions to link two proteins together. It binds the protein containing it to a second protein that contains a phosphorylated tyrosine side chain in a specific amino acid sequence context, as shown in Figure 3\u201340B. The amino acids located at the binding site for the phosphorylated polypeptide have been the slowest to change during the long evolutionary process that produced Figure 3\u201339 an unusually reactive amino acid at the active site of an enzyme. This example is the \u201ccatalytic triad\u201d Asp-His-Ser found in chymotrypsin, elastase, and other serine proteases (see Figure 3\u201312). The aspartic acid side chain (Asp) induces the histidine (His) to remove the proton from a particular serine (Ser). This activates the serine and enables it to form a covalent bond with an enzyme substrate, hydrolyzing a peptide bond. The many convolutions of the polypeptide chain are omitted here."

Apparently, proteins do not require this type of reinforcement in the relatively mild environment inside the cell. Protein Molecules Often Serve as Subunits for the Assembly of Large Structures The same principles that enable a protein molecule to associate with itself to form rings or a long filament also operate to generate much larger structures formed from a set of different macromolecules, such as enzyme complexes, ribosomes, viruses, and membranes. These large objects are not made as single, giant, covalently linked molecules. Instead they are formed by the noncovalent assembly of many separately manufactured molecules, which serve as the subunits of the final structure. The use of smaller subunits to build larger structures has several advantages: 1."

In addition, noncovalent interactions allow macromolecules to be used as building blocks for the formation of Figure 2\u20138 Three families of macromolecules. each is a polymer formed from small molecules (called monomers) linked together by covalent bonds. Figure 2\u20139 Condensation and hydrolysis as opposite reactions. The macromolecules of the cell are polymers that are formed from subunits (or monomers) by a condensation reaction, and they are broken down by hydrolysis. The condensation reactions are all energetically unfavorable; thus polymer formation requires an energy input, as will be described in the text."

Side chains as attachment sites for other compounds: The polar hydroxyl group of serine, threonine, and (rarely) tyrosine can serve as a site of attachment for structures such as a phosphate group. In addition, the amide group of asparagine, as well as the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine, can serve as a site of attachment for oligosaccharide chains in glycoproteins (see p. 165). C. Amino acids with acidic side chains The amino acids aspartic acid and glutamic acid are proton donors. At physiologic pH, the side chains of these amino acids are fully ionized, containing a negatively charged carboxylate group (\u2212COO\u2212). The fully ionized forms are called aspartate and glutamate. D. Amino acids with basic side chains"
