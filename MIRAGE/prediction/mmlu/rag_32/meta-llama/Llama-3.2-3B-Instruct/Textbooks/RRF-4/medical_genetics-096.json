Hyperammonemia is a condition characterized by an excessive amount of ammonia in the blood, which can be toxic to the central nervous system. It can be caused by various factors, including genetic defects, liver disease, and other metabolic disorders. Let's examine each option to determine which one is associated with hyperammonemia.\\n\\nOption A, galactosaemia, is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to metabolize galactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. While it can cause a range of symptoms, including liver dysfunction, it is not directly associated with hyperammonemia.\\n\\nOption B, Hurler's syndrome, is a genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase, leading to the accumulation of sugar molecules in the body. It can cause a range of symptoms, including liver dysfunction, but it is not typically associated with hyperammonemia.\\n\\nOption C, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, is a genetic disorder that affects the urea cycle, leading to the accumulation of ammonia in the blood. This is a classic cause of hyperammonemia, especially in neonates and young children.\\n\\nOption D, phenylketonuria (PKU), is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. While it can cause a range of symptoms, including neurological problems, it is not typically associated with hyperammonemia.\\n\\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is Option C, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, which is directly associated with hyperammonemia.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Hyperammonemia The capacity of the hepatic urea cycle exceeds the normal rates of ammonia generation, and the levels of blood ammonia are normally low (5\u201335 \u00b5mol/l). However, when liver function is compromised, due either to genetic defects of the urea cycle or liver disease, blood levels can be >1,000 \u00b5mol/l. Such hyperammonemia is a medical emergency, because ammonia has a direct neurotoxic effect on the CNS. For example, elevated concentrations of ammonia in the blood cause the symptoms of ammonia intoxication, which include tremors, slurring of speech, somnolence (drowsiness), vomiting, cerebral edema, and blurring of vision. At high concentrations, ammonia can cause coma and death. There are two major types of hyperammonemia. 1."

The other major source of ammonia (\u224840%) is the kidney (see ).

As a result, excess NH3 reaches the systemic circulation, where it interferes with cerebral metabolism in a way that is not fully understood.

            "content": "Portosystemic encephalopathy is a serious complication of chronic liver disease and is broadly defined as an alteration in mental status and cognitive function occurring in the presence of liver failure. In acute liver injury with fulminant hepatic failure, the development of encephalopathy is a requirement for a diagnosis of fulminant failure. Encephalopathy is much more commonly seen in patients with chronic liver disease. Gut-derived neurotoxins that are not removed by the liver because of vascular shunting and decreased hepatic mass get to the brain and cause the symptoms that we know of as hepatic encephalopathy. Ammonia levels are typically elevated in patients with hepatic encephalopathy, but the correlation between severity of liver disease and height of ammonia levels is often poor, and most hepatologists do not rely on ammonia levels to make a diagnosis. Other compounds and metabolites that may contribute to the development of encephalopathy include certain false"

Poor feeding, hypotonia, apnea, hypothermia, and vomiting rapidly give way to coma and occasionally to intractable seizures. Respiratory alkalosis is common. Death occurs in hours to days if the condition remains untreated. Available @ StudentConsult.com"

            "content": "9.4. Which one of the following would also be elevated in the blood of this patient? A. Asparagine B. Glutamine C. Lysine D. Urea Correct answer = B. Deficiencies of the enzymes of the urea cycle result in the failure to synthesize urea and lead to hyperammonemia in the first few weeks after birth. Glutamine will also be elevated because it acts as a nontoxic storage and transport form of ammonia. Therefore, elevated glutamine accompanies hyperammonemia. Asparagine and lysine do not serve this sequestering role. Urea would be decreased because of impaired activity of the urea cycle. [Note: Alanine would also be elevated in this patient.] 9.5. Why might supplementation with arginine be of benefit to this patient? The arginine will be cleaved by arginase to urea and ornithine. Ornithine will be combined with carbamoyl phosphate by ornithine transcarbamylase to form citrulline. Citrulline, containing one waste nitrogen, will be excreted.

            "content": "Laboratory studies during an acute attack include elevated ammonia, citrulline, and arginine with low or normal levels of glutamine (the latter is usually increased in classic urea cycle defects). The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating mutations in the SLC25A13 gene. Liver transplantation prevents progression of the disease and normalizes biochemical parameters. A diet high in fats and proteins and low in carbohydrates with supplements of arginine and pyruvate is also effective in preventing further episodes, at least in the short term."
