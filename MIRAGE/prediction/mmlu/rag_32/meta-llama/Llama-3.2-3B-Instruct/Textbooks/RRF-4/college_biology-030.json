Connective tissue is a type of connective tissue that supports other tissues and organs, and it consists of cells embedded in an extracellular matrix. The extracellular matrix can contain various components such as glycosaminoglycans, collagens, and other proteins. Thrombin, on the other hand, is a serine protease that plays a crucial role in the coagulation of blood. It is not typically associated with the composition of connective tissue. Fibroblasts are the primary cell type in connective tissue, responsible for producing and maintaining the extracellular matrix. Glycosaminoglycans and collagens are also found in the extracellular matrix of connective tissue. Therefore, the correct answer is thrombin, as it is not typically found in connective tissue.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

In fact, it is the connective tissue that most epithelia rest on. The extracellular matrix of loose connective tissue contains loosely arranged collagen fibers and numerous cells. Some of these cells, the fibroblasts, form and maintain the extracellular matrix. However, most of the cells are migrants from the vascular system and have roles associated with the immune system. In contrast, where only strength is required, collagen fibers are more numerous and densely packed. Also, the cells are relatively sparse and limited to the fiber-forming cell, the fibroblast (Fig. 4.2b). This type of connective tissue is described as dense connective tissue."

In contrast, dense irregular connective tissue contains few cells, almost all of which are fibroblasts that are re-sponsible for the formation and maintenance of the abundant collagen fibers that form the matrix of this tissue. The cells that are typically as-sociated with loose connective tissue are fibroblasts, the collagen-forming cells, and those cells that function in the immune system and those of the body\u2019s general defense system.

No less important than its mechanical role, connective tissue also contains the blood vessels that bring the oxygen and nourishment on which all cells depend. Cells of the immune system roam through connective tissue, passing in and out of blood vessels and lymphatics, and providing defence against infection; and through the meshes of connective tissue run peripheral nerves. Also embedded in connective tissue are the muscles that enable us to move. In these many ways, the cells that form connective tissue and synthesize its various types of extracellular matrix contribute to the support and repair of almost every tissue and organ."
