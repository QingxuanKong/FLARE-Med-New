Anaerobic metabolism refers to the process of generating energy for the cell without the use of oxygen. In the context of glycolysis, anaerobic metabolism would involve the conversion of glucose into pyruvate or lactate without the involvement of oxygen. Let's analyze the options given in the question. Option A, 'without the involvement of ADP', is not correct because ADP is a molecule that is used to generate ATP, and anaerobic metabolism involves the generation of ATP. Option B, 'without the use of glycogen', is also not correct because glycogen can be used as a source of energy in anaerobic metabolism. Option D, 'in the absence of available oxygen', is a broader term that encompasses anaerobic metabolism but is not a specific definition of anaerobic metabolism. Therefore, the correct answer is C, 'without the use of oxygen'. This is because anaerobic metabolism specifically refers to the generation of ATP without the use of oxygen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Anaerobic glycolysis: A net of two molecules of ATP are generated for each molecule of glucose converted to two molecules of lactate (Fig. 8.22). There is no net production or consumption of NADH. 2. Aerobic glycolysis: The generation of ATP is the same as in anaerobic glycolysis (that is, a net gain of two ATP per molecule of glucose). Two molecules of NADH are also produced per molecule of glucose. Ongoing aerobic glycolysis requires the oxidation of most of this NADH by the ETC, producing three ATP for each NADH molecule entering the chain (see p. 77).

Without mitochondria, present-day animal cells would have had to generate all of their ATP through anaerobic glycolysis. When glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate, it releases only a small fraction of the total free energy that is potentially available from glucose oxidation (see Chapter 2). In mitochondria, the metabolism of sugars is complete: pyruvate is imported into the mitochondrion and ultimately oxidized by O2 to CO2 and H2O, which allows 15 times more ATP to be made from a sugar than by glycolysis alone. As explained later, this became possible only when enough molecular oxygen accumulated in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere to allow organisms to take full advantage, via respiration, of the large amounts of energy potentially available from the oxidation of organic compounds."

Only the final step of oxidative metabolism consumes molecular oxygen (O2) directly (see Figure 14\u201310). Nearly all the energy available from metabolizing carbohydrates, fats, and other foodstuffs in earlier stages is saved in the form of energy-rich compounds that feed electrons into the respiratory chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane. These electrons, most of which are carried by NADH, finally combine with O2 at the end of the respiratory chain to form water. The energy released during the complex series of electron transfers from NADH to O2 is harnessed in the inner membrane to generate an electrochemical gradient that drives the conversion of ADP + Pi to ATP. For this reason, the term oxidative phosphorylation is used to describe this final series of reactions (Figure 14\u201312)."

            "content": "phosphorylation, each pair of electrons donated by the NADH produced in mitochondria can provide energy for the formation of about 2.5 molecules of ATP. Oxidative phosphorylation also produces 1.5 ATP molecules per electron pair from the FADH2 produced by succinate dehydrogenase in the mitochondrial matrix, and from the NADH molecules produced by glycolysis in the cytosol. From the product yields of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, we can calculate that the complete oxidation of one molecule of glucose\u2014starting with glycolysis and ending with oxidative phosphorylation\u2014gives a net yield of about 30 molecules of ATP. Nearly all this ATP is produced by the mitochondrial ATP synthase."

            "content": "Figure 14\u201310 A summary of the energy-converting metabolism in mitochondria. pyruvate and fatty acids enter the mitochondrion (top of the figure) and are broken down to acetyl Coa. the acetyl Coa is metabolized by the citric acid cycle, which reduces NaD+ to NaDh, which then passes its high-energy electrons to the first complex in the electron-transport chain. In the process of oxidative phosphorylation, these electrons pass along the electron-transport chain in the inner membrane cristae to oxygen (O2). this electron transport generates a proton gradient, which drives the production of atp by the atp synthase (see Figure 14\u20133). Electrons from the oxidation of succinate, a reaction intermediate in the citric acid cycle (see panel 2\u20139, pp. 106\u2013107), take a separate path to enter this electron-transport chain (not shown, see p. 772)."

            "content": "PFK-1. A total of two ATP are used during this phase of glycolysis. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is cleaved to form two trioses that are further metabolized by the glycolytic pathway, forming pyruvate. During this phase, four ATP and two nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) are produced per glucose molecule. The final step in pyruvate synthesis from phosphoenolpyruvate is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase (PK). This enzyme is allosterically activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and the hepatic isozyme is inhibited covalently by glucagon via the cAMP pathway. PK deficiency accounts for the majority of all inherited defects in glycolytic enzymes. Effects are restricted to RBC and present as mild-tosevere chronic, nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Glycolytic gene transcription is enhanced by insulin and glucose. In anaerobic glycolysis, NADH is reoxidized to NAD+ by the reduction of pyruvate to lactate via lactate dehydrogenase. This occurs in cells such as RBC that lack mitochondria and in"

            "content": "Most chemical energy is released in the last stage in the degradation of a food molecule. In this final process, NADH and FADH2 transfer the electrons that they gained when oxidizing food-derived organic molecules to the electron-transport chain, which is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion (see Figure 14\u201310). As the electrons pass along this long chain of specialized electron acceptor and donor molecules, they fall to successively lower energy states. The energy that the electrons release in this process pumps H+ ions (protons) across the membrane\u2014from the innermost mitochondrial compartment (the matrix) to the intermembrane space (and then to the cytosol)\u2014generating a gradient of H+ ions (Figure 2\u201360). This gradient serves as a major source of energy for cells, being tapped like a battery to drive a variety of energy-requiring reactions. The most prominent of these reactions is the generation of ATP by the phosphorylation of ADP."

At the end of this series of electron transfers, the electrons are passed to molecules of oxygen gas (O2) that have diffused into the mitochondrion, which simultaneously combine with protons (H+) from the surrounding solution to produce water. The electrons have now reached a low energy level, and all the available energy has been extracted from the oxidized food molecule. This process, termed oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 2\u201361), also occurs in the plasma membrane of bacteria. As one of the most remarkable achievements of cell evolution, it is a central topic of Chapter 14. In total, the complete oxidation of a molecule of glucose to H2O and CO2 is used by the cell to produce about 30 molecules of ATP. In contrast, only 2 molecules of ATP are produced per molecule of glucose by glycolysis alone. amino acids and nucleotides are part of the nitrogen Cycle"
