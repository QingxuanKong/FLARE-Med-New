She has a family history of early coronary artery disease (CAD) and her father died suddenly at age 46 years of myocardial infarction. She tells you that she has never had chest pain. She is not currently sexually active and has no children. She claims that her high-stress lifestyle makes it impossible for her to eat regular meals or to follow a special diet, and she usually eats fast food. She exercises two or three times a week for about 20 minutes on a treadmill. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. Her only medication is acetaminophen for tension headaches. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 76 kg (167 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2 . Vital signs today are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities except for mild obesity. Institution of which of the following is the most essential step in the prevention of CAD in this patient?",

The patient has a family history of early CAD, high fasting serum total cholesterol concentration, high BMI, smoking history, and a high-stress lifestyle. She also consumes fast food and has a sedentary exercise routine. According to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, the most essential step in the prevention of CAD is lifestyle modification, which includes a combination of diet, physical activity, and stress management. Among these, a more rigorous and consistent exercise program is recommended for patients with a high risk of CAD, as it can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. While smoking cessation and strict low-calorie diet are also important, they are not the most essential step in this patient's case, as she is not a smoker and her diet is not severely restricted. Biofeedback-based stress reduction programs are not the primary recommended approach for CAD prevention in this context. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B. More rigorous and consistent exercise program.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The prevention of heart disease, especially of CAD, is one of the most important tasks of primary care health givers as well as cardiologists. Prevention begins with risk assessment, followed by attention to lifestyle, such as achieving optimal weight, physical activity, and smoking cessation, and then aggressive treatment of all abnormal risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (Chap. 417). After a complete diagnosis has been established in patients with known heart disease, a number of management options are usually available.

Although a great deal of attention has been directed to these examinations, it is important to recognize that they serve to supplement, not supplant, a careful examination carried out with clinical and noninvasive techniques. A coronary arteriogram should not be performed in lieu of a careful history in patients with chest pain suspected of having ischemic heart disease. Although coronary arteriography may establish whether the coronary arteries are obstructed and to what extent, the results of the procedure by themselves often do not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether a patient\u2019s complaint of chest discomfort is attributable to coronary atherosclerosis and whether or not revascularization is indicated."

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

In the Framingham study, angina was the most common initial symptom of CHD in women, whereas myocardial infarction (MI) was the most common initial presentation in men. Women more often have atypical symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, indigestion, and upper back pain. Although awareness that heart disease is the leading cause of death in women has nearly doubled over the last 15 years, women remain less aware that its symptoms are often atypical, and they are less likely to contact 9-1-1 when they experience such symptoms."

Her hyperlipidemia should be treated vigorously to slow progression of, and if pos-sible reverse, the coronary lesions that are present (see Chapter 35). Coronary angiography is not indicated unless symptoms become much more frequent and severe; revas-cularization may then be considered. Medical treatment of her acute episodes of angina should include sublingual tab-lets or sublingual nitroglycerin spray 0.4\u20130.6 mg. Relief of discomfort within 2\u20134 minutes can be expected. To prevent episodes of angina, a \u03b2blocker such as metoprolol should be tried first. If contraindications to the use of a \u03b2 blocker are present, a mediumto long-acting calcium channel blocker such as verapamil, diltiazem, or amlodipine is likely to be effective.
