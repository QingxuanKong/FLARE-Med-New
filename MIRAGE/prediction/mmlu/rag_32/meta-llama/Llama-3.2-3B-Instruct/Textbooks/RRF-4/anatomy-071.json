Thus in myasthenia gravis, repetitive stimulation, particularly at a rate of between 2 and 5 Hz, may lead to a depression of neuromuscular transmission, with a decrement in size of the response recorded from affected muscles. Similarly, immediately after a period of maximal voluntary activity, single or repetitive stimuli of the motor nerve may elicit larger muscle responses than before, indicating that more muscle fibers are responding. This postactivation facilitation of neuromuscular transmission is followed by a longer-lasting period of depression, maximal between 2 and 4 min after the conditioning period and lasting for as long as 10 min or so, during which responses are reduced in size."

The modern concept of neurohumoral transmission had its beginnings in the early decades of the twentieth century. In 1921, Loewi discovered that stimulation of the vagus nerve released a chemical substance (Vagusstoff) that slowed the heart. Later this substance was shown by Dale to be acetylcholine (ACh). Also, in 1920, Cannon reported that stimulation of the sympathetic trunk released an epinephrine-like substance, which increased the heart rate and blood pressure. He named this substance \u201csympathin,\u201d subsequently shown to be norepinephrine, or NE. Dale found that ACh had pharmacologic effects similar to those obtained by stimulation of parasympathetic nerves; he designated these effects as \u201cparasympathomimetic.\u201d These observations placed neurochemical transmission on solid ground and laid the basis for the distinction between cholinergic and adrenergic transmission in the autonomic nervous system."

A special needle electrode is placed within a muscle and positioned to record action potentials from two muscle fibers belonging to the same motor unit. The time interval between the two potentials will vary in consecutive discharges; this is called the neuromuscular jitter. The jitter can be quantified as the mean difference between consecutive interpotential intervals and is normally between 10 and 50 \u03bcs. This value is increased when neuromuscular transmission is disturbed for any reason, and in some instances impulses in individual muscle fibers may fail to occur because of impulse blocking at the neuromuscular junction. Single-fiber EMG is more sensitive than repetitive nerve stimulation or determination of acetylcholine receptor antibody levels in diagnosing myasthenia gravis."

This allows precise regulation of the reaction of a postsynaptic neuron (or muscle fiber or gland cell). The function of synapses is not simply to transmit impulses in an unchanged manner from one neuron to another. Rather, synapses allow for the processing of neuronal input. Typically, the impulse passing from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic neuron is modified at the synapse by other neurons that, although not in the direct pathway, nevertheless have access to the synapse (see Fig. 12.5). These other neurons may influence the membrane of the presynaptic neuron or the postsynaptic neuron and facilitate or inhibit the transmission of impulses. The firing of impulses in the postsynaptic neuron is caused by the summation of the actions of hundreds of synapses."

If there has been muscle denervation, an electrical pulse of several milliseconds induced by a constant electrical (galvanic) stimulus is required to produce the same response.

The greatly reduced number of receptors and the competitive activity of anti-AChR antibodies (see later) produce postsynaptic potentials of insufficient amplitude to discharge some muscle fibers. Blocked transmission at many endplates results in a reduction in the contractile power of the muscle. This deficiency is reflected first in the ocular and cranial muscles that are both the most continuously active and have the fewest AChRs per motor unit. Fatigue is understandable as the result of the normal decline in the amount of ACh released with each successive impulse."

It causes erythema by dilating cutaneous vessels and edema by releasing histamine from mast cells; it also acts as a chemoattractant for leukocytes. This reaction, called neurogenic inflammation by White and Helme, is mediated by antidromic action potentials from the small nerve cells in the spinal ganglia and is the basis of the axon reflex of Lewis; the reflex is abolished in peripheral nerve diseases and can be studied electrophysiologically as an aid to clinical localization. The final pathway of activation of sensory nerves consists of opening of the various channels that are expressed on the surface of sensory endings and axons, as detailed in an earlier section.

What sequence of events connect the entry of calcium at the presynaptic terminal to release of neurotransmitter? 5. What is the quantal hypothesis of synaptic transmission, and how does the presence of miniature end plate potentials support this hypothesis? 6. Why is the reversal potential of a typical EPSP near 0 mV? 7. What distinguishes EPSPs and IPSPs in terms of underlying ionic conductances, effect on membrane potential, and neuronal firing probability? 8. How does an IPSP still inhibit a neuron when its reversal potential is equal to or more positive than the neuron\u2019s resting potential? 9. What are the mechanisms by which synaptic effects can change over time? 10. What are the criteria for determining a substance is a neurotransmitter, and what are the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters? 11."
