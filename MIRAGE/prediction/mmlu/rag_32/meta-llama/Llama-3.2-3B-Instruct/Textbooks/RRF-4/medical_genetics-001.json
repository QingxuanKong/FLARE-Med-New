However, the two types of proteins are very similar to one another.

Indeed, some proteins (for example, the CAP protein) can act as both a repressor and an activator, depending on the exact placement of their cis-regulatory sequence relative to the promoter: for some genes, the CAP cis-regulatory sequence overlaps the promoter, and CAP binding thereby prevents the assembly of RNA polymerase at the promoter."

The shapes and chemical structures of the bases allow hydrogen bonds to form efficiently only between A and T and between g and C, because atoms that are able to form hydrogen bonds (see Panel 2\u20133, pp. 94\u201395) can then be brought close together without distorting the double helix. As indicated, two hydrogen bonds form between A and T, while three form between g and C. The bases can pair in this way only if the two polynucleotide chains that contain them are antiparallel to each other. Figure 4\u20135 The DNA double helix. A space-filling model of 1.5 turns of the DNA double helix. Each turn of DNA is made up of 10.4 nucleotide pairs, and the center-to-center distance between adjacent nucleotide pairs is 0.34 nm. The coiling of the two strands around each other creates two grooves in the double helix: the wider groove is called the major groove, and the smaller the minor groove, as indicated."

Only transmembrane proteins can function on both sides of Figure 10\u201317 Various ways in which proteins associate with the lipid bilayer. Most membrane proteins are thought to extend across the bilayer as (1) a single \u03b1 helix, (2) as multiple \u03b1 helices, or (3) as a rolled-up \u03b2 sheet (a \u03b2 barrel). Some of these \u201csingle-pass\u201d and \u201cmultipass\u201d proteins have a covalently attached fatty acid chain inserted in the cytosolic lipid monolayer (1). Other membrane proteins are exposed at only one side of the membrane. (4) Some of these are anchored to the cytosolic surface by an amphiphilic \u03b1 helix that partitions into the cytosolic monolayer of the lipid bilayer through the hydrophobic face of the helix."

These proteins drive cells to differentiate into muscle, expressing muscle-specific actins and myosins and all the other specialized cytoskeletal, metabolic, and membrane proteins that a muscle cell needs. Analogously, members of the Achaete/Scute family of transcription regulators drive cells to become neural progenitors. In both these examples, the proteins belong to the basic helix\u2013loop\u2013helix (bHLH) class of transcription regulators (see p. 377), and the same is true for many of the other proteins that induce the differentiation of particular cell types. These master transcription regulators exert their powerful differentiation-inducing activity by binding to many different regulatory sites in the genome and thereby controlling the expression of large numbers of downstream target genes. In one well-studied case, that of an Achaete/Scute family member called Atonal homolog"

            "content": "Special Proteins Help to Open Up the DNA Double Helix in Front of the Replication Fork For DNA synthesis to proceed, the DNA double helix must be opened up (\u201cmelted\u201d) ahead of the replication fork so that the incoming deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates can form base pairs with the template strands. However, the DNA double helix is very stable under physiological conditions; the base pairs are locked in place so strongly that it requires temperatures approaching that of boiling water to separate the two strands in a test tube. For this reason, two additional types of replication proteins\u2014DNA helicases and single-strand DNA-binding proteins\u2014are needed to open the double helix and provide the appropriate single-strand DNA templates for the DNA polymerase to copy."

            "content": "The sequences given here are the consensus sequences, but they can vary substantially from one gene segment to another, even in the same individual, as there is some flexibility in the recognition of these sequences by the enzymes that carry out the recombination. The spacers vary in sequence, but their conserved lengths correspond to one turn (12 bp) or two turns (23 bp) of the DNA double helix. This is thought to bring the heptamer and nonamer sequences to the same side of the DNA helix to allow interactions with proteins that catalyze recombination, but this concept still lacks structural proof. The heptamer\u2013 spacer\u2013nonamer sequence motif\u2014the RSS\u2014is always found directly adjacent to the coding sequence of V, D, or J gene segments. Recombination normally occurs between gene segments located on the same chromosome. A gene segment flanked by an RSS with a 12-bp spacer typically can be joined only to one flanked by a 23-bp spacer RSS. This is known as the 12/23 rule."
