This is incorrect because monocular diplopia occurs when one eye is closed, and binocular diplopia occurs when both eyes are open. Therefore, diplopia can indeed occur even when one eye is covered.\\n\\nOption B: The outer image is always the false image. This is incorrect because the outer image is not always the false image. The position of the outer image depends on the type of strabismus or muscle palsy. In general, the outer image is the image seen by the non-paralytic eye when the eyes are aligned, but this can vary depending on the specific condition.\\n\\nOption C: A fourth nerve palsy occurs when the patient looks upwards. This is correct according to document [24] which states that a lesion of the fourth nerve, which innervates the superior oblique muscle, is the most common cause of isolated symptomatic vertical diplopia, and the patient complains of difficulty looking down and reading or going down stairs.\\n\\nOption D: A sixth nerve palsy causes a divergent squint. This is incorrect because a sixth nerve palsy causes a convergent squint, not divergent. The sixth nerve controls the lateral rectus muscle, which abducts the eye, and paralysis of this muscle results in an inability to abduct the eye, leading to convergence of the eyes.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Orbital pseudotumor, myositis, infection, tumor, thyroid disease, and muscle entrapment (e.g., from a blowout fracture) cause restrictive diplopia.

The direction in which the images are maximally separated indicates the action of the pair of muscles at fault. For example, if the greatest horizontal separation is in looking to the right, either the right abductor (lateral rectus) or the left adductor (medial rectus) muscle is weak; if maximal when gazing to the left, the left lateral rectus and right medial rectus are implicated (Fig. 13-6A and B). As a corollary, if the separation is mainly horizontal, the paresis will be found in one of the horizontally acting recti (a small vertical disparity should be disregarded); if the separation is mainly vertical, the paresis will be found in the vertically acting muscles, and a small horizontal deviation should be disregarded."

Lesions of the sixth nerve result in a paralysis of the abducens muscle and a resultant weakness of lateral or outward movement leading to a crossing of the visual axes. The affected eye deviates medially, that is, in the direction of the opposing muscle. Diplopia is experienced as horizontal separation that is greatest when viewing in the direction of the sixth nerve palsy and in the distance (Fig 13-7A).

The red-glass and other similar tests are most useful when a single muscle is responsible for the diplopia.

            "content": "If the maximum vertical separation of images occurs on looking downward and to the left and the white image is projected farther down than the red, the paretic muscle is the left inferior rectus; if the red image (from the right eye) is lower than the white, the paretic muscle is the right superior oblique. As already mentioned, correction of vertical diplopia by a tilting of the head implicates the superior oblique muscle of the opposite side (or the ipsilateral trochlear nucleus). Separation of images on looking up and to the right or left will similarly distinguish paresis of the inferior oblique and superior rectus muscles. Most patients are attentive enough to open and close each eye and determine the source of the image thrown most outward in the field of maximal separation."
