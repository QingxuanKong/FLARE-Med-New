The two-gene deletion is in trans, meaning one deletion is on the maternal gene and one deletion is on the paternal gene. To determine the percentage of offspring with a two-gene deletion, we need to consider the possible genotypes and phenotypes of the offspring. The woman can be either \\u00e0-thalassemia minor (one gene deletion) or \\u00e0-thalassemia major (two gene deletion). The man can be \\u00e0-thalassemia minor (one gene deletion) or \\u00e0-thalassemia major (two gene deletion). If the woman is \\u00e0-thalassemia minor, she can contribute either one or two deleted genes to her offspring. If the man is \\u00e0-thalassemia major, he can contribute one or two deleted genes to his offspring. Therefore, the possible genotypes of the offspring are: \\u00e0-thalassemia minor (\\u00e0/-\\u00e0) or \\u00e0-thalassemia major (--/-). The probability of each genotype is as follows: P(\\u00e0/-\\u00e0) = P(\\u00e0) \\* P(-/A) = 0.5 \\* 0.5 = 0.25 P(--/-) = P(-/-) \\* P(-/A) = 0.5 \\* 0.5 = 0.25 To find the percentage of offspring with a two-gene deletion, we need to consider the offspring that have the genotype --/--. This genotype occurs when the woman contributes two deleted genes and the man contributes two deleted genes. The probability of this genotype is P(--/--) = P(--/A) \\* P(--/A) = 0.25 \\* 0.25 = 0.0625 Therefore, the percentage of offspring with a two-gene deletion is 0.0625 x 100\\% = 6.25\\%.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

            "content": "hese disorders of globin-chain synthesis are the most common single-gene disorders worldwide (Forget, 2013; Vichinsky, 2013). As many as 200 million people carry a gene for one of these hemoglobinopathies, and hundreds of mutations are known to cause thalassemia syndromes (Chap. 56, p. 1084). In endemic areas such as Mediterranean and Southeast Asian countries, counseling and other prevention strategies have reduced the incidence of new cases by up to 80 percent (Cao, 2013). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2015a) recommends that individuals of high-risk ancestry be ofered carrier screening to allow them informed decision making regarding reproduction and prenatal diagnosis. One method of early prenatal diagnosis is preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), which is coupled with assisted reproductive technologies. Described in Chapter 14 (p. 295), PGD is available for patients at risk for certain thalassemia syndromes (Kuliev, 2011)."

Disease presentation and prognosis vary with the number of genes missing (see Table 2.7-5). Diagnosed by hemoglobin electrophoresis evaluation (but note that this is normal in \u03b1-thalassemia) and DNA studies. Most patients do not require treatment, but those with \u03b2-thalassemia major and hemoglobin H disease are commonly transfusion dependent and should be given iron chelators (deferoxamine) to prevent overload. Erythrocytosis (an abnormal elevation of hematocrit) may be either 1\u00b0 (due to \u2191 RBC production) or 2\u00b0 (due to \u2193 plasma volume and hemoconcentration)."

            "content": "Genomic imprinting is Based on DnA Methylation Mammalian cells are diploid, containing one set of genes inherited from the father and one set from the mother. The expression of a small minority of genes depends on whether they have been inherited from the mother or the father: when the paternally inherited gene copy is active, the maternally inherited gene copy is silent, or vice versa. This phenomenon is called genomic imprinting. Roughly 300 genes are imprinted in humans. Because only one copy of an imprinted gene is expressed, imprinting can \u201cunmask\u201d mutations that would normally be covered by the other, functional copy. For example, Angelman syndrome, a disorder of the nervous system in humans that causes reduced mental ability and severe speech impairment, results from a gene deletion on one chromosomal homolog and the silencing, by imprinting, of the intact gene on the other homolog."

Because of this, routine carrier screening is not ofered. If there is microcytic anemia in the absence of iron deiciency and the hemoglobin electrophoresis is normal, then testing for a-thalassemia can be considered, particularly among individuals of Southeast Asian descent (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2015). Mutations in 3-globin genes may cause reduced or absent production of 3-globin chains. If the mutation afects one gene, it results in 3-thalassemia minor. If both copies are afected, the result is either 3-thalassemia major-termed Cooley anemiaor 3-thalassemia intermedia. Because of reduced production of hemoglobin A among carriers, electrophoresis demonstrates elevated levels of hemoglobins that do not contain 3-chains. hese include hemoglobins F and A2."
