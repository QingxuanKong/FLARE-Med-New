The patient presents with progressive shortness of breath and nonproductive cough, which are common respiratory symptoms of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in systemic sclerosis. The pulmonary function tests show a restrictive pattern with reduced total lung capacity and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, which is consistent with ILD. The histologic examination of a lung biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis. Given the patient's symptoms and test results, the most likely histologic finding in the lung biopsy specimen is a restrictive pattern of pulmonary fibrosis, which is the most common histologic pattern in systemic sclerosis-related ILD. The other options are less likely: intra-alveolar exudates are more characteristic of acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple thromboemboli are a cause of acute respiratory failure, and necrotizing vasculitis is a feature of vasculitis, which is not suggested by the patient's presentation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

In addition, race influences lung volumes; on average, TLC values are ~12% lower in African Americans and 6% lower in Asian Americans than in Caucasian Americans. In practice, a mean \u201cnormal\u201d value is predicted by multivariate regression equations using height, age, and sex, and the patient\u2019s value is divided by the predicted value (often with \u201crace correction\u201d applied) to determine \u201cpercent predicted.\u201d For most measures of lung function, 85\u2013115% of the predicted value can be normal; however, in health, the various lung volumes tend to scale together. For example, if one is \u201cnormal big\u201d with a TLC 110% of the predicted value, then all other lung volumes and spirometry"

Katzung, MD, PhD* A 56-year-old woman presents in the office with a history of recent-onset chest discomfort when jogging or swimming vigorously. The pain is dull but poorly localized; it disap-pears after 5\u201310 minutes of rest. She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"

Markers of poor prognosis include male gender, African-American race, older age at disease onset, extensive skin thickening with truncal involvement, palpable tendon friction rubs, and evidence of significant or progressive visceral organ involvement. Laboratory predictors of increased mortality at initial evaluation include an elevated ESR, anemia, proteinuria and anti\u2013topoisomerase I antibodies. In one study, SSc 2165 patients with extensive skin involvement, lung vital capacity <55% predicted, significant gastrointestinal involvement (pseudoobstruction ormalabsorption), evidenceof cardiac involvement(arrhythmias or congestive heart failure), or scleroderma renal crisis had a cumulative 9-year survival <40%. The severity of PAH is strongly associated with mortality, and SSc patients who had a mean pulmonary arterial pressure \u226545 mmHg had a 33% 3-year survival.

            "content": "If a patient has evidence of both pulmonary and cardiac disease, a cardiopulmonary exercise test should be carried out to determine which system is responsible for the exercise limitation. If, at peak exercise, the patient achieves predicted maximal ventilation, demonstrates an increase in dead space or hypoxemia, or develops bronchospasm, the respiratory system is probably the cause of the problem. Alternatively, if the heart rate is >85% of the predicted maximum, if the anaerobic threshold occurs early, if the blood pressure becomes excessively high or decreases during exercise, if the O2 pulse (O2 consumption/heart rate, an indicator of stroke volume) falls, or if there are ischemic changes on the electrocardiogram, an abnormality of the cardiovascular system is likely the explanation for the breathing discomfort.

Case 3: Hyperglycemia and Hyperketonemia Patient Presentation: MW, a 40-year-old woman, was brought to the hospital in a disoriented, confused state by her husband. Focused History: As noted on her medical alert bracelet, MW has had type 1 diabetes (T1D) for the last 24 years. Her husband reports that this is her first medical emergency in 2 years. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): MW displayed signs of dehydration (such as dry mucous membranes and skin, poor skin turgor, and low blood pressure) and acidosis (such as deep, rapid breathing [Kussmaul respiration]). Her breath had a faintly fruity odor. Her temperature was normal."
