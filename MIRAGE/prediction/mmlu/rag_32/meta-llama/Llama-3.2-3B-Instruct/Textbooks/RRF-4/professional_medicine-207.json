The key concept to focus on is the relationship between exercise, heart rate, and blood pressure. During exercise, the body's demand for oxygen increases, which leads to an increase in heart rate and cardiac output. However, the blood pressure may not increase proportionally with the increase in heart rate. In fact, the total peripheral resistance (TPR) decreases during exercise due to vasodilation in active muscles. The pulse pressure, which is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure, may not change significantly during exercise. The stroke volume, which is the amount of blood pumped by the heart per beat, may increase during exercise to meet the increased oxygen demand. The systolic blood pressure, which is the top number in the blood pressure reading, may also increase during exercise due to the increased cardiac output and peripheral resistance. Given these changes, the total peripheral resistance (TPR) is likely to decrease during exercise, as the blood vessels in the active muscles dilate to increase blood flow. This decrease in TPR is a key factor in maintaining adequate blood flow to the exercising muscles. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Total peripheral resistance.\"} {\"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Pharmacologic treatment of PAD has not been as successful as the medical treatment of CAD (Chap. 293). In particular, vasodilators as a class have not proved to be beneficial.

If the baroreceptors are denervated, the cardiac output and heart rate responses to exercise are small in comparison with those in individuals with normally innervated baroreceptors. However, with total cardiac denervation, exercise still increases cardiac output as much as it does in normal individuals. This increase in cardiac output is achieved chiefly by means of an elevated stroke volume. However, if a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist is given to dogs with denervated hearts, exercise performance is impaired. The \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist prevents the cardiac acceleration and enhanced contractility caused by increased amounts of circulating catecholamines. Therefore, the increase in cardiac output necessary for maximal exercise performance is limited."

The principal increase in cardiac output during exercise must therefore be attributed to other factors. Such ancillary factors include the pronounced reduction in peripheral vascular resistance because of the vasodilation in the active skeletal muscles and the increased contractility of cardiac muscle associated with the generalized increase in sympathetic neural activity. Nevertheless, the increase in heart rate is still an important factor. Abundant data show that if the heart rate cannot increase normally during exercise, the augmentation in cardiac output and the capacity for exercise are severely limited. Because stroke volume changes only slightly during exercise, the increase in heart rate may play an important permissive role in augmenting cardiac output during physical exercise."

During sleep, the heart rate decreases by 10 to 20 beats per minute. It may increase during emotional excitement, and during muscular exercise, it may increase to rates well above 150 beats per minute. In well-trained athletes, the usual resting rate is only approximately 50 beats per minute. Both divisions of the autonomic nervous system tonically influence the cardiac pacemaker, which is normally the sinoatrial (SA) node. The sympathetic nervous system enhances automaticity, whereas the parasympathetic nervous system inhibits it. Changes in heart rate usually involve a reciprocal action of these two divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Thus the heart rate ordinarily increases with a combined decrease in parasympathetic activity and increase in sympathetic activity; the heart rate decreases with the opposite changes in autonomic neural activity."

Blood flow and capillary density are greater in red muscle (slow-twitch muscle with high oxidative capacity) than in white muscle (fast-twitch muscle with low oxidative capacity).

With longer aerobic exercise, blood flow to muscle and the availability of glucose and fatty acids are increased. At first, glucose is the main source of energy during exercise; later, with exhaustion of glycogen stores, energy is provided by oxidation of fatty acids. Thus, muscle failure at a certain phase of exercise is predictive of the type of energy failure.

            "content": "Balance Between Energy Availability and Energy demand Release of phosphate from ATP provides every living cell with the energy required for life. However, the storage of ATP is only enough for 6 sec; therefore, ATP is constantly resynthesized. Although ATP can be resynthesized by anaerobic glycolysis, most of the energy used in the body is generated through aerobic metabolism. Therefore, energy consumption is usually estimated indirectly by oxygen consumption (indirect calorimetry). There is currently no method to measure true \u201cfitness,\u201d which is the maximal energy that can be produced by an organism over extended periods. Thus, fitness is estimated indirectly from peak oxygen consumption (MVo ), often during a maximal treadmill test. gressively with aging (Fig. 11-10), and the rate of decline is accelerated in persons who are sedentary and in those affected by chronic diseases."

            "content": "The threshold for the development of angina pectoris may vary by time of day and emotional state. Many patients report a fixed threshold for angina, which occurs predictably at a certain level of activity, such as climbing two flights of stairs at a normal pace. In these patients, coronary stenosis and myocardial oxygen supply are fixed, and ischemia is precipitated by an increase in myocardial oxygen demand; they are said to have stable exertional angina. In other patients, the threshold for angina may vary considerably within any particular day and from day to day. In such patients, variations in myocardial oxygen supply, most likely due to changes in coronary vasomotor tone, may play an important role in defining the pattern of angina. A patient may report symptoms upon minor exertion in the morning (a short walk or shaving) yet by midday be capable of much greater effort without symptoms. Angina may also be precipitated by unfamiliar tasks, a heavy meal, exposure to cold, or a"

            "content": "Prevention Type 2 DM is preceded by a period of IGT or IFG, and a number of lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic agents prevent or delay the onset of DM. Individuals with prediabetes or increased risk of diabetes should be referred to a structured program to reduce body weight and increase physical activity as well as being screened for cardiovascular disease. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) demonstrated that intensive changes in lifestyle (diet and exercise for 30 min/d five times/week) in individuals with IGT prevented or delayed the development of type 2 DM by 58% compared to placebo. This effect was seen in individuals regardless of age, sex, or ethnic group. In the same study, metformin prevented or delayed diabetes by 31% compared to placebo. The lifestyle intervention group lost 5\u20137% of their body weight during the 3 years of the study. Studies in Finnish and Chinese populations noted similar efficacy of diet and exercise in preventing or delaying type 2 DM. A number"

            "content": "Fig. 19.17 ). Therefore, the increase in cardiac output is proportionally greater than the decrease in TPR. The vasoconstriction produced in the inactive tissues by the sympathetic nervous system (and to some extent by the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla) is important for maintenance of normal or increased blood pressure. Sympathectomy or drug-induced blockade of the adrenergic sympathetic nerve fibers decreases arterial pressure (hypotension) during exercise. Sympathetic neural activity also elicits vasoconstriction in active skeletal muscle when additional muscles are recruited. In experiments in which one leg is working at maximal levels and then the other leg starts to work, blood flow decreases in the first working leg. Furthermore, blood levels of norepinephrine rise significantly during exercise, and most of the norepinephrine is released from sympathetic nerves to the active muscles."
