Dif-ferential diagnosis includes felon, gout, osteomyelitis, trauma, RA, or skin cancer. Treatment of a hand or wrist metastatic lesion must not interfere with treatment of the primary cancer. Treatment is usually palliative (simple excision or amputa-tion). The average life expectancy for these patients is less than 6 months.101BURNSThe palm of the hand makes up approximately 1% of the total body surface area. A burn involving the entire hand and digits is unlikely to cause life-threatening injury or shock, but seem-ingly small burns to the hand may cause severe permanent loss of function if not treated appropriately. Burns to the hand can cause serious shortand long-term disability. All burns to the hand are considered severe injuries that warrant transfer to a dedicated burn center for specialized treatment.

            "content": "Presents with sudden onset of pain and swelling at the site of trauma or recent surgery. Pain often progresses to anesthesia. An area of erythema quickly spreads over the course of hours to days. Margins move out into normal skin, and skin becomes dusky or purplish near the site of insult, ultimately leading to necrosis. Necrosis can initially have the appearance of undermining of the skin and subcutaneous layer; if the skin is open, gloved fingers can easily pass between the two layers to reveal yellow-green necrotic fascia (infection spreads quickly in deep fascia). The most important signs are tissue necrosis, a putrid discharge, bullae, severe pain, gas production, rapid burrowing through fascial planes, lack of classical tissue in\ufb02ammatory signs, and intravascular volume loss. Local radiographs or CT scans show air in tissue. Biopsy from the edge of the lesion can be diagnostic. A surgical emergency. Early and aggressive surgical debridement is critical."

Details on antibiotic allergies, immunosuppression, splenectomy, liver disease, mastectomy, and immunization history should be obtained. The wound should be inspected carefully for evidence of infection, including redness, exudate, and foul odor. The type of wound (puncture, laceration, or scratch); the depth of penetration; and the possible involvement of joints, tendons, nerves, and bones should be assessed. It is often useful to include a diagram or photograph of the wound in the medical record. In addition, a general physical examination should be conducted and should include an assessment of vital signs as well as an evaluation for evidence of lymphangitis, lymphadenopathy, dermatologic lesions, and functional limitations. Injuries to the hand warrant consultation with a hand surgeon for the assessment of tendon, nerve, and muscular damage. Radiographs should be obtained when bone"

            "content": "A 45-year-old man with no significant medical history was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 10 days ago after suffering third-degree burns over 40% of his body. He had been relatively stable until the last 24 hours. Now, he is febrile (39.5\u00b0C [103.1\u00b0F]), and his white blood cell count has risen from 8500 to 20,000/mm3. He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"
