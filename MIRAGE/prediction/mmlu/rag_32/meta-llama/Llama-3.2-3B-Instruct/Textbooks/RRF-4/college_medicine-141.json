When examining the correlates of admission acceptance, two obvious factors that strongly correlated with admissions were GPA and standardized test scores, with correlation values of +0.41 and +0.55 respectively. However, the study also demonstrated that those students who had social networks that overlapped with the alumni networks of the selective colleges were even more likely to be admitted, with a correlation between social network and alumni network of +0.61.

    },
    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of social capital and its relationship to admission acceptance in selective colleges. Social capital refers to the benefits that an individual derives from their social connections, such as access to information, resources, and opportunities. In the context of college admissions, social capital can be thought of as the connections between a student's social network and the alumni network of the selective college. The correlation value of +0.61 between social network and alumni network suggests a strong positive relationship between the two. This implies that students with social connections to the college's alumni network are more likely to be admitted. This can be seen as a demonstration of the value of social capital in gaining an advantage in the college admissions process. The other options do not accurately describe this relationship. Meritocracy (B) refers to a system where admission is based solely on merit, which is not the case here. Cultural capital (A) refers to the cultural knowledge and resources that an individual possesses, which is not directly related to the social connections between networks. A false association (D) does not apply here as the correlation is a real and significant relationship between social network and alumni network.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

One is the two-factor theory of Spearman, who noted that all the separate tests of cognitive abilities correlated with each other, suggesting that a general factor (g factor) enters into all performance. Because none of the correlations between subtests approached unity, he postulated that each test measures not only this general ability (commonly identified with intelligence) but also a subsidiary factors specific to the individual tests, which he designated the s factors. A second theory, the multifactorial theory of Thurstone, proposed that intelligence consists of a number of entirely separable primary mental abilities, such as memory, verbal facility, numerical ability, visuospatial perception, and capacity for problem solving, all of them more or less equivalent. He proposed that these primary abilities, although correlated, are not subordinate to a more"

However, it became evident that the tests used were also greatly influenced by the environment in which the child was reared. Moreover, tests were less reliable in identifying talented children who were not offered optimal opportunities. This led to the equally polarized but widespread belief that intelligence tests are only achievement tests and that environmental factors fostering high performance are the important factors determining intelligence."

Each book receives a rating as follows: The Rating is meant to re\ufb02ect the overall usefulness of the book in preparing for the USMLE Step 2 CK exam. This is based on a number of factors, including: The cost of the book The readability of the text The appropriateness and accuracy of the book The quality and number of sample questions The quality of written answers to sample questions The quality and appropriateness of the illustrations (e.g., graphs, diagrams, photographs) The length of the text (longer is not necessarily better) The quality and number of other books available in the same discipline The importance of the discipline on the USMLE Step 2 CK exam"

            "content": "entry into a highly coveted graduate training program with centuries of tradition. Yet, these medical students are naive to the actual practice of medicine and its professional norms. Along the way to becoming a doctor, many medical students lose some of the optimism, empathy, and excite-ment, particularly during their first and third years of school. Some students come to see the patient-physician relationship as an after-thought to providing care.145,146 Through the \u201chidden curriculum,\u201d formal leadership training, and modeling of professional behavior, surgical residents, and attendings can help medical students to real-ize their vision of becoming empathic physicians.Traditionally, medical schools and professors have unknowingly relied on a hidden curriculum to mold these ide-alistic students into capable professionals. The hidden curricu-lum is the informal social norms learned by students implicitly, based on their observations of resident and attending behavior. The hidden"

For 15-minute scores $2, there is a 53-percent mortality rate and a 36-percent cerebral palsy rate. For 20-minute scores $2, mortality rate is 60 percent, and a cerebral palsy rate is 57 percent. Some outcomes in the Norwegian Study of infants with these low 5-minute Apgar scores are shown in Table33-3. Survivors who had Apgar scores of 0 at 10 minutes have even worse outcomes. In a review of 94 such newborns, 78 died, and al survivors assessed had long-term disabilities (Harrington, 2007). TABLE 33-3.

Intimacy: Intense, unstable, and conflicted close relationships, marked by mistrust, neediness, and anxious preoccupation with real or imagined abandonment; close relationships often viewed in extremes of idealization and devaluation and alternat- ing between overinvolvement and withdrawal."

            "content": "The second analysis of stillbirth risk factors was included in the Stillbirth Collaborative Research Network study described earlier. he validity of stillbirth prediction was assessed based on risks identified in early pregnancy. They found that pregnancy factors known at the start of pregnancy accounted for only a small proportion of stillbirth risk. Except for prior stillbirth or pregnancy loss from causes such as preterm birth or fetal-growth restriction, other risks had limited predictive value (Stillbirth Collaborative Research Network Writing Group, 2011a). he importance of prior stillbirth as a risk for recurrence has been emphasized by Sharma and associates (2006). Specifically, the stillbirth risk was ivefold higher in women with a prior stillbirth. From another report, prior preterm birth, fetal-growth restriction, preeclampsia, and placental abruption were strongly associated with subsequent stillbirth (Rasmussen, 2009). Table 35-2 lists estimates of stillbirth risk"
