    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand what polytene chromosomes are and how they are formed in Drosophila salivary cells. Polytene chromosomes are a type of chromosome that is characterized by their large size and banding pattern. They are formed in Drosophila salivary cells during the process of polytene synthesis, which involves repeated rounds of DNA replication followed by nuclear division. This process allows for the formation of chromosomes with thousands of identical DNA molecules aligned in register. The resulting chromosomes are then condensed and become visible under a light microscope. Given this understanding, let's evaluate the options provided: Option A: not actively carrying out transcription - This is incorrect because polytene chromosomes are known to be actively involved in transcription, as evidenced by the presence of RNA synthesis in polytene chromosome puffs. Option B: produced only during mitosis - This is incorrect because polytene chromosomes are formed during the process of polytene synthesis, which involves repeated rounds of DNA replication followed by nuclear division, not just mitosis. Option C: produced by repeated rounds of DNA replication followed by nuclear division - This is correct because polytene chromosomes are formed through this process in Drosophila salivary cells. Option D: multiple copies of a single chromosome - This is incorrect because polytene chromosomes are formed from multiple copies of a single chromosome, not multiple copies of a single chromosome. \", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Drosophila has four chromosomes, and there are four different chromosome pairs present. but each chromosome is tightly paired with its homolog (so that each pair appears as a single structure), which is not true in most nuclei (except in meiosis). Each chromosome has undergone multiple rounds of replication, and the homologs and all their duplicates have remained in exact register with each other, resulting in huge chromatin cables many DNA strands thick."

About 95% of the DNA in polytene chromosomes is in bands, and 5% is in interbands. A very thin band can contain 3000 nucleotide pairs, while a thick band may contain 200,000 nucleotide pairs in each of its chromatin strands. The chromatin in each band appears dark because the DNA is more condensed than the DNA in interbands; it may also contain a higher concentration of proteins (Figure 4\u201351). This banding pattern seems to reflect the same sort of organization detected in the amphibian lampbrush chromosomes described earlier."

Specific sets of non-histone proteins assemble on these nucleosomes to affect biological function in different ways. Recruitment of some of these non-histone proteins can spread for long distances along the DNA, imparting a similar chromatin structure to broad tracts DNA product is obtained only if proteins hold the two DNA sequences close together in the cell"

Such an analysis in Drosophila has thus far localized more than 50 different chromatin proteins and histone modifications. The results suggest that three major types of repressive chromatin predominate in this organism, along with two major types of chromatin on actively transcribed genes, and that each type is associated with a different complex of non-histone proteins.

The DNA has been stained with a fluorescent dye (DAPI) that binds to it. The DNA is present in chromosomes, which become visible as distinct structures in the light microscope only when they become compact, sausage-shaped structures in preparation for cell division, as shown on the left. The cell on the right, which is not dividing, contains identical chromosomes, but they cannot be clearly distinguished at this phase in the cell\u2019s life cycle, because they are in a more extended conformation.

However, the other crucial advance made in the 1940s was the identification of DNA as the likely carrier of genetic information. This breakthrough in our understanding of cells came from studies of inheritance in bacteria (Figure 4\u20132). But still, as the 1950s began, both how"

            "content": "A preparation of chromosomes derived from mechanically ruptured, dividing cells that are then fixed, plated on a microscope slide, and stained is called a metaphase spread. In the past, chromosomes were routinely stained with Giemsa stain; however, with the recent development of in situ hybridization techniques, the fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) procedure is now more often used to visualize a chromosomal spread. These spreads are observed with fluorescence microscopes, and computer-controlled cameras are then used to capture images of the chromosome pairs. Image-processing software is used to sort the chromosome pairs according to their morphology to form a karyotype (see Fig. F3.1.1a). A variety of molecular probes that are now commercially available are used in cytogenetic testing to diagnose disorders caused by chromosomal abnormalities such as nondisjunctions, transpositions (see Fig. F3.1.1a), deletions (see Fig. F3.1.1b), and duplications of specifc gene sites."

At this stage in development, the egg contains approximately 4000 nuclei. the eve and Giant proteins are both located in the nuclei, and the eve stripes are about four nuclei wide. the pattern for the Giant protein is also shown in figure 7\u201326.

To build up a twodimensional image, data from each point in the plane of focus are collected sequentially by scanning across the field from left to right in a regular pattern of pixels and are displayed on a computer screen. Although not shown in Figure 9\u201319, the scanning is usually done by deflecting the beam with an oscillating mirror placed between the dichroic mirror and the objective lens in such a way that the illuminating spotlight and the degraded by light from other regions of the specimen. Figure 9\u201320 Confocal fluorescence microscopy produces clear optical sections and three-dimensional data sets. the first two micrographs are of the same intact gastrula-stage Drosophila embryo, which has been stained with a fluorescent probe for actin filaments."
