This condition can lead to preterm birth. Additionally, the patient is at increased risk for preterm labor and delivery because she is a gravida 2, para 1, which indicates that she has had one previous pregnancy and delivery. This can increase the risk of preterm labor in subsequent pregnancies. Furthermore, the patient is at increased risk for preterm labor and delivery due to the fact that she has a history of iron deficiency anemia, which can lead to preterm birth. This is a significant risk factor for preterm labor and delivery. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Preterm labor and delivery.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

            "content": "Regardless of its cause, any chronic hypertensive disorder predisposes a woman to develop superimposed preeclampsia syndrome. Chronic underlying hypertension is diagnosed in women with documented blood pressures > 140/90 mm Hg before pregnancy or before 20 weeks' gestation, or both. Hypertensive disorders can create diicult problems with diagnosis and management in women who are not irst seen until after midpregnancy. This is because blood pressure normally drops during the second and early third trimesters in both normotensive and chronically hypertensive women (see Fig. 40-1). Thus, a woman with previously undiagnosed chronic vascular disease who is seen before 20 weeks frequently has blood pressures within normal range. During the third trimester, however, as blood pressures return to their originally hypertensive levels, it may be diicult to determine whether hypertension is chronic or induced by pregnancy. Even a careful search for evidence of preexisting end-organ damage may be"

            "content": "The patient gave no history of these disorders. Upon further questioning, however, the patient revealed that her last menstrual period was 6 weeks before this examination. The senior physician realized that a potential cause of the abdominal pain was a pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). The patient was rushed for an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed no fetus or sac in the uterus. She was also noted to have a positive pregnancy test. The patient underwent surgery and was found to have a ruptured fallopian tube caused by an ectopic pregnancy. Whenever a patient has apparent pelvic pain, it is important to consider the gender-related anatomical differences. Ectopic pregnancy should always be considered in women of childbearing age."

            "content": "With prenatal management of multifetal pregnancy, primary goals aim to prevent or interdict complications as they develop. A major imperative is to prevent preterm delivery of markedly immature neonates. At Parkland Hospital, women with multifetal gestations are seen every 2 weeks beginning at 22 weeks' gestation. A digital cervical examination is performed at each visit to screen for cervical shortening or dilation. Identification of other unique complications discussed earlier may also lead to interventions including admission or early delivery."

A 19-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 36-hour history of lower abdominal pain that was sharp and initially intermittent, later becoming constant and severe. The patient also reported feeling nauseated and vomited once in the ER. She did not have diarrhea and had opened her bowels normally 8 hours before admission. She had no symptoms of dysuria. She was afebrile, slightly tachycardic at 95/min, and had a normal blood pressure. Blood results showed mild leukocytosis of 11.6 x 109/L and normal renal and liver function tests. She reported being sexually active with a long-term partner. She was never pregnant, and the urine pregnancy test on admission was negative."
