    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the normal range of flexion at the knee joint, we need to consider the anatomy and function of the knee joint. The knee joint is a hinge joint that allows mainly flexion and extension. The normal range of motion for a hinge joint is typically limited to 0-130 degrees. However, the range of motion for the knee joint can vary slightly depending on individual factors such as age, sex, and muscle strength. Nevertheless, the generally accepted range of motion for the knee joint is between 0-135 degrees. This range allows for normal activities of daily living, such as bending and straightening the knee. Options A, C, and D suggest a range of motion that exceeds the typical range for a hinge joint, which may indicate abnormal movement or joint pathology. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B, 0-135 degrees.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Mechanical symptoms, such as buckling, catching, or locking, could also signify internal derangement, such as meniscal tears, and need to be evaluated. In the knee, pain with activities requiring knee flexion, such as stair climbing and arising from a chair, often emanates from the patellofemoral compartment of the knee, which does not actively articulate until the knee is bent ~35\u00b0."

A second major function of the lower limbs is to move the body through space. This involves the integration of movements at all joints in the lower limb to position the foot on the ground and to move the body over the foot. Movements at the hip joint are flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, medial and lateral rotation, and circumduction (Fig. 6.5). The knee and ankle joints are primarily hinge joints. Movements at the knee are mainly flexion and extension (Fig. 6.6A). Movements at the ankle are dorsiflexion (movement of the dorsal side of the foot toward the leg) and plantarflexion (Fig. 6.6B)."

As the knee is extended, the surfaces move to the broad and flat areas on the inferior aspects of the femoral condyles. Consequently the joint surfaces become larger and more stable in extension. Another component of the locking mechanism is medial rotation of the femur on the tibia during extension. Medial rotation and full extension tightens all the associated ligaments. Another feature that keeps the knee extended when standing is that the body\u2019s center of gravity is positioned along a vertical line that passes anterior to the knee joint. The popliteus muscle unlocks the knee by initiating lateral rotation of the femur on the tibia."

The joint between the femur and tibia is the principal articulation of the knee joint, but the joint between the patella and femur shares the same articular cavity.

This rotation contributes to \u201clocking\u201d of the knee when fully extended, particularly when standing.

Typically, the injury presents as posterior displacement of the tibia on physical examination (the so called tibial sag sign). Patients complain of knee pain and swelling, inability to bear weight, and instability. The diagnosis is confirmed on MRI. The management, as in ACL injury, depends on the degree of the injury (sprain, partial thickness, full thickness) and the level of desired activity.

Careful examination should distinguish between true articular swelling (caused by bony hypertrophy, synovial effusion or proliferation) and nonarticular (or periarticular) involvement, which usually extends beyond the normal joint margins. Synovial effusion can be distinguished from synovial hypertrophy or bony hypertrophy by palpation or specific maneuvers. For example, small to moderate knee effusions may be identified by the \u201cbulge sign\u201d or \u201cballottement of the patellae.\u201d Bursal effusions (e.g., effusions of the olecranon"

            "content": "The limbs are usually loose and slack, but as the disability progresses, fibrous contractures appear as a result of the limbs remaining in one position and the imbalance between agonists and antagonists. Early in the ambulatory phase of the disease, the feet assume an equinovarus position as a result of shortening of the posterior calf muscles, which act without the normal opposition of the pretibial and peroneal muscles. Later, the hamstring muscles become permanently shortened because of a lack of counteraction of the weaker quadriceps muscles. Similarly, contractures occur in the hip flexors because of the relatively greater weakness of hip extensors and abdominal muscles. This leads to a pelvic tilt and compensatory lordosis to maintain standing equilibrium. The consequences of these contractures account for the habitual posture of the patient with Duchenne dystrophy: lumbar lordosis, hip flexion and abduction, knee flexion, and plantar flexion. As they become severe, these"

            "content": "For knee and hip OA, trials have shown that exercise lessens pain and improves physical function. Most effective exercise regimens consist of aerobic and/or resistance training, the latter of which focuses on strengthening muscles across the joint. Exercises are likely to be effective, especially if they train muscles for the activities a person performs daily. Activities that increase pain in the joint should be avoided, and the exercise regimen needs to be individualized to optimize effectiveness. Range-of-motion exercises, which do not strengthen muscles, and isometric exercises that strengthen muscles, but not through range of motion, are unlikely to be effective by themselves. Low-impact exercises, including water aerobics and water resistance training, are often better tolerated by patients than exercises involving impact loading, such as running or treadmill exercises. A patient should be referred to an exercise class or to a therapist who can create an individualized regimen,"

Those with low activity levels may opt for knee bracing and physiotherapy; however, in the long term the internal damage to the knee leads to the development of early osteoarthritis."

            "content": "In the clinic The collateral ligaments are responsible for stabilizing the knee joint, controlling its sideway movements, and protecting the knee from excessive motion. Injury to the fibular collateral ligament occurs when excessive outward force is applied to the medial side of the knee (varus force), and is less common than an injury to the tibial collateral ligament that is damaged when excessive force is applied inward to the lateral side of the joint (valgus force). Injuries to the tibial collateral ligament can be part of a so called \u201cunhappy triad\u201d that also involves tears of the medial meniscus and the anterior cruciate ligament. The spectrum of injuries to collateral ligaments of the knee range from minor sprains where the ligaments are slightly stretched, but still able to stabilize the knee joint, to full thickness tears where all fibers are torn and the ligaments lose their stabilizing function.
