Although much larger than mitochondria, they are organized on the same principles. They have a highly permeable outer membrane; a much less permeable inner membrane, in which membrane transport proteins are embedded; and a narrow intermembrane space in between. Together, these two membranes form the chloroplast envelope (Figure 14\u201337D). The inner chloroplast membrane surrounds a large space called the stroma, which is analogous to the mitochondrial matrix. The stroma contains many metabolic enzymes and, as for the mitochondrial matrix, it is the place where ATP is made by the head of an ATP synthase.

A single quantum of visible light does not contain enough energy both to withdraw electrons from water, which holds on to its electrons very tightly (redox potential +820 mV) and therefore is a very poor electron donor, and to force them on to NADP+, which is a very poor electron acceptor (redox potential \u2013320 mV). The Z scheme first evolved in cyanobacteria to enable them to use water as a universally available electron source. Other, simpler photosynthetic bacteria have only one photosystem. As we shall see, they cannot use water as an electron source and must rely on other, more energy-rich substrates instead, from which electrons are more readily withdrawn. The ability to extract electrons from water (and thereby to produce molecular oxygen) was acquired by plants when their ancestors took up the endosymbiotic cyanobacteria that later evolved into chloroplasts (see Figure 1\u201331)."

In eukaryotic cells, most of the ATP that powers life processes is produced by specialized, membrane-enclosed, energy-converting organelles. These are of two types. Mitochondria, which occur in virtually all cells of animals, plants, and fungi, burn food molecules to produce ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Chloroplasts, which occur only in plants and green algae, harness solar energy to produce ATP by photosynthesis. In electron micrographs, the most striking features of both mitochondria and chloroplasts are their extensive internal membrane systems.

This conversion caused the precipitation of huge amounts of stable oxides, and the extensive banded iron formations in sedimentary rocks, beginning about 2.7 billion years ago, help to date the spread of the cyanobacteria. By about 2 billion years ago, the supply of Fe2+ was exhausted, and the deposition of further iron precipitates ceased.

            "content": "the Genetic Systems of Mitochondria and Chloroplasts resemble those of prokaryotes As discussed in Chapter 12, it is thought that eukaryotic cells originated through a symbiotic relationship between an archaeon and an aerobic bacterium (a proteobacterium). The two organisms are postulated to have merged to form the ancestor of all nucleated cells, with the archeaon providing the nucleus and the proteobacterium serving as a respiring, ATP-producing endosymbiont\u2014one that would eventually evolve into the mitochondrion (see Figure 12\u20133). This most likely occurred roughly 1.6 billion years ago, when oxygen had entered the atmosphere in substantial amounts (see Figure 14\u201356). The chloroplast was derived later, after the plant and animal lineages diverged, through endocytosis of an oxygen-producing cyanobacterium."

Electrons are fed into the excited chlorophylls by a cytochrome. Lh1 is a bacterial antenna complex."

            "content": "ancient protein family. A related class of membrane proteins, the channelrhodopsins that green algae use to detect light, form ion channels when they absorb a photon. When engineered so that they are expressed in animal brains, these proteins have become invaluable tools in neurobiology because they allow specific neurons to be stimulated experimentally by shining light on them, as we discuss in Chapter 11 (Figure 11\u201332)."
