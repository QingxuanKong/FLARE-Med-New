The provided documents do not explicitly mention prolapsed stomas, high output stomas, herniation around the stoma, or retraction of the stoma as common indications for surgical support. However, we can make an educated inference based on the general principles of surgical care and management of gastrointestinal issues. Surgical support is often used to manage complications related to stomas, such as leaks, obstruction, or herniation. Given the options, herniation around the stoma is a plausible scenario where surgical support might be necessary to manage the condition and prevent further complications. This could involve techniques like herniorrhaphy or other surgical interventions to secure the stoma in place. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C. herniation around the stoma.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Depending on the extent and location of prolapse, surgery may involve a combination of repairs directed to the anterior vagina, vaginal apex, posterior vagina, and perineum. Concomitant surgery may be planned for urinary or fecal incontinence. The surgical route is chosen based on the type and severity of prolapse, the surgeon\u2019s training and experience, the patient\u2019s preference, and the expected or desired surgical outcome. Procedures for prolapse can be broadly categorized into three groups: (i) restorative, which use the patient\u2019s endogenous support structures; (ii) compensatory, which attempt to replace deficient support with permanent graft material; and (iii) obliterative, which close or partially close the vagina (51)."

This type of management should be strongly considered in patients undergoing pelvic exenterations, urinary diversions, or multiple enterectomies (16). Preoperative nutritional support is indicated for patients who have significant preexisting malnutrition or require major elective surgery.

The most commonly used device is an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP), which is inserted into the aorta via the femoral artery and provides temporary hemodynamic support.

This model is based on the seven steps of caring for a surgical patient that are well known to the surgical trainee47: (a) the \u201chistory\u201d is the equivalent of gathering subjec-tive information from involved parties with appropriate empa-thy and listening; (b) the \u201claboratory/studies\u201d are the equivalent of collecting objective data to validate the subjective informa-tion; (c) a \u201cdifferential diagnosis\u201d is formed out of possible root causes of the conflict; (d) the \u201cassessment/plan\u201d is developed in the best interest of all involved parties; the plan, including risks and benefits, is openly discussed in a compassionate style of com-munication; (e) \u201cpreoperative preparation\u201d includes the acquisi-tion of appropriate consultations for clearances, consideration of equipment and supplies needed for implementation, and the"

Michon developed a classification scheme that can be use-ful in guiding surgical treatment (Table 44-1).79 Figure 44-20 (B and C) demonstrates drainage of a stage II FTS. A Brunner incision allows better initial exposure but may yield difficul-ties with tendon coverage if skin necrosis occurs. A 16-gauge catheter or 5-French pediatric feeding tube then is inserted into the tendon sheath through the proximal incision. The sheath is copiously irrigated with normal saline. Avoid excessive fluid extravasation into the soft tissue because the resulting increase in tissue pressure can lead to necrosis of the digit. The catheter is removed after irrigation. The incisions are left open. Some surgeons prefer a continuous irrigation technique for a period of 24 to 48 hours. The catheter is sewn in place, and a small drain is placed at the"

More than 5 billion people lack access to safe, timely, and affordable surgical care.1 Very few surgical procedures occur in countries spending less than U.S. $100 per person on health care per year compared to coun-tries spending greater than U.S. $1000 per person (Fig. 49-1).2Examples of disparities abound. In many countries, including the wealthiest, islands of poverty coexist within cities replete with material resources. Tertiary level hospitals operate within eyesight of slums whose inhabitants have no access to even basic care. Most of the people without access\u2014people in rural areas and in countries with poor infrastructure\u2014are the very people most at risk for death or disability due to lack of surgical care. Often the poor accept and endure many painful and potentially correctable fatal conditions as a fact of life.3-6 Care for"

Usually, the fracture is reamed prior to the insertion of the rod into the intramedullary canal. Screws can then be placed across the cortices of the bone through holes in the rod proximal and distal to the fracture to create a locked construct that further stabilizes the rod. When the fracture is locked proximally and distally, this is called static locking. In situations where patients are severely injured and cannot safely undergo more invasive open surgery, damage control orthope-dics is done by utilizing an external fixator. External fixators are also used when the soft tissues are too swollen or injured to allow for surgical incisions to be safely made. The wrinkle test is helpful in guiding the most suitable time for definitive sur-gery. An external fixation device can be used to temporarily immobilize the fracture, especially"
