Cricothyroidotomy is an emergency procedure to establish an airway when other methods fail. The cricothyroid membrane is a thin, fibrous structure that separates the thyroid cartilage from the cricoid cartilage in the larynx. The correct approach to the cricothyroid membrane is crucial to avoid injury to the vocal cords and other surrounding structures. According to the provided documents, when an emergency opening into the airway is required, the cricothyroid membrane should be pierced inferiorly to avoid injury to the vocal cords. This is because the vocal cords are located above the cricoid cartilage, and piercing the membrane inferior to the cricoid cartilage ensures that the vocal cords are not damaged. Therefore, the correct answer is B. inferior to the cricoid cartilage.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The intrinsic muscles of the larynx (Table 8.19) adjust tension in the vocal ligaments, open and close the rima glottidis, control the inner dimensions of the vestibule, close the rima vestibuli, and facilitate closing of the laryngeal inlet. They do this mainly by: acting on the cricothyroid and crico-arytenoid joints, adjusting the distance between the epiglottis and arytenoid cartilages, pulling directly on the vocal ligaments, and forcing soft tissues associated with the quadrangular membranes and vestibular ligaments toward the midline. The fan-shaped cricothyroid muscles are attached to the anterolateral surfaces of the arch of the cricoid cartilage and expand superiorly and posteriorly to attach to the thyroid cartilage (Fig. 8.222). Each muscle has an oblique part and a straight part:"

            "content": "Examination should include the auricle, external ear canal, and tympanic membrane. The external ear canal of the elderly is often dry and fragile; it is preferable to clean cerumen with wall-mounted suction or cerumen loops and to avoid irrigation. In examining the eardrum, the topography of the tympanic membrane is more important than the presence or absence of the light reflex. In addition to the pars tensa (the lower two-thirds of the tympanic membrane), the pars flaccida (upper one-third of the tympanic membrane) above the short process of the malleus should also be examined for retraction pockets that may be evidence of chronic eustachian tube dysfunction or cholesteatoma. Insufflation of the ear canal is necessary to assess tympanic membrane mobility and compliance. Careful inspection of the nose, nasopharynx, and upper respiratory tract is indicated. Unilateral serous effusion should prompt a fiberoptic examination of the nasopharynx to exclude neoplasms. Cranial nerves should"

Preoperative or intraoperative ultrasonography can be useful for identifying intrathyroidal parathyroid glands. Rarely, the third branchial pouch may maldescend and be found high in the neck (undescended parathymus), anterior to the carotid bulb, along with the missing parathyroid gland. Upper para-thyroid glands are more consistent in position and usually are found near the junction of the upper and middle thirds of the gland, at the level of the cricoid cartilage (Fig. 38-33C). Ectopic upper glands may be found in carotid sheath, tracheoesopha-geal groove, retroesophageal, or in the posterior mediastinum. The locations of ectopic upper and lower parathyroid glands are shown in Fig. 38-34. Every attempt must be made to"

Complications of tracheostomy include pneu-mothorax, tracheal stenosis, wound infection/stomatitis with large-vessel erosion, and failure to close after decannulation. A meta-analysis of 15 randomized studies assessing nearly 1000 patients demonstrated no difference between the open and percutaneous techniques, although there was a trend toward fewer complications in the percutaneous approach.207 The per-cutaneous approach was also found to be cheaper and had the added benefit of being performed at the bedside outside of the operating room. A Cochrane review on the topic lower wound infection/stomatitis and unfavorable scarring rates with the per-cutaneous approach.208 Mortality and serious adverse events did not differ between the two techniques.The use of cricothyroidotomy, typically in the emergency setting, is inferior to a tracheotomy due to higher incidence of vocal cord dysfunction and subglottic stenosis.

A chin-lift maneuver can be used as a last resort but should be avoided where possible, as it requires movement of the potentially unstable C-spine. An oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway may facilitate bag-mask ventilation. Perform intubation in patients with apnea, significantly depressed mental status (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] < 8), or impending airway compromise (e.g., significant maxillofacial trauma or inhalation injury in fires). Perform a surgical airway (cricothyroidotomy) in patients who cannot be intubated or in whom there is significant maxillofacial trauma, making intubation impractical. Maintain cervical spine stabilization/immobilization in trauma patients until the spine is appropriately cleared through exam and radiographic studies. However, never allow this concern to delay airway management."

The myotomy can be performed under local or general anesthesia through an incision along the anterior border of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. The pharynx and cervi-cal esophagus are exposed by retracting the sternocleidomastoid muscle and carotid sheath laterally and the thyroid, trachea, and larynx medially (Fig. 25-50). When a pharyngoesophageal diverticulum is present, localization of the pharyngoesophageal segment is easy. The diverticulum is carefully freed from the overlying areolar tissue to expose its neck, just below the inferior pharyngeal constrictor and above the cricopharyngeus muscle. It can be difficult to identify the cricopharyngeus muscle in the absence of a diverticulum. A benefit of local anesthesia is that the patient"
