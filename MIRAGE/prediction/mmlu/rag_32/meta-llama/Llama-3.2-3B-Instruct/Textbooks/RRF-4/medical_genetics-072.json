In the United States, the incidence of CF is approximately 1 in 3200 whites, 1 in 15,000 African Americans, and 1 in 31,000 persons of Asian heritage. The gene for CF, located on the long arm of chromosome 7, encodes for a polypeptide, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel located on the apical surface of epithelial cells. CFTR is important for the proper movement of salt and water across cell membranes and maintaining the appropriate composition of various secretions, especially in the airways, liver, and pancreas. The most common mutation is a deletion of three base pairs resulting in the absence of phenylalanine at the 508 position (\u0394F508). More than 1500 mutations of the CFTR gene have been identified."

It must be appreciated, however, that there is a great deal of heterogeneity in relationship to the CFTR gene defect. More than 1000 putative mutations of the CFTR gene have been identified. Attempts to elucidate the relationship between the genotype and pancreatic manifestations have been hampered by the number of mutations. The ability to detect CFTR mutations has led to the recognition that the clinical spectrum of the disease is broader than previously thought. Two studies have clarified the association between mutations of the CFTR gene and another monosymptomatic form of cystic fibrosis (i.e., chronic pancreatitis).

CF may develop from either homozygosiy or compound heterozygosiy for mutations in the CFTR gene. In other words, one mutation must be present in each copy of the gene, but they need not be the same mutation. As expected, this results in a tremendous range of clinical disease severity. Median survival is approximately 37 years, but approximately 15 percent have milder disease and can survive for decades longer. Care for the pregnant woman with CF is discussed in Chapter 51 (p. 998)."

CFTR regulates ion concentrations in the extracellular fluid, especially in the lung. One in 27 Caucasians carries a gene encoding a mutant form of this protein; in 1 in 2900, both copies of the gene are mutated, causing the disease. In contrast to other ABC transporters, ATP binding and hydrolysis in the CFTR protein do not drive the transport process. Instead, they control the opening and closing of a continuous channel, which provides a passive conduit for Cl\u2013 to move down its electrochemical gradient. Thus, some ABC proteins can function as transporters and others as gated channels."

The viscous luminal contents may result in meconium ileus, which is present in up to 10% of newborns with cystic fibrosis. In the pancreas the ducts are plugged by thick mucus. This leads to obstruction, low-grade chronic autodigestion of the pancreas, and eventual exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in more than 80% of patients.

This \u2206F508 mutation prevents normal folding of CFTR, leading to its destruction by the proteasome (see p. 247). CFTR normally functions as a chloride channel in epithelial cells, and its loss results in the production of thick, sticky secretions in the lungs and pancreas, leading to lung damage and digestive deficiencies (see p. 174). The incidence of CF is highest (1 in 3,300) in those of Northern European origin. In >70% of individuals with CF, the \u2206F508 mutation is the cause of the disease."

            "content": "Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting the function of exocrine glands due to a gene mutation, leading to an abnormally low concentration of chloride in exocrine secretions, rendering them thick and sticky. Thick secretions cause blockage and subsequent damage to the airways, bowel, pancreas, liver, and reproductive tract. In the lungs, thick nonclearing secretions lead to recurrent infections and persistent inflammation, resulting in permanent distortion and dilation of the distal bronchi, a condition known as bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis can be seen on plain chest radiographs as tubular (tram track like) structures, particularly affecting the upper lobes. Computed tomography can easily demonstrate the extent of airway damage and identify potential pulmonary complications of cystic fibrosis such as lobar collapse, pneumothorax, or enlargement of the pulmonary trunk due to pulmonary hypertension."

            "content": "35% of affected individuals have a genetic variant in the MUC5B gene that alters the production of mucin, while a smaller number of affected patients have germ line mutations in surfactant genes. These genes are only expressed in lung epithelial cells, indicating that epithelial cell abnormalities can be the primary initiators of IPF. It is hypothesized that abnormal epithelial repair at the sites of chronic injury and inflammation gives rise to exuberant fibroblastic or myofibroblastic proliferation, leading to the characteristic fibroblastic foci. Although the mechanisms of fibrosis are incompletely understood, recent data point to excessive activation of profibrotic factors such as TGF-\u03b2."
