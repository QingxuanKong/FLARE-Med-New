            "content": "nuclear localization signals Direct nuclear proteins to the nucleus When proteins are experimentally extracted from the nucleus and reintroduced into the cytosol, even the very large ones reaccumulate efficiently in the nucleus. Sorting signals called nuclear localization signals (NLSs) are responsible for the selectivity of this active nuclear import process. The signals have been precisely defined by using recombinant DNA technology for numerous nuclear proteins, as well as for proteins that enter the nucleus only transiently (Figure 12\u20139). In many nuclear proteins, the signals consist of one or two short sequences that are rich in the positively charged amino acids lysine and arginine (see Table 12\u20133, p. 648), with the precise sequence varying for different proteins. Other nuclear proteins contain different signals, some of which are not yet characterized."

(Figure 6\u20139) RNA primer Short stretch of RNA synthesized on a DNA template. It is required by DNA polymerases to start their DNA synthesis. RNA processing control Regulation by a cell of gene expression by controlling the processing of RNA transcripts, which includes their splicing. RNA splicing Process in which intron sequences are excised from RNA transcripts. A major process in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells leading to formation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). RNA transport and localization control Regulation by a cell of gene expression by selecting which completed mRNAs are exported from the nucleus to the cytosol and determining where in the cytosol they are localized. RNA world Hypothesis that early life on Earth was based primarily on RNA molecules that both stored genetic information and catalyzed biochemical reactions."

Many processes are common to all cells, and any two cells in a single organism therefore have many gene products in common. These include the structural proteins of chromosomes, RNA and DNA polymerases, DNA repair enzymes, ribosomal proteins and RNAs, the enzymes that catalyze the central reactions of metabolism, and many of the proteins that form the cytoskeleton such as actin (Figure 7\u20133A). 2."

The cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element\u2013binding protein, repressor protein, and thyroid hormone nuclear receptor protein are molecules that diffuse (transit) to the DNA, bind, and affect the expression of that DNA and so are trans-acting. 3.3.
