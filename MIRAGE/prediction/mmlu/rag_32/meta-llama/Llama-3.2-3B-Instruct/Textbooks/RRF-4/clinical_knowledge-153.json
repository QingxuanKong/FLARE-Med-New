Document [3] mentions that clubbing may be hereditary, idiopathic, or acquired and associated with various disorders, and the presence of clubbing in isolation may be congenital or represent an early stage or one element in the spectrum of HOA. This suggests that clubbing can be subtle and not always easily visible from above.\\n\\nOption B, assessing the fluctuancy of the nail-bed, is not a commonly mentioned method in the provided documents. While it may be a subjective assessment, it is not a standard method for evaluating clubbing.\\n\\nOption C, Schamroth's sign, is mentioned in Document [1] as a way to assess clubbing, but it is not the most reliable method. The document states that clubbing of the toes but not the fingers has been associated with an infected abdominal aortic aneurysm and patent ductus arteriosus, suggesting that clubbing can be asymmetric and not always easy to detect.\\n\\nOption D, inspecting the nail-bed angle from the side, is the most reliable method to assess clubbing, as mentioned in Document [2].

HOA may be primary or familial and may begin in childhood. Secondary HOA is associated with intrathoracic malignancies, suppurative and some hypoxemic lung diseases, congenital heart disease, and a variety of other disorders. Clubbing is almost always a feature of HOA but can occur as an isolated manifestation (Fig. 397-2). The presence of clubbing in isolation may be congenital or represent either an early stage or one element in the spectrum of HOA.

Clubbing of a single digit may follow trauma and has been reported in tophaceous gout and sarcoidosis.

Tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased oxygen saturation mandate a more expedited evaluation of hemoptysis. A specific focus on respiratory and cardiac examinations is important; these examinations should include inspection of the nares, auscultation of the lungs and heart, assessment of the lower extremities for symmetric or asymmetric edema, and evaluation for jugular venous distention. Clubbing of the digits may suggest underlying lung diseases such as bronchogenic carcinoma or bronchiectasis, which predispose to hemoptysis.

This syndrome has been associated with both inadequate oral intake and elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1). Such wasting is an independent poor prognostic factor in COPD. Some patients with advanced disease have paradoxical inward movement of the rib cage with inspiration (Hoover\u2019s sign), the result of alteration of the vector of diaphragmatic contraction on the rib cage as a result of chronic hyperinflation. Signs of overt right heart failure, termed cor pulmonale, are relatively infrequent since the advent of supplemental oxygen therapy. Clubbing of the digits is not a sign of COPD, and its presence should alert the clinician to initiate an investigation for causes of clubbing. In this population, the development of lung cancer is the most likely explanation for newly developed clubbing."

In this condition, the subperiosteal formation of new bone in the distal diaphyses of the long bones of the extremities causes pain and symmetric arthritis-like changes in the shoulders, knees, ankles, wrists, and elbows. The diagnosis of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy may be confirmed by bone radiograph or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although the mechanism of clubbing is unclear, it appears to be secondary to humoral substances that cause dilation of the vessels of the distal digits as well as growth factors released from platelet precursors in the digital circulation.

Although they are uncommon causes of cyanosis, these abnormal hemoglobin species should be sought by spectroscopy when cyanosis is not readily explained by malfunction of the circulatory or respiratory systems. Generally, digital clubbing does not occur with them. Peripheral Cyanosis Probably the most common cause of peripheral cyanosis is the normal vasoconstriction resulting from exposure to cold air or water. When cardiac output is reduced, cutaneous vasoconstriction occurs as a compensatory mechanism so that blood is diverted from the skin to more vital areas such as the CNS and heart, and cyanosis of the extremities may result even though the arterial blood is normally saturated."

Best used as a supplement to other resources. $36.95 Review B\u2212Psychiatry Made Ridiculously Simple GOOD MedMaster, 2005, 4th ed., 98 pages, ISBN 9780940780682 Part of the \u201cMade Ridiculously Simple\u201d series. Pros: A comprehensive, fast read with nice tables and entertaining illustrations to highlight key points. Cons: Some areas are not detailed enough, while others are too verbose. Not boards oriented. Summary: A good, fast review, but more helpful for clerkship than for the boards. $13.95 Review B\u2212Psychiatric Secrets JACOBSON Hanley &"

            "content": "Because aortic regurgitation can result in dilatation of the left ventricle over time with ultimate reduction in ventricular function, caring for the patient with aortic regurgitation requires serial assessment of ventricular size and function. Patients whose ventricles dilate beyond an end-systolic diameter of 5.5 cm or whose LVEF declines below normal are at significantly higher risk of death or heart failure, and these measures are often used to decide the need for valve surgery. Quantitation of regurgitation itself can be performed using a number of methods. Semiquantitative visual assessment of aortic regurgitant jet width and depth by color flow Doppler remains the most used. The jet diameter as a ratio of the left ventricular outflow tract diameter proximal to the valve represents one of the most reliable indices of severity and correlates well with angiographic assessment. Similarly, the vena contracta, which represents the smallest diameter of the regurgitant flow at the"

A clinically helpful approach to diagnosis of alcohol dependence and abuse is the use of the CAGE questionnaire (Table 357-2), which is recommended for all medical history-taking."

Rare catastrophes are likely to be remembered with a clarity and force disproportionate to their likelihood for future diagnosis\u2014 for example, a patient with a sore throat eventually found to have leukemia or a young athlete with leg pain eventually found to have a sarcoma\u2014and those publicized in the media or that are recent experiences are, of course, easier to recall and therefore more influential on clinical judgments."
