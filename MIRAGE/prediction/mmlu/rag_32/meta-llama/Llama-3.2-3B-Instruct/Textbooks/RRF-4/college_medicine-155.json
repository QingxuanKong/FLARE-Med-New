The hormone is found both inside and out of cells, increases the amount of nucleic acid in the cell, and is derived from a structure containing four hydroxycarbon rings. Let's examine the options one by one. Enzymatic hormones (A) are not typically described as being derived from a structure containing four hydroxycarbon rings. Peptide hormones (C) are proteins or polypeptides, which do not typically contain four hydroxycarbon rings. Amino acids (D) are the building blocks of proteins and do not fit the description of being derived from a structure containing four hydroxycarbon rings. Steroid hormones (B) are a class of hormones that are derived from a structure containing four hydroxycarbon rings, such as cholesterol. They can be found both inside and out of cells, and some steroid hormones can increase the amount of nucleic acid in the cell. Given these characteristics, the hormone described in the scenario is most likely a steroid hormone.

Rather, a single hormone controls a subset of cellular functions in only the cell types that express receptors for that hormone. Thus selective receptor expression determines which cells respond to a given hormone. Moreover, the differentiated state of a cell determines how it responds to a hormone. Thus the specificity of hormonal responses resides in the structure of the hormone itself, the receptor for the hormone, and the cell type in which the receptor is expressed. Serum hormone concentrations are typically extremely low (10\u221211 to 10\u22129 mol/L). Therefore, a receptor must have high affinity, as well as specificity, for its cognate hormone."

The body releases this hormone during times of starvation and intense physical activity, and among its other activities, it stimulates liver cells to increase the production of glucose from amino acids and other small molecules. To respond in this way, liver cells increase the expression of many different genes that code for metabolic enzymes, such as tyrosine aminotransferase, as we discussed earlier in this chapter (see Figure 7\u20133).

Mineralocorticoids\u2014control vascular volume and serum electrolyte (Na+, K+) concentrations 6. Insulin\u2014maintains euglycemia in the fed and fasted states The defense against hypoglycemia is an impressive example of integrated hormone action (Chap. 420). In response to the fasting state and falling blood glucose, insulin secretion is suppressed, resulting in decreased glucose uptake and enhanced glycogenolysis, lipolysis, proteolysis, and gluconeogenesis to mobilize fuel sources. If hypoglycemia develops (usually from insulin administration or sulfonylureas), an orchestrated counterregulatory response occurs\u2014glucagon and epinephrine rapidly stimulate glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, whereas GH and cortisol act over several hours to raise glucose levels and antagonize insulin action."

Other endocrine cell types reside within islets, but their respective hormone products are of marginal or unclear importance and thus will not be discussed further. Blood flow to the islets is somewhat autonomous from blood flow to the surrounding exocrine pancreatic tissue. Blood flow through the islets passes from beta cells, which predominate in the center of the islet, to alpha and delta cells, which predominate in the periphery (see Fig. 38.5B-C ). Consequently the first cells affected by circulating insulin are the alpha cells, in which insulin inhibits glucagon secretion."

            "content": "Ovarian steroid-producing cells do not store hormones but produce them in response to LH and FSH during the normal menstrual cycle. The sequence of steps and the enzymes involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones are similar in the ovary, adrenal, and testis. However, the enzymes required to catalyze specific steps are compartmentalized and may not be abundant or even present in all cell types. Within the developing ovarian follicle, estrogen synthesis from cholesterol requires close integration between theca and granulosa cells\u2014sometimes called the two-cell model for steroidogenesis (Fig. 412-6). FSH receptors are confined to the granulosa cells, whereas LH receptors are restricted to the theca cells until the late stages of follicular development, when they are also found on granulosa cells. The theca cells surrounding the follicle are highly vascularized and use cholesterol, derived primarily from circulating lipoproteins, as the starting point for the synthesis of"

            "content": "B. Physiologic Effects The glucocorticoids have widespread effects because they influence the function of most cells in the body. The major metabolic consequences of glucocorticoid secretion or administration are due to direct actions of these hormones in the cell. However, some important effects are the result of homeostatic responses by insulin and glucagon. Although many of the effects of glucocorticoids are dose-related and become magnified when large amounts are administered for therapeutic purposes, there are also other effects\u2014called permissive effects\u2014without which many normal functions become deficient. For example, the response of vascular and bronchial smooth muscle to catecholamines is diminished in the absence of cortisol and restored by physiologic amounts of this glucocorticoid. Similarly, the lipolytic responses of fat cells to catecholamines, ACTH, and growth hormone are attenuated in the absence of glucocorticoids. C. Metabolic Effects"
