The Korotkoff sounds are the sounds heard during blood pressure measurement using a sphygmomanometer. The sounds are generated when blood flows through the artery as the cuff is deflated. The auscultatory gap is the time period when the Korotkoff sounds are not heard. Let's analyze the options given in the context of the Korotkoff sounds and blood pressure readings.\\n\\nOption A: when you can no longer hear the Korotkoff sounds because the bladder is equal with the diastolic pressure. This option is incorrect because the auscultatory gap is not related to the diastolic pressure. The Korotkoff sounds disappear when the cuff pressure is equal to the diastolic pressure, not when the bladder is equal to the diastolic pressure.\\n\\nOption B: when the Korotkoff sounds can be heard between systolic and diastolic phases. This option is incorrect because the Korotkoff sounds are heard during the diastolic phase, not between the systolic and diastolic phases.\\n\\nOption C: when the Korotkoff sounds disappear then return during phase 2 as the bladder is deflated. This option is correct because the auscultatory gap is the time period when the Korotkoff sounds disappear and then reappear as the cuff pressure is further deflated during phase 2 of the blood pressure measurement.\\n\\nOption D: When the Korotkoff sounds do not disappear when the cuff is fully deflated. This option is incorrect because the Korotkoff sounds should disappear when the cuff is fully deflated, not when they do not disappear.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. when the Korotkoff sounds disappear then return during phase 2 as the bladder is deflated.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

Under conditions of acidosis, there are decreased myocardial contractility, a propensity for vasodilation of the peripheral vasculature leading to hypotension, and refractoriness of the fibrillating heart to defibrillation (27). These effects promote decompensation of the cardiovascular system and can hinder attempts at resuscitation. Metabolic acidosis results from a decrease in serum bicarbonate levels caused by the consumption and replacement of bicarbonate by circulating acids or the replacement by other anions such as chloride.

The murmur of AS will increase in intensity, or become louder, in the beat after a premature beat, whereas the murmur of MR will have constant intensity from beat to beat. The intensity of the AS murmur also varies directly with the cardiac output. With a normal cardiac output, a systolic thrill and a grade 4 or higher murmur suggest severe AS. The murmur is softer in the setting of heart failure and low cardiac output. Other auscultatory findings of severe AS include a soft or absent A2, paradoxical splitting of S2, an apical S4, and a late-peaking systolic murmur. In children, adolescents, and young adults with congenital valvular AS, an early ejection sound (click) is usually audible, more often along the left sternal border than at the base.

This sound generally follows the sound of aortic valve closure (A2) by 0.05\u20130.12 s. The time interval between A2 and OS varies inversely with the severity of the MS. The OS is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, diastolic murmur, heard best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral recumbent position (see Fig. 267-5); it is accentuated by mild exercise (e.g., a few rapid sit-ups) carried out just before auscultation.

In the sense that gaps in memory exist and that whatever the patient supplies in place of the correct answers fills these gaps, the statement is incontrovertible. It is hardly explanatory, however. The implication that confabulation is a deliberate attempt to hide the memory defect, out of embarrassment or for other reasons, is incorrect.

AP = anteroposterior. (Data from Hytten F: The Clinical Physiology of the Puerperium. London, Farrand Press, 1995.) poor. Best estimates show that the uterus weighs approximately 500 g by 1 week postpartum, about 300 g by 2 weeks, and at 4 weeks, involution is complete and the uterus weighs approximately 100 g. Ater each successive delivery, the uterus is usually slightly larger than before the most recent pregnancy."

            "content": "Dynamic Auscultation Diagnostic accuracy can be enhanced by the performance of simple bedside maneuvers to identify heart murmurs and characterize their significance (Table 267-1). Except for the pulmonic Respiration Right-sided murmurs and sounds generally increase with inspiration, except for the PES. Left-sided murmurs and sounds are usually louder during expiration. Valsalva maneuver Most murmurs decrease in length and intensity. Two exceptions are the systolic murmur of HOCM, which usually becomes much louder, and that of MVP, which becomes longer and often louder. After release of the Valsalva maneuver, right-sided murmurs tend to return to control intensity earlier than do left-sided murmurs."

            "content": "Four sounds are usually generated by the heart, but only two are ordinarily audible through a stethoscope. With electronic amplification, the less intense sounds can be detected and recorded graphically as a phonocardiogram. This means of registering faint heart sounds helps delineate the precise timing of the heart sounds in relation to other events in the cardiac cycle. The first heart sound is initiated at the onset of ventricular systole ( Fig. 16.42 ) and reflects closure of the AV valves. It is the loudest and longest of the heart sounds, has a crescendo-decrescendo quality, and is heard best over the apical region of the heart. The tricuspid valve sounds are heard best in the fifth intercostal space just to the left of the sternum; the mitral sounds are heard best in the fifth intercostal space at the cardiac apex."

            "content": "In general viral pneumonias are associated more often with cough, wheezing, or stridor; fever is less prominent than with bacterial pneumonia. Mucosal congestion and upper airway inflammation suggest a viral infection. Bacterial pneumonias typically are associated with higher fever, chills, cough, dyspnea, and auscultatory findings of lung consolidation. Atypical pneumonia in young infants is characterized by tachypnea, cough, crackles on auscultation, and concomitant (chlamydial) conjunctivitis (infants) may be present. Other signs of respiratory distress include nasal flaring, intercostal and subcostal retractions, and grunting."
