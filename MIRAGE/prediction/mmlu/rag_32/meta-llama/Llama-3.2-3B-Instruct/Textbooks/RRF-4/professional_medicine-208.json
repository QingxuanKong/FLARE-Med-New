His pulse is 120/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg. Breath sounds are normal on the right and decreased on the left. Abdominal examination shows an entrance wound in the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line below the left costal margin.

In this scenario, the patient is already receiving intravenous fluid resuscitation, so the next step is to secure the airway. Intubation and mechanical ventilation are indicated to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. A CT scan of the chest (option A) may be necessary later, but it is not the immediate next step. Peritoneal lavage (option C) is also not the immediate next step, as it is not indicated in this scenario.

He has a history of hyper-tension and coronary artery disease with symptoms of stable angina. He can walk only half a block before pain in his legs forces him to stop. He has a 50-pack-year smoking history but stopped 2 years ago. Medications include atenolol, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. The nurse in the preoperative holding area obtains the following vital signs: temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure 168/100 mm Hg, heart rate 78 bpm, oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter 96% while breathing room air, and pain 5/10 in the right lower leg after walking into the hospital. What anesthetic agents will you choose for his anesthetic plan? Why? Does the choice of anesthetic make a difference?"

Pertinent labs should be ordered based on the mechanism of injury, suspicion of intoxication or OD, and past medical history. A rough estimate of SBP can be made on the basis of palpated pulses. Carotids correspond roughly to an SBP of 60 mmHg, femorals to an SBP of 70 mmHg, and radials to an SBP of 80 mmHg. The evaluation and treatment of penetrating trauma depend on the location and extent of the injury. Intubate early. Immediate surgical exploration is mandatory for patients with shock and active ongoing hemorrhage from neck wounds. All wounds that violate the platysma are considered true penetrating neck trauma. The neck is divided into three zones, and treatment varies according to which zone is injured (see Figure 2.17-1)."

Because the pericardium is not acutely dis-tensible, the pressure in the pericardial sac will rise to match that of the injured chamber. When this pressure exceeds that of the right atrium, right atrial filling is impaired and right ventricular preload is reduced. This ultimately leads to decreased right ven-tricular output. Additionally, increased intrapericardial pressure impedes myocardial blood flow, which leads to subendocardial ischemia and a further reduction in cardiac output.Diagnosis of hemopericardium is"

A chest radiograph demonstrated translucent notches along the inferior border of ribs III to VI (eFig. 3.119). He was referred to a cardiologist and a diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta was made. The rib notching was caused by dilated collateral intercostal arteries. Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. This narrowing can markedly reduce blood flow to the lower body. Many of the vessels above the narrowing therefore enlarge due to the increased pressure so that blood can reach the aorta below the level of the narrowing. Commonly, the internal thoracic, superior epigastric, and musculophrenic arteries enlarge anteriorly. These arteries supply the anterior intercostal arteries, which anastomose with the posterior intercostal arteries that allow blood to flow retrogradely into the aorta. Enlargement of the intertcostal vessels results in notching of the ribs."
