This suggests that smaller cannula sizes may be used. **Step 4:** Document [26] (Title: Gynecology_Novak) also mentions that the smallest cannulas necessary to perform the procedure should be used. **Step 5:** Based on the above information, the smallest cannula size that would be suitable for rapid blood transfusion in a patient would be a 20-gauge cannula. **Answer:** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Based on the relevant medical documents, the smallest cannula size that would be suitable for rapid blood transfusion in a patient is a 20-gauge cannula.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Although most of the attention to hemorrhagic shock resuscitation has centered on higher ratios of plasma and platelets, DCR is actually composed of four basic components: permissive hypotension, minimizing crystalloid-based resusci-tation, the immediate release and administration of predefined balanced blood products (red blood cells, plasma, and platelets) in ratios similar to those of whole blood, and the use of hemo-static adjuncts.The shift to DCR began in earnest in 2007 when a retro-spective study of 246 military casualties reported that patients with high plasma:RBC ratio (median 1:1.4) had substantially reduced mortality"

In a Cochrane review of resuscitation of nonpregnant critically ill patients, Perel and coworkers (2013) found equivalent benefits but concluded that colloid solutions were more expensive. Similar results were found in the Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) randomized trial of almost 7000 nonpregnant patients (Finfer, 2004).

She is feeling well overall but reports a 25-pack-year smoking history. She drinks 3\u20134 beers per week and has no known medication allergies. She has a history of heroin use and is currently receiving methadone. Physical examination reveals normal vital signs and no abnormalities. White blood cell count is 5800 cells/mm3 with a normal differential, hemoglobin is 11.8 g/dL, all liver tests are within normal limits, CD4 cell count is 278 cells/mm3, and viral load (HIV RNA) is 110,000 copies/mL. What other laboratory tests should be ordered? Which antiretroviral medica-tions would you begin?"

            "content": "Even after a properly positioned incision, the abdominal wall vessels can be injured if a trocar slides medially during placement. Large-diameter devices are more likely to cause injury; therefore, the smallest cannulas necessary to perform the procedure should be used. Ancillary cannulas should not be placed too close together because this results in hindrance of the hand instruments, which compromises access and maneuverability. The incision made must be of adequate length to allow easy insertion of the device through the skin\u2014a 1-cm long incision is inadequate to allow passage of a 1-cm diameter device. It is important to know that the outside diameter of a cannula is larger than the inside diameter, to allow for the thickness of the material used to create the port. In some instances, this can add two or more millimeters to the device diameter, and, therefore, increase the length of the required incision."

Fluid resuscitation usually begins with isotonic crystalloid, typically Ringer\u2019s lactate. However, for patients arriving in shock (persistent SBP <90 mmHg in an adult), instead of crystalloid the current practice is to activate a massive trans-fusion protocol (MTP) in which red blood cells (RBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are administered. The details of a MTP are discussed later.
