    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's first identify the categories used to classify patients according to the Glasgow Coma Scale. The Glasgow Coma Scale is a neurological scale intended to give a reliable, objective way of recording the conscious state of a person for initial as well as subsequent assessment. It assesses patients based on three aspects of neurologic function: eye opening, verbal response, and motor response. The scale uses a summed score from 3 to 15, with higher scores indicating better neurological function. The categories are as follows: Eye opening, Verbal response, and Best motor response. Now, let's evaluate the options to determine which one is not a category used to classify patients according to the Glasgow Coma Scale. Option A, Eye opening, is a category. Option B, Verbal response, is also a category. Option C, Best motor response, is another category. Option D, Pupil response, is not a category used to classify patients according to the Glasgow Coma Scale. The Glasgow Coma Scale assesses eye opening, verbal response, and best motor response, but it does not specifically assess pupil response. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

It is usually possible to categorize the patient by assessing the mental and neurologic status when first seen and at intervals after the accident. The Glasgow Coma Scale has been used for almost 50 years as a rapid reference to accomplish this purpose (Table 34-1) but does not substitute for a fuller neurologic examination. The scale registers three aspects of neurologic function: eye opening, verbal response, and motor response to various stimuli. The scale uses a summed score from 3 to 15; a score of 7 or less is considered to reflect severe trauma and a poor clinical state, 8 to 12, moderate injury, and higher scores, mild injury. The scores provided by this scale correspond roughly with the outcome of the head injury as discussed further on, but its main utility is in"

Children and young adults may have ominous early clinical findings such as abnormal brainstem reflexes and yet recover; temporization in offering a prognosis in this group of patients is wise. Metabolic comas have a far better prognosis than traumatic ones. All systems for estimating prognosis in adults should be taken as approximations, and medical judgments must be tempered by factors such as age, underlying systemic disease, and general medical condition. In an attempt to collect prognostic information from large numbers of patients with head injury, the Glasgow Coma Scale was devised; empirically, it has predictive value in cases of brain trauma (see Table 457e-2). For anoxic and metabolic coma, clinical signs such as the pupillary and motor responses after 1 day, 3 days, and 1 week have been shown to have predictive value.

These three responses are assessed by the Glasgow Coma Scale; a score between 3 and 15 is assigned (Table 457e-1). Over 85% of patients with aggregate scores of <5 die within 24 h. However, a number of patients with slightly higher scores, including a few without pupillary light responses, survive, suggesting that an initially aggressive approach is justified in most patients. Patients <20 years old, particularly children, may make remarkable recoveries after having grave early neurologic signs. In one large study of severe head injury, 55% of children had a good outcome at 1 year, compared with 21% of adults. Older age, increased ICP, early hypoxia or hypotension, compression of the brainstem on CT or MRI, and a delay in the evacuation of large intracranial hemorrhages are indicators of a poor prognosis."

A clot 60 mL in volume is almost uniformly fatal if situated in the basal ganglia but may allow reasonably good outcome if located in the frontal or occipital lobe.

Included are patients with the following: severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score \u22648 [see Table 457e-2]); large tissue shifts from supratentorial ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke; or hydrocephalus from subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intraventricular hemorrhage, or posterior fossa stroke. An additional disorder in which ICP monitoring can add important information is fulminant hepatic failure, in which elevated ICP may be treated with barbiturates or, eventually, liver transplantation. In general, ventriculostomy is preferable to ICP monitoring devices that are placed in the brain parenchyma, because ventriculostomy allows CSF drainage as a method of treating"

            "content": "There is that relatively small, distressing group of severely brain-injured patients in whom the vital signs become normal but who never regain full consciousness. As the weeks pass, the prospects become bleaker. Such a patient, especially if a child, may still emerge from coma after 6 to 12 weeks or longer and make a relatively good, although usually incomplete, recovery. Some of those who survive for long periods open their eyes and move their heads and eyes from side to side but betray no evidence of seeing or recognizing even the closest members of their families. They do not speak and are capable of only primitive postural or reflex withdrawal movements. Jennett and Plum referred to this as the \u201cpersistent vegetative state\u201d (see Chap. 16 for a full discussion of this subject). Fourteen percent of the patients in the Traumatic Coma Data Bank remained in this state. Hemiplegia or quadriplegia with varying degrees of decerebrate or decorticate posturing are usually present. Life is"
