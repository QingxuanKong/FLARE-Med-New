To answer this question, we need to consider the effects of IV therapy on surrounding tissues. The key phrase in the question is 'Leakage of vesicant (irritant) medication or fluid into surrounding tissues, causing tissue damage'. This phrase suggests that the complication is related to the leakage of a substance that can cause irritation or damage to surrounding tissues. In the context of IV therapy, extravasation is a known complication where a medication or fluid leaks out of the vein and into the surrounding tissues, causing tissue damage. The other options do not match this description. Phlebitis is inflammation of the vein, inflammation is a general term for a response to tissue damage, and infiltration is the movement of cells or fluids into a tissue, but neither of these options specifically describes the leakage of a vesicant into surrounding tissues. Therefore, the correct answer is extravasation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The plasma protein concentration is increased in conditions of dehydration (e.g., water deprivation, prolonged sweating, severe vomiting, diarrhea). In this condition, less water moves by osmotic force from the tissues to the vascular compartment, thereby decreasing the volume of the interstitial fluid. In contrast, the plasma protein concentration is reduced in some renal diseases because of its loss in urine, and edema may occur. When capillary injury is extensive, as in severe burns, intravascular fluid and plasma protein leak into the interstitial space in the damaged tissues. The protein that escapes from the vessel lumen increases the oncotic pressure of the interstitial fluid. This greater osmotic force outside the capillaries leads to additional fluid loss and possibly to severe dehydration."

Normally, the outflow of fluid produced by hydrostatic pressure at the arteriolar end of the microcirculation is nearly balanced by inflow at the venular end owing to slightly elevated osmotic pressure; hence there is only a small net outflow of fluid into the interstitial space, which is drained by lymphatic vessels.

            "content": "Misoprostol has both acid inhibitory and mucosal protective properties. It is believed to stimulate mucus and bicarbonate secretion and enhance mucosal blood flow. Misoprostol can reduce the incidence of NSAID-induced ulcers to less than 3% and the incidence of ulcer complications by 50%. It is approved for prevention of NSAID-induced ulcers in high-risk patients; however, misoprostol has never achieved widespread use owing to its high adverse-effect profile and need for multiple daily dosing."

            "content": "In noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, lung water increases due to damage of the pulmonary capillary lining with consequent leakage of proteins and other macromolecules into the tissue; fluid follows the protein as oncotic forces are shifted from the vessel to the surrounding lung tissue. This process is associated with dysfunction of the surfactant lining the alveoli, increased surface forces, and a propensity for the alveoli to collapse at low lung volumes. Physiologically, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is characterized by intrapulmonary shunt with hypoxemia and decreased pulmonary compliance leading to lower functional residual capacity. On pathologic examination, hyaline membranes are evident in the alveoli, and inflammation leading to pulmonary fibrosis may be seen. Clinically, the picture ranges from mild dyspnea to respiratory failure. Auscultation of the lungs may be relatively normal despite chest radiographs that show diffuse alveolar infiltrates. CT scans demonstrate that the"
