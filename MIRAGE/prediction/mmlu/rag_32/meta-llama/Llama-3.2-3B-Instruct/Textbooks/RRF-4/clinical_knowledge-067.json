    "answer": "D",
    "predict": "After analyzing the provided documents, I can provide the following step-by-step thinking and answer: Step 1: Analyze the definition of headache in the documents. According to Document [0], headache is characterized as a primary or secondary headache, with primary headaches being those in which headache and its associated features are the disorder itself, whereas secondary headaches are those caused by exogenous disorders. Step 2: Review the characteristics of primary and secondary headaches. Document [1] states that primary headache often results in considerable disability and a decrease in the patient's quality of life, while mild secondary headache, such as that seen in association with upper respiratory tract infections, is common but rarely worrisome. Step 3: Consider the common types of primary headaches. Document [7] lists migraine, tension-type headache, and the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, notably cluster headache, as common primary headache disorders. Step 4: Review the characteristics of tension-type headache. Document [29] describes tension-type headache (TTH) as a chronic head-pain syndrome characterized by bilateral tight, band-like discomfort, typically building slowly, fluctuating in severity, and persisting more or less continuously for many days. Step 5: Analyze the options provided. - Option A: When associated with neck stiffness, headache is not always due to meningitis. Document [16] states that a systematic approach is necessary to diagnose headaches in children and adolescents, and neck stiffness is just one of the characteristics to consider. - Option B: Severe pain usually does not indicate a life-threatening cause. Document [3] states that life-threatening headache is relatively uncommon, but vigilance is required to recognize and appropriately treat such patients. - Option C: Temporal arteritis is strongly associated with giant cell arteritis, not rheumatoid arthritis. Document [24] states that headache is a common symptom in patients with brain tumors, but it is not a specific indicator of rheumatoid arthritis. - Option D: Tension headaches are a common cause of headache, but the documents do not provide a specific prevalence rate. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"After analyzing the provided documents, the correct answer can be determined by considering the characteristics of primary and secondary headaches, common types of primary headaches, and the characteristics of tension-type headache. Option B is the most accurate statement, as severe pain does not always indicate a life-threatening cause. The other options are incorrect based on the provided documents.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The task of the primary care physician is to identify the very few worrisome secondary headaches from the very great majority of primary and less troublesome secondary headaches (Table 21-2). Absent any warning signs, a reasonable approach is to treat when a diagnosis is established. As a general rule, the investigation should focus on identifying worrisome causes of headache or on gaining confidence if no primary headache diagnosis can be made. After treatment has been initiated, follow-up care is essential to identify whether progress has been made against the headache complaint. Not all headaches will respond to treatment, but, in general, worrisome headaches will progress and will be easier to identify."

The ratio of classic to common migraine is 1:5. Either type may be preceded by vague premonitory changes in mood and appetite. Migraine with aura is ushered in by a disturbance of nervous function, most often visual, followed in a few minutes to hours by hemicranial (or, in about one-third of cases, bilateral) headache, nausea, and sometimes vomiting, all of which last for hours or as long as a day or more.

Most cases turn out to be idiopathic. Wijdicks and colleagues confirmed that thunderclap headache is usually a benign condition; among 71 patients followed for more than 3 years they found no serious cerebrovascular lesions. For this reason, these idiopathic thunderclap headaches have been presumed by some workers to be a form of migraine (\u201ccrash migraine\u201d). This opinion is based in part on a history of preceding or of subsequent headaches and migrainous episodes in affected individuals; however, in our experience not all of such patients have had migraine in the past.
