First, we need to understand the concept of ommatidia and its relation to the visual organs of crustaceans and insects. Ommatidia are the individual visual units of the compound eye found in crustaceans and insects. They are made up of a group of photoreceptor cells, cornea, and a lens, which work together to detect light and transmit the signal to the brain. Now, let's examine the options provided: A. eyespot - This is not a term related to the visual organs of crustaceans and insects. B. simple eye - This is a type of eye found in some animals, but it is not related to ommatidia. C. compound eye - This is the correct term for the visual organs of crustaceans and insects, which are made up of ommatidia.

Like the optical system of a camera, the cornea and lens of the eye capture and automatically focus light. The iris also automatically adjusts the eye to differences in illumination of visual fields. In many aspects, the optical system of the eye is far more elaborate and complex than a camera. For example, the eye has the ability to track moving objects with coordinated eye movements. The eye can also protect, maintain, self-repair, and clean its transparent optical system. The light detector in a digital camera, the charge-coupled device (CCD), consists of closely spaced photodiodes that capture, collect, and convert the light image into a series of electrical impulses. Similarly, the photoreceptor cells in the retina of the eye detect light intensity and color (wavelengths of visible light that are reflected by different objects) and encode these parameters"

In the nasal epithelium, cilia protruding from dendrites of olfactory neurons are the site of both odorant reception and signal amplification. Similarly, the rod and cone cells of the vertebrate retina possess a primary cilium equipped with an expanded tip called the outer segment, which is specialized for converting light into a neural signal (see Figure 15\u201338). Maintenance of the outer segment requires continuous IFT-mediated transport of large quantities of lipids and proteins into the cilium, at rates of up to 2000 molecules per minute. The links between cilia function and the senses of sight and smell are underscored by Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a set of disorders associated with defects in IFT, the cilium, or the basal body.

The retinal axons grow back to the optic tectum, restoring normal vision. If, however, the eye is in addition rotated in its socket at the time of cutting of the nerve, so as to put originally ventral retinal cells in the position of dorsal retinal cells, vision is still restored, but with an awkward flaw: the animal behaves as though it sees the world upside down and left\u2013right inverted (Figure 21\u201377).

Once these Drosophila genes were sequenced, the genomes of vertebrates could be scanned for homologs. These were found, and their functions in vertebrates were then tested by analyzing mice in which the genes had been mutated.

Complex neural mechanisms coordinate eye movements, enabling us to perceive depth and distance to achieve a three-dimensional image. Therefore, the way in which we perceive the world around us largely depends on impulses processed within the retina and analysis and interpretation of these impulses by the CNS. The eye measures approximately 25 mm in diameter. It is suspended in the bony orbital socket by six extrinsic muscles that control its movement.

The neurons of the retina are arranged sequentially in three layers: (1) a deep layer of rods and cones; (2) an intermediate layer of bipolar, horizontal, and amacrine cells; and (3) a superficial layer of ganglion cells. Nerve impulses originating in the rods and cones are transmitted to the intermediate layer and then to the ganglion cells. Synaptic connections occur in the outer plexiform layer (between the rods and cones and the intermediate neuronal layer) and the inner plexiform layer (between the intermediate layer and the ganglion cells), resulting in summation and neuronal integration. Finally, the ganglion cells send their axons to the brain as components of the optic nerve."

(a) Normally, stripes of cortical cells driven by the right eye alternate with stripes, of equal width, driven by the left eye. the stripes, set up before birth, are revealed here by injecting a radioactive tracer molecule into one eye, allowing time for this tracer to be transported to the visual cortex, and detecting radioactivity there by autoradiography, in sections cut parallel to the cortical surface. (B) If one eye is kept covered after birth, during the sensitive period of development, and thus deprived of visual experience, its stripes shrink and those of the active eye expand. In this way, the deprived eye may lose the power of vision almost entirely. (From"

            "content": "Neurons also contain complex cytoskeletal structures. As they differentiate, neurons send out specialized processes that will either receive electrical signals (dendrites) or transmit electrical signals (axons) (see Figure 16\u201350). The beautiful and elaborate branching morphology of axons and dendrites enables neurons to form tremendously complex signaling networks, interacting with many other cells simultaneously and making possible the complicated behavior of the higher animals. Both axons and dendrites (collectively called neurites) are filled with bundles of microtubules that are critical to both their structure and their function. In axons, all the microtubules are oriented in the same direction, with their minus end pointing back toward the cell body and their plus end pointing toward the axon terminals (Figure 16\u201362). The microtubules do not reach from the cell Figure 16\u201361 Regulated melanosome movements in fish pigment cells."
