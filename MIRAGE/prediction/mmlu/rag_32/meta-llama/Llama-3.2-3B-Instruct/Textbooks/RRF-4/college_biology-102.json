Hydrogen bonds: An \u03b1-helix is stabilized by extensive hydrogen bonding between the peptide bond carbonyl oxygens and amide hydrogens that are part of the polypeptide backbone (see Fig. 2.6). The hydrogen bonds extend up and are parallel to the spiral from the carbonyl oxygen of one peptide bond to the \u2013NH group of a peptide linkage four residues ahead in the polypeptide. This insures that all but the first and last peptide bond components are linked to each other through intrachain hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds are individually weak, but they collectively serve to stabilize the helix. 2. Amino acids per turn: Each turn of an \u03b1-helix contains 3.6 amino acids. Thus, amino acids spaced three or four residues apart in the primary sequence are spatially close together when folded in the \u03b1-helix. 3."

These involve atoms in the polypeptide backbone, as well as atoms in the amino acid side chains. There are three types of these weak bonds: hydrogen bonds, electrostatic attractions, and van der Waals attractions, as explained in Chapter 2 (see p. 44). Individual noncovalent bonds are 30\u2013300 times weaker than the typical covalent bonds that create biological molecules. But many weak bonds acting in parallel can hold two regions of a polypeptide chain tightly together.

In contrast, in \u03b1-helices, the polypeptide is coiled and the hydrogen bonds are parallel to the backbone (see Fig. 2.6). The orientation of the R groups of the amino acid residues in both the \u03b1helix and the \u03b2-sheet can result in formation of polar and nonpolar sides in these secondary structures, thereby making them amphipathic."

This is not surprising. A helix is an unexceptional structure, and it is generated simply by placing many similar subunits next to each other, each in the same strictly repeated relationship to the one before\u2014that is, with a fixed rotation followed by a fixed translation along the helix axis, as in a spiral staircase.

            "content": "In other proteins, \u03b1 helices wrap around each other to form a particularly stable structure, known as a coiled-coil. This structure can form when the two (or in some cases, three or four) \u03b1 helices have most of their nonpolar (hydrophobic) side chains on one side, so that they can twist around each other with these side chains facing inward (Figure 3\u20139). Long rodlike coiled-coils provide the structural framework for many elongated proteins. Examples are \u03b1-keratin, which forms the intracellular fibers that reinforce the outer layer of the skin and its appendages, and the myosin molecules responsible for muscle contraction."

Peptide bond polarity: Like all amide linkages, the \u2212C = O and \u2212NH groups of the peptide bond are uncharged, and neither accept nor release protons over the pH range of 2\u201312. Thus, the charged groups present in polypeptides consist solely of the N-terminal (\u03b1-amino) group, the C-terminal (\u03b1-carboxyl) group, and any ionized groups present in the side chains of the constituent amino acids. The \u2212C = O and \u2212NH groups of the peptide bond are polar, however, and are involved in hydrogen bonds (for example, in \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets), as described on pp. 16\u201317. B.

Each type of protein differs in its sequence and number of amino acids; therefore, it is the sequence of the chemically different side chains that makes each protein distinct. The two ends of a polypeptide chain are chemically different: the end carrying the free amino group (NH3+, also written NH2) is the amino terminus, or N-terminus, and that carrying the free carboxyl group (COO\u2013, also written COOH) is the carboxyl terminus or C-terminus. The amino acid sequence of a protein is always presented in the N-to-C direction, reading from left to right. (\u201cwater-fearing\u201d), others are negatively or positively charged, some readily form covalent bonds, and so on. Panel 3\u20131 (pp. 112\u2013113) shows their atomic structures and Figure 3\u20132 lists their abbreviations."

            "content": "Central to understanding protein structure is the concept of the native conformation (Fig. 2.15), which is the functional, fully folded protein structure (for example, an active enzyme or structural protein). The unique three-dimensional structure of the native conformation is determined by its primary structure, that is, its amino acid sequence. Interactions between the amino acid side chains guide the folding of the polypeptide chain to form secondary, tertiary, and (sometimes) quaternary structures, which cooperate in stabilizing the native conformation of the protein. In addition, a specialized group of proteins named chaperones is required for the proper folding of many species of proteins. Protein denaturation results in the unfolding and disorganization of the protein\u2019s structure, which are not accompanied by hydrolysis of peptide bonds. Denaturation may be reversible or, more commonly, irreversible. Disease can occur when an apparently normal protein assumes a conformation"

They are usually found on the surface of protein molecules and often include charged residues. [Note: \u03b2-Bends were given this name because they often connect successive strands of antiparallel \u03b2sheets.] \u03b2-Bends are generally composed of four amino acids, one of which may be proline, the amino acid that causes a kink in the polypeptide chain. Glycine, the amino acid with the smallest R group, is also frequently found in \u03b2-bends. \u03b2-Bends are stabilized by the formation of hydrogen bonds between the first and last residues in the bend.
