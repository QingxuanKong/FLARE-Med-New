    "question": "A 12-year-old boy with sickle cell disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus is brought to the office by his mother for an initial visit. The family recently moved to the area. Type 1 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in the patient 6 years ago. Since that time, he has been treated with insulin and dietary management. His insulin regimen has not changed during the past year; however, his mother says he has been only marginally compliant with his insulin and dietary regimens. His diabetic diary shows home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations ranging from 140\u2013200 mg/dL during the past 3 months. He admits to checking his glucose concentrations infrequently. Measurement of hemoglobin A1c obtained last week was 5.4%. The patient's vital signs are temperature 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse 72/min, respirations 24/min, and blood pressure 110/64 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the discrepancy between the patient's home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations and his hemoglobin A1c?",
    "options": {
        "A": "His daily glucose control is better than recorded",

Hemoglobin A1c Measurements When plasma glucose levels are in the normal range, about 4\u20136% of hemoglobin A has one or both of the N terminal valines of their beta chains irreversibly glycated by glucose\u2014referred to as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The HbA1c fraction is abnormally elevated in people with diabetes with chronic hyperglycemia. Since red cells have a lifespan of up to 120 days, the HbA1c value reflects plasma glucose levels over the preceding 8\u201312 weeks. In patients who monitor their glucose levels, the HbA1c value provides a valuable check on the accuracy of their monitoring. In patients who do not monitor their glucose levels, HbA1c measurements are essential for adjusting treatment. HbA1c can be used to diagnose diabetes. An HbA1c of 6.5% or greater if confirmed by repeat testing is diagnostic of diabetes. Less than 5.7% is normal, and patients with levels of 5.7\u20136.4% are considered at high risk for developing diabetes (Table 41\u20134). C. Urine or Blood Ketones"

            "content": "Pertinent Findings: Results on a 24-hour urine specimen and blood tests requested in advance of this visit reveal that IR is not an undersecretor of uric acid. His blood urate was 8.5 mg/dl (reference = 2.5\u20138.0). The unusually young age of presentation is suggestive of an enzymopathy of purine metabolism, and additional blood tests are ordered. Diagnosis: IR has gout (MSU crystal deposition disease), a type of inflammatory arthritis. Treatment: IR was given prescriptions for allopurinol and colchicine. The treatment goals are to reduce his blood urate levels to <6.0 mg/dl and prevent additional attacks. He was advised to lose weight because being overweight or obese is a risk factor for gout. His BMI of 31 puts him in the obese category. He was also given written information on the association between diet and gout. Prognosis: Gout increases the risk of developing renal stones. It is also associated with hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease."

At admission, his blood glucose was 24 mg/dl (age-referenced normal is 60\u2013100). His urine was negative for ketone bodies and positive for a variety of dicarboxylic acids. Blood carnitine levels (free and acyl bound) were normal. A tentative diagnosis of medium-chain fatty acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is made. In patients with MCAD deficiency, the fasting hypoglycemia is a consequence of: A. decreased acetyl coenzyme A production. B. decreased ability to convert acetyl coenzyme A to glucose. C. increased conversion of acetyl coenzyme A to acetoacetate. D. increased production of ATP and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide."

Changes in time zone, in the amount and timing of food intake, and in physical activity demand vigilant assessment of metabolic control. Because of the risk of foot ulcers, travelers should wear closed footwear that has been proven to be comfortable. The traveler with diabetes should pack medication (including a bottle of regular insulin for emergencies), insulin syringes and needles, equipment and supplies for glucose monitoring, and snacks in carry-on luggage. Insulin is stable for ~3 months at room temperature but should be kept as cool as possible. The name and telephone number of the home physician and a card and bracelet listing the patient\u2019s medical problems and the type and dose of insulin used should accompany the traveler.

Untreated proliferative retinopathy is a relative contraindication to vigorous exercise, because this may lead to vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment. Optimal monitoring of glycemic control involves plasma glucose measurements by the patient and an assessment of long-term control by the physician (measurement of hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] and review of the patient\u2019s self-measurements of plasma glucose). These measurements are complementary: the patient\u2019s measurements provide a picture of short-term glycemic control, whereas the HbA1c reflects average glycemic control over the previous 2\u20133 months."

Elevated blood glucose occurs in type 1 diabetes (T1D) as a result of a lack of insulin. In type 2 diabetes (T2D), hyperglycemia is due to a defect in \u03b2-cell function and insulin resistance. The hyperglycemia results in elevated hemoglobin A1c levels. Ketoacidosis is rare in T2D, whereas obesity is rare in T1D. C (connecting)-peptide is a measure of insulin synthesis. It would be virtually absent in T1D and initially increased then decreased in T2D. Both forms of the disease show complex genetics. 5.4. An obese individual with type 2 diabetes typically: A. benefits from receiving insulin about 6 hours after a meal. B. has a lower plasma level of glucagon than does a normal individual. C. has a lower plasma level of insulin than does a normal individual early in the disease process."

He enjoyed good health until 1 year ago when spells of rapid heartbeat began. These became more severe and were eventually accompanied by throbbing headaches and drenching sweats. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 150/90 mm Hg and heart rate of 88 bpm. During the physical examination, palpation of the abdomen elicited a sudden and typical episode, with a rise in blood pressure to 210/120 mm Hg, heart rate to 122 bpm, profuse sweating, and facial pallor. This was accompanied by severe headache. What is the likely cause of his episodes? What caused the blood pressure and heart rate to rise so high during the examination? What treatments might help this patient?"
