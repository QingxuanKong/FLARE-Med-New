The thick periosteum may decrease the rate of displaced fractures and stabilize fractures after reduction. Because of the higher proportion of cartilage, the skeletally immature patient can withstand more force before deformation or fracture than adult bone. As children mature into adolescence, the rate of healing slows and approaches that of adults. Buckle or torus fractures occur after compression of the bone; the bony cortex does not truly break. These fractures will typically occur in the metaphysis and are stable fractures that heal in approximately 4 weeks with immobilization. A common example is a fall onto an outstretched arm causing a buckle fracture in the distal radius."

In the absence of malignant transformation, Paget disease is usually not a serious or life-threatening disease. Most affected individuals have mild symptoms that are readily suppressed by treatment with calcitonin and bisphosphonates. A fracture is defined as loss of bone integrity resulting from mechanical injury and/or diminished bone strength. Fractures are the most common pathologic conditions affecting bone. The following qualifiers describe fracture types and affect treatment: Simple: the overlying skin is intact Compound: the bone communicates with the skin surface Comminuted: the bone is fragmented Displaced: the ends of the bone at the fracture site are not aligned"

Surgery utilizing a variety of sur-gical techniques is done for unstable fractures as well as those with significant intra-articular involvement.Scaphoid FracturesScaphoid fracture is the most common fracture of the carpal bone. Its diagnosis can be easily missed, and the fracture can lead to nonunion and avascular necrosis. It usually occurs in the waist of the scaphoid but can occur in the proximal or distal pole. Proximal scaphoid fracture will have a higher inci-dence of avascular necrosis due to interruption of the retro-grade blood supply. Tenderness in the anatomic snuffbox after trauma should be considered a scaphoid fracture"

One prospective randomized series of scaphoid wrist fractures demonstrated shortening of time to union by up to 6 weeks in the surgically treated group, but no difference in rate of union.14 Surgery may be useful in the younger, more active patient who would benefit from an earlier return to full activity.Ligament injuries of the wrist can be difficult to recognize. Patients often present late and may not be able to localize their pain. In severe cases, the ligaments of the wrist can rupture to the point of dislocation of the capitate off the lunate or even the lunate off the radius. Mayfield and colleagues classified the progression of this injury into four groups.15 In the most severe group, the lunate dislocates off the radius into the carpal tunnel. In some circumstances, the scaphoid bone may break rather than Figure 44-11. The Jahss maneuver. The surgeon fully flexes the patient\u2019s"

This is the most common fracture and may be classified as comminuted, oblique, transverse, or spiral, depending on the direction of the fracture line. Greenstick fractures occur when a bone is angulated beyond the limits of plastic deformation. The bone fails on the tension side and sustains a bend deformity on the compression side. The force is insufficient to cause a complete fracture (Fig. 198-1). The bone fragments separate completely Incomplete The bone fragments are still partially joined Linear"
