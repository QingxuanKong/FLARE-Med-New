    "question": "A 2-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother for follow-up of a chromosome analysis done 1 month ago. The child has minor dysmorphic features, and growth and developmental delay. Chromosome analysis showed a small unbalanced chromosome translocation, with extra chromosomal material at the tip of chromosome 3. The cytogenetics laboratory requested blood samples from both parents for follow-up studies. The parents are divorced, and the mother has custody of the child. The relationship between the parents is hostile. The mother has been tested and has normal chromosomes without evidence of translocation. At today's visit, she reacts angrily when the issue of contacting the child's father for testing is raised. She states that he abandoned them and that he has no interest in his child. She refuses to cooperate in contacting the father, who could be a translocation carrier. You do not know the father, but an office worker told you that he lives in a nearby town. The mother says that he is living with a new girlfriend. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",

        "A": "Attempt to identify the father's physician and work with that physician to obtain chromosome studies on the father",

However, chromosomal markers for one particular chromosome are identical to the markers found on the chromosomes of the patient\u2019s mother or father (but not both). In UPD, the individual inherits two copies of one parent\u2019s chromosome and no copy from the other parent. UPD probably occurs through a few mechanisms, but the most common results from a spontaneous rescue mechanism. At the time of conception, through nondisjunction, the fertilized egg is trisomic for a particular chromosome, with two copies of one parent\u2019s chromosome and one copy of the other parent\u2019s chromosome; conceptuses with trisomy often miscarry early in development. Fetuses with UPD survive because they spontaneously lose one of three copies of the affected chromosome. If the single chromosome from one parent is lost, the patient has UPD."

If the child has trisomy 21, the empiric recurrence risk is 1% (added to the age-specific risk for women up to 40 years of age; after 40, the age-specific risk alone is used for subsequent pregnancies). If the child has a robertsonian translocation, chromosomal analysis of both parents must be performed. In approximately 65% of cases, the translocation is found to have arisen de novo (i.e., spontaneously, with both parents having normal karyotypes), and in 35% of cases, one parent has a balanced translocation. The recurrence risk depends on which parent is the carrier: if the mother is the carrier, the risk is 10% to 15%; if the father is the carrier, the recurrence risk is 2% to 5%."

Balanced translocation carriers are at risk for abnormal chromosome segregation during meiosis and therefore have a higher risk for infertility, SAB, and live-born offspring with multiple congenital malformations. These phenotypes are observed when only one of the pairs of chromosomes involved in a translocation is inherited from a parent, resulting in an unbalanced genotype (Fig. 83e-3).

Women who were not a twin, but whose husbands were a dizygotic twin, gave birth to twins at a rate of 1 set per 116 pregnancies. Painter and associates (2010) performed genomewide linkage analyses on more than 500 families of mothers of dizygotic twins and identified four potential linkage peaks. he highest peak was on the long arm ofchromosome 6, and other suggestive peaks were on chromosomes 7, 9, and 16. That said, the contribution of these variants to the overall incidence of twinning is likely small (Hoekstra, 2008)."

            "content": "The third approach is to use donor eggs or sperm. This treatment is particularly useful for patients with parental genetic factors and recurrent pregnancy loss, for example, a patient with Robertsonian translocations involving homologous chromosomes. In these patients, their genetic anomaly always results in unbalanced gametes, and the use of donor oocyte or donor sperm is recommended. Use of donor gametes among patients with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss can be useful in other cases where couples are at higher risk for unbalanced offspring because of carrying other forms of chromosomal rearrangements, such as reciprocal translocations or advanced maternal age. In these cases use of donor gametes was demonstrated to be as effective as its use in matched patients without such a history (358). In all cases of balanced translocations or embryonic aneuploidy, genetic counseling is recommended."

            "content": "genes that result in disease. Because each individual has two copies of each chromosome (one inherited from the mother and one inherited from the father), he or she can have only two alleles at a given locus. However, there can be many different alleles in the population. The normal or common allele is usually referred to as wild type. When alleles at a given locus are identical, the individual is homozygous. Inheriting identical copies of a mutant allele occurs in many autosomal recessive disorders, particularly in circumstances of consanguinity or isolated populations. If the alleles are different on the maternal and the paternal copy of the gene, the individual is heterozygous at this locus (Fig. 82-10). If two different mutant alleles are inherited at a given locus, the individual is said to be a compound heterozygote. Hemizygous is used to describe males with a mutation in an X chromosomal gene or a female with a loss of one X chromosomal locus."

In a robertsonian translocation, the q arms of two acrocentric chromosomes fuse at one centromere to form a derivative chromosome. he other centromere and both sets of p arms are lost. Because the number of centromeres determines the chromosome count, a robertsonian translocation carrier has only 45 chromosomes. Fortunately, the p arms of the acrocentric chromosomes-the satellite regions-contain redundant copies of genes that code for ribosomal RNA. As these are present in multiple copies on other acrocentric chromosomes, their loss does not afect the translocation carrier, who is usually phenotypically normal. However, when the derivative chromosome is paired during fertilization with a haploid chromosome from the partner, resulting ofspring will be trisomic for that chromosome."

He remains independent in all activi-ties of daily living, but he has become more forgetful and occasionally sees his long-deceased father in his bedroom. Examination reveals hypomimia, hypophonia, a slight rest tremor of the right hand and chin, mild rigidity, and impaired rapid alternating movements in all limbs. Neuro-logic and general examinations are otherwise normal. What is the likely diagnosis and prognosis? The patient is started on a dopamine agonist, and the dose is gradually built up to the therapeutic range. Was this a good choice of medications? Six months later, the patient and his wife return for follow-up. It now becomes apparent that he is falling asleep at inappropriate times, such as at the dinner table, and when awake, he spends much of the time in arranging and"

Features seen in children with 47,XX,+inv dup (15q) or 47,XY,inv dup(15q) depend on the size of the extra chromosomal material present: the larger the region, the worse the prognosis. Children with this disorder tend to have a variable degree of developmental disability and autism spectrum disorders; seizures are common, as are behavior problems. The phenotype shows minimal dysmorphic features, with a sloping forehead, short and downward-slanting palpebral fissures, a prominent nose with a broad nasal bridge, a long and well-defined philtrum, a mid-line crease in the lower lip, and micrognathia."
