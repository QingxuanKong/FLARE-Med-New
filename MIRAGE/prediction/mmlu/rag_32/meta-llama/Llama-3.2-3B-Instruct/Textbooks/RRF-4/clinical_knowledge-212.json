According to Document [27], enlargement of the craniofacial skeleton may produce leontiasis ossea (lion face) and a cranium so heavy that is difficult for the person to hold the head erect, which can cause bowing of the long bones, such as the femurs and tibiae.\\n\\nOption B: Spinal cord compression is a common complication - This statement is true. According to Document [22], the weakened Pagetic bone may lead to invagination of the skull base (platybasia) and compression of the posterior fossa, which can result in spinal cord compression.\\n\\nOption C: Heart failure is not a recognized complication - This statement is false. According to Document [12], cardiovascular complications may occur in patients with involvement of large portions of the skeleton and a high degree of disease activity, leading to high-output heart failure.\\n\\nOption D: Pathological fractures are not a feature - This statement is false. According to Document [16], fractures are serious complications of Paget's disease and usually occur in long bones at areas of active or advancing lytic lesions.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

An initial osteolytic phase involves prominent bone resorption and marked hypervascularization. Radiographically, this manifests as an advancing lytic wedge, or \u201cblade of grass\u201d lesion. The second phase is a period of very active bone formation and resorption that replaces normal lamellar bone with haphazard (woven) bone. Fibrous connective tissue may replace normal bone marrow. In the final sclerotic phase, bone resorption declines progressively and leads to a hard, dense, less vascular pagetic or mosaic bone, which represents the so-called burned-out phase of Paget\u2019s disease. All three phases may be present at the same time at different skeletal sites."

Approximately 50% of familial Paget disease and 10% of sporadic cases harbor mutations in the SQSTM1 gene. The mutations increase the activity of NF-\u03baB, which, in turn increases osteoclast activity. Activating mutations in RANK and inactivating mutations in OPG account for some cases of juvenile Paget disease. The geographic distribution is suggestive of some environmental influence. Of note in this regard, cell culture studies have shown that infection of osteoclast precursors with viruses such as measles or other RNA viruses alters vitamin D sensitivity and IL-6 secretion, both of which can lead to increased bone resorption.

The pathologic process is initiated by overactive osteoclastic bone resorption followed by a compensatory increase in osteoblastic new bone formation, resulting in a structurally disorganized mosaic of woven and lamellar bone. Pagetic bone is expanded, less compact, and more vascular; thus, it is more susceptible to deformities and fractures.

Enlargement of the craniofacial skeleton may produce leontiasis ossea (lion face) and a cranium so heavy that is difficult for the person to hold the head erect. The weakened Pagetic bone may lead to invagination of the skull base (platybasia) and compression of the posterior fossa. Weight bearing causes anterior bowing of the femurs and tibiae Fig. 21.11 Mosaic pattern of lamellar bone pathognomonic of Paget disease."

Represents carcinoma in situ, usually with no underlying carcinoma 1. Paget disease of the nipple is also characterized by malignant epithelial cells in the epidermis of the nipple, but it is almost always associated with an underlying carcinoma. D.

This test is sensitive but relatively nonspecific because areas of increased uptake are not always related to metastatic disease. Healing fractures, arthritis, Paget\u2019s disease, and other conditions will also cause abnormal uptake. True-positive bone scans are uncommon when the PSA is <10 ng/mL unless the tumor is high grade."

            "content": "Paget\u2019s Disease Unlike squamous cell VIN 3, in which the histologic extent of disease correlates closely with the macroscopic lesion, Paget\u2019s disease usually extends well beyond Figure 19.22 Paget\u2019s disease of the labium majus. the gross lesion (150). This extension results in positive surgical margins and frequent local recurrence unless a wide local excision is performed (151). Underlying adenocarcinomas are apparent clinically, but this finding does not occur invariably; therefore, the underlying dermis should be removed for adequate histologic evaluation. For this reason, laser therapy is unsatisfactory in treating primary Paget\u2019s disease. If underlying invasive carcinoma is present, it should be treated in the same manner as a squamous vulvar cancer. This treatment usually requires radical vulvectomy and at least an ipsilateral inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy."
