Endochondral ossification is a process where a cartilage model serves as the precursor of the bone. According to Document [2] (Title: Pathology_Robbins), the bones of the extremities and those parts of the axial skeleton that bear weight (e.g., vertebrae) develop by endochondral ossification. Additionally, according to Document [3] (Title: Histology_Ross), the flat bones of the skull and face, the mandible, and the clavicle develop by intramembranous ossification. However, Document [2] (Title: Pathology_Robbins) also mentions that long bones develop from a cartilage mold by the process of endochondral ossification. So, we can conclude that long bones, including ribs, develop by endochondral ossification. However, the sternum and clavicle develop by intramembranous ossification. Therefore, the correct answer should include only the ribs and not the sternum and clavicle. Similarly, vertebrae also develop by endochondral ossification. Hence, the correct answer is the combination of ribs and vertebrae.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Blood vessels that cross over a joint and nerves that innervate muscles acting on a joint usually contribute articular branches to that joint.

As bone is laid down on the calcified spicules, the cartilage is resorbed, ultimately leaving a primary spongy bone. This spongy bone undergoes reorganization through osteoclastic activity and addition of new bone tissue, thus accommodating the continued growth and physical stresses placed on the bone."

Osteoblast activity can be assessed by measuring serum bone-specific Growth in width and thickness is accomplished by formation of alkaline phosphatase. Similarly, osteocalcin, a protein secreted from bone at the periosteal surface and by resorption at the endosteal osteoblasts, is made virtually only by osteoblasts. Osteoclast activity surface, with the rate of formation exceeding that of resorption. In can be assessed by measurement of products of collagen degradation. adults, after the growth plates of cartilage close, growth in length and Collagen molecules are covalently linked to each other in the extracelendochondral bone formation cease except for some activity in the lular matrix through the formation of hydroxypyridinium cross-links cartilage cells beneath the articular surface.

In the region of apoptosis the matrix mineralizes and is invaded by capillaries, providing the nutrients for osteoblasts, which synthesize osteoid. This process produces longitudinal bone growth. Intramembranous ossification, by contrast, is responsible for the development of flat bones. Bones of the cranium, for example, are formed by osteoblasts directly http://ebooksmedicine.net Fig.21.3Activegrowthplatewithongoingendochondralossification.1,Reservezone.2,Zoneofproliferation.3,Zoneofhypertrophy.4,Zoneofmineralization.5,Primaryspongiosa. from a fibrous layer of tissue, without cartilage anlagen. The enlargement of flat bones is achieved by deposition of new bone on a preexisting surface."
