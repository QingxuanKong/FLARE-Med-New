    "question": "A 10-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because her school nurse thinks that she may have Marfan syndrome. She is at the 95th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows a narrow palate with dental crowding, long slender extremities, and joint laxity. Molecular testing for FBN1 shows a single nucleotide difference that does not change the amino acid at that locus. Her mother is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall. There is no clinical evidence of Marfan syndrome in the mother, but she has the same single nucleotide change as the patient. The same nucleotide change is found in 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome. Which of the following best describes the single nucleotide change in the patient and her mother?",

        "A": "It is a disease-causing mutation in the patient and her mother",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's break it down into smaller parts and analyze the information provided. The patient and her mother have a single nucleotide difference in the FBN1 gene, which does not change the amino acid at that locus. This suggests that the mutation is not a disease-causing mutation. We need to determine whether this is a polymorphism, a sequence variant of unknown significance, or something else. We also need to consider the frequency of the mutation in the general population. According to the text, the same nucleotide change is found in 15 of 200 individuals without Marfan syndrome, which suggests that it is a polymorphism. A polymorphism is a common genetic variation that does not necessarily cause disease. It is possible that the patient and her mother are carriers of the mutation, but it is not a disease-causing mutation. Therefore, the correct answer is B. It is a polymorphism.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

More than 1800 distinct causative mutations in the very large FBN1 gene have been found, a level of complexity that complicates diagnosis by DNA sequencing. As a result, the diagnosis is mainly based on clinical findings. Because heterozygotes have clinical symptoms, it is thought that the mutant fibrillin protein may act as a dominant negative, preventing the assembly of normal microfibrils. The prevalence of Marfan syndrome is estimated to be 1 in 5000. Approximately 70% to 85% of cases are familial, and the rest are sporadic, arising from de novo FBN1 mutations in the germ cells of parents."

Many of the symptoms of MFS are caused not by the defect in the fibrillin protein itself but rather by an excess in transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), a protein usually bound by fibrillin. Losartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist that also lowers levels of TGF-\u03b2, may prevent aneurysms in patients with MFS. Disorders that are inherited in an AR manner manifest only when both copies of a gene pair located on a non-sex chromosome have a mutation (Tables 47-4, 47-5). Affected children usually are born to unaffected parents, each of whom carries one copy of the mutation. If both members of a couple are carriers (or heterozygotes) for this mutation, each of their offspring has a 25% chance of being affected (Fig. 47-3). SEE CHAPTER 150.

At age 1 month, the infant had multiple fractures in various states of healing (right clavicle, right humerus, and right radius). A careful family history has ruled out nonaccidental trauma (child abuse) as a cause of the bone fractures.

She was diag-nosed with Crohn\u2019s disease 2 years ago, and it involves her terminal ileum and proximal colon, as confirmed by colonoscopy and small bowel radiography. She was initially treated with mesalamine and budesonide with good response, but over the last 2 months, she has had a relapse of her symptoms. She is experiencing fatigue, cramping, abdominal pains, and nonbloody diarrhea up to 10 times daily, and she has had a 15-lb weight loss. She has no other significant medical or surgical his-tory. Her current medications are mesalamine 2.4 g/d and budesonide 9 mg/d. She appears thin and tired. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without guarding in the right lower quadrant; no masses are palpable. On perianal examination, there is no tenderness, fissure, or fistula. Her laboratory data are notable for anemia and elevated C-reactive protein. What are the options for immediate"

Physical examination shows hyperpigmentation, hepatomegaly, and mild scleral icterus. Laboratory tests are remarkable for elevated serum transaminases (liver function tests) and fasting blood glucose. Results of other tests are pending. Correct answer = B. The patient has hereditary hemochromatosis, a disease of iron overload that results from inappropriately low levels of hepcidin caused primarily by mutations to the HFE (high iron) gene. Hepcidin regulates ferroportin, the only known iron export protein in humans, by increasing its degradation. The increase in iron with hepcidin deficiency causes hyperpigmentation and hyperglycemia (\u201cbronze diabetes\u201d). Phlebotomy or use of iron chelators is the treatment.

A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a chief complaint of fatigue. She indicates that she was promoted to senior manager in her company approximately 11 months earlier. Although her promotion was welcome and came with a sizable raise in pay, it resulted in her having to move away from an office and group of colleagues she very much enjoyed. In addition, her level of responsibility increased dramatically. The patient reports that for the last 7 weeks, she has been waking up at 3 am every night and been unable to go back to sleep. She dreads the day and the stresses of the workplace. As a consequence, she is not eating as well as she might and has dropped 7% of her body weight in the last 3 months. She also reports being so stressed that she breaks down crying in the office occasionally"
