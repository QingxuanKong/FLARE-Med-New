The term 'hard inheritance' was coined by Mayr and Provine (1980) to describe this type of inheritance. Let's evaluate the options: A. Genotype inheritance refers to the passing of genetic information from parents to offspring in the form of genetic variations. This is not the correct answer. B.

Mechanisms of this type have a variety of important functions in cells. Most strikingly, certain types of chromatin structure can be inherited; that is, the structure can be directly passed down from a cell to its descendants. Because the cell memory that results is based on an inherited chromatin structure rather than on a change in DNA sequence, this is a form of epigenetic inheritance. The prefix epi is Greek for \u201con\u201d; this is appropriate, because epigenetics represents a form of inheritance that is superimposed on the genetic inheritance based on DNA."

(Unfortunately, the term epigenetic is sometimes also used to refer to all covalent modifications to histones and DNA, whether or not they are self-propagating; many of these modifications are erased each time a cell divides and do not generate cell memory.) In Figure 7\u201353, we contrast two self-propagating epigenetic mechanisms that work in cis, affecting only one chromosomal copy with two self-propagating mechanisms that work in trans, affecting both chromosomal copies of a gene. Cells can combine these mechanisms to ensure that patterns of gene expression are maintained and inherited accurately and reliably\u2014over a period of up to a hundred years or more, in our own case."

Yet stable inheritance requires that each chromosome should contain one centromere, and one only.

When their gene expression, histone modification, and DNA methylation patterns are compared, however, many differences are observed. Because these differences are roughly correlated not only with age but also with the time that the twins have spent apart from each other, it has been proposed that some of these differences are heritable from cell to cell and are the result of environmental factors. Although these studies are in early stages, the idea that environmental events can be permanently registered as epigenetic changes in our cells is a fascinating one that presents an important challenge to the next generation of biological scientists."

These modifications have many functions, inasmuch as they serve as recognition sites for protein domains that link specific protein complexes to different regions of chromatin.

            "content": "If p and q represent the frequencies of alleles A and a, respectively, in a population, then p + q = 1: p2 = frequency of homozygosity for allele A q2 = frequency of homozygosity for allele a 2pq = frequency of heterozygosity (carrier frequency, if an autosomal recessive disease) Therefore, the sum of the frequencies of these genotypes is p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1. The frequency of an X-linked recessive disease in males = q and in females = q2. Hardy-Weinberg law assumptions include: No mutation occurring at the locus Natural selection is not occurring If a population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, then the values of p and q remain constant from generation to generation. Disorders of imprinting Imprinting\u2014one gene copy is silenced by methylation, and only the other copy is expressed \u008e parent-of-origin effects. Modes of inheritance Autosomal dominant Often due to defects in structural genes. Many generations, both males and females are affected. AaaaAaAaaaaa"
