Similar to the work of LH during the menstrual cycle, hCG maintains the corpus luteum during early pregnancy. HCG also possesses marked homology to pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which may account for hyperthyroidism in pregnancy by stimulating the maternal thyroid gland to increase secretion of tetraiodothyronine (T4).

The \u03b2 subunit of hCG is longer than that of LH and contains more sites for glycosylation, which greatly increases the half-life of hCG to 24 to 30 hours. The stability of hCG allows it to rapidly accumulate in the maternal circulation such that hCG is detectable within maternal serum within 24 hours of implantation.

Placental gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is likely involved in the regulation of hCG formation. Both GnRH and its receptor are expressed by cytotrophoblasts and by the syncytiotrophoblast (Wolfahrt, 1998). GnRH administration elevates circulating hCG levels, and cultured trophoblasts respond to GnRH treatment and raise hCG secretion (Iwashita, 1993; Siler-Khodr, 1981). Pituitary GnRH production also is regulated by inhibin and activin. In cultured placental cells, activin stimulates and inhibin inhibits GnRH and hCG production (Petraglia, 1989; Steele, 1993)."

            "content": "physiological adaptations of pregnant women to the unique endocrine milieu, and this is discussed throughout Chapter 4 (p. 49). Chorionic gonadotropin is a glycoprotein with biological activity similar to that of LH, and both act via the same LH-hCG receptor. hCG has with a molecular weight of 36,000 to 40,000 Da and has the highest carbohydrate content of any human hormone-30 percent. The carbohydrate component, and especially the terminal sialic acid, protects the molecule from catabolism. As a result, the 36-hour plasma half-life of intact hCG is much longer than the 2 hours for LH. he hCG molecule is composed of two dissimilar subunits termed . and \ufffd subunits. hese are noncovalently linked and are held together by electrostatic and hydrophobic forces. Isolated subunits are unable to bind the LH-hCG receptor and thus lack biological activity."

            "content": "Human placental lactogen (hPL), also called human chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS), is a 191\u2013amino acid protein hormone produced in the syncytiotrophoblast that is structurally similar to growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL). Its function overlaps those of both GH and PRL. It can be detected within the syncytiotrophoblast by 10 days after conception and in maternal serum by 3 weeks\u2019 gestation (see Fig. 44.34 ). Maternal serum levels rise progressively throughout the remainder of the pregnancy. The quantity of hormone produced is directly related to the size of the placenta, such that as the placenta grows during gestation, hPL secretion increases. As much as 1 g/day of hPL can be secreted late in gestation."

Free a-subunits that do not combine with the 3-subunit are found in placental tissue and maternal plasma. Levels of the a-subunit rise gradually and steadily until they plateau at approximately 36 weeks' gestation. At this time, they account for 30 to 50 percent of hormone (Cole, 1997). Thus, .-hCG secretion roughly corresponds to placental mass, whereas secretion of complete hCG molecules is maximal at 8 to 10 weeks. TABLE 5-2.

Peak maternal plasma levels reach approximately 50,000 to 100,000 mIU/mL between the 60th and 80th days after menses. At 10 to 12 weeks' gestation, plasma levels begin to decline, and a nadir is reached by approximately 16 weeks. Plasma levels are maintained at this lower level for the remainder of pregnancy. The pattern of hCG appearance in fetal blood is similar to that in the mother. Fetal plasma levels, however, are only about 3 percent of those in maternal plasma.
