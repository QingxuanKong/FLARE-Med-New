    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the role of sodium bicarbonate in exercise performance, particularly in middle distance running. Sodium bicarbonate ingestion is a common practice among endurance athletes, including distance runners, to improve performance. The primary mechanism by which sodium bicarbonate improves exercise performance is not directly related to its effect on pH or buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid. Instead, it is the increased pH of the blood that allows for improved buffering capacity of the muscle cells, particularly the phosphocreatine kinase enzyme. This enzyme is crucial for the phosphagen system, which is responsible for the rapid replenishment of ATP during high-intensity, short-duration activities. By increasing the pH of the blood, sodium bicarbonate helps to maintain the activity of phosphocreatine kinase, allowing for more efficient energy production in the muscle. This results in improved exercise performance, particularly in middle distance running. The correct answer is therefore related to the elevation of the pH of the blood, which allows for improved buffering capacity of the muscle cells, not the elevation of the pH or buffering capacity of the extracellular fluid, or the elevation of pre-exercise muscle pH.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

This process in essence With adequate access to water, the thirst mechanism can prevent development of hyperosmolality. This mechanism is responsible for the polydipsia seen in response to the polyuria of both central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Most individuals ingest water/beverages even in the absence of the thirst sensation. Normally the kidneys are able to excrete this excess water because they can excrete up to 18 L/day of urine. However, in some instances, the volume of water ingested exceeds the kidneys\u2019 capacity to excrete water, especially over short periods of time. When this occurs, body fluids become hypoosmotic. An example of how water intake can exceed the capacity of the kidneys to excrete water is long-distance running. A study of participants in the Boston Marathon found that 13% of the runners developed hyponatremia during the course of the race."

Because over the course of the race they ingested (and generated through metabolism) more water than their kidneys were able to excrete or was lost by sweating, hyponatremia developed. In some racers the hyponatremia was severe enough to elicit the neurological symptoms described previously. The maximum amount of water that can be excreted by the kidneys (e.g., 18 L/day) depends on the amount of solute excreted, which in turn depends on food intake. For example, with maximally dilute urine (Uosm = 50 mOsm/kg H2O), the maximum urine output of 18 L/day will be achieved only if the solute excretion rate is 900 mmol/day:"

The ductal cells secrete bicarbonate predominantly derived from plasma (93%) more than from intracellular metabolism (7%). Bicarbonate enters the duct lumen through the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter with depolarization caused by chloride efflux through the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Secretin and VIP bind at the basolateral surface and cause an increase in secondary messenger intracellular cyclic AMP, and act on the apical surface of the ductal cells opening the CFTR in promoting secretion. CCK, acting as a neuromodulator, markedly potentiates the stimulatory effects of secretin. Acetylcholine also plays an important role in ductal cell secretion.

            "content": "APPROACH TO THE PATIENT: The underlying condition that disrupts lactate metabolism must first be corrected; tissue perfusion must be restored when inadequate. Vasoconstrictors should be avoided, if possible, because they may worsen tissue perfusion. Alkali therapy is generally advocated for acute, severe acidemia (pH <7.15) to improve cardiac function and lactate use. However, NaHCO3 therapy may paradoxically depress cardiac performance and exacerbate acidosis by enhanc ing lactate production (HCO3 stimulates phosphofructokinase). While the use of alkali in moderate lactic acidosis is controversial, it is generally agreed that attempts to return the pH or [HCO3 -] to normal by administration of exogenous NaHCO3 are deleterious. A reasonable approach is to infuse sufficient NaHCO3 to raise the arterial pH to no more than 7.2 over 30\u201340 min."

            "content": "Exercise such as endurance running can increase the size of the heart as a result of hypertrophy of individual cardiac muscle cells. Concomitant with this enlarged so-called athlete\u2019s heart is improved cardiac performance, as assessed by an increase in stroke volume, increased oxygen consumption, and preserved relaxation. Thus the athlete\u2019s heart represents an example of \u201cphysiological hypertrophy,\u201d with beneficial contractile effects. In contrast, if exposed to chronic pressure overload, the heart may undergo either concentric left ventricular hypertrophy or dilated left ventricular hypertrophy, which causes impairment of function. Details regarding the morphological, functional, and mechanistic differences between these various types of hypertrophy can be found elsewhere in this textbook (see Chapter 18)."

            "content": "The PT conducts isosmotic reabsorption (see Fig. 161-1)to reabsorb two thirds of the filtered volume, sodium, and chloride. Glucose, amino acids, potassium, and phosphate are almost completely reabsorbed. Approximately 75% of filtered bicarbonate is reabsorbed in the PT. When filtered bicarbonate exceeds the PT threshold, bicarbonate is spilled into the urine. The PT also secretes compounds such as organic acids, penicillins, and other drugs. The most potent vitamin D analog\u20141,25(OH)2-cholecalciferol (calcitriol)\u2014is produced by PT cells in response to parathyroid hormone and intracellular calcium/phosphorus concentrations. The loop of Henle is the site of reabsorption of 25% of sodium chloride filtered in the glomerulus (see Fig. 161-1).Active chloride transport drives the countercurrent multiplier and composes the medullary interstitial hypertonic gradient required for urinary concentration."
