The diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. It is located below the lungs and above the liver, stomach, and intestines. The left upper quadrant of the abdominal cavity is where the spleen is located. The spleen is an organ that filters the blood and stores red blood cells. It is located beneath the diaphragm and is situated in the left upper quadrant of the abdominal cavity. Therefore, the correct answer is the spleen.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

            "content": "In the clinic To understand why a hernia occurs through the diaphragm, it is necessary to consider the embryology of the diaphragm. The diaphragm is formed from four structures\u2014 the septum transversum, the posterior esophageal mesentery, the pleuroperitoneal membrane, and the peripheral rim\u2014which eventually fuse together, separating the abdominal cavity from the thoracic cavity. The septum transversum forms the central tendon, which develops from a mesodermal origin superior to the embryo\u2019s head and then moves to its more adult position during folding of the cephalic portion of the embryo. Fusion of the various components of the diaphragm may fail, and hernias may occur through the failed points of fusion (Fig. 4.146). The commonest sites are: between the xiphoid process and the costal margins on the right (Morgagni\u2019s hernia), and through an opening on the left when the pleuroperitoneal membrane fails to close the pericardioperitoneal canal (Bochdalek\u2019s hernia)."

One of the most important roles of the abdominal wall is to assist in breathing: It relaxes during inspiration to accommodate expansion of the thoracic cavity and the inferior displacement of abdominal viscera during contraction of the diaphragm (Fig. 4.3). During expiration, it contracts to assist in elevating the domes of the diaphragm, thus reducing thoracic volume. Material can be expelled from the airway by forced expiration using the abdominal muscles, as in coughing or sneezing. Contraction of abdominal wall muscles can dramatically increase intraabdominal pressure when the diaphragm is in a fixed position (Fig. 4.4). Air is retained in the lungs by closing valves in the larynx in the neck. Increased intra-abdominal pressure assists in voiding the contents of the bladder and rectum and in giving birth."

The liver is anatomically divided by deep grooves into two large lobes (the right and left lobes) and two smaller lobes (the quadrate and caudate lobes; Fig. 18.1). This anatomic division has only topographic importance because it relates lobes of the liver to other abdominal organs.

The other of these ports is a 12-mm port. The assistant has two 5-mm ports available in the left upper quadrant laterally, and the surgeon\u2019s left-hand port is a 5-mm port more lateral and superior in the right upper quadrant. A liver retractor is placed in the epigastric region.The operation begins by devascularizing the greater curva-ture of the stomach, beginning 3 to 5 cm proximal to the pylorus. The division of all vessels adjacent to the greater curvature is continued up to the left crus of the diaphragm. A complete mobilization of the fundus in this area and division of posterior fibrous attachments to the antrum and body of the stomach are then performed such that the stomach is attached solely by the lesser curvature blood supply and the pyloric and esophageal regions. Stapled division of the stomach now"

            "content": "Diagnosis Diagnosis of ascites is by physical examination and is often aided by abdominal imaging. Patients will have bulging flanks, may have a fluid wave, or may have the presence of shifting dullness. This is determined by taking patients from a supine position to lying on either their left or right side and noting the movement of the dullness to percussion. Subtle amounts of ascites can be detected by ultrasound or CT scanning. Hepatic hydrothorax is more common on the right side and implicates a rent in the diaphragm with free flow of ascitic fluid into the thoracic cavity."

            "content": "Protection of vital organs The thorax houses and protects the heart, lungs, and great vessels. Because of the upward domed shape of the diaphragm, the thoracic wall also offers protection to some important abdominal viscera. Much of the liver lies under the right dome of the diaphragm, and the stomach and spleen lie under the left. The posterior aspects of the superior poles of the kidneys lie on the diaphragm and are anterior to rib XII, on the right, and to ribs XI and XII, on the left. The mediastinum acts as a conduit for structures that pass completely through the thorax from one body region to another and for structures that connect organs in the thorax to other body regions. The esophagus, vagus nerves, and thoracic duct pass through the mediastinum as they course between the abdomen and neck. The phrenic nerves, which originate in the neck, also pass through the mediastinum to penetrate and supply the diaphragm."

            "content": "At the same time, the duodenum, together with its dorsal mesentery and an appreciable part of the pancreas, swings to the right and fuses to the body wall. Secondary fusion of the duodenum to the body wall, massive growth of the liver in the ventral mesentery, and fusion of the superior surface of the liver to the diaphragm restrict the opening to the space enclosed by the ballooned dorsal mesentery associated with the stomach. This restricted opening is the omental foramen (epiploic foramen). The part of the abdominal cavity enclosed by the expanded dorsal mesentery, and posterior to the stomach, is the omental bursa (lesser sac). Access, through the omental foramen, to this space from the rest of the peritoneal cavity (greater sac) is inferior to the free edge of the ventral mesentery."
