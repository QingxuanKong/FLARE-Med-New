Thus, the eukaryotic cell cycle is traditionally divided into four sequential phases: G1, S, G2, and M. G1, S, and G2 together are called interphase (Figure 17\u20134, and see Figure 17\u20133). In a typical human cell proliferating in culture, interphase might occupy 23 hours of a 24-hour cycle, with 1 hour for M phase. Cell growth occurs throughout the cell cycle, except during mitosis.

With respect to the cell cycle, there are three subpopulations of cells: 1. Terminally differentiated cells cannot re-enter the cell cycle. 2. Quiescent (G0) cells can enter the cell cycle if appropriately stimulated. 3. Dividing cells are currently in the cell cycle."

Chromosome duplication occurs during S phase of the cell cycle, whereas most other cell components are duplicated continuously throughout the cycle. During M phase, the replicated chromosomes are segregated into individual nuclei (mitosis), and the cell then splits in two (cytokinesis). S phase and M phase are usually separated by gap phases called G1 and G2, when various intracellular and extracellular signals regulate cell-cycle progression.

During this phase, the proteinase enzyme separase cleaves the cohesion complexes between the sister chromatids. Cleavage of the cohesin complexes in the region of the centromere releases the bond between both centromeres. This cleavage allows the sister chromatids to separate at anaphase II and move to opposite poles of the cell. During meiosis II, the cells pass through prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telophase II. These stages are essentially the same as those in mitosis except that they involve a haploid set of chromosomes (1n) and produce daughter cells that have only haploid DNA content (1d).

From the proportion of cells in such a population that are labeled, we can estimate the duration of S phase as a fraction of the whole cell-cycle duration. Similarly, from the proportion of cells in mitosis (the mitotic index), we can estimate the duration of M phase. Another way to assess the stage that a cell has reached in the cell cycle is by measuring its DNA content, which doubles during S phase. This approach is greatly facilitated by the use of fluorescent DNA-binding dyes and a flow cytometer, which allows the rapid and automatic analysis of large numbers of cells (Figure 17\u20138). We can use flow cytometry to determine the lengths of G1, S, and G2 + M phases, by measuring DNA content in a synchronized cell population as it progresses through the cell cycle."

In a mammalian cell, the S phase typically lasts for about 8 hours; in simpler eukaryotic cells such as yeasts, the S phase can be as short as 40 minutes. By its end, each chromosome has been replicated to produce two complete copies, which remain joined together at their centromeres until the M phase (M for mitosis), which soon follows.

            "content": "For renewing cell populations and growing cell populations, including embryonic cells, and cells in tissue culture, the goal of the cell cycle is to produce two daughter cells, each containing chromosomes identical to those of the parental cell. The cell cycle incorporates two principal phases: the interphase, representing continuous growth of the cell, and the M phase (mitosis), characterized by the partition of the genome. Three other phases, G1 (gap1) phase, S (synthesis) phase, and G2 (gap2) phase, further subdivide interphase (Fig. 3.10). Rapidly renewing populations of human cells progress through the full cell cycle in about 24 hours. Throughout the cycle, several internal quality-control mechanisms or checkpoints represented by biochemical pathways control transition between cell-cycle stages. The cell cycle stops at several checkpoints and can only proceed if certain conditions are met\u2014for example, if the cell has reached a certain size. Checkpoints monitor and modulate the"

            "content": "Fig. 1.16 Cell proliferation is fundamental to development, maintenance of steady-state tissue homeostasis, and replacement of dead or damaged cells. The key elements of cellular proliferation are accurate DNA replication accompanied by the coordinated synthesis of all other cellular constituents, followed by equal apportionment of DNA and other cellular constituents (e.g., organelles) to daughter cells through mitosis and cytokinesis. The sequence of events that results in cell division is called the cell cycle. The cell cycle consists of G1 (pre-synthetic growth), S (DNA synthesis), G2 (premitotic growth), and M (mitotic) phases; quiescent cells that are not actively cycling are in the G0 state. ("
