    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand how mutations in DNA can result in the expression of a new phenotype. Let's break down the process step by step.\\n\\nFirst, a mutation occurs in the DNA sequence of an organism. This can be due to various reasons such as errors during DNA replication, exposure to mutagens, or viral infections.\\n\\nNext, the mutation is passed on to the next generation through the process of inheritance. The mutated DNA sequence is then transcribed into mRNA, which is the template for protein synthesis.\\n\\nNow, the mutation can result in the production of a different polypeptide. This is because the genetic code is read in triplets of nucleotides (codons) and each codon specifies a particular amino acid. If the mutation changes the codon, it can result in the production of a different amino acid, which can lead to a new phenotype.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. A different polypeptide is produced.\\n\\nAnswer choice B is incorrect because the polarity of tRNA (transfer RNA) is not directly related to the expression of a new phenotype. While tRNA plays a crucial role in protein synthesis, its polarity is not the cause of a new phenotype.\\n\\nAnswer choice C is also incorrect because methylation of nucleic acids can affect gene expression, but it is not the primary mechanism by which mutations result in the expression of a new phenotype.\\n\\nAnswer choice D is incorrect because the direction of transcription (5' to 3' or 3' to 5') is not directly related to the expression of a new phenotype. The direction of transcription is determined by the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA, but it does not determine the final phenotype of the organism.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is A. A different polypeptide is produced.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

If the genome size of the organism is small (for example, for bacteria or simple eukaryotes), it is possible to simply determine the genome sequence of the mutant organism and identify the affected gene by comparison with the wild-type sequence. Because of the continuous accumulation of neutral mutations, there will probably be differences between the two genome sequences in addition to the mutation responsible for the phenotype. One way of proving that a mutation is causative is to introduce the putative mutation back into a normal organism and determine whether or not it causes the mutant phenotype. We will discuss how this is accomplished later in the chapter."

When we compare the three domains of the living world, we can begin to see which genes are common to all of them and must therefore have been present in the cell that was ancestral to all present-day living things, and which genes are peculiar to a single branch in the tree of life. To explain the findings, however, we need to consider a little more closely how new genes arise and genomes evolve. The raw material of evolution is the DNA sequence that already exists: there is no natural mechanism for making long stretches of new random sequence. In this sense, no gene is ever entirely new. Innovation can, however, occur in several ways (Figure 1\u201319): 1. Intragenic mutation: an existing gene can be randomly modified by changes in its DNA sequence, through various types of error that occur mainly in the process of DNA replication. 2."

For example, one copy might lose expression in a particular tissue as a result of a regulatory mutation, while the other copy loses expression in a second tissue. Following such an occurrence, both gene copies would be required to provide the full range of functions that were once supplied by a single gene; hence, both copies would now be protected from loss through inactivating mutations.

Can we identify general features common to all cancer cells\u2014such as their production of misfolded, mutated proteins\u2014that can be used for the targeted destruction of many different types of cancers? Can sensitive and reliable blood tests be devised to detect cancers very early, before they have grown to a size where treatment with a single drug will generally be defeated by the survival of a preexisting resistant variant? how can the observed environmental effects on cancer rates be exploited to reduce avoidable cancers? Can new technologies be devised to reveal exactly how a quiescent micrometastasis converts to a full-blown metastatic tumor?"

A. cya\u2212 (no adenylyl cyclase made) B. i\u2212 (no repressor protein made) C. Oc (operator cannot bind repressor protein) D. One resulting in impaired glucose uptake Correct answer = A. In the absence of glucose, adenylyl cyclase makes cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which forms a complex with the catabolite activator protein (CAP). The cAMP\u2013CAP complex binds the CAP site on the DNA, causing RNA polymerase to bind more efficiently to the lac operon promoter, thereby increasing expression of the operon. With cya\u2212 mutations, adenylyl cyclase is not made, and so the operon is unable to be maximally expressed even when glucose is absent and lactose is present. The absence of a repressor protein or decreased ability of the repressor to bind the operator results in constitutive (essentially constant) expression of the lac operon."

A deletion construct for use in yeast contains DNA sequences (red) homologous to each end of a target gene x, a selectable marker gene (blue), and a unique \u201cbarcode\u201d sequence approximately 20 nucleotide pairs in length (green). This DNA is introduced into yeast cells, where it readily replaces the target gene by homologous recombination. Cells that carry a successful gene replacement are identified by expression of the selectable marker gene, typically a gene that provides resistance to a drug. By using a collection of such constructs, each specific for one gene, a library of yeast mutants was constructed containing a mutant for every gene. Essential genes cannot be studied this way, as their deletion from the genome causes the cells to die. In this case, the target gene is replaced by a version of the gene that can be regulated by the experimenter (see Figure 8\u201352). The gene can then be turned off and the effect of this can"
