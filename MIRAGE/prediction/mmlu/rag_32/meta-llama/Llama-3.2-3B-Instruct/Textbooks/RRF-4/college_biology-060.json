The nucleus, plasma membrane, and other organelles are thought to have evolved later in the history of life.

A frog, a chicken, and a mammal, for example, even though they develop in similar ways later, make eggs that differ radically in size and structure, and they begin their development with different sequences of cell divisions and cell specializations. Gastrulation occurs in all animal embryos, but the details of its timing, of the associated pattern of cell movements, and of the shape and size of the embryo as gastrulation proceeds are highly variable. Likewise, there is great variation in the time and manner in which the primary axes of the body become marked out. However, this polarization of the embryo usually becomes discernible very early, before gastrulation begins: it is the first step of spatial patterning."

They found three patterns of cell labeling in different tissues. Cells in some tissues such as neurons in the central nervous system and the retina did not get labeled. Muscle, kidney, and liver, by contrast, each showed a small number of labeled cells that retained their label, apparently without further division or loss. Finally, cells such as those in the squamous epithelia of the tongue and esophagus were labeled in fairly large numbers, with radioactive pairs of nuclei visible in 12 hours; however, the labeled cells disappeared over time. Which of these three patterns of labeling would you expect to see if the labeled cells were generated by stem cells? Explain your answer."

During the blastula stages, cells are often totipotent or pluripotent\u2014they have the potential to give rise to all or almost all of the cell types of the adult body. The pluripotency is lost as gastrulation proceeds: a cell located in the endodermal germ layer, for example, can give rise to the cell types that will line the gut or form gut-derived organs such as the liver or pancreas, but it no longer has the potential to form mesoderm-derived structures such as skeleton, heart, or kidney. Such a cell is said to be determined for an endodermal fate. Thus, cell determination starts early and progressively narrows the options as the cell steps through a programmed series of intermediate states\u2014guided at each step by its genome, its history, and its interactions with neighbors.

We also discussed how the basic features of tissues, such as the polarity of epithelia, arise from the properties of individual cells. In this section, we consider how the rearrangements of cells during animal development give shape to the embryo and to all the individual organs and appendages of the body."

            "content": "what if there is no clear initial asymmetry? Can a regular pattern arise spontaneously within a set of cells that are initially all alike? The answer is yes. The fundamental principle underlying such de novo pattern formation is positive feedback: cells can exchange signals in such a way that any small initial discrepancy between cells at different sites becomes self-amplifying, driving the cells toward different fates. This is most clearly illustrated in the phenomenon of lateral inhibition, a form of cell\u2013cell interaction that forces close neighbors to become different and thereby generates fine-grained patterns of different cell types."

Thus, a succession of simple cues that a cell receives at different times can direct it along a complex developmental pathway. At each step, the cell becomes further restricted in the range of final states open to it. The process reaches its limit when the cell differentiates to form one of the specialized cell types of the adult body."

            "content": "Wherever we find this phenomenon of modulated repetition, we can break down the developmental biologist\u2019s problem into two kinds of questions: what is the basic construction mechanism common to all the objects of the given class, and how is this mechanism modified to give the observed variations in different animals? The segments of the insect body provide a good example. We have thus far sketched the way in which the rudiment of a single body segment is constructed and how cells within each segment become different from one another. We now consider how one segment becomes determined, or specified, to be different from another."
