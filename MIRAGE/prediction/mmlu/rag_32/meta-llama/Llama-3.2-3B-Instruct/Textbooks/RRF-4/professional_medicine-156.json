    "question": "A male neonate, who was born at 36 weeks' gestation 2 hours ago in the labor and delivery unit of the hospital, now shows signs of respiratory difficulty. The mother, an 18-year-old primigravid woman, smoked one pack of cigarettes daily throughout her pregnancy. She received prenatal care during most of the pregnancy. One episode of chlamydial cervicitis was detected during the last trimester and treated with azithromycin. The neonate was born via cesarean delivery due to fetal heart rate decelerations. The amniotic fluid was stained with light particulate meconium. Apgar scores were 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The patient is 50 cm (20 in; 50th percentile) long and weighs 3005 g (6 lb 10 oz; 50th percentile); head circumference is 35 cm (14 in; 50th percentile). The infant's vital signs now are temperature 36.6\u00b0C (97.8\u00b0F), pulse 150/min, and respirations 70/min. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Physical examination discloses mild subcostal and intercostal retractions. Chest x-ray shows prominent pulmonary vascular markings and fluid in the intralobar fissures.

Although the passage of meconium into amniotic fluid is common in infants born in the breech presentation, meconium-stained fluid should be considered clinically as a sign of fetal distress in all infants. The presence of meconium in the amniotic fluid suggests in utero distress with asphyxia, hypoxia, and acidosis. Aspiration of amniotic fluid contaminated with particulate meconium may occur in utero in a distressed, gasping fetus; more often, meconium is aspirated into the lung immediately after delivery. Affected infants have abnormal chest radio-graphs, showing a high incidence of pneumonia and pneumothoraces."

Because fetal breathing movements are episodic, interpretation of fetal health when respirations are absent may be tenuous.

Other signiicant correlates of aspiration included cesarean delivery, forceps to expedite delivery, intrapartum heart rate abnormalities, depressed Apgar scores, and need for assisted ventilation at delivery. Analysis of the type of fetal acidemia based on umbilical blood gases suggested that the fetal compromise associated with meconium aspiration syndrome was an acute event. his is because most acidemic fetuses had abnormally increased PC02 values rather than a pure metabolic acidemia. Dawes and coworkers (1972) observed that such hypercarbia in fetal lambs induces gasping and resultant increased amnionic fluid inhalation.

This practice failed to lower meconium aspiration syndrome rates because fetuses usually inhaled meconium before labor (Bryne, 1987; Wenstrom, 1995).

The most common cause of respiratory failure in preterm infants (affects > 70% of infants born at 28\u201330 weeks\u2019 gestation); formerly known as hyaline membrane disease. Surfactant def ciency leads to poor lung compliance, alveolar collapse, and atelectasis. Risk factors include maternal DM, male gender, and the second born of twins. Presents in the first 48\u201372 hours of life with a respiratory rate > 60/min, progressive hypoxemia, cyanosis, nasal \ufb02aring, intercostal retractions, and expiratory grunting. Check ABGs, CBC, and blood cultures to rule out infection. Diagnosis is based mainly on characteristic CXR findings: RDS: \u201cGround-glass\u201d appearance, diffuse atelectasis, and air bronchograms on CXR. Transient tachypnea of the newborn: Retained amniotic \ufb02 uid results in prominent perihilar streaking in interlobular fissures."

To further the confusion, the National Vital Statistics Reports tabulates fetal deaths from gestations that are 20 weeks or older (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). his is problematic because the 50th percentile for fetal weight at 20 weeks approximates 325 to 350 g-considerably less than the 500-g deinition. Indeed, a birthweight of 500 g corresponds closely with the 50th percentile for 22 weeks' gestation."

Preterm labor = regular uterine contractions + concurrent cervical change at < 37 weeks\u2019 gestation. First step: A sterile speculum exam reveals pooling of amniotic fuid in the vaginal vault. Nitrazine paper test is (paper turns blue, indicating alkaline pH of amniotic f uid). Fern test is (a ferning pattern is seen under a microscope after amniotic fuid dries on a glass slide). Second step: Ultrasound to assess amniotic f uid volume. If unsure: Ultrasound-guided transabdominal instillation of indigo carmine dye to check for leakage (unequivocal test). Minimize infection risk; do not perform digital vaginal exams on women who are not in labor or for whom labor is not planned immediately. Check fetal heart tracing, maternal temperature, WBC count, and uterine tenderness for evidence of chorioamnionitis. Depends on GA and fetal lung maturity."

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia.

This team readies equipment, ensures that adequate personnel are present, delegates roles and responsibilities, and considers contingency plans to stabilize the newborn. Four questions a neonatal provider will ask pertain to expected gestional age, amnionic fluid color, fetal number, and additional fetal risks. Several conditions are associated with a nonvigorous presentation. These may include immaturity, hypoxemia or acidosis from any cause, sepsis syndrome, recent drugs administered to the mother, and central nervous system developmental abnormalities. Those related to the respiratory tract are lung abnormalities, upper airway obstruction, pneumothorax, and meconium aspiration."

            "content": "In 2015, a workshop sponsored by the NICHD was convened and suggested renaming this condition \"intraamnionic infection and inflammation\" (Higgins, 2016). The merits and clinical utility of this novel \"triple I\" terminology have been questioned (Barth, 2016). Nonetheless, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (20 17b) recently revised both the definitions and temperature thresholds for intraamnionic infection. Using these new deinitions, the diagnosis of suspected intraamniotic infection is made when the maternal temperature is \ufffd39.0\u00b0C or when the maternal temperature is 38.0 to 38.9\u00b0C and one additional clinical risk factor is present. Suggested factors include low parity, multiple digital examinations, use of internal uterine and fetal monitors, meconiumstained amnionic fluid, and the presence of certain genital tract pathogens. Examples are group B streptococcus and sexually transmitted agents. Isolated maternal fever is deined as any maternal temperature between"

If two such episodes occur in 30 minutes, the test result is considered reactive (versus nonreactive), and the fetus is not at risk. Additional signs of fetal well-being are fetal breathing movements, gross body movements, fetal tone, and the presence of amniotic fluid pockets more than 2 cm in size, detected by ultrasound. The biophysical profile combines the nonstress test with these four parameters and offers the most accurate fetal assessment."

Women diagnosed with labor by either cervical change or persistent uterine contractions are admitted. After review by a physician, women without cervical change or with abatement of contractions return home with a diagnosis of false labor. In a recent study, a total of 3949 women with uncomplicated pregnancies between and 416r weeks' gestation were diagnosed with false labor. The mean inteval from hospital discharge to when they again presented was 4.9 days (Nelson, 2017).
