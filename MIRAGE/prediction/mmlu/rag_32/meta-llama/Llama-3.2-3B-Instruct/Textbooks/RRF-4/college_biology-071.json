We are given a scenario where a fluorescent molecule of 1,000 daltons is injected into one cell and observed to enter an adjacent cell. The key concept here is to understand how molecules can pass between cells. The question is asking about the structure that allows the passage of small molecules (less than 1,000 daltons) between cells. According to Document [8], molecules with a molecular weight of less than about 1,000 daltons can pass through the nuclear envelope (NPC) by passive diffusion. However, the question is asking about the passage between cells, not within the cell. Therefore, we need to consider the structures that connect cells. According to Document [6], gap junctions are structures that allow for the direct exchange of molecules between adjacent cells. They are composed of connexons, which are proteins that form channels that allow for the passage of small molecules. Given this information, the correct answer can be determined.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Fluorescent molecules absorb light at one wavelength and emit it at another, longer wavelength (Figure 9\u201312A). If we illuminate such a molecule at its absorbing wavelength and then view it through a filter that allows only light of the emitted wavelength to pass, it will glow against a dark background. Because the background is dark, even a minute amount of the glowing fluorescent dye can be detected. In contrast, the same number of molecules of a nonfluorescent stain, viewed conventionally, would be practically indiscernible because the absorption of light by molecules in the stain would result in only the faintest tinge of color in the light transmitted through that part of the specimen."

This process is referred to as photoactivation. Many inactive photosensitive precursors of this type, often called caged molecules, have been made based on a variety of fluorescent molecules. A microscope can be used to focus a strong pulse of light from a laser on any tiny region of the cell, so that the experimenter can control exactly where and when the fluorescent molecule is photoactivated.

Researchers have determined the effective size of these passages by injecting labeled water-soluble molecules of different sizes into the cytosol and then measuring their rate of diffusion into the nucleus. Small molecules (5000 daltons or less) diffuse in so fast that we can consider the nuclear envelope freely permeable to them. Large proteins, however, diffuse in much more slowly, and the larger a protein, the more slowly it passes through the NPC. Proteins larger than 60,000 daltons cannot enter by passive diffusion. This size cut-off to free diffusion is thought to result from the NPC structure (see Figure 12\u20138). The channel nucleoporins with extensive unstructured regions form a disordered tangle (much like a kelp bed in the ocean) that restricts the diffusion of large macromolecules while allowing smaller molecules to pass."

These are then imaged before bleaching quenches their fluorescence and a new subset is activated. Each molecule emits a few thousand photons in response to the excitation before switching off, and the switching process can be repeated hundreds or even thousands of times, allowing the exact coordinates of a very large set of single molecules to be determined. The full set can be combined and digitally displayed as an image in which the computed location of each individual molecule is exactly marked (Figure 9\u201338).

(Courtesy of kevin F. sullivan.) (see Figure 9\u201313) but, like many organic fluorochromes, they fade fairly rapidly when continuously illuminated. More stable fluorochromes have been developed based on inorganic chemistry. Tiny crystals of semiconductor material, called nanoparticles, or quantum dots, can be excited to fluoresce by a broad spectrum of blue light. Their emitted light has a color that depends on the exact size of the nanocrystal, between 2 and 10 nm in diameter,"

            "content": "technique called total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. In a TIRF microscope, laser light shines onto the coverslip surface at the precise critical angle at which total internal reflection occurs (Figure 9\u201332A). Because of total internal reflection, the light does not enter the sample, and the majority of fluorescent molecules are not, therefore, illuminated. However, electromagnetic energy does extend, as an evanescent field, for a very short distance beyond the surface of the cover slip and into the specimen, allowing just those molecules in the layer closest to the surface to become excited. When these molecules fluoresce, their emitted light is no longer competing with outoffocus light from the overlying molecules, and can now be detected. TIRF has allowed several dramatic experiments, for instance imaging of single motor proteins moving along microtubules or single actin filaments forming and branching. At present, the technique is restricted to a thin layer"

            "content": "In fluorescence microscopy, the excitation light is focused to a spot on the specimen by the objective lens, which then captures the photons emitted by any fluorescent molecule that the beam has raised from a ground state to an excited state. Because the excitation spot is blurred according to the point spread function, fluorescent molecules that are closer than about 200 nm will be imaged as a single blurred spot. One approach to increasing the resolution is to switch all the fluorescent molecules at the periphery of the blurry excitation spot back to their ground state, or to a state where they no longer fluoresce in the normal way, leaving only those at the very center to be recorded. This can be done in practice by adding a second, very bright laser beam that wraps around the excitation beam like a torus. The wavelength and intensity of this second beam are adjusted so as to switch the fluorescent molecules off everywhere except at the very center of the point spread function, a"

            "content": "Fig. A.32 Polyclonal mitogens, many of plant origin, stimulate lymphocyte proliferation in tissue culture. Many of these mitogens are used to test the ability of lymphocytes in human peripheral blood to proliferate. Cells are first incubated with a fluorescent dye such as carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE). This dye enters the cell and, once in the cytosol, becomes covalently coupled to lysine residues on cellular proteins. Each time the cell divides, the amount of CFSE is diluted by one-half, as each daughter cell inherits one-half of the CFSE-labeled proteins. Cell division can then be analyzed by flow cytometry, where a histogram of CFSE fluorescence displays a series of peaks, each of which represents cells that have undergone a fixed number of divisions. Under optimal conditions, this assay is capable of detecting up to 7\u20138 cell divisions, after which CFSE fluorescence can no longer be measured."
