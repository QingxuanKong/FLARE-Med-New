According to Document [2], Golgi tendon organs are located at the junction of the tendon and the muscle fibers and thus lie in series with the muscle fibers. This indicates that they are indeed found at the junction between muscle and tendon. Additionally, Document [4] states that the actual stimulus sensed by the Golgi tendon organ is the force that develops in the tendon to which it is linked. This suggests that the Golgi tendon organ is sensitive to muscle contraction and tension. Furthermore, Document [12] mentions that Golgi tendon organs are encapsulated receptors located in the tendinous portions of muscle and activate afferent fibers that end on internuncial cells, which project to alpha motor neurons. This implies that the Golgi tendon organ is a proprioceptive sensory receptor. Based on these characteristics, we can conclude that the Golgi tendon organ is a proprioceptive sensory receptor found at the junction between muscle and tendon.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The main component of the tendon organ is an elongated fascicle of collagen bundles that is in series with the muscle fibers and can respond to contractions of individual muscle fibers. A given tendon organ may attach to several fast-twitch or slow-twitch muscle fibers (or both) and sends impulses through type Ib afferent nerve fibers in response to muscle contraction. The type Ib afferent impulses enter the spinal cord, which can promote inhibition of \u03b1 motor neurons to the contracting (and synergistic) muscles while promoting excitation of \u03b1 motor neurons to antagonistic muscles. The inhibitory actions are mediated through interneurons in the cord that release an inhibitory transmitter to the \u03b1 motor neuron and create an inhibitory postsynaptic potential. The type Ib afferent impulses are also sent to higher centers of the brain (including the motor cortex and"

Such functional units precisely regulate contractions of portions of the muscle by creating \u201cfixation points\u201d within the muscle substance. Similar encapsulated receptors, Golgi tendon organs, are found in the tendons of muscle and respond to increased tension on the muscle. These receptors contain only sensory (afferent, Ib) nerve fibers, and they monitor muscle tension (or the force of contraction) within an optimal range. Development, Repair, Healing, and Renewal Development of myogenic stem cell linage depends on expression of various myogenic regulatory factors."

Just as the stretch reflex can be thought of as a feedback system to regulate muscle length, the inverse myotatic, or group Ib, reflex can be thought of as a feedback system to help maintain force levels in a muscle. With the upper part of the leg as an example, the group Ib reflex arc is depicted in Fig. 9.7. The arc starts with the Golgi tendon organ receptor, which senses the tension in the muscle. Golgi tendon organs are located at the junction of the tendon and the muscle fibers and thus lie in series with the muscle fibers, in contrast to the parallel arrangement of the muscle spindles (see Fig. 9.2 ). Golgi tendon organs have a diameter of about 100 \u00b5m and a length of about 1 mm. A Golgi tendon organ is innervated by the terminals of group Ib afferent fibers. These terminals wrap about bundles of collagen fibers in the tendon of a muscle (or in tendinous inscriptions within the muscle)."

Recall that the Golgi tendon organs monitor force levels across the tendon that they supply. If during maintained posture (such as standing at attention) knee extensors (such as the rectus femoris muscle) begin to fatigue, the force pulling on the patellar tendon declines. The decline in force reduces the activity of Golgi tendon organs in this tendon. Because the group Ib reflex normally inhibits the \u03b1 motor neurons to the rectus femoris muscle, reduced activity of the Golgi tendon organs enhances the excitability of (i.e., disinhibits) the \u03b1 motor neurons and thereby helps reverse the decrease in force caused by the fatigue. Simultaneously, bending of the knee stretches the knee extensors and activates the afferent fibers from the muscle spindles, which then excite the same \u03b1 motor neurons. Thus coordinated action of afferent fibers from both the muscle spindle and Golgi tendon organ"

In both cases, however, the actual stimulus sensed by the Golgi tendon organ is the force that develops in the tendon to which it is linked. Thus the response to stretch is the result of the spring-like nature of the muscle (i.e., by Hooke\u2019s law, the force on a spring is proportional to how much it is stretched). To distinguish between the responsiveness of the muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, the firing patterns of group Ia and group Ib fibers can be compared when a muscle is stretched and then held at a longer length (Fig."

It is active both in cells that secrete protein by exocytosis and in cells that synthesize large amounts of membrane and membrane-associated proteins such as nerve cells. In the light microscope, secretory cells that have a large Golgi apparatus (e.g., plasma cells, osteoblasts, and cells of the epididymis) typically exhibit a clear area partially surrounded by ergastoplasm (Fig. 2.32). In EM, the Golgi apparatus appears as a series of stacked, \ufb02attened, membrane-limited sacs or cisternae and tubular extensions embedded in a network of microtubules near the microtubule-organizing center (see page 65). Small vesicles involved in vesicular transport are seen in association with the cisternae. The Golgi apparatus is polarized both morphologically and functionally. The \ufb02attened cisternae"

As the collagen fibers are orga-nized, transmission of forces across the damaged portion can occur. Restoration of the mechanical integrity may never be equal to that of the undamaged tendon.Tendon vasculature has a clear effect on healing. Hypovas-cular tendons tend to heal with less motion and more scar for-mation than tendons with better blood supply. The specialized cells, tenocytes, are metabolically very active and retain a large regenerative potential, even in the absence of vascularity. Cells on the tendon surface are identical to those within the sheath and play a role in tendon healing as well.NerveNerve injuries are very common, with an estimated 200,000 repairs performed every year in the United States. Peripheral nerves are a complex arrangement of axons, nonneuronal cells, and extracellular"

The type Ib afferent impulses are also sent to higher centers of the brain (including the motor cortex and cerebellum). It is hypothesized that feedback from the tendon organs in response to muscle contraction may smooth the progression of muscle contraction by limiting the recruitment of additional motor units. Of interest is that the response of the tendon organ is not linearly related to force; rather, it drops off at higher levels of force, which may facilitate the recruitment of motor units at higher levels of effort."
