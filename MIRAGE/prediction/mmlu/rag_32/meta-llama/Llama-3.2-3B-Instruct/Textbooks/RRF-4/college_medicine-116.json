The visual system detects electromagnetic waves between 400 and 750 nm long as visible light, which enters the eye and impinges on photoreceptors in a specialized sensory epithelium, the retina. The photoreceptors, rods and cones, can distinguish two aspects of light: its brightness (or luminance) and its wavelength (or color). Rods have high sensitivity for detecting low light intensities but do not provide well-defined visual images, nor do they contribute to color vision. Rods operate best under conditions of reduced lighting (scotopic vision). Cones, in contrast, are not as sensitive to light as rods are and thus operate best under daylight conditions (photopic vision). Cones are responsible for high visual acuity and color vision."

If two trains of waves reaching the same point by different paths are precisely in phase, with crest matching crest and trough matching trough, they will reinforce each other so as to increase brightness. In contrast, if the trains of waves are out of phase, they will interfere with each other in such a way as to cancel each other partly or entirely (Figure 9\u20134). The interaction of light with an object changes the phase relationships of the light waves in a way that produces complex interference effects. At high magnification, for example, the shadow of an edge that is evenly illuminated with light of uniform wavelength appears as a set of parallel lines (Figure 9\u20135), whereas that of a circular spot appears as a set of concentric rings. For the same reason, a single point seen through a microscope appears as a blurred disc, and two point objects close together give overlapping images and may merge into one."

Relatively small numbers of types of signal molecules and receptors are sufficient. The complexity lies in the ways in which cells respond to the combinations of signals that they receive. A signal molecule often has different effects on different types of target cells. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (Figure 15\u20135A), for example, decreases the small, hydrophobic signal molecule"

            "content": "In visual transduction responses, which are the fastest G-protein-mediated responses known in vertebrates, the receptor activation stimulated by light causes a fall rather than a rise in the level of the cyclic nucleotide. The pathway has been especially well studied in rod photoreceptors (rods) in the vertebrate retina. Rods are responsible for noncolor vision in dim light, whereas cone photoreceptors (cones) are responsible for color vision in bright light. A rod photoreceptor is a highly specialized cell with outer and inner segments, a cell body, and a synaptic region where the rod passes a chemical signal to a retinal nerve cell (Figure 15\u201338). This nerve cell relays the signal to another nerve cell in the retina, which in turn relays it to the brain."

            "content": "Given the Western, biomedical model, acupuncture is difficult to comprehend. There is, however, an intriguing and growing body of research on this technique. In one study involving stimulation of an acupuncture point located on the lateral aspect of the foot that corresponds to the visual cortex, magnetic resonance imaging detected activity of the visual cortex of the brain equivalent to the activity seen when a light is shone in the eye. No activity was seen when an acupuncture needle was placed 1 cm away from the designated acupuncture point (15). Many of the CAM approaches that claim to have an effect and yet seem to be inconsistent with the biomedical model deserve further investigation."

            "content": "5. Signal processing can convert a simple signal into a complex response. In many systems, for example, a gradual increase in an extracellular signal is converted into an abrupt, switchlike response. In other cases, a simple input signal is converted into an oscillatory response, produced by a repeating series of transient intracellular signals. Feedback usually lies at the heart of biochemical switches and oscillators, as we describe later. 6."
