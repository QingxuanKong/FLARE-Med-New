The ZPD refers to the range of tasks that are just beyond an individual's current level of independent performance, but with the guidance of a more knowledgeable other, they can be accomplished. This means that the individual is not yet able to perform the task independently but can do so with the support of someone who is more experienced or knowledgeable. Let's examine each option in the context of the ZPD:\\n\\nOption A: A baseball player hitting baseballs from a tee to build muscle memory is an example of a task that is within their current level of independent performance. It's a skill that they can already do without needing guidance.\\n\\nOption B: A concert flute player who falls short of finishing a piece without mistakes may be on the cusp of mastering the task, but they are not yet in the ZPD. They are close to achieving independence but need further practice or guidance.\\n\\nOption C: A high school English student submitting a paper for review by their professor is a task that is within their current level of independent performance. They are already able to complete the task without needing significant guidance.\\n\\nOption D: A high diver taking instruction from her coach to improve her form on a specific move is an example of being in the ZPD. She is not yet able to perform the task independently but can do so with the guidance of her coach, who is more knowledgeable and experienced.\\n\\nBased on the definition of the ZPD, the correct answer is D.

Motor skills attain their maximal precision in the performances of athletes, artists, and musicians, whose peak development is at maturity (age 18 to 21 years). Intelligence and the capacity for reflective thought and the manipulation of mathematical symbols become possible for most individuals only in adolescence and later. Emotional control, precarious in the school age and all through adolescence, stabilizes in adulthood. We tend to think of all these phenomena as being achieved through the stresses of human relations, which are conditioned and habituated by the powerful influences of social approval.

One of the leading theories had been that of Piaget, who proposed that the emergence of intelligence is accomplished in discrete stages related to age: sensorimotor, from 0 to 2 years; preconceptual thought, from 2 to 4 years; intuitive thought, from 4 to 7 years; concrete operations (conceptualization), from 7 to 11 years; and, finally, the period of \u201cformal operations\u201d (logical or abstract thought), from 11 years on. This scheme implies that the capacity for logical thought, developing as it does according to an orderly timetable, is coded in the genes. Surely, one can recognize these states of intellectual development in the child, but Piaget\u2019s theory has been criticized as being anecdotal and lacking the quantitative validation that could be derived only from studies of a large normal population.

Gesell took the position that careful observation of a large number of infants, with accurate recording of the age at which various skills are acquired, permits the establishment of norms or averages. From such a framework one can determine the level of developmental attainment, expressed as the development quotient (DQ = developmental age/chronologic age), and thus ascertain whether any given child has superior, average, or inferior performance. Furthermore, after examining 10,000 infants over a period of 40 years, Gesell concluded that \u201cattained growth is an indicator of past growth processes and a foreteller of growth yet to be achieved.\u201d In other words, the DQ predicts potential attainment."

Now, learning proceeds rapidly as adults attach names to objects and help the baby manipulate them. Gradually the child acquires verbal facility (learning what words mean), memory, color and spatial perception, a concept of number, and the practical use of tools, each at a particular time according to a schedule set largely by the maturational state of the brain. Nevertheless, in these early achievements individuals differ considerably, reflecting to some extent the influence of their parents and others around them. Also, the young child exhibits elementary modes of thinking but is highly suggestible and often incapable of separating imagination from reality."

The converse does not apply, however; delay in the acquisition of motor milestones often correlates with developmental delay. In other words, most cognitively delayed children sit, stand, walk, and run at a later age than normal children, and deviations from this rule occur mainly in specific diseases, such as autism. In the period of early childhood, the reflexive- instinctual activities are no longer of help in evaluating cerebral development, and one must turn to the examination of language functions and learned sensory and motor skills, which are outlined in Tables 27-5 and 27-6."

            "content": "The most common co-occurring mental and neurodevelopmental disorders are atten- behavior); impulse-control disorders; and major neurocognitive disorder. Major depres- sive disorder may occur throughout the range of severity of intellectual disability. Self- agnosis of stereotypic movement disorder. Individuals with intellectual disability, partic- ularly those with more severe intellectual disability, may also exhibit aggression and disruptive behaviors, including harm of others or property destruction. Relationship to Other Classifications ICD-ll (in development at the time of this publication) uses the term intellectual develop- mental disorders to indicate that these are disorders that involve impaired brain functioning early in life. These disorders are described in ICD-11 as a metasyndrome occurring in the developmental period analogous to dementia or neurocognitive disorder in later life. There are four subtypes in ICD-ll: mild, moderate, severe, and profound."

            "content": "The long-standing controversy about cerebral functions, whether they are diffusely represented in the cerebrum with all parts roughly equivalent, or localized to certain lobes or regions, has been resolved to the satisfaction of most neurologists. Clinicians have demonstrated beyond doubt that particular functions are assignable to certain cortical regions. For example, the preand postrolandic zones control motor and sensory activities, respectively, the striate occipital zones control visual perception, the superior temporal gyri are auditory, and so on. Beyond these broad correlations, however, there is a notable lack of precision in the cortical localization of most of the behavioral and mental operations described in Chaps. 19 and 20. In particular, of the higher order functions, such as attention, vigilance, apperception, and analytic and synthetic thinking, none has a precise and predictable anatomy; or, more accurately, the neural systems on which they depend are widely"
