Endurance training is a type of exercise that is designed to improve the body's ability to use oxygen to generate energy. This type of training typically involves low to moderate intensity exercise that lasts for a long period of time. One of the key adaptations that occur with endurance training is an increase in the muscle's capacity to use fat and carbohydrate as energy sources. This is because endurance training increases the muscle's oxidative capacity, allowing it to burn more fat and carbohydrate for energy. The other options are not accurate descriptions of the effects of endurance training. Endurance training does not increase the muscle's capacity to contract faster (A), break down phosphocreatine (B), or generate energy anaerobically (D). In fact, endurance training can actually improve the muscle's ability to use oxygen to generate energy, which is the opposite of anaerobic energy production. Therefore, the correct answer is C. burn fat and carbohydrate.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

This level can be greatly increased by a regular exercise regimen that is sufficient to induce adaptive responses. The adaptive response of skeletal muscle fibers to endurance exercise is mainly the result of an increase in the oxidative metabolic capacity of the motor units involved. This demand places an increased load on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems and increases the capacity of the heart and respiratory muscles. The latter effects are responsible for the principal health benefits associated with endurance exercise."

Typically, most athletic endeavors involve elements of all three. The learning aspect of training involves motivational factors, as well as neuromuscular coordination. This aspect of training does not involve adaptive changes in the muscle fibers per se. However, motor skills can persist for years without regular training, unlike the responses of muscle cells to exercise."

Such efforts recruit fast glycolytic motor units, as well as slow oxidative motor units. During these efforts, blood supply to the working muscles may be interrupted as tissue pressures rise above intravascular pressure. The reduced blood flow limits the duration of the contraction. Regular maximal-strength exercise, such as weightlifting, induces the synthesis of more myofibrils and hence hypertrophy of the active muscle cells. The increased stress also induces the growth of tendons and bones. Endurance exercise does not cause fast motor units to become slow, nor does maximal muscular effort produce a shift from slow to fast motor units. Thus any practical exercise regimen, when superimposed on normal daily activities, probably does not alter muscle fiber phenotype."

Normally, type 1 (oxidative enzyme-rich) fibers are slightly smaller than type 2 (phosphorylative enzyme-rich) fibers; the numerical proportions of the 2 fiber types vary in different muscles in accordance with the natural functions of that muscle. The exercising of young animal muscle causes a hypertrophy of high-oxidative type 1 fibers and an increase in the proportion of low-oxidative type 2 fibers; aging muscle lacks this capacity; exercise produces only an increase in the proportion of type 2 fibers (Silbermann et al). No such data are available in humans, but clinical observation suggests that with aging, the capacity of muscle to respond to intense, sustained exercise is diminished."

Additional differences between fast and slow muscles include the following: 1. The motor neuron in slow muscle is more easily excited than that in fast muscle, and so slow muscles are typically recruited first. As stated previously, the high oxidative capacity of slow muscle, coupled with the low myosin ATPase activity, helps reduce the susceptibility to fatigue in slow muscle. 2."

Instead, metabolic byproducts seem to be important factors in the onset of fatigue. Fatigue may potentially occur at any of the points involved in muscle contraction, from the brain to the muscle cells, as well as in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems that maintain energy supplies (i.e., fatty acids and glucose) and oxygen delivery to the exercising muscle.

The prime factors that cause the pain are swelling and inflammation from injury to muscle cells, most commonly near the myotendinous junction.

The smaller diameter of slow muscle fibers, and the higher capillary density in slow muscle, also helps slow muscle resist fatigue. Fast muscle, in contrast, is recruited for activities that require faster movements, more force, or both (see Fig. 12.15 ). Weightlifting, for example, can require a lot of power for short duration.

Blood flow and capillary density are greater in red muscle (slow-twitch muscle with high oxidative capacity) than in white muscle (fast-twitch muscle with low oxidative capacity).
