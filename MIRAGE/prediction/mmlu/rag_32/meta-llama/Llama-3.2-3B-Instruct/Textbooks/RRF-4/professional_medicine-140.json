Large local reactions from biting insects, such as mosquitoes, fleas, and flies, are a more common occurrence. The reaction appears urticarial and is caused by the salivary secretions deposited by the biting insect and does not represent an allergic response. Insect sting allergy may develop at any age and typically manifests after several uneventful stings. Although children are stung more frequently than adults, systemic allergic reactions occur in only about 1% of children and 3% of adults. Reactions in adults are generally more severe than in children and can result in death. Large local reactions to insect stings are more common in children, with an estimated incidence of 20% for children and 10% for adults."

Virtually all individuals with large local reactions have similar reactions with subsequent stings. Systemic reactions are IgE mediated and occur in 1% of children. They can be mild and nonlife-threatening with cutaneous symptoms only or life-threatening with respiratory, cardiovascular, or neurologic symptoms of anaphylaxis (see Chapter 81). Toxic reactions may result if a person receives a large number of stings (50 to 100). Symptoms include malaise, nausea, and emesis resulting from the toxic effects of the venom. Unusual reactions, such as vasculitis, nephrosis, neuritis, serum sickness, and encephalitis, rarely are associated with insect"

Type I hypersensitivity results from cross-linking of membrane-bound IgE on blood basophils or tissue mast cells by antigen. This cross-linking causes cells to degranulate, releasing substances such as histamine, leukotrienes, and eosinophil chemotactic factor, which induce anaphylaxis, asthma, hay fever, or urticaria (hives) in affected individuals (Figure 55\u20135). A severe type I hypersensitivity reaction such as systemic anaphylaxis (eg, from insect envenomation, ingestion of certain foods, or drug hypersensitivity) requires immediate medical intervention. 2. Type II\u2014Type II hypersensitivity results from the formation of antigen-antibody complexes between foreign antigen and IgM or"

            "content": "This often-explosive, life-threatening reaction is characterized by significant hypotension (decreased blood pressure), decreased circulating blood volume (leaky vessels), and smooth muscle cells constriction in the bronchial tree. The individual has difficulty breathing and may exhibit a rash, as well as have nausea and vomiting. Symptoms of anaphylactic shock usually develop within 1 to 3 minutes, and immediate treatment with vasoconstric-tors such as epinephrine is required. The assessment of the activation of basophils in systemic anaphylactic reac-tions is still problematic because an assay for a specific cellular marker released by basophils (and not by other cells such as mast cells) has not yet been developed. After the signs or symptoms of the immediate hyper-sensitiviy reaction have been resolved, an affected indi-vidual may develop late-phase allergic reactions 6 to 24 hours later. The symptoms of these reactions may in-clude redness, persistent swelling of the skin, nasal"
