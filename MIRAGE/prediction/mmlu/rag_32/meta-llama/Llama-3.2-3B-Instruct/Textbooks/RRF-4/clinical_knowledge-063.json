Systemic Sclerosis is known to have a female-to-male ratio of 3:1.\\n\\nOption B: If telangiectasia are seen this clinches the diagnosis - This is not entirely true. While telangiectasia is a common feature of SSc, particularly in CREST syndrome, its presence alone is not sufficient for a definitive diagnosis.\\n\\nOption C: Arachnodactyly is a feature of the disease - This is true. Arachnodactyly, or finger lengthening, is a characteristic feature of SSc, particularly in the limited form of the disease.\\n\\nOption D: Patients have a beaked shaped nose and waxy skin - This is not a typical feature of SSc. SSc is known for causing skin thickening and tightening, but a beaked-shaped nose is more commonly associated with other conditions, such as Marfan syndrome.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.

Although inflammatory infiltrates in the affected skin typically are sparse, they include activated CD4+ TH2 cells. Several cytokines, including IL-13 produced by TH2 cells and TGF-\u03b2 produced by macrophages and other cell types, stimulate synthesis of collagen and extracellular matrix proteins (e.g., fibronectin) in fibroblasts.

Raynaud phenomenon, caused by episodic vasoconstriction of the arteries and arterioles of the extremities, is seen in virtually all patients and precedes other symptoms in 70% of cases. Progressive collagen deposition in the skin leads to increasing stiffness, especially of the hands, with eventually complete immobilization of the joints.

The disease is characterized serologically by high titers of antibodies to U1 ribonucleoprotein. Typically, it presents with synovitis of the fingers, Raynaud phenomenon, and mild myositis. Renal involvement is modest, and there is a favorable response to corticosteroids, at least in the short term. Because these clinical features are shared with other diseases, mixed connective tissue disease may not be a distinct entity, and in fact it may evolve over time into classic SLE or systemic sclerosis. However, progression to other autoimmune disorders is not universal, and there may be a form of mixed connective tissue disease that is distinct from other autoimmune diseases. Serious complications of mixed connective tissue disease include pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease, and renal disease."

LT-\u03b1 can substitute for CD40 ligand in macrophage activation C. TNFR-I activation is antagonized by activated TH1 cells D. Macrophages are sensitized to IFN-\u03b3 by small amounts of bacterial LPS 11.6 Short Answer: How do M2 macrophages stimulate collagen production in order to promote tissue repair? 11.7 Multiple Choice: Which of the following is not true concerning type 3 responses? A. The primary innate effector cells are neutrophils, which are recruited by CXCL8 and CXCL2 and have an increased output due to G-CSF and GM-CSF B. At homeostasis, TH17 cells are present almost exclusively in the intestinal mucosa C. IL-17 is the central cytokine D. IL-22 is produced to induce antimicrobial peptide production and epithelial cell proliferation and shedding of natural killer cells"

            "content": "Virtually all patients have ANAs that react with a variety of nuclear antigens (see Table 5.11 ). Two ANAs are strongly associated with systemic sclerosis. One directed against DNA topoisomerase I (anti-Scl 70) is highly specific and is associated with a greater likelihood of pulmonary fibrosis and peripheral vascular disease. The other, an anticentromere antibody, is associated with a higher likelihood of CREST syndrome. Patients with this syndrome have relatively limited skin disease, often confined to fingers, forearms and face, and subcutaneous calcifications. Involvement of the viscera, including esophageal lesions, pulmonary hypertension, and biliary cirrhosis, may not occur at all or occur late. In general, these patients live longer than those with systemic sclerosis with diffuse visceral involvement from the outset. http://ebooksmedicine.net"

Goodin Demyelinating disorders are immune-mediated conditions charac-terized by preferential destruction of central nervous system (CNS) 458 myelin. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is spared, and most patients have no evidence of an associated systemic illness. Multiple sclerosis, the most common disease in this category, is second only to trauma as a cause of neurologic disability beginning in early to middle adulthood."

Nonetheless, transitional cases sharing the clinical and pathologic attributes of more than one disease are encountered in any large clinical practice and pathologic collection. The subjects of multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica and other primarily inflammatory myelitidies are also discussed in Chap. 35. Some of the main points are recapitulated here."
