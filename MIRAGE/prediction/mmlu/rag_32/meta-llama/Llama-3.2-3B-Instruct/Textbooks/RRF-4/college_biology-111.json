    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the fundamental concept of evolution and its relationship with genetic variation and heritability. Evolution is the process by which populations of living organisms adapt and change over time, and it is driven by the accumulation of genetic variation within a population. For evolution to occur, there must be genetic variation within a population, which can arise from various sources such as mutation, genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection. The key point is that evolution occurs at the population level, not at the individual level. Therefore, the frequencies of alleles in a population's gene pool must change over successive generations for evolution to have occurred. This change in allele frequencies can be due to various mechanisms such as mutation, genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection. The other options do not accurately describe the necessary condition for evolution to occur. Option B is incorrect because allele frequencies change over generations, not during an individual's lifetime. Option C is incorrect because allele frequencies do not remain constant over successive generations. Option D is incorrect because allele frequencies can change within an individual's lifetime due to various mechanisms such as mutation and genetic drift. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

When we compare the three domains of the living world, we can begin to see which genes are common to all of them and must therefore have been present in the cell that was ancestral to all present-day living things, and which genes are peculiar to a single branch in the tree of life. To explain the findings, however, we need to consider a little more closely how new genes arise and genomes evolve. The raw material of evolution is the DNA sequence that already exists: there is no natural mechanism for making long stretches of new random sequence. In this sense, no gene is ever entirely new. Innovation can, however, occur in several ways (Figure 1\u201319): 1. Intragenic mutation: an existing gene can be randomly modified by changes in its DNA sequence, through various types of error that occur mainly in the process of DNA replication. 2."

Most of the genetic changes that occur result simply from failures in the normal mechanisms by which genomes are copied or repaired when damaged, although the movement of transposable DNA elements (discussed below) also plays an important part. As we will explain in Chapter 5, the mechanisms that maintain DNA sequences are remarkably precise\u2014but they are not perfect. DNA sequences are inherited with such extraordinary fidelity that typically, along a given line of descent, only about one nucleotide pair in a thousand is randomly changed in the germ line every million years.

During replication, the two strands of DNA separate, and each strand creates a new complementary strand by precise base-pair matching (Fig. 15-3). The two, new, double-stranded DNAs carry the same genetic information, which can then be passed on to two daughter cells. Proofread-ing mechanisms ensure that the replication process occurs in a highly accurate manner.

For example, when an insect or amphibian undergoes metamorphosis\u2014the transition from larva to adult\u2014almost every part of the body is transformed.

One attractive theory to explain such an end result imagines that different, mildly deleterious mutations occur quickly in both copies of a duplicated gene set. For example, one copy might lose expression in a particular tissue as a result of a regulatory mutation, while the other copy loses expression in a second tissue. Following such an occurrence, both gene copies would be required to provide the full range of functions that were once supplied by a single gene; hence, both copies would now be protected from loss through inactivating mutations.

In fact, genome comparisons strongly suggest that both lineage-specific gene loss and horizontal gene transfer, in some cases between evolutionarily distant species, have been major factors of evolution, at least among prokaryotes.

At the beginning of this chapter, we compared development with an orchestral performance. There are many players, and each must do the right thing at the right time; yet there is no leader or conductor to set the tempo and coordinate the timing of all the different events. Each developmental process must thus occur at an appropriate rate, tuned by evolution to fit with the timing of other processes in the embryo or in the environment. The control of timing is one of the most important problems in developmental biology, but also one of the least understood."

Though these sequences are conserved strongly, they are not conserved perfectly, and when the version in one species is compared with that in another they are generally found to have drifted apart by a small amount corresponding simply to the time elapsed since the last common ancestor. In a small proportion of cases, however, one sees signs of a sudden evolutionary spurt. For example, some DNA sequences that have been highly conserved in other mammalian species are found to have accumulated nucleotide changes exceptionally rapidly during the 6 million years of human evolution since we diverged from the chimpanzees. These human accelerated regions (HARs) are thought to reflect functions that have been especially important in making us different in some useful way."

In many cases, a whole cluster of genes is closely related to similar clusters present elsewhere in the genome, suggesting that genes have been duplicated in linked groups rather than as isolated individuals. According to one hypothesis, at an early stage in the evolution of the vertebrates, the entire genome underwent duplication twice in succession, giving rise to four copies of every gene. The precise course of vertebrate genome evolution remains uncertain, because many further evolutionary changes have occurred since these ancient events. Figure 1\u201340 Drosophila melanogaster."

            "content": "Virtually all cells contain mobile genetic elements (known informally as \u201cjumping genes\u201d). As explained in Chapter 4, over evolutionary time scales, they have had a profound effect on the shaping of modern genomes. For example, nearly half of the human genome can be traced to these elements (see Figure 4\u201362). Over time, random mutation has altered their nucleotide sequences, and, as a result, only a few of the many copies of these elements in our DNA are still active and capable of movement. The remainder are molecular fossils whose existence provides striking clues to our evolutionary history."

Aging is seen as the random degeneration resulting from the inability of evolution to prevent it, i.e., the nonadaptive consequence of evolutionary \u201cneglect.\u201d This conclusion is supported by studies that restricted reproduction to later life in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, thus permitting natural selection to operate on later life traits and leading to an increase in longevity. There are some species of plants and animals that do not appear to age, or at least they undergo an extremely slow aging process, termed \u201cnegligible senescence.\u201d The mortality rates of these species are relatively constant with time, and they do not display any obvious phenotypic changes of aging. Conversely, there are some living things that undergo programmed death immediately after reproduction, such as annual plants and semelparous animals (Fig. 94e-4). However, many other living things from yeast to humans undergo a gradual aging process leading to death that is surprisingly similar at"
