    },
    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of early-successional plant communities and the characteristics that define them. Early-successional plant communities are those that are found in areas that have been disturbed or cleared of vegetation, such as after a forest fire or a hurricane. These communities are characterized by a lack of diversity and a high rate of species turnover. They are often dominated by pioneer species that are able to colonize the area quickly and take advantage of the resources available. With this understanding, let's evaluate the options provided.\\n\\nOption A: High niche divergence among co-occurring species. Early-successional plant communities are actually characterized by low niche divergence among co-occurring species. The pioneer species in these communities often have similar ecological niches and compete with each other for resources. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\\n\\nOption B: High ratios of primary production to standing-crop biomass. Early-successional plant communities are typically characterized by a low ratio of primary production to standing-crop biomass. The pioneer species in these communities are often small and produce little biomass, and the community as a whole is still in the process of establishing itself. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\\n\\nOption C: High frequency of K-selected species. Early-successional plant communities are actually characterized by a high frequency of R-selected species. R-selected species are able to rapidly colonize and reproduce, and are often able to outcompete K-selected species for resources. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\\n\\nOption D: High detrital biomass. Early-successional plant communities are indeed characterized by a high detrital biomass. The pioneer species in these communities are often able to quickly colonize and decompose the organic matter in the disturbed area, creating a high amount of detrital biomass. Therefore, option D is correct.\\n\\nAnswer: D\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",
