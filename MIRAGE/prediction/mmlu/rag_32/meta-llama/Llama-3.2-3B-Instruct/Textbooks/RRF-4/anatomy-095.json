Additionally, they provide innervation through somatic afferent fibers to the mediastinal pleura, fibrous pericardium, and parietal layer of serous pericardium. The phrenic nerves pass through the thorax and innervate the diaphragm, parietal pleura, and pericardium. Therefore, the correct answer should include these structures.

            "content": "The collective output of the respiratory control center to motor neurons located in the anterior horn of the spinal column controls the muscles of respiration, and this output determines the automatic rhythmic pattern of respiration. Motor neurons located in the cervical region of the spinal column control the activity of the diaphragm through the phrenic nerves, whereas other motor neurons located in the thoracic region of the spine control the intercostal muscles and the accessory muscles of respiration."

            "content": "The preganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic nervous system leave the central nervous system (CNS) in the third, seventh, ninth, and tenth cranial nerves as well as the second and third sacral nerves, while the preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous system exit the spinal cord between the first thoracic and the second lumbar segments (Fig. 454-1). These are thinly myelinated. The postganglionic neurons, located in ganglia outside the CNS, give rise to the postganglionic unmyelinated autonomic nerves that innervate organs and tissues throughout the body. Responses to sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation are frequently antagonistic (Table 454-1), reflecting highly coordinated interactions within the CNS; the resultant changes in parasympathetic and sympathetic activity provide more precise control of autonomic responses than could be achieved by the modulation of a single system."

The NTS is the site of the central projections of the chemoreceptors and baroreceptors. Stimulation of the NTS inhibits sympathetic nerve outflow to the peripheral blood vessels (depressor effect), whereas lesions of"

            "content": "In the clinic In cases of phrenic nerve palsy, diaphragmatic paralysis ensues, which is manifested by the elevation of the diaphragm muscle on the affected side (Fig. 3.36). The most important cause of the phrenic nerve palsy that should never be overlooked is malignant infiltration of the nerve by lung cancer. Other causes include postviral neuropathy (in particular, related to varicella zoster virus), trauma, iatrogenic injury during thoracic surgery, and degenerative changes in the cervical spine with compression of the C3\u2013C5 nerve roots. Most patients with unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis are asymptomatic and require no treatment. Some may report shortness of breath, particularly on exertion. Bilateral paralysis of the diaphragm is rare but can cause significant respiratory distress."
