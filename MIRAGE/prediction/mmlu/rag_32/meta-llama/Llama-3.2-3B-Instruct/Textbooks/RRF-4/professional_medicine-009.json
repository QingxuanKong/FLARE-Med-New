    "question": "A 42-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination 1 week after he passed a renal calculus. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the calculus showed calcium as the primary cation. Physical examination today shows no abnormalities. A 24-hour collection of urine shows increased calcium excretion. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",

    "answer": "B",
    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient, we need to consider the type of kidney stone and the patient's urinary profile. The patient has passed a renal calculus with calcium as the primary cation, and the 24-hour urine collection shows increased calcium excretion. This suggests that the patient has hypercalciuria, which can contribute to the formation of calcium stones. Given the presence of hypercalciuria, the most effective treatment would be to reduce calcium absorption in the intestine and increase calcium excretion in the urine. Thiazide diuretics are a commonly used class of medications for this purpose. They work by inhibiting the Na+ \u2013Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor in the distal convoluted tubule, which increases calcium reabsorption and reduces urinary calcium excretion. However, in this case, the patient has hypercalciuria, so we want to decrease calcium excretion, not increase it. Therefore, thiazides are not the best choice. Instead, we can consider other options such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, Na+ \u2013K + \u20132Cl\u2212 symport inhibitors, or osmotic diuretics. However, the most appropriate choice would be a Na+ \u2013K + \u20132Cl\u2212 symport inhibitor, such as amiloran or triamterene, which can increase sodium and potassium excretion while reducing calcium reabsorption and increasing calcium excretion in the urine. This would help to reduce the risk of future stone formation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

            "content": "Clinically, the most striking defect is an inability to maximally concentrate the urine, due to reduced collecting duct responsiveness to arginine vasopressin and defective transport of sodium and chloride in the loop of Henle. Reductions in both glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow can occur, both in acute and in prolonged hypercalcemia. Eventually, uncontrolled hypercalcemia leads to severe tubulointerstitial damage and overt renal failure. Abdominal x-rays may demonstrate nephrocalcinosis as well as nephrolithiasis, the latter due to the hypercalciuria that often accompanies hypercalcemia. Treatment consists of reducing the serum calcium concentration toward normal and correcting the primary abnormality of calcium metabolism (Chap. 424). Renal dysfunction of acute hypercalcemia may be completely reversible. Gradual progressive renal insufficiency related to chronic hypercalcemia, however, may not improve even with correction of the calcium disorder."

While the term hypercalciuria is often used, there is no widely accepted cutoff that distinguishes between normal and abnormal urine calcium excretion. In fact, the relation between urine calcium and stone risk appears to be continuous; thus the use of an arbitrary threshold should be avoided. Levels of urine calcium excretion are higher in individuals with a history of nephrolithiasis; however, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Greater gastrointestinal calcium absorption is one important contributor, and greater bone turnover (with a resultant reduction in bone mineral density) may be another. Primary renal calcium loss, with lower serum calcium concentrations and elevated serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) (and a normal 25-hydroxy vitamin D level), is rare."

The PTH level should be measured if indicated by high-normal or elevated serum and urine calcium concentrations. Often, 25-hydroxy vitamin D is measured in concert with PTH to investigate the possible role of secondarily elevated PTH levels in the setting of vitamin D insufficiency. The urinalysis, including examination of the sediment, can provide useful information. In individuals with asymptomatic residual renal stones, red and white blood cells are frequently present in urine. If there is concern about the possibility of an infection, a urine culture should be performed. The sediment may also reveal crystals (Fig. 342-1), which may help identify the stone type and also provide prognostic information, as crystalluria is a strong risk factor for new stone formation."

Renal biopsies of stone formers have revealed calcium phosphate in the renal interstitium. It is hypothesized that this calcium phosphate extends down to the papilla and erodes through the papillary epithelium, where it provides a site for deposition of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate crystals. The majority of calcium oxalate stones grow on calcium phosphate at the tip of the renal papilla (Randall\u2019s plaque). Thus, the process of stone formation may begin years before a clinically detectable stone is identified. The processes involved in interstitial deposition are under active investigation. Risk factors for nephrolithiasis can be categorized as dietary, nondietary, or urinary.These risk factors vary by stone type and by clinical characteristics."

In addition to the medical costs associated with nephrolithiasis, this condition also has a substantial economic impact, as those affected are often of working age. Once an individual has had a stone, the prevention of a recurrence is essential. Published recurrence rates vary by the definitions and diagnostic methods used. Some reports have relied on symptomatic events, while others have been based on imaging. Most experts agree that radiographic evidence of a second stone should be considered to represent a recurrence, even if the stone has not yet caused symptoms."

            "content": "Table 14.5 , 50% of patients who develop calcium stones have hypercalciuria that is not associated with hypercalcemia. Most patients in this group absorb calcium from the gut in excessive amounts (absorptive hypercalciuria) and promptly excrete it in the urine, and some have a primary renal defect of calcium reabsorption (renal hypercalciuria). The causes of the other types of renal stones are better understood. Magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) stones almost always occur in individuals with a persistently alkaline urine resulting from UTIs. In particular, infections with urea-splitting bacteria, such as Proteus vulgaris and staphylococci, predispose individuals to urolithiasis. Moreover, bacteria may serve as particulate nidi for the formation of any kind of stone. In avitaminosis A, desquamated cells from the metaplastic epithelium of the collecting system act as nidi."

            "content": "APPROACH TO THE PATIENT: At present, there are no widely accepted, evidence-based guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of nephrolithiasis. However, there are standard approaches to patients with acute and chronic presentations that can reasonably guide the clinical evaluation. It typically requires weeks to months (and often much longer) for a kidney stone to grow to a clinically detectable size. Although the passage of a stone is a dramatic event, stone formation and growth are characteristically clinically silent. A stone can remain asymptomatic in the kidney for years or even decades before signs (e.g., hematuria) or symptoms (e.g., pain) become apparent. Thus, it is important to remember that the onset of symptoms, typically attributable to a stone moving into the ureter, does not provide insight into when the stone actually formed. The factors that induce stone movement are unknown."

            "content": "All of the North American patients reported have been African American. The disease usually presents in childhood and continues throughout the patient\u2019s life. The calcific masses are typically painless and grow at variable rates, sometimes becoming large and bulky. The masses are often located near major joints but remain extracapsular. Joint range of motion is not usually restricted unless the tumors are very large. Complications include compression of neural structures and ulceration of the overlying skin with drainage of chalky fluid and risk of secondary infection. Small deposits not detected by standard radiographs may be detected by 99mTc bone scanning. The most common laboratory findings are hyperphosphatemia and elevated serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels. Serum calcium, parathyroid hormone, and ALP levels are usually normal. Renal function is also usually normal. Urine calcium and phosphate excretions are low, and calcium and phosphate balances are positive."

            "content": "Individual susceptibility is important in the pathogenesis, because some patients are treated with calcium carbonate and alkali regimens without developing the syndrome. One variable is the fractional calcium absorption as a function of calcium intake. Some individuals absorb a high fraction of calcium, even with intakes \u22652 g of elemental calcium per day, instead of reducing calcium absorption with high intake, as occurs in most normal individuals. Resultant mild hypercalcemia after meals in such patients is postulated to contribute to the generation of alkalosis. Development of hypercalcemia causes increased sodium excretion and some depletion of total-body water. These phenomena and perhaps some suppression of endogenous PTH secretion due to mild hypercalcemia lead to increased bicarbonate resorption and to alkalosis in the face of continued calcium carbonate ingestion. Alkalosis per se selectively enhances calcium resorption in the distal nephron, thus aggravating the"

            "content": "Most hypouricemia results from increased renal uric acid excretion. The finding of normal amounts of uric acid in a 24-h urine collection from an individual with hypouricemia is evidence for a renal cause. Medications with uricosuric properties (Table 431e-1) include aspirin (at doses >2.0 g/d), losartan, fenofibrate, x-ray contrast materials, and 431e-5 glyceryl guaiacolate. Total parenteral hyperalimentation can also cause hypouricemia, possibly a result of the high glycine content of the infusion formula. Other causes of increased urate clearance include conditions such as neoplastic disease, hepatic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and inappropriate secretion of vasopressin; defects in renal tubular transport such as primary Fanconi syndrome and Fanconi syndromes caused by Wilson\u2019s disease, cystinosis, multiple myeloma, and heavy metal toxicity; and isolated congenital defects in the bidirectional transport of uric acid. Hypouricemia can be a familial disorder that is generally"

Although there are numerous medical conditions (hyperparathyroidism, hypervitaminosis D, sarcoidosis, malignancies, etc) that cause hypercalciuria, many patients with such stones exhibit a defect in proximal tubular Ca2+ reabsorption. This can be treated with thiazide diuretics, which enhance Ca2+ reabsorption in the DCT and thus reduce the urinary Ca2+ concentration. Fluid intake should be increased, but salt intake must be reduced, since excess dietary NaCl will overwhelm the hypocalciuric effect of thiazides. Dietary Ca2+ should not be restricted, as this can lead to negative total body Ca2+ balance. Calcium stones may also be caused by increased intestinal absorption of Ca2+, or they may be idiopathic. In these situations, thiazides are also effective but should be used as adjunctive therapy with other measures."
