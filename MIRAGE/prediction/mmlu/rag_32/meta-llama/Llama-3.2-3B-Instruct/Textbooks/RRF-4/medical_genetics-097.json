Inheritance is usually not Mendelian, however, and it is difficult to distinguish the role of genes and environmental factors. Adoptees more closely resemble their biologic than adoptive parents with respect to obesity, providing strong support for genetic influences. Likewise, identical twins have very similar BMIs whether reared together or apart, and their BMIs are much more strongly correlated than those of dizygotic twins. These genetic effects appear to relate to both energy intake and expenditure. Currently, identified genetic variants, both common and rare, account for less than 5% of the variance of body weight."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have elucidated numerous disease-associated loci and are providing novel insights into the allelic architecture of complex traits.

Additional evidence for a genetic basis has emerged from recent large-scale genome-wide association studies, which have identified dozens of susceptibility loci called diabetogenic genes. Unlike type 1 diabetes, however, the disease is not linked to genes involved in immune tolerance and regulation (e.g., HLA, CTLA4).

There are approximately 10 million common SNPs within a human genome consisting of 3 billion base pairs. As a rule, GWAS identify only common variants, namely, those with a frequency of more than 5% in the general population. Overall, several themes have emerged from GWAS in RA. First, the non-MHC loci identified as risk alleles for RA have only a modest US: 0.7-1.3% Brazil: 0.4-1.4% Jamaica: 1.9-2.2% UK: 0.8-1.1% South Africa: 2.5-3.6% Lesotho: 1.7-4.5% Saudi Arabia: 0.1-0.2% Java: 0.1-0.2% Liberia: 2-3% Norway: 0.4% Spain: 0.2-0.8% Greece: 0.3-1% Bulgaria: 0.2-0.6% Iraq: 0.4-1.5% India: 0.1-0.4% Japan: 0.2-0.3% Hong Kong: 0.1-0.5%"

            "content": "allelic association, linkaGe Disequilibrium, anD HaPlotyPes Allelic association refers to a situation in which the frequency of an allele is significantly increased or decreased in individuals affected by a particular disease in comparison to controls. Linkage and association differ in several aspects. Genetic linkage is demonstrable in families or sibships. Association studies, on the other hand, compare a population of affected individuals with a control population. Association studies can be performed as case-control studies that include unrelated affected individuals and matched controls or as family-based studies that compare the frequencies of alleles transmitted or not transmitted to affected children."

            "content": "Special structural regions of DNA, including telomeres (chromosome ends) and centromeres (chromosome \u201ctethers\u201d) Importantly, many genetic variations (polymorphisms) associated with diseases are located in non\u2013proteincoding regions of the genome. Thus, variation in gene regulation may prove to be more important in disease causation than structural changes in specific proteins. Another surprise that emerged from genome sequencing is that any two humans are typically >99.5% DNA-identical (and are 99% sequence-identical with chimpanzees)! Thus, individual variation, including differential susceptibility to diseases and environmental exposures, is encoded in <0.5% of our DNA (importantly, this still represents about 15 million base pairs). The two most common forms of DNA variation in the human genome are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs)."
