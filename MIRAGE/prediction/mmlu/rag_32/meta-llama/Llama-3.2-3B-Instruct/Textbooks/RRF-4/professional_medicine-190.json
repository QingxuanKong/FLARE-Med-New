The patient is a 68-year-old female with a 3-day history of worsening fever and headache. 2. The lumbar puncture reveals a protein level of 89 mg/dL, which is elevated (above the reference range of 15-45 mg/dL). 3. There is pleocytosis, indicating an increased white blood cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Given these findings, we can consider the potential causes of bacterial meningitis, as the elevated protein and pleocytosis suggest an infectious etiology. The options provided are: A. Clostridium perfringens B. Haemophilus influenzae C. Rhinovirus D. Streptococcus pneumoniae The most likely etiologic organism is D. Streptococcus pneumoniae, as it is a common cause of bacterial meningitis in adults, particularly in those over 60 years old. The elevated protein and pleocytosis in the CSF are consistent with bacterial meningitis. The other options are less likely: A. Clostridium perfringens is a cause of food poisoning and gas gangrene, but it is not typically associated with bacterial meningitis. C. Rhinovirus is a common cause of viral infections, such as the common cold and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but it is not typically associated with bacterial meningitis. B. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is a cause of bacterial meningitis, but it is more commonly seen in children under 5 years old. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D. Streptococcus pneumoniae.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

The CSF is usually under increased pressure and contains between 50 and 500 white cells per cubic millimeter, rarely more. Early in the disease there may be a more-or-less-equal number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes, but after several days lymphocytes predominate in the majority of cases. In some cases, however, M. tuberculosis causes a persistent polymorphonuclear pleocytosis, the other usual causes of this CSF formula being Nocardia, Aspergillus, and Actinomyces (Peacock). The protein content of the CSF is always elevated, between 100 and 200 mg/dL in most cases, but much higher if the flow of CSF is blocked around the spinal cord. Glucose is reduced to levels below 40 mg/dL, but rarely to the very low values observed in conventional bacterial meningitis; the glucose falls slowly and a reduction may become manifest only several days"

The spinal fluid is often sterile, but on occasion an organism is cultured. If the patient is stuporous or comatose, there is a risk associated with performing a lumbar puncture, and one should proceed first with imaging procedures. By imaging, one can see the ear or sinus lesions or bone erosion. The meninges around the empyema enhance and the collection of pus can be visualized more dependably with MRI. Empyema that follows meningitis in children tends to localize on the undersurface of the temporal lobe and may require coronal views to be well visualized."

Blood cultures are positive in more than half of cases, but direct aspiration of the abscess at surgery is often required for a micro-biologic diagnosis. Lumbar puncture is only required if encephalopathy or other clinical signs raise the question of associated meningitis, a feature that is found in <25% of cases. The level of the puncture should be planned to minimize the risk of meningitis due to passage of the needle through infected tissue. A high cervical tap is sometimes the safest approach. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities in epidural and subdural abscess consist of pleocytosis with a preponderance of polymorphonuclear cells, an elevated protein level, and a reduced glucose level, but the responsible organism is not cultured unless there is associated meningitis."

Plasma Na+ concentration was initially 129 meq/L, decreasing within 3 days to 118\u2013120 meq/L despite fluid restriction to 1 L/d. A chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a right 2.8 \u00d7 1.6 cm infrahilar mass and postobstructive pneumonia. The patient was an active smoker. Past medical history was notable for laryngeal carcinoma treated 15 years prior with radiation therapy, renal cell carcinoma, peripheral vascular disease, and hypothyroidism. On review of systems, he denied headache, nausea, and vomiting. He had chronic hip pain, managed with acetaminophen with codeine. Other medications included cilostazol, amoxicillin/clavulanate, digoxin, diltiazem, and thyroxine. He was euvolemic on examination, with no lymphadenopathy and a normal chest examination.

            "content": "Spinal Epidural Abscess Spinal epidural abscess presents with midline back or neck pain, fever, and progressive limb weakness. Prompt recognition of this distinctive process may prevent permanent sequelae. Aching pain is almost always present, either over the spine or in a radicular pattern. The duration of pain prior to presentation is generally \u22642 weeks but may on occasion be several months or longer. Fever is typically but not invariably present, accompanied by elevated white blood cell count, sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein. As the abscess expands, further spinal cord damage results from venous congestion and thrombosis. Once weakness and other signs of myelopathy appear, progression may be rapid and irreversible. A more chronic sterile granulomatous form of abscess is also known, usually after treatment of an acute epidural infection."

The CSF glucose level is usually normal (in contrast to the low CSF glucose level in mumps), with a normal or slightly elevated protein concentration. Partially treated bacterial meningitis may be particularly difficult to exclude in some instances. Enteroviral meningitis is more common in summer and fall in temperate climates, while viral meningitis of other etiologies is more common in winter and spring. Symptoms ordinarily resolve within a week, although CSF abnormalities can persist for several weeks. Enteroviral meningitis is often more severe in adults than in children. Neurologic sequelae are rare, and most patients have an excellent prognosis."

In neonates, common organisms are Escherichia coli and group B streptococci. In adolescents and young adults, Neisseria meningitidis is the most common pathogen; in older adults, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Listeria monocytogenes are more common. Across ages, patients typically show systemic signs of infection along with meningeal irritation and neurologic impairment, including headache, photophobia, irritability, clouding of consciousness, and neck stiffness. Lumbar puncture reveals an increased pressure; examination of the CSF shows abundant neutrophils, elevated protein, and reduced glucose. Untreated pyogenic meningitis is often fatal, but with prompt diagnosis and administration of antibiotics, most patients can be saved."

            "content": "The most important laboratory aids are the electrodiagnostic studies and CSF examination. The CSF is under normal pressure and is acellular or contains only a few lymphocytes in all but 10 percent of patients; in the latter group, 10 to 50 cells (rarely more) per cubic millimeter, predominantly lymphocytes, may be found. The number of cells then decreases in a matter of 2 to 3 days; persistent pleocytosis suggests an alternative or additional process producing aseptic meningitis such as neoplastic infiltration, HIV, sarcoidosis, or Lyme infection. We have been unable to relate pleocytosis in the spinal fluid with any of the clinical features of GBS or to the severity of illness. The protein content is usually normal during the first few days of illness, but then it rises, reaching a peak in 4 to 6 weeks and persisting at a variably elevated level for many weeks. The increase in CSF protein is probably a reflection of widespread inflammatory disease of the nerve roots, but high values"

She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet. Her father survived a \u201cheart attack\u201d at age 55, and an uncle died of some cardiac disease at age 60. On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy. Assuming that a diagno-sis of stable effort angina is correct, what medical treatment should be implemented?"
