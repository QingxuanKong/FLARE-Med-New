Muscle contraction occurs when the actin and myosin filaments slide past each other, resulting in the shortening of the muscle. This process is regulated by the binding of myosin heads to actin binding sites on the actin filaments. When the nerve stimulus is present, it triggers the release of calcium ions, which bind to troponin and tropomyosin, causing them to shift and expose the actin binding sites. Myosin heads then bind to these sites and pull the actin filaments, resulting in muscle contraction. When the nerve stimulus is removed, the calcium ions are pumped back into the sarcoplasm, and troponin and tropomyosin return to their original position, covering the actin binding sites. This prevents myosin heads from binding to the actin filaments, resulting in muscle relaxation. Therefore, the correct answer is A. the nerve stimulus is removed.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Nevertheless, when the polar regions contract, the equatorial region elongates and regains its sensitivity. Conversely, when a muscle relaxes (\u03b1 motor neuron activity drops) and thus elongates (if its ends are being pulled), a concurrent decrease in \u03b3 motor neuron activity allows the intrafusal fibers to relax (and thus elongate) as well and thereby prevent the tension on the central portion of the intrafusal fiber from reaching a level at which firing of the afferent fibers is saturated. Thus the \u03b3 motor neuron system allows the muscle spindle to operate over a wide range of muscle lengths while retaining high sensitivity to small changes in length."

The soleus muscle of the leg, in contrast, requires 90 msec to reach peak tension in response to an action potential, and then it relaxes slowly. The gastrocnemius muscle requires an intermediate time to reach peak tension (40 msec) because of the presence of both fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscle fibers in this muscle. The difference in speed of contraction between fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscles is correlated with myosin ATPase activity (see Fig. 12.14B ), which in turn reflects the type of myosin present in the muscle fiber (Fig. 12.15 Table 12.1 ).

By following the stretch reflex arc, it is possible to see that changes in its activity act to oppose changes in muscle length from a particular equilibrium point. For example, if the muscle\u2019s length is increased, there will be an increase in firing by group Ia and group II fibers, which excites homonymous \u03b1 motor neurons and leads to contraction of the muscle and reversal of the stretch. Similarly, passive shortening of the muscle unloads the spindles and leads to a decrease in the excitatory drive to the motor neurons and thus relaxation of the muscle. So how are humans able to rotate their joints? It is partly because the \u03b3 motor neurons are coactivated during a movement and thereby shift the equilibrium point of the spindle and partly because the gain or strength of the reflex is low enough that other input to the motor neuron can override the stretch reflex."

The result is that the reflex arc is a stretch-induced contraction of the muscle that does not require input from high centers in the brain.

The two basic types of skeletal muscle fibers are distinguished on the basis of their speed of contraction (i.e., fast-twitch versus slow-twitch). The difference in speed of contraction is attributed to the expression of different myosin isoforms that differ in myosin ATPase activity.
