    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To determine the first point of entry of water at the roots of a monocot plant, we need to understand the structure and function of the root system. In monocot roots, water enters through the root cap, which is a specialized region at the tip of the root. The root cap is composed of cells that are highly specialized for water uptake and transport. The root cap cells are surrounded by a specialized layer called the endodermis, which acts as a barrier to prevent water loss and regulate the movement of ions and water into the root. The pericycle is a layer of cells that surrounds the endodermis and is involved in root growth and development. The Casparian strip is a specialized region of the endodermis that regulates the movement of water and ions across the root. The question asks for the first point of entry of water, which is the root cap. The root cap is the first point of contact between the root and the soil, and it is responsible for absorbing water and nutrients from the soil. Therefore, the correct answer is A. root cap.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

Although the fluid in the plant cell wall contains more solutes than does the water in the plant\u2019s external milieu (for example, soil), it is still hypotonic in comparison with the cell interior. This osmotic imbalance causes the cell to develop a large internal hydrostatic pressure, or turgor pressure, which pushes outward on the cell wall, just as an inner tube pushes outward on a tire. The turgor pressure increases just to the point where the cell is in osmotic equilibrium, with no net influx of water despite the salt imbalance. The turgor pressure generated in this way may reach 10 or more atmospheres, about five times that in the average car tire. This pressure is vital to plants because it is the main driving force for cell expansion during growth, and it provides much of the mechanical rigidity of living plant tissues.

A cell can rapidly redistribute transporters by controlling the traffic of vesicles containing them. The auxin efflux transporters, for example, normally recycle between intracellular vesicles and the plasma membrane. A cell can redistribute these transporters on its surface by inhibiting their endocytosis in one domain of the plasma membrane, causing the transporters to accumulate there. One example occurs in the root, where gravity influences the direction of growth. The auxin efflux transporters are normally distributed symmetrically in the cap cells of the root. Within minutes of a change in the direction of the gravity vector, however, the efflux transporters redistribute to one side of the cells, so that auxin is pumped out toward the side of the root pointing downward. Because auxin inhibits root-cell elongation, this redirection"

It is on the fourth point that plant development differs radically: plant cells are unable to migrate or move independently through the embryo because each one is contained within a cell wall, through which it is cemented to its neighbors, as discussed in Chapter 19."

It works by stimulating the ubiquitylation and degradation of repressor proteins that block the transcription of auxin target genes in unstimulated cells (Figure 15\u201371B and C).

It consists of a collection of flattened, membrane-enclosed compartments called cisternae, that somewhat resemble a stack of pita breads. Each Golgi stack typically consists of four to six cisternae (Figure 13\u201326), although some unicellular flagellates can have more than 20. In animal cells, tubular connections between corresponding cisternae link many stacks, thus forming a single complex, which is usually located near the cell nucleus and close to the centrosome (Figure 13\u201327A). This localization depends on microtubules. If microtubules are experimentally depolymerized, the Golgi apparatus reorganizes into individual stacks that are found throughout the cytoplasm, adjacent to ER exit sites. Some cells, including most plant cells, have hundreds of individual Golgi stacks dispersed throughout the cytoplasm where they are typically"

            "content": "Chloroplasts have an extra membrane-enclosed compartment, the thylakoid. Many chloroplast proteins, including the protein subunits of the photosynthetic system and of the ATP synthase (discussed in Chapter 14), are located in the thylakoid membrane. Like the precursors of some mitochondrial proteins, the precursors of these proteins are translocated from the cytosol to their final destination in two steps. First, they pass across the double membrane into the matrix space (called the stroma in chloroplasts), and then they either integrate into the thylakoid membrane or translocate into the thylakoid space (Figure 12\u201326A). The precursors of these proteins have a hydrophobic thylakoid signal sequence following the N-terminal chloroplast signal sequence. After the N-terminal signal sequence has been used to import the protein into the stroma, a stromal signal peptidase removes it, unmasking the thylakoid signal sequence that initiates transport"

Chloroplasts Capture Energy from Sunlight and Use It to Fix Carbon We can group the reactions that occur during photosynthesis in chloroplasts into two broad categories: 1. The photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions (also called the \u201clight reactions\u201d) occur in two large protein complexes, called reaction centers, embedded in the thylakoid membrane. A photon (a quantum of light) knocks an electron out of the green pigment molecule chlorophyll in the first reaction center, creating a positively charged chlorophyll ion. This electron then moves along an electron-transport chain and through a sec-ond reaction center in much the same way that an electron moves along the respiratory chain in mitochondria. During this electron-transport process, H+ is pumped across the thylakoid membrane, and the resulting LEAF upper epidermis lower epidermis nucleus cytosol vacuole air space cell wall"
