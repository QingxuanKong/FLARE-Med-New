He has had recurrent cervical lymphadenitis and pneumonia since infancy. Two years ago, a culture from an abscess in the cervical region grew Staphylococcus aureus. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F). Examination shows a tender, erythematous, edematous left ankle; there is point tenderness over the medial malleolus. A bone scan shows increased uptake in the left lower tibial metaphysis. Culture of bone aspirate grows Serratia marcescens. Nitroblue tetrazolium test shows no color change. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism for these findings?",

    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of recurrent cervical lymphadenitis and pneumonia, which suggests an immunodeficiency. The fact that the patient is a 5-year-old boy and has had these recurrent infections since infancy points towards a congenital immunodeficiency. The patient's current presentation of fever and painful swelling of the left ankle, with a bone scan showing increased uptake in the left lower tibial metaphysis, suggests osteomyelitis. The culture of bone aspirate grows Serratia marcescens, which is a opportunistic pathogen that typically affects individuals with immunodeficiency. The nitroblue tetrazolium test shows no color change, indicating impaired phagocytic oxidative metabolism. This suggests that the patient's immune system is unable to produce reactive oxygen species, which is a key function of phagocytic cells such as neutrophils. This is consistent with a diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a congenital immunodeficiency that affects the ability of phagocytic cells to kill certain bacteria and fungi.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

On examination he had significant swelling of the ankle with a subcutaneous hematoma. He was unable to stand on tiptoe on the right leg, and in the prone position a palpable defect was demonstrated within the calcaneal tendon. A diagnosis of calcaneal tendon rupture was made. This patient has a typical history of ruptured calcaneal tendon and the clinical findings support this. Magnetic resonance imaging was carried out and confirmed the diagnosis (eFig. 6.144). The patient underwent an operative repair. The tendon healed well, though the patient has not gone back to playing squash."

Joint fluid that exhibits the characteristics of pyogenic infection may not reveal bacterial pathogens, even in the absence of preceding antibiotic therapy, because of the bacteriostatic effects of synovial fluid.

Plain radiographs typically add little information to the physical findings. Radiographs may show swelling of the joint capsule, a widened joint space, and displacement of adjacent normal fat lines. Radionuclide scans are of limited use, although magnetic resonance imaging or technetium-99m bone scans may be helpful to exclude concurrent bone infection or deep abscesses.

Patients with high spinal cord injuries at or above the level of the fifth thoracic vertebra may experience sudden extreme elevation of blood pressure, an 10Stage 1Observable pressure related alteration of intact skin whose indicators as compared to the adjacent or opposite area of the body may include changes in one or more of the following: skin temperature (warmth or coolness), tissue consistency (firm or boggy feel), and/or sensation (pain, itching).

He was a golf instructor and indicated that the blisters had erupted shortly after the golfing season began. He did not have recent exposure to common skin irritants. He had partial complex seizure disorder that had begun ~3 years earlier after a head injury. The patient had been taking phenytoin (his only medication) since the onset of the seizure disorder. He admitted to an average weekly ethanol intake of ~18 12-oz cans of beer. The patient\u2019s urine was reddish orange. Cultures obtained from skin lesions failed to grow organisms. A 24-hour urine collection showed elevated uroporphyrin (1,000 mg; normal, <27 mg). The most likely diagnosis is: A. acute intermittent porphyria. B. congenital erythropoietic porphyria. C. erythropoietic protoporphyria. D. hereditary coproporphyria. E. porphyria cutanea tarda."

Surgeons become involved when the patient develops infectious or obstructive complications.The nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction test is used to diagnose CGD. Normal neutrophils can reduce this com-pound, while neutrophils from affected patients do not, facili-tating the diagnosis via a colorimetric test. Clinically, patients develop recurrent infections such as pneumonia, lymphadenitis, hepatic abscess, and osteomyelitis. Organisms most commonly responsible are S. aureus, Aspergillus, Klebsiella, Serratia, or Candida. When CGD patients require surgery, a preoperative pulmonary function test should be considered since they are predisposed to obstructive and restrictive lung disease. Wound complications, mainly infection, are common. Sutures should be removed as late as possible since the wounds heal slowly. Abscess drains should be left in place for a prolonged period until the infection is completely"

Radiographs of the ankle showed osteopenia, widened medullary spaces, thin cortices, and coarse trabeculations\u2014 findings that are largely the result of bone marrow expansion. The joint space was preserved. Specimens of bone from three patients revealed osteomalacia, osteopenia, and microfractures. Increased numbers of osteoblasts as well as increased foci of bone resorption were present on the bone surface. Iron staining was found in the bone trabeculae, in osteoid, and in the cement line. Synovium showed hyperplasia of lining cells, which contained deposits of hemosiderin. This arthropathy was considered to be related to the underlying bone pathology. The role of iron overload or abnormal bone metabolism in the pathogenesis of this arthropathy is not known. The arthropathy was treated with analgesics and splints. Patients also received transfusions to decrease"
