Temperature: According to Document [15], temperature can affect enzyme activity, with a decrease in reaction velocity at higher temperatures due to temperature-induced denaturation of the enzyme. Therefore, temperature is a factor that can affect enzyme activity.\\n\\nB. pH: As mentioned in Document [15], pH can also affect enzyme activity, particularly the ionization state of certain amino acid groups on the enzyme. Changes in pH can alter the enzyme's conformation and, consequently, its activity. So, pH is a factor that can impact enzyme activity.\\n\\nC. The presence of certain metal ions: Document [15] also mentions that metal ions can affect enzyme activity. Certain metal ions can bind to the enzyme, altering its shape and, consequently, its activity. Therefore, the presence of certain metal ions is a factor that can affect enzyme activity.\\n\\nGiven the above analysis, the correct answer is D.

Different enzymes show different responses to changes in substrate concentration, temperature, and pH. This section describes factors that influence the reaction velocity of enzymes. Enzymic responses to these factors give us valuable clues as to how enzymes function in living cells (that is, in vivo). A. Substrate concentration 1. Maximal velocity: The rate or velocity of a reaction (v) is the number of substrate molecules converted to product per unit time. Velocity is usually expressed as \u00b5mol of product formed per minute. The rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction increases with substrate concentration until a maximal velocity (Vmax) is reached (Fig. 5.6). The leveling off of the reaction rate at high substrate concentrations reflects the saturation with substrate of all available binding sites on the enzyme molecules present. 2."

These enzymes are almost always composed of multiple subunits, and the regulatory (allosteric) site that binds the effector is distinct from the substrate-binding site and may be located on a subunit that is not itself catalytic. Effectors that inhibit enzyme activity are termed negative effectors, whereas those that increase enzyme activity are called positive effectors. Positive and negative effectors can affect the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate (K0.5), modify the maximal catalytic activity of the enzyme (Vmax), or both (Fig. 5.16).

Enzymes subject to regulation of synthesis are often those that are needed at only one stage of development or under selected physiologic conditions. For example, elevated levels of insulin as a result of high blood glucose levels cause an increase in the synthesis of key enzymes involved in glucose metabolism (see p. 105).

Active site chemistry The active site is not a passive receptacle for binding the substrate but, rather, is a complex molecular machine employing a diversity of chemical mechanisms to facilitate the conversion of substrate to product. A number of factors are responsible for the catalytic efficiency of enzymes, including the following examples. 1. Transition-state stabilization: The active site often acts as a flexible molecular template that binds the substrate and initiates its conversion to the transition state, a structure in which the bonds are not like those in the substrate or the product (see T* at the top of the curve in Fig. 5.4). By stabilizing the transition state, the enzyme greatly increases the concentration of the reactive intermediate that can be converted to product and, thus, accelerates the reaction.

But the discovery of linkage in studies of a few enzymes in the 1950s, followed by an extensive analysis of allosteric mechanisms in proteins in the early 1960s, had a revolutionary effect on our understanding of biology. Since molecule X in these examples binds at a site on the enzyme that is distinct from the site where catalysis occurs, it need not have any chemical relationship to the substrate that binds at the active site. Moreover, as we have just seen, for enzymes that are regulated in this way, molecule X can either turn the enzyme on (positive regulation) or turn it off (negative regulation). By such a mechanism, allosteric proteins serve as general switches that, in principle, can allow one molecule in a cell to affect the fate of any other."

C. pH 1. pH effect on active site ionization: The concentration of protons ([H+]) affects reaction velocity in several ways. First, the catalytic process usually requires that the enzyme and substrate have specific chemical groups in either an ionized or unionized state in order to interact. For example, catalytic activity may require that an amino group of the enzyme be in the protonated form (\u2212NH3+). Because this group is deprotonated at alkaline pH, the rate of the reaction declines. 2."

Reaction order: When [S] is much less (<<) than Km, the velocity of the reaction is approximately proportional to the substrate concentration (Fig. 5.10). The rate of reaction is then said to be first order with respect to substrate. When [S] is much greater (>>) than Km, the velocity is constant and equal to Vmax.

            "content": "Figure 3\u201359 enzyme activity versus the concentration of inhibitory ligand for single-subunit and multisubunit allosteric enzymes. For an enzyme with a single subunit (red line), a drop from 90% enzyme activity to 10% activity (indicated by the two dots on the curve) requires a 100-fold increase in the concentration of inhibitor. The enzyme activity is calculated from the simple equilibrium relationship K = [IP]/[I][P], where P is active protein, I is inhibitor, and IP is the inactive protein bound to inhibitor. An identical curve applies to any simple binding interaction between two molecules, A and B. In contrast, a multisubunit allosteric enzyme can respond in a switchlike manner to a change in ligand concentration: the steep response is caused by a cooperative binding of the ligand molecules, as explained in Figure 3\u201360. Here, the green line represents the idealized result expected for the cooperative binding of two inhibitory ligand molecules to an allosteric enzyme with two"

            "content": "products, it does not change the equilibrium of the reaction. Most enzymes show Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and a plot of the initial reaction velocity (vo) against substrate concentration ([S]) has a hyperbolic shape similar to the oxygen-dissociation curve of myoglobin. A Lineweaver-Burk plot of 1/v and 1/[S] allows determination of Vmax (maximal velocity) and Km (Michaelis constant, which reflects affinity for substrate). Any substance that can decrease the velocity of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is called an inhibitor. The two most common types of reversible inhibition are competitive (which increases the apparent Km) and noncompetitive (which decreases the apparent Vmax). In contrast, the multisubunit allosteric enzymes show a sigmoidal curve similar in shape to the oxygen-dissociation curve of hemoglobin. They typically catalyze the committed step of a pathway. Allosteric enzymes are regulated by molecules called effectors that bind noncovalently at a site other than the active"

            "content": "Regulation occurs at many levels. At one level, the cell controls how many molecules of each enzyme it makes by regulating the expression of the gene that encodes that enzyme (discussed in Chapter 7). The cell also controls enzymatic activities by confining sets of enzymes to particular subcellular compartments, whether by enclosing them in a distinct membrane-bounded compartment (discussed in Chapters 12 and 14) or by concentrating them on a protein scaffold (see Figure 3\u201377). As will be explained later in this chapter, enzymes are also covalently modified to control their activity. The rate of protein destruction by targeted proteolysis represents yet another important regulatory mechanism (see Figure 6\u201386). But the most general process that adjusts reaction rates operates through a direct, reversible change in the activity of an enzyme in response to the specific small molecules that it binds."
