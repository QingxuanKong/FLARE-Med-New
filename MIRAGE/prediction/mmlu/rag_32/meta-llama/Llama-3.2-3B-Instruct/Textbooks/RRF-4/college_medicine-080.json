The original RNA strand produces a transmembrane protein that facilitates potassium entry into muscle cells. The modification changes a single nucleotide (C to C) in the sequence. This change does not alter the reading frame of the genetic code, so it is likely to produce a protein with the same size and function as the original protein. Therefore, the most likely outcome of this modification is that the cell will produce a protein that is similar in size and function to the original protein. The modified protein is likely to be functional, but it may have a slightly different amino acid sequence due to the change in the nucleotide sequence.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Instead, it results from an RNA cleavage reaction that is catalyzed by additional proteins while the transcript is elongating (see Figure 6\u201334). A cell can control the site of this cleavage so as to change the C-terminus of the resultant protein. In the simplest cases, one protein variant is simply a truncated version of the other; in many other cases, however, the alternative cleavage and polyadenylation sites lie within intron sequences and the pattern of splicing is thereby altered. This process can produce two closely related proteins differing only in the amino acid sequences at their C-terminal ends. Close analysis of RNAs produced from the human genome in a variety of cell types (see Figure 7\u20133) indicate that as many as 50% of human protein-coding genes produce mRNA species that differ at their site of polyadenylation."

It seems unnecessarily complex, however, to consider most of the protein variants produced by alternative RNA splicing as being derived from overlapping genes. A more sensible alternative is to modify the original definition to count a DNA sequence that is transcribed as a single unit and encodes one set of closely related polypeptide chains (protein isoforms) as a single protein-coding gene. This definition also accommodates those DNA sequences that encode protein variants produced by post-transcriptional processes other than RNA splicing, such as transcript cleavage and RNA editing (discussed below).

The structure of the double-stranded RNA specifies whether the mRNA is to be edited, and if so, where the edit should be made. An especially important example of A-to-I editing takes place in the mRNA that codes for a transmitter-gated ion channel in the brain.

In addition, some tRNA precursors (from both bacteria and eukaryotes) contain introns that must be spliced out. This splicing reaction differs chemically from pre-mRNA splicing; rather than generating a lariat intermediate, tRNA splicing uses a cutand-paste mechanism that is catalyzed by proteins (Figure 6\u201352).

In Chapter 6, we will describe this code in detail in the course of elaborating the process of gene expression, through which a cell converts the nucleotide sequence of a gene first into the nucleotide sequence of an RNA molecule, and then into the amino acid sequence of a protein."

            "content": "The Structure of DNA Provides a mechanism for Heredity The discovery of the structure of DNA immediately suggested answers to the two most fundamental questions about heredity. First, how could the information to specify an organism be carried in a chemical form? And second, how could this information be duplicated and copied from generation to generation? The answer to the first question came from the realization that DNA is a linear polymer of four different kinds of monomer, strung out in a defined sequence like the letters of a document written in an alphabetic script. The answer to the second question came from the double-stranded nature of the structure: because each strand of DNA contains a sequence of nucleotides that is exactly complementary to the nucleotide sequence of its partner strand, each strand can act as a template, or mold, for the synthesis of a new complementary strand. In other words, if we designate the two DNA strands as S and S\u02b9, strand 0.34 nm"

            "content": "RNA molecules have distinctive structures that can also give them other specialized chemical capabilities. Being single-stranded, their backbone is flexible, so that the polymer chain can bend back on itself to allow one part of the molecule to form weak bonds with another part of the same molecule. This occurs when segments of the sequence are locally complementary: a ...GGGG... segment, for example, will tend to associate with a ...CCCC... segment. These types of internal associations can cause an RNA chain to fold up into a specific shape that is dictated by its sequence (Figure 1\u20136). The shape of the RNA molecule, in turn, may enable it to recognize other molecules by binding to them selectively\u2014and even, in certain cases, to catalyze chemical changes in the molecules that are bound. In fact, some chemical reactions catalyzed by RNA molecules are crucial for several of the most ancient and fundamental processes in living cells, and it has been suggested that an extensive catalysis"

            "content": "Figure 8\u201331 The synthesis of cDNA. Total mRNA is extracted from a particular tissue, and the enzyme reverse transcriptase (see Figure 5\u201362) is used to produce DNA copies (cDNA) of the mRNA molecules. For simplicity, the copying of just one of these mRNAs into cDNA is illustrated. A short oligonucleotide complementary to the poly-A tail at the 3\u02b9 end of the mRNA (discussed in Chapter 6) is first hybridized to the RNA to act as a primer for the reverse transcriptase, which then copies the RNA into a complementary DNA chain, thereby forming a DNA\u2013RNA hybrid helix. Treating the DNA\u2013RNA hybrid with a specialized nuclease (RNAse H) that attacks only the RNA produces nicks and gaps in the RNA strand. DNA polymerase then copies the remaining single-stranded cDNA into double-stranded cDNA. Because DNA polymerase can synthesize through the bound RNA molecules, the RNA fragment that is base-paired to the 3\u02b9 end of the first DNA strand usually acts as the primer for the second strand synthesis,"
