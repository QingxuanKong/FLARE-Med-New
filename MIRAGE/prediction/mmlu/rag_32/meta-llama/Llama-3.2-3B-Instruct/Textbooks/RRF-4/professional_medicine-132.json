The infant is fed cow-milk formula and a variety of strained fruits and vegetables. The physical examination reveals a slightly distended abdomen, dry mucous membranes, and normal temperature. The key to this question is to consider the symptoms and the diet of the infant. The infant is being fed cow-milk formula, which contains lactose, a sugar that is not fully digested in infants. The symptoms of persistent watery diarrhea and abdominal distension are consistent with lactose intolerance. The infant's age and recent history of enteritis and dehydration also support this diagnosis. The other options, such as fructose intolerance, magnesium deficiency, and regional enteritis, are less likely given the infant's diet and symptoms.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

The patient reported prior episodes of a similar nature following ingestion of a significant amount of dairy products.

The physical symptoms suggest a deficiency in an enzyme responsible for carbohydrate degradation.

Breastfeeding or formula feeding should be maintained and not delayed for more than 24 hours. Patients with more severe diarrhea require continued supervision. The volume of ORS ingested should equal the volume of stool losses. If stool volume cannot be measured, an intake of 10 to 15 mL of ORS/kg/hr is appropriate. Parenteral nutrition (PN) is necessary when enteral feeding is inadequate to meet the nutritional needs of a patient. Enteral nutrition is always preferred because it is more physiologic, less expensive, and associated with fewer complications. Fewer complications are expected if at least some nutrition can be provided enterally."

            "content": "enteropatHogenic e. coli EPEC causes disease primarily in young children, including neonates. The first E. coli pathotype recognized as an agent of diarrheal disease, EPEC was responsible for outbreaks of infantile diarrhea (including some outbreaks in hospital nurseries) in industrialized countries in the 1940s and 1950s. At present, EPEC infection is an uncommon cause of diarrhea in developed countries but is an important cause of diarrhea (both sporadic and epidemic) among infants in developing countries. Breast-feeding diminishes the incidence of EPEC infection. Rapid person-to-person spread may occur. Upon colonization of the small bowel, symptoms develop after a brief incubation period (1 or 2 days). Initial localized adherence via bundle-forming pili leads to a characteristic effacement of microvilli, with the formation of cuplike, actin-rich pedestals mediated by factors in the LEE. Diarrhea production is a complex and regulated process in which host cell modulation by a type"

The degree of dehydration dictates the urgency of the situation and the volume of fluid needed for rehydration. Table 33-5 summarizes the clinical features that are present with varying degrees of dehydration. A patient with mild dehydration has few clinical signs or symptoms. The history may describe decreased intake but Infants and young children Thirsty, alert; restless Thirsty; restless or lethargic; Drowsy; limp, cold, sweaty, cyanotic extremities; may irritable be comatose Older children Thirsty, alert Thirsty, alert (usually) Usually conscious (but at reduced level), apprehensive; cold, sweaty, cyanotic extremities; wrinkled skin on fingers and toes; muscle cramps Respirations Normal Deep, may be rapid Deep and rapid Data from World Health Organization."

Iduronidase D. Mannosidase E. Sulfatase Correct answer = E. Degradation of glycoproteins follows the rule: last on, first off. Because sulfation is the last step in the synthesis of this sequence, a sulfatase is required for the next step in the degradation of the compound shown. 4.3. An 8-month-old boy with coarse facial features, skeletal abnormalities, and delays in both growth and development is diagnosed with I-cell disease based on his presentation and on histologic and biochemical testing. I-Cell disease is characterized by: A. decreased production of cell surface O-linked glycoproteins. B. elevated levels of acid hydrolases in the blood. C. inability to N-glycosylate proteins. D. increased synthesis of proteoglycans. E. oligosaccharides in the urine."

His wife reports that he had been in his normal state of health until 3 days ago when he developed a fever and a productive cough. Dur-ing the last 24 hours he has complained of a headache and is increasingly confused. His wife reports that his medical history is significant only for hypertension, for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, and that he is allergic to amoxicillin. She says that he developed a rash many years ago when prescribed amoxicillin for bron-chitis. In the emergency department, the man is febrile (38.7\u00b0C [101.7\u00b0F]), hypotensive (90/54 mmHg), tachypneic (36/min), and tachycardic (110/min). He has no signs of meningismus but is oriented only to person. A stat chest x-ray shows a left lower lung consolidation consistent with pneumonia. A CT scan is not concerning for lesions or elevated intracranial pressure. The plan is to start empiric antibiotics and perform a"
