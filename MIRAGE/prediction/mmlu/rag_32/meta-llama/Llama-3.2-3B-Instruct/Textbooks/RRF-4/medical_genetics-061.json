Duodenal atresia - This is a congenital anomaly of the duodenum and can be associated with various genetic syndromes, including Down syndrome. Therefore, it may raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality.\\n\\nB. Holoprosencephaly - This is a severe congenital anomaly of the brain and is often associated with trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) or other chromosomal abnormalities. Thus, it may raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality.\\n\\nC. Hydrops fetalis - This condition is characterized by the accumulation of fluid in two or more fetal compartments, often associated with chromosomal abnormalities, such as trisomy 16 or 18, or other genetic disorders. Therefore, it may raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality.\\n\\nD. Monozygotic twins - This is a type of dizygotic twinning, which is not associated with chromosomal abnormalities. Dizygotic twins have two separate eggs fertilized by two separate sperm, and their chromosomes are normal. Therefore, this finding would not raise suspicion of a chromosome abnormality.\\n\\nThe correct answer is D. Monozygotic twins.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Generally, chromosomal microarray analysis is recommended as the irst-line test. Importantly, a fetus with one abnormality may have others that are less likely to be detected sonographically but that greatly afect the prognosis. Aneuploidy screening-including cell-free DNA-is not recommended if a major abnormality has been identified. The fetal risk cannot be normalized with a normal screening result, not merely because screening results can be falsely negative, but also because major anomalies confer risk for genetic syndromes not identiied through screening tests."
