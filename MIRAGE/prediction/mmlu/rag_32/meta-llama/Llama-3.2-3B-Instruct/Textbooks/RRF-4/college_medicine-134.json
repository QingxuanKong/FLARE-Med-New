Transmembrane proteins typically have hydrophobic amino acid residues on their exterior and hydrophilic residues on their interior. Hydrophobic residues are more likely to be found in the transmembrane domain, while hydrophilic residues are more likely to be found in the cytosolic or extracellular domains. Among the given amino acids, glycine, tyrosine, arginine, and isoleucine, we need to identify which one is most hydrophobic. Glycine is the smallest amino acid and has a neutral side chain, making it somewhat hydrophobic but not as hydrophobic as other amino acids. Tyrosine has a hydroxyl group and a phenyl ring, making it hydrophilic. Arginine is a basic amino acid with a guanidinium group, making it hydrophilic. Isoleucine is a branched amino acid with a hydrophobic side chain. Considering the hydrophobicity of the amino acids, isoleucine is the most hydrophobic among the options. Therefore, it is most likely to be inside the transmembrane domain.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

As a consequence, it is often possible to engineer cells to produce just the cytosolic or extracellular domains of these proteins as water-soluble molecules. This approach has been invaluable for studying the structure and function of these domains, especially the domains of transmembrane receptor proteins (discussed in Chapter 15). A transmembrane \u03b1 helix, even in a single-pass membrane protein, however, often does more than just anchor the protein to the lipid bilayer. Many single-pass membrane proteins form homoor heterodimers that are held together by noncovalent, but strong and highly specific, interactions between the two transmembrane \u03b1 helices; the sequence of the hydrophobic amino acids of these helices contains the information that directs the protein\u2013protein interaction."

This reflects both the asymmetric manner in which it is inserted into the lipid bilayer in the ER during its biosynthesis (discussed in Chapter 12) and the different functions of its cytosolic and noncytosolic domains. These domains are separated by the membrane-spanning segments of the polypeptide chain, which contact the hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer and are composed largely of amino acids with nonpolar side chains. Because the peptide bonds themselves are polar and because water is absent, all peptide bonds in the bilayer are driven to form hydrogen bonds with one another. The hydrogen-bonding between peptide bonds is maximized if the polypeptide chain forms a regular \u03b1 helix as it crosses the bilayer, and this is how most membrane-spanning segments of polypeptide chains traverse the bilayer (Figure 10\u201319)."

Why, then, are these shielded helices nevertheless composed primarily of hydrophobic amino acids? The answer lies in the way in which multi-pass proteins are integrated into the membrane during their biosynthesis. As we discuss in Chapter 12, transmembrane \u03b1 helices are inserted into the lipid bilayer sequentially by a protein translocator. After leaving the translocator, each helix is transiently surrounded by lipids, which requires that the helix be hydrophobic. It is only as the protein folds up into its final structure that contacts are made between adjacent helices, and protein\u2013protein contacts replace some of the protein\u2013lipid contacts (Figure 10\u201322)."

            "content": "Cytokine receptors can be grouped into five general families based on similarities in their extracellular amino acid sequences and conserved structural domains. The immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily represents a large number of cell-surface and secreted proteins. The IL-1 receptors (type 1, type 2) are examples of cytokine receptors with extracellular Ig domains. The hallmark of the hematopoietic growth factor (type 1) receptor family is that the extracellular regions of each receptor contain two conserved motifs. One motif, located at the N terminus, is rich in cysteine residues. The other motif is located at the C terminus proximal to the transmembrane region and comprises five amino acid residues, Outcome determined by balance of signals"

The transmembrane regions of each chain have unusual acidic or basic residues as shown. Lower panel: the transmembrane regions of the various TcR subunits are represented in cross-section. it is thought that one of the positive charges, from a lysine (K) of the \u03b1 chain, interacts with the two negative charges of aspartic acid (d) of the cd3\u03b4:\u03b5 dimer, while the other positive charge, of arginine (R),"

Thus, the protein asymmetry observed in cell membranes seems not to be an inherent property of the proteins, but instead results solely from the process by which proteins are inserted into the ER membrane from the cytosol. Figure 12\u201344 Integration of a double-pass transmembrane protein with an internal signal sequence into the ER membrane. in this protein, an internal er signal sequence acts as a start-transfer signal (as in figure 12\u201343) and initiates the transfer of the C-terminal part of the protein. at some point after a stop-transfer sequence has entered the translocator, the translocator discharges the sequence laterally into the membrane."

            "content": "Whereas the lipid bilayer determines the basic structure of biological membranes, proteins are responsible for most membrane functions, serving as specific receptors, enzymes, transporters, and so on. Transmembrane proteins extend across the lipid bilayer. Some of these membrane proteins are single-pass proteins, in which the polypeptide chain crosses the bilayer as a single \u03b1 helix. Others are multipass proteins, in which the polypeptide chain crosses the bilayer multiple times\u2014either as a series of \u03b1 helices or as a \u03b2 sheet rolled up into the shape of a barrel. All proteins responsible for the transport of ions and other small water-soluble molecules through the membrane are multipass proteins. Some membrane proteins do not span the bilayer but instead are attached to either side of the membrane: some are attached to the cytosolic side by an amphipathic a helix on the protein surface or by the covalent attachment of one or more lipid chains, others are attached to the noncytosolic"

Peptides eluted from two different Mhc class i molecules are shown in the upper and lower panels, respectively. The anchor residues (green) differ for peptides that bind different allelic variants of Mhc class i molecules but are similar for all peptides that bind to the same Mhc molecule. The anchor residues that bind a particular Mhc molecule need not be identical, but are always related: for example, phenylalanine (f) and tyrosine (Y) are both aromatic amino acids, whereas valine (V), leucine (L), and isoleucine (i) are all large hydrophobic amino acids. Peptides also bind to Mhc class i molecules through their amino (blue) and carboxy (red) termini."
