The Doppler shift is the change in frequency of a wave in relation to an observer moving relative to the source of the wave. The correct variables that must be known to determine the Doppler shift are the speed of sound in the medium (I) and the frequency of the emitted sound (IV). The time of interaction between the sound source and detector (II) is not directly involved in calculating the Doppler shift, and the distance between the source and detector (III) is also not necessary. The Doppler shift is a function of the relative motion between the source and observer, so the distance and time are not required.

A decibel (dB) is equal to 20 times the logarithm of the ratio of the sound pressure required to achieve threshold in the patient to the sound pressure required to achieve threshold in a normal-hearing person. Therefore, a change of 6 dB represents doubling of sound pressure, and a change of 20 dB represents a tenfold change in sound pressure. Loudness, which depends on the frequency, intensity, and duration of a sound, doubles with approximately each 10-dB increase in sound pressure level. Pitch, on the other hand, does not directly correlate with frequency. The perception of pitch changes slowly in the low and high frequencies. In the middle tones, which are important for human speech, pitch varies more rapidly with changes in frequency."

If the tone is much more than 1 kHz, a single fiber cannot discharge with every cycle, but phase locking can also occur for sounds with periods shorter than the absolute refractory period of the afferent fiber. This allows the CNS to detect higher frequency information from the activity of a population of afferent fibers, each of which discharges in phase with the stimulus and which, as a group, signal the frequency of the stimulus (see Fig. 8.22B ). This observation is the basis of the frequency theory of hearing. For still higher frequencies (>5000 Hz), the place theory dominates: the CNS interprets sounds that activate afferent fibers supplying hair cells near the base of the cochlea as being of high frequency. Thus both the place and the frequency theories are necessary to explain the frequency coding of sound (duplex theory) across the entire range from 20 to 20,000 Hz."

A sound of specified frequency causes displacement of a relatively long segment of the basilar membrane, but the region of maximal displacement is narrow. The point of maximal displacement of the basilar membrane is specified for a given frequency of sound and is the morphologic basis of frequency discrimination. High-frequency sounds cause maximal vibration of the basilar membrane near the base of the cochlea; low-frequency sounds cause maximal displacement nearer the apex. Amplitude discrimination (i.e., perception of sound intensity or loudness) depends on the degree of displacement of the basilar membrane at any given frequency range. Thus, coding acoustic information into nerve impulses depends on the vibratory pattern of the basilar membrane.

That said, comparisons of 3-D and conventional 2-D sonography for the diagnosis of most congenital anomalies have not demon strated better overall detection rates (Goncalves, 2006; Reddy, 2008). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecolo gists (2016) concludes that proof of a clinical advantage of 3-D S sonography for prenatal diagnosis is generally lacking. D hen sound waves strike a moving target, the frequency of the waves reflected back is shifted in proportion to the velocity and direction of that moving target-a phenomenon known as the Doppler sht. Because the magnitude and direction of the frequency shift depend on the relative motion of the moving target, Doppler can help evaluate low within blood vessels. The Doppler equation is shown in Figure 10-50."

            "content": "Ultrasonography of the body is widely used for all aspects of medicine. Ultrasound is a very high frequency sound wave (not electromagnetic radiation) generated by piezoelectric materials, such that a series of sound waves is produced. Importantly, the piezoelectric material can also receive the sound waves that bounce back from the internal organs. The sound waves are then interpreted by a powerful computer, and a real-time image is produced on the display panel. Developments in ultrasound technology, including the size of the probes and the frequency range, mean that a broad range of areas can now be scanned."

In some women-for example, those who are obese-external monitoring may be dificult (Brocato, 2017). With external monitoring, the fetal heart rate is detected through the maternal abdominal wall using the ultrasound Doppler principle. Ultrasound waves undergo a shift in frequency as they are reflected from moving fetal heart valves and from pulsatile blood ejected during systole (Chap. 10, p. 213). he unit consists of a transducer that emits ultrasound and a sensor to detect a shift in frequency of the reflected sound. The transducer is placed on the maternal abdomen at a site where fetal heart action is best detected. A coupling gel"

            "content": "Duration and Character The duration of a heart murmur depends on the length of time over which a pressure difference exists between two cardiac chambers, the left ventricle and the aorta, the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, or the great vessels. The magnitude and variability of this pressure difference, coupled with the geometry and compliance of the involved chambers or vessels, dictate the velocity of flow; the degree of turbulence; and the resulting frequency, configuration, and intensity of the murmur. The diastolic murmur of chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) is a blowing, high-frequency event, whereas the murmur of mitral stenosis (MS), indicative of the left atrial\u2013left ventricular diastolic pressure gradient, is a low-frequency event, heard as a rumbling sound with the bell of the stethoscope. The frequency components of a heart murmur may vary at different sites of auscultation. The coarse systolic murmur of aortic stenosis (AS) may sound higher pitched and more"
