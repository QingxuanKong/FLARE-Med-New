This is true, as the ulnar nerve spirals around the humerus in the spiral groove, and a fracture in this area can compress or damage the nerve (Document [1], [11]).\\n\\nOption B: The ulnar nerve does not give rise to a positive Phalen's sign. Phalen's sign is typically associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, which involves the median nerve (Document [22]).\\n\\nOption C: Ulnar nerve palsy leads to loss of sensation over the little finger and half of the ring finger, not the medial half of the hand and medial one and a half digits on both palmar and dorsal aspects of the hand. This is incorrect.\\n\\nOption D: The biceps muscle is actually supplied by the musculocutaneous nerve, which is part of the lateral cord of the brachial plexus (Document [28]). The ulnar nerve supplies the muscles of the forearm and hand, including the interossei and third and fourth lumbricals, but not the biceps.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\\nanswer_choice\": \"A\"",

Ulnar motor conduction studies will generally also distinguish between a radiculopathy (normal findings) and ulnar neuropathy (abnormal findings) and will often identify the site of an ulnar nerve lesion. The nerve is stimulated at several points along its course to determine whether the compound action potential recorded from a distal muscle that it supplies shows a marked alteration in size or area or a disproportionate change in latency, with stimulation at a particular site. The electrophysiologic findings thus permit a definitive diagnosis to be made and specific treatment instituted in circumstances where there is clinical ambiguity."

Delayed (\u201ctardive\u201d) ulnar palsy may occur many months or years after an injury to the elbow that had resulted in a cubitus valgus deformity of the joint. Because of the deformity, the nerve is stretched in its groove over the ulnar condyle and its superficial location renders it vulnerable to compression. A shallow ulnar groove, quite apart from abnormalities of the elbow joint, may expose the nerve to compressive injury from more innocuous situations such as prolonged resting of the arm on the side of a chair or even excessive flexion of the elbow. Anterior transposition of the ulnar nerve is a simple and effective form of treatment for these types of ulnar palsies. Compression of the nerve may occur just distal to the medial epicondyle, where it runs beneath the aponeurosis of the flexor carpi ulnaris (cubital"

The most frequent site of compression is at the elbow where the nerve passes superficially in the ulnar groove. Symptoms usually begin with tingling in the ulnar distribution, including the fourth and fifth digits of the hand (Fig. 463e-3B). Sensory symptoms may be worsened by elbow flexion due to increased pressure on the nerve, hence the tendency of patients to complain of increasing paresthesias at night when the arm is flexed at the elbow during sleep. Motor dysfunction can be disabling and involves most of the intrinsic hand muscles, limiting dexterity and strength of grasp and pinch. Etiologies of ulnar entrapment include trauma to the nerve (hitting the \u201cfunny bone\u201d), malpositioning during anesthesia for surgical procedures, and chronic arthritis of the elbow.

Compression of the nerve may occur just distal to the medial epicondyle, where it runs beneath the aponeurosis of the flexor carpi ulnaris (cubital tunnel). Flexion at the elbow causes a narrowing of the tunnel and constriction of the nerve. This type of ulnar palsy is treated by incising the aponeurotic arch between the olecranon and medial epicondyle. Yet another site of ulnar nerve compression is in the ulnar tunnel at the wrist. Prolonged pressure on the ulnar part of the palm may result in damage to the deep palmar branch of the ulnar nerve, causing weakness of small hand muscles but no sensory loss. This site is most often implicated in patients who hold tools or implements tightly in the hand for long periods (we have seen it in machinists and professional cake decorators).

The anastomosis can be demonstrated by obtaining a normal CMAP when stimulating the proximal median nerve and recording over ulnar innervated muscles.

The arm hangs at the side, internally rotated and extended at the elbow. Movements of the hand and forearm are unaffected. The prognosis for spontaneous recovery is generally good, although this may be incomplete. Injuries of the upper brachial plexus and spinal roots incurred at birth (termed in older literature as Erb-Duchenne palsy) usually persist throughout life."

            "content": "Infraclavicular Lesions Involving Cords of the Brachial Plexus (See Fig. 43-5) A lesion of the lateral cord causes weakness of the muscles supplied by the musculocutaneous nerve and the lateral root of the median nerve; it manifests mainly as a weakness of flexion and pronation of the forearm. The intrinsic muscles of the hand innervated by the medial root of the median nerve are spared. A lesion of the medial cord of the plexus causes weakness of muscles supplied by the medial root of the median nerve and the ulnar nerve. The effect is that of a combined median and ulnar nerve palsy. A lesion of the posterior cord results in weakness of the deltoid muscle, extensors of the elbow, wrist, and fingers, and sensory loss on the outer surface of the upper arm."

            "content": "The radial nerve may be compressed in the axilla (\u201ccrutch\u201d palsy), but more frequently at a lower point, where the nerve winds around the humerus (see Table 43-8); pressure palsies incurred during an alcoholic stupor and fractures of the humerus commonly injure the nerve at the site of injury. It is susceptible to lead intoxication and is frequently involved as part of brachial neuritis and mononeuritis multiplex."

Combinations of these lower cranial nerve palsies, which have a variety of eponymic designations (see Table 44-1) are caused by various tumors, both primary and metastatic, or by chronic inflammations or granulomas involving lymph nodes at the base of the skull. If there is no palatal weakness and no pharyngeal or palatal sensory loss, the lesion is below the origin of the pharyngeal branches, which leaves the vagus nerve high in the cervical region. The usual site of disease is then the mediastinum. The Eleventh, or Spinal Accessory, Nerve"
