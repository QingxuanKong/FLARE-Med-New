Over the past week, she has had nausea related to excess coughing. Over the past year, she has had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss. She has asthma treated with theophylline and inhaled \u03b2-adrenergic agonists and corticosteroids. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 44 years and drinks one alcoholic beverage daily. She appears thin. Examination shows a 2-cm, nontender lymph node in the right supraclavicular area. Examination shows no other abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows a large right lower lobe density. A CT scan of the chest shows a 7.5 x 7.5 x 6-cm right lower lobe mass with some scattered calcifications. The lesion abuts the posterior chest wall without clear invasion. There are right lower peritracheal, precarinal, right hilar, and subcarinal lymph nodes. There is a 1.5-cm mass in the right adrenal gland. A biopsy specimen of the lung mass is most likely to show which of the following?",

    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this question, let's analyze the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. The patient presents with a 5-month history of increasing shortness of breath, sore throat, and a cough productive of small amounts of white phlegm, as well as a 3.2-kg weight loss over the past year. The patient has a history of asthma and a 44-year smoking history. The physical examination reveals a 2-cm, nontender lymph node in the right supraclavicular area and a large right lower lobe density on chest X-ray with a 7.5 x 7.5 x 6-cm right lower lobe mass on CT scan showing scattered calcifications. The mass abuts the posterior chest wall without clear invasion and is associated with right lower peritracheal, precarinal, right hilar, and subcarinal lymph nodes, as well as a 1.5-cm mass in the right adrenal gland. These findings are suggestive of a lung mass with possible metastasis to the lymph nodes and adrenal gland. Given the patient's history of smoking and the presence of calcifications in the lung mass, the most likely diagnosis is non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). NSCLC is a type of lung cancer that is more common in smokers and can present with lymph node metastasis and adrenal gland involvement. Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that affects the lining of the lungs, but it is less likely given the presence of lymph node and adrenal gland metastasis. Metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast is also possible, but the patient's smoking history and the presence of calcifications in the lung mass make NSCLC more likely. Multiple endocrine neoplasia is a genetic disorder that can cause tumors in multiple endocrine glands, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

            "content": "A 69-year-old retired teacher presents with a 1-month history of palpitations, intermittent shortness of breath, and fatigue. She has a history of hypertension. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 122 beats/min (bpm) and signs of left ventricular hypertrophy. She is anticoagulated with warfarin and started on sustained-release metoprolol, 50 mg/d. After 7 days, her rhythm reverts to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, over the ensuing month, she continues to have intermittent palpita-tions and fatigue. Continuous ECG recording over a 48-hour period documents paroxysms of atrial fibrillation with heart rates of 88\u2013114 bpm. An echocardiogram shows a left ven-tricular ejection fraction of 38% (normal \u2265 60%) with no localized wall motion abnormality. At this stage, would you initiate treatment with an antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm, and if so, what drug would you choose?"

Focused History: KL reports that the rash first appeared a little over 2 weeks ago. It started out small but has gotten larger. She also thinks she is getting the flu because her muscles and joints ache (myalgia and arthralgia, respectively), and she has had a headache for the last few days. Upon questioning, KL reports that she and her husband took a camping trip through New England last month. Pertinent Findings: The physical examination is remarkable for the presence of a red, circular, flat lesion ~11 cm in size that resembles a bullseye (erythema migrans) (see image at right). KL also has a low-grade fever. Diagnosis: KL has Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of a tick in the genus Ixodes. Infected ticks are endemic in the Northeast region of the United States."

She received all standard childhood immunizations, but no additional treat-ment before travel, since her parents have returned to their native Nigeria frequently without medical consequences. Three days ago, the child was seen in an outpatient clinic and diagnosed with a viral syndrome.

This procedure may also be used to sample the alveolar space with bronchoalveolar lavage or to obtain nonsurgical lung biopsies. Blood testing may include assessment for hypercoagulable states in the setting of pulmonary vascular disease, serologic testing for infectious or rheumatologic disease, or assessment of inflammatory markers or leukocyte counts (e.g., eosinophils). Sputum evaluation for malignant cells or microorganisms may be appropriate. An echocardiogram to assess rightand left-sided heart function is often obtained. Finally, at times, a surgical lung biopsy is needed to diagnose certain diseases of the respiratory system. All of these studies will be guided by the preceding history, physical examination, pulmonary function testing, and chest imaging. Approach to the Patient with Disease of the Respiratory System"

Originally thought to derive from histiocytes because of the microscopic appear-ance of cultured tumor cells, these tumors likely originate from the fibroblast. MFHs are generally the most common soft tissue sarcoma of late adult life, although they are rare on the chest wall. The typical age at presentation is between age 50 and 70 years. Presentation is pain, with or without a palpable mass. Radiographically, a mass is usually evident, with destruction of surrounding tissue and bone. Treatment is wide resection with a margin of 4 cm or more and recon-struction. Over two-thirds of patients suffer from distant metastasis or local recurrence.4. Liposarcoma. Liposarcomas make up 15%"

A Doppler ultrasound scan revealed marked stenosis of the subclavian artery at the outer border of the rib with abnormal flow distal to the narrowing. Within this region of abnormal flow there was evidence of thrombus adherent to the vessel wall. This patient underwent surgical excision of the cervical rib and had no further symptoms. A 52-year-old man presented with headaches and shortness of breath. He also complained of coughing up small volumes of blood. Clinical examination revealed multiple dilated veins around the neck. A chest radiograph demonstrated an elevated diaphragm on the right and a tumor mass, which was believed to be a primary bronchogenic carcinoma. By observing the clinical findings and applying anatomical knowledge, the site of the tumor can be inferred."

Reticulonodular and nodular disease without cavitation can be seen, as can pleural effusions and hilar adenopathy. The most common CT findings include bilateral ground-glass opacity and airspace consolidation that is predominantly subpleural. Other CT findings include bronchial wall thickening, hyperinflation, interlobular septal thickening, lymph node enlargement, and pericardial and pleural effusions. Angiography may be used diagnostically and may show signs of vasculitis in the coronary, central nervous system, and peripheral vasculature. Treatment and Prognosis of EGPA Most patients diagnosed with EGPA have previously been diagnosed with asthma, rhinitis, and sinusitis, and have received treatment with inhaled or systemic corticosteroids."
