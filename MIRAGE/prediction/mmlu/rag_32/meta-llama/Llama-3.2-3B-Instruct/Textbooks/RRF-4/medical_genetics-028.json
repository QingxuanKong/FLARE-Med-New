Developmental epigenetics: This term refers to the study of epigenetic mechanisms that influence the development and growth of an organism. While this field may involve prenatal development, it is not specifically focused on maternal stress.\\n\\nB. Social epigenetics: This term refers to the study of how social factors, including environmental influences, affect gene expression and epigenetic marks. This field may involve maternal stress, but it is not the most specific term for the research in question.\\n\\nC. Fetal epigenetics: This term refers to the study of epigenetic mechanisms that occur during fetal development. Given that the research by Moshe Szyf and colleagues focuses on the epigenetic influences of prenatal maternal stress on the fetus, this term is a strong candidate.\\n\\nD. Maternal epigenetics: This term refers to the study of epigenetic mechanisms that occur in the mother. While maternal stress is the focus of the research, this term is not as specific as fetal epigenetics in describing the scope of the study.\\n\\nConsidering the context and definitions, the most accurate description of the research by Moshe Szyf and colleagues is fetal epigenetics, as it specifically examines the epigenetic influences of prenatal maternal stress on the fetus.\\n\\nanswer_choice\": \"C\"}}",

But such studies raise the possibility ofetal programming, that is, the fetal environment may lead to adverse adult health outcomes. Elucidation is limited by insuicient data on potential maternal and genetic predisposing factors and on the environment of the infant and child in relation to diet and activity. he science of epigenetics has provided some support for the possibility that perturbations of the maternal-fetal environment can adversely alter postdelivery events (Kitsiou-T zeli, 2017). Also possible are contributions of the maternal-child environment subsequent to birth (Gluck, 2009). These and other factors regarding fetal programming are discussed in Chapter 44 (p. 849)."

Examples of stressors are nutrient restriction, obesity, infection, and diabetes. Psychological duress can include racial discrimination, childhood stress, depression, or posttraumatic stress syndrome (Gillespie, 2017; Goldstein, 2017; Shaw, 2017). A quantitative measure of \"stress\" is difficult. Yet, considerable evidence shows a correlation between some degree of maternal stress and adverse birth outcomes that include stillbirth, preterm birth, and abnormal fetal development (Hobel, 2003; Ruiz, 2003). Factors that activate this cascade likely are broad and inluence the stress response."

Some data, including a strong association between schizophrenia and the velocardiofacial syndrome, suggest that associated genes are located on chromosome 22q 11 (Murphy, 2002). But sophisticated gene mapping studies clearly show that schizophrenia is not related to a single gene or mutation. Instead, multiple DNA variants likely interact to lead to schizophrenia (Kukshal, 2012). Other putative risks for subsequent schizophrenia in an exposed fetus include maternal iron-deiciency anemia, diabetes, and acute maternal stress (Insel, 2008; Malaspina, 2008; Van Lieshout, 2008). hese remain unproven, as does the association with maternal inluenza A infection."

There is a strong contribution for genetic factors in deter- mining risk for schizophrenia, although most individuals who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia have no family history of psychosis. Liability is conferred by a spectrum of risk alleles, common and rare, with each allele contributing only a small fraction to the to- tal population variance. The risk alleles identified to date are also associated with other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, depression, and autism spectrum disorder. Pregnancy and birth complications with hypoxia and greater paternal age are associated with a higher risk of schizophrenia for the developing fetus. In addition, other prenatal and perinatal adversities, including stress, infection, malnutrition, maternal diabetes, and other medical conditions, have been linked with schizophrenia. However, the vast major- ity of offspring with these risk factors do not develop schizophrenia."

Intuitively, pregnancy exacerbates some coexisting psychological disorders. Namely, an increased risk for mood disorders is linked with pregnancy-related shifts in sex steroid and monoamine neurotransmitter levels, dysfunction of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis, thyroid dysfunction, and alterations in immune response (Yonkers, 2011). These changes, coupled with familial clustering of depression cases, suggest that there may be a subgroup of women at risk for developing a unipolar major depressive disorder during pregnancy."

Up to 15 percent of women develop a nonpsychotic postpartum depressive disorder within 6 months of delivery (Tam, 2007; Yonkers, 201r1). A few have a psychotic illness following delivery, and half of these manifest a bipolar disorder. Depressive disorders are more likely in women with obstetrical complications such as severe preeclampsia or fetal-growth restriction, especially if associated with early delivery. Houston and coworkers (2015) found that expectations at delivery also increased the risk for postpartum depression."

When their gene expression, histone modification, and DNA methylation patterns are compared, however, many differences are observed. Because these differences are roughly correlated not only with age but also with the time that the twins have spent apart from each other, it has been proposed that some of these differences are heritable from cell to cell and are the result of environmental factors. Although these studies are in early stages, the idea that environmental events can be permanently registered as epigenetic changes in our cells is a fascinating one that presents an important challenge to the next generation of biological scientists."

Certain epidemiologic factors also come into play including a family history of depression, single motherhood, cigarette smoking, low income, youth, and domestic violence. The implications, however, of depression during and after pregnancy are great in that the fetus and neonate are at risk of suffering due to inadequate prenatal and postnatal care and there is an increased rate of miscarriage. Several pieces of controversial evidence suggest that maternal depression may affect fetal growth and infant temperament. Furthermore, postpartum depression is also more common in women with prenatal depression and may lead to similar difficulties with infant care."

Others assert that these incongruities stem from an antagonistic action of progesterone on mineralocorticoids (Keller-Wood, 2001). Thus, in response to elevated progesterone levels during pregnancy, an elevated free cortisol is needed to maintain homeostasis. Other theories include possible roles for higher free cortisol in preparation for the stress of pregnancy, delivery, and lactation. This pattern might also influence postpartum behavior and parenting roles (Conde, 2014)."

            "content": "The action of exogenous toxins during pregnancy is another factor to be considered. Severe maternal alcoholism has been linked to a dysmorphic syndrome and developmental delay, but the findings of several studies have not been consistent (see Chap. 41); a similar problem attaches maternal exposure to anticonvulsant medications (see Chap. 15). Surprisingly, maternal addiction to opiates, while causing an opiate withdrawal in infants for weeks or even months (Wilson et al), seems not to result in permanent injury to the nervous system. The importance of exposure to extremely small amounts of environmental lead is also controversial."

            "content": "Several studies of the long-term consequences to this cohort of children born to nutritionally deprived women have been performed and have been reviewed by Kyle and Pichard (2006). Progeny deprived in mid to late pregnancy were lighter, shorter, and thinner at birth, and they had a higher incidences of sub sequent hypertension, reactive airway disease, dyslipidemia, diminished glucose tolerance, and coronary artery disease. Early pregnancy deprivation was associated with greater obesity rates in adult women but not men. Early starvation was also linked to higher rates of central nervous system anomalies, schizophre nia, and schizophrenia-spectrum personality disorders. hese observations and others have led to the concept of etal programming by which adult morbidity and mortality are related to fetal health. Known widely as the Barker hypothesis, as promulgated by Barker and colleagues (1989), this concept is discussed in Chapter 44 (p. 848)."
