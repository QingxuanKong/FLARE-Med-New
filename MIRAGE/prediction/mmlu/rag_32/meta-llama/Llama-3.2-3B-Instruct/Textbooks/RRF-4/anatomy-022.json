    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, let's analyze the information provided in the given documents. The question asks about the regional lymphatic drainage of the left side of the tip of the tongue. According to Document [1], the oral part of the tongue drains both directly into the deep cervical nodes and indirectly into these nodes by passing first through the mylohyoid muscle and into submental and submandibular nodes. The tip of the tongue drains through the mylohyoid muscle into the submental nodes and then into mainly the jugulo-omohyoid node of the deep cervical chain. Therefore, the lymphatic drainage of the left side of the tip of the tongue is likely to be to the left submental lymph node and the jugulo-omohyoid node. However, since the question is about the left side of the tip of the tongue, we can focus on the left submental lymph node as the primary drainage site. Let's look at the options provided. Option A: left submental lymph node - This option is consistent with the information provided in Document [1], which states that the tip of the tongue drains through the mylohyoid muscle into the submental nodes. So, this seems like a plausible answer. Option B: left and right submental lymph nodes - This option is not supported by the information provided in the documents. The documents do not mention that the lymphatic drainage of the left side of the tip of the tongue goes to the right submental lymph node. Option C: left submandibular lymph node - This option is not supported by the information provided in the documents. The documents do not mention that the lymphatic drainage of the left side of the tip of the tongue goes to the left submandibular lymph node. Option D: left and right submandibular lymph nodes - This option is also not supported by the information provided in the documents. The documents do not mention that the lymphatic drainage of the left side of the tip of the tongue goes to both the left and right submandibular lymph nodes. Based on the analysis, the most appropriate answer is Option A: left submental lymph node.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}}",

            "content": "Lymphatic drainage of the breast is as follows: Approximately 75% is via lymphatic vessels that drain laterally and superiorly into axillary nodes (Fig. 3.16). Most of the remaining drainage is into parasternal nodes deep to the anterior thoracic wall and associated with the internal thoracic artery. Some drainage may occur via lymphatic vessels that follow the lateral branches of posterior intercostal arteries and connect with intercostal nodes situated near the heads and necks of ribs. Axillary nodes drain into the subclavian trunks, parasternal nodes drain into the bronchomediastinal trunks, and intercostal nodes drain either into the thoracic duct or into the bronchomediastinal trunks. The breast in men is rudimentary and consists only of small ducts, often composed of cords of cells, that normally do not extend beyond the areola. Breast cancer can occur in men. Muscles of the pectoral region"

In the clinic The jugular venous pulse is an important clinical sign that enables the physician to assess the venous pressure and waveform and is a reflection of the functioning of the right side of the heart. In the clinic The thyroid gland develops from a small region of tissue near the base of the tongue. This tissue descends as the thyroglossal duct from the foramen cecum in the posterior aspect of the tongue to pass adjacent to the anterior aspect of the middle of the hyoid bone. The thyroid tissue continues to migrate inferiorly and eventually comes to rest at the anterior aspect of the trachea in the root of the neck."

In general, there are no lymphatic vessels in the core of lamina propria between the intestinal glands and none that extend toward the luminal surface of the large intestine. Only recently, using new very selective markers for lymphatic epithelium, researchers have found occasional small lymphatic vessels at the bases of the intestinal glands. These lymphatic vessels drain into the lymphatic network within the muscularis mucosae. The next step in lymph drainage occurs in the lymphatic plexuses in the submucosa and muscularis externa before lymph leaves the wall of the large intestine and drains into the regional lymph nodes. To understand the clinical significance of the lymphatic pattern in the large intestine, see Folder 17.6."

Erosion or invasion of the thyroid and cri-coid cartilage can significantly impact outcomes and treatment as can extension into the preepiglottic or paraglottic spaces. The supraglottic and subglottic sites are lymphatic rich, and bilateral lymphadenopathy is not uncommon, whereas the glottic site has relatively poor lymphatic drainage (1%\u20134% regional metasta-sis for isolated larynx cancer). The supraglottis drains through the neurovascular bundle to the thyrohyoid membrane, mainly draining to the upper and lateral cervical nodes (levels II\u2013IV), whereas the glottis and subglottis drain through the cricothyroid membrane and can have spread to the prelaryngeal (Delphian nodes), paratracheal, and lower cervical nodes (levels IV and VI), although in these cases we still treat levels II to IV surgi-cally because of the significant occult nodes in this region.The primary management of laryngeal cancer depends on a variety of"

All lymphatics from the upper limb drain into lymph nodes in the axilla (Fig. 7.57). In addition, axillary nodes receive drainage from an extensive area on the adjacent trunk, which includes regions of the upper back and shoulder, the lower neck, the chest, and the upper anterolateral abdominal wall. Axillary nodes also receive drainage from approximately 75% of the mammary gland. The 20\u201330 axillary nodes are generally divided into five groups on the basis of location. Humeral (lateral) nodes posteromedial to the axillary vein receive most of the lymphatic drainage from the upper limb. Pectoral (anterior) nodes occur along the inferior margin of the pectoralis minor muscle along the course of the lateral thoracic vessels and receive drainage from the abdominal wall, the chest, and the mammary gland."
