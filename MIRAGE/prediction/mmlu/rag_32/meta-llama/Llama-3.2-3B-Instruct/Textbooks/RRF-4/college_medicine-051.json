At physiologic pH (~7.4), the carboxyl group is dissociated, forming the negatively charged carboxylate ion (\u2212COO\u2212), and the amino group is protonated (\u2212NH3+) (Fig. 1.1A).

Wobble hypothesis The mechanism by which a tRNA can recognize more than one codon for a specific amino acid is described by the wobble hypothesis, which states that codon\u2013anticodon pairing follows the traditional Watson-Crick rules (G pairs with C and A pairs with U) for the first two bases of the codon but can be less stringent for the last base. The base at the 5\u2032-end of the anticodon (the first base of the anticodon) is not as spatially defined as the other two bases. Movement of that first base allows nontraditional base-pairing with the 3\u2032-base of the codon (the last base of the codon). This movement is called wobble and allows a single tRNA to recognize more than one codon. Examples of these flexible pairings are shown in Figure 32.9. The result of wobble is that 61 tRNA species are not required to read the 61 codons that code for amino acids. V. STEPS IN TRANSLATION"

Blood is drawn for clinical laboratory tests. Prognosis: Patients treated with the appropriate antibiotic in the early stages of Lyme disease typically recover quickly and completely. Case-Related Questions: Choose the ONE best answer. Q1. Antibiotics in the tetracycline class inhibit protein synthesis (translation) at the initiation step. Which of the following statements about translation is correct? A. In eukaryotic translation, the initiating amino acid is formylated methionine. B. Only the charged initiating transfer RNA goes directly to the ribosomal A site. C. Peptidyltransferase is a ribozyme that forms the peptide bond between two amino acids. D. Prokaryotic translation can be inhibited by the phosphorylation of initiation factor 2."

The isoelectric point (pI) is the pH at which an amino acid is electrically neutral, that is, in which the sum of the positive charges equals the sum of the negative charges. For an amino acid, such as alanine, that has only two dissociable hydrogens (one from the \u03b1-carboxyl and one from the \u03b1-amino group), the pI is the average of pK1 and pK2 (pI = [2.3 + 9.1]/2 = 5.7) as shown in Figure 1.11. The pI is, thus, midway between pK1 (2.3) and pK2 (9.1). pI corresponds to the pH at which the form II (with a net charge of zero) predominates and at which there are also equal amounts of forms I (net charge of +1) and III (net charge of \u22121)."

Amino acid and small peptide intestinal absorption Most free amino acids are taken into enterocytes via sodium-dependent secondary active transport by solute carrier (SLC) proteins of the apical membrane. At least seven different transport systems with overlapping amino acid specificities are known. Di-and tripeptides, however, are taken up by a proton-linked peptide transporter (PepT1). The peptides are then hydrolyzed to free amino acids. Regardless of their source, free amino acids are released from enterocytes into the portal system by sodium-independent transporters of the basolateral membrane. Therefore, only free amino acids are found in the portal vein after a meal containing protein. These amino acids are either metabolized by the liver or released into the general circulation. [Note: Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) are not metabolized by the liver but, instead, are sent from the liver to muscle via the blood.] E. Absorption abnormalities"

When such \u201chybrid\u201d aminoacyl-tRNA molecules were used for protein synthesis in a cell-free system, the wrong amino acid was inserted at every point in the protein chain where that tRNA was used. Although, as we shall see, cells have several quality control mechanisms to avoid this type of mishap, the experiment did establish that the genetic code is translated by two sets of adaptors that act sequentially. Each matches one molecular surface to another with great specificity, and it is their combined action that associates each sequence of three nucleotides in the mRNA molecule\u2014that is, each codon\u2014with its particular amino acid."

Amino acid titration The titration curve of an amino acid can be analyzed in the same way as described for acetic acid. 1. Carboxyl group dissociation: Consider alanine, for example, which contains an ionizable \u03b1-carboxyl and \u03b1-amino group. [Note: Its \u2013CH3 R group is nonionizable.] At a low (acidic) pH, both of these groups are protonated (Fig. 1.10). As the pH of the solution is raised, the \u2212COOH group of form I can dissociate by donating a H+ to the medium. The release of a H+ results in the formation of the carboxylate group, \u2212COO\u2212. This structure is shown as form II, which is the dipolar form of the molecule (see Fig. 1.10). This form, also called a zwitterion (from the German word for \u201chybrid\u201d), is the isoelectric form of alanine, that is, it has an overall (net) charge of zero. 2."
