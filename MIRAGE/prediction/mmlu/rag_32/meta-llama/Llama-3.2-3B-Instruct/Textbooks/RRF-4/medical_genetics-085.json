The genotype refers to the complete set of genes that an individual possesses, while the phenotype is the physical expression of those genes. In other words, the phenotype is the observable characteristics of an individual, such as height, skin color, eye color, etc. The question asks for the set of observable characteristics that is the sum of genetic and environmental effects. The genotype is not directly observable, so it cannot be the correct answer. Therefore, we can eliminate option A. The phenotype is the observable characteristics, but it is not the sum of genetic and environmental effects. It is the result of the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Therefore, we can eliminate option B. The correct answer is the combination of genotype and phenotype, as they both play a role in determining the observable characteristics of an individual. This is the definition of phenotype, which is the sum of genetic and environmental effects. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

These characteristics (also known as quantitative trait loci [QTLs]) show a continuous variation within, as well as across, all population groups. Environmental influences, however, significantly modify the phenotypic expression of complex traits. For example, type 2 diabetes mellitus has many of the features of a complex multigenic disorder. It is well recognized clinically that affected persons often first exhibit clinical manifestations of this disease after weight gain. Thus, obesity, as well as other environmental influences, unmasks the diabetic genetic trait. Assigning a disease to this mode of inheritance must be done with caution. Such attribution depends on many factors but first on familial clustering and the exclusion of mendelian and chromosomal modes of transmission.

A trait is called polygenic if multiple genes contribute to the phenotype or multifactorial if multiple genes are assumed to interact with environmental factors. Genetic models for these complex traits need to account for genetic heterogeneity and interactions with other genes and the environment. Complex genetic traits may be influenced by modifier genes that are not linked to the main gene involved in the pathogenesis of the trait. This type of gene-gene interaction, or epistasis, plays an important role in polygenic traits that require the simultaneous presence of variations in multiple genes to result in a pathologic phenotype."

A low response per drink is observed early in the drinking career and before alcohol use disorders develop. All follow-up studies have demonstrated that this need for higher doses of alcohol to achieve effects predicts future heavy drinking, alcohol problems, and alcohol use disorders. The impact of a low response to alcohol on adverse drinking outcomes is partially mediated by a range of environmental influences, including the selection of heavier-drinking friends, more positive expectations of the effects of high doses of alcohol, and suboptimal ways of coping with stress."

            "content": "of the natural history of COPD is shown as a function of the influences on tracking curves of FEV1 in Fig. 314-3. Death or disability from COPD can result from a normal rate of decline after a reduced growth phase (curve C), an early initiation of pulmonary function decline after normal growth (curve B), or an accelerated decline after normal growth (curve D). The rate of decline in pulmonary function can be modified by changing environmental exposures (i.e., quitting smoking), with smoking cessation at an earlier age providing a more beneficial effect than smoking cessation after marked reductions in pulmonary function have already developed. Genetic factors likely contribute to the level of pulmonary function achieved during growth and to the rate of decline in response to smoking and potentially to other environmental factors as well."
