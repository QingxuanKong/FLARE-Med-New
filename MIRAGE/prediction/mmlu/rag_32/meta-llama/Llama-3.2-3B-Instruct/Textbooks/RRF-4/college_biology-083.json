The urea cycle is a process that converts ammonia (NH4+) into urea, while the citric acid cycle is a process that converts acetyl-CoA into carbon dioxide (CO2). Ornithine is a key component of the urea cycle, and it is regenerated during each turn of the cycle in a similar manner to how citrate is regenerated in the citric acid cycle. In the citric acid cycle, citrate is converted back into oxaloacetate, which can then enter the cycle again. Similarly, in the urea cycle, ornithine is converted back into glutamate via the action of ornithine transcarbamylase, and then glutamate can be converted back into \u03b1-ketoglutarate, which can then enter the cycle again. Therefore, ornithine is regenerated during each turn of the urea cycle in a similar manner to how citrate is regenerated in the citric acid cycle.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

Two critical steps of the urea cycle are carried out in the mitochondria of liver cells, while the remaining steps occur in the cytosol. Mitochondria also play an essential part in the metabolic adaptation of cells to different nutritional conditions. For example, under conditions of starvation, proteins in our bodies are broken down to amino acids, and the amino acids are imported into mitochondria and oxidized to produce NADH for ATP production."

The citric acid molecule is then gradually oxidized, allowing the energy of this oxidation to be harnessed to produce energy-rich activated carrier molecules.

            "content": "proper function of the urea cycle. Therapy consists of dietary protein restriction and supplementation of citrulline (2\u20138 g/d), a neutral amino acid that fuels the urea cycle when metabolized to arginine and ornithine. Pulmonary disease responds to glucocorticoids or bronchoalveolar lavage in some patients. Women with lysinuric protein intolerance who become pregnant have an increased risk of anemia, toxemia, and bleeding complications during delivery. These can be minimized by aggressive nutritional therapy and control of blood pressure. Their infants can have intrauterine growth restriction but have normal neurologic function"

            "content": "Congenital: Genetic deficiencies of each of the five enzymes of the urea cycle (and of NAGS) have been described, with an overall incidence of ~1:25,000 live births. X-linked OTC deficiency is the most common of these disorders, predominantly affecting males, although female carriers may become symptomatic. All of the other urea cycle disorders follow an autosomal-recessive inheritance pattern. In each case, the failure to synthesize urea leads to hyperammonemia during the first weeks following birth. [Note: The hyperammonemia seen with arginase deficiency is less severe because arginine contains two waste nitrogens and can be excreted in the urine.] Historically, urea cycle defects had high morbidity (neurologic manifestations) and mortality. Treatment included restriction of dietary protein in the presence of sufficient calories to prevent protein catabolism. Administration of compounds that bind covalently to nonessential amino acids, producing nitrogen-containing molecules that"
