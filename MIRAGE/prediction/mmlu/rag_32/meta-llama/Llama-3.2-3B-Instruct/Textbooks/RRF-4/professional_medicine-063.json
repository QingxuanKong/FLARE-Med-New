    "question": "A 20-year-old man has had frequent upper respiratory tract infections over the past 4 years. He has daily purulent sputum and has noted decreased exercise tolerance over the past 2 years. He and his wife have been unable to conceive because of his low sperm count. Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. An x-ray of the chest shows hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a decreased FEV1:FVC ratio. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",

The patient has a history of frequent upper respiratory tract infections, daily purulent sputum, decreased exercise tolerance, and low sperm count, which suggests a chronic condition affecting the respiratory system. 2. The presence of scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi throughout both lung fields on chest x-ray and the decreased FEV1:FVC ratio on spirometry indicate airway obstruction. 3. The patient's inability to conceive due to low sperm count may suggest cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that affects the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems. 4. Cystic fibrosis is characterized by thick, sticky mucus production, which can lead to recurrent respiratory infections and lung damage. **Answer:** {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient's symptoms and test results are consistent with cystic fibrosis. The decreased FEV1:FVC ratio, scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi, and chronic respiratory infections are all characteristic of cystic fibrosis. The low sperm count may also be related to the underlying genetic disorder. The sweat chloride test is a diagnostic test for cystic fibrosis, as it measures the level of chloride in sweat, which is abnormal in people with cystic fibrosis.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan."

Lung Function Tests Simple spirometry confirms airflow limitation with a reduced FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio, and PEF (Fig. 309-6). Reversibility is demonstrated by a >12% and 200-mL increase in FEV1 15 min after an inhaled short-acting \u03b22-agonist or in some patients by a 2to 4-week trial of oral corticosteroids (OCS) (prednisone or prednisolone 30\u201340 mg daily). Measurements of PEF twice daily may confirm the diurnal variations in airflow obstruction. Flow-volume loops show reduced peak flow and reduced maximum expiratory flow. Further lung function tests are rarely necessary, but whole-body plethysmography shows increased airway resistance and may show increased total lung capacity and residual volume. Gas diffusion is usually normal, but there may be a small increase in gas transfer in some patients."

Restriction can result from parenchymal disease, neuromuscular weakness, or chest wall or pleural diseases.

Even more often, spirometry is used to measure airflow, which reflects the dynamic properties of the lung. During an FVC maneuver, the patient inhales to TLC and then exhales rapidly and forcefully to RV; this method ensures that flow limitation has been achieved, so that the precise effort made has little influence on actual flow. The total amount of air exhaled is the FVC, and the amount of air exhaled in the first second is the FEV1; the FEV1 is a flow rate, revealing volume change per time. Like lung volumes, an individual\u2019s maximal expiratory flows should be compared with predicted values based on height, age, and sex. While the FEV1/FVC ratio is typically reduced in airflow obstruction, this condition can also reduce FVC by raising RV, sometimes rendering the FEV1/FVC ratio \u201cartifactually normal\u201d with the erroneous implication that airflow obstruction is absent.

In the acute setting, this manifestation may be a sign of viral or bacterial bronchitis. Chronic rhonchi suggest bronchiectasis or COPD.

This study is an effort-dependent test used to assess for obstructive pathophysiology as seen in asthma, COPD, and bronchiectasis. A diminished-forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) (often defined as <70% of the predicted value) is diagnostic of obstruction. In addition to measuring FEV1 and FVC, the clinician should examine the flow-volume loop (which is effort-independent). A plateau of the inspiratory and expiratory curves suggests large-airway obstruction in extrathoracic and intrathoracic locations, respectively."

Patients with apparently uncomplicated influenza have been reported to have a variety of mild ventilatory defects and increased alveolar-capillary diffusion gradients; thus, subclinical pulmonary involvement may be more common than is appreciated. In uncomplicated influenza, the acute illness generally resolves over 2\u20135 days, and most patients have largely recovered in 1 week, although cough may persist 1\u20132 weeks longer. In a significant minority (particularly the elderly), however, symptoms of weakness or lassitude (postinfluenza asthenia) may persist for several weeks and may prove troublesome for persons who wish to resume their full level of activity promptly. The pathogenetic basis for this asthenia is unknown, although pulmonary function abnormalities may persist for several weeks after uncomplicated influenza."

It is common among cigarette smokers and urban dwellers in smog-ridden cities; some studies indicate that 20% to 25% of men in the 40to 65-year-old age group have the disease. In early stages of the disease, the cough raises mucoid sputum, but airflow is not obstructed. Some patients with chronic bronchitis have evidence of hyperresponsive airways, with intermittent bronchospasm and wheezing (asthmatic bronchitis), while other bronchitic patients, especially heavy smokers, develop chronic outflow obstruction, usually with associated emphysema (COPD). The distinctive feature of chronic bronchitis is hypersecretion of mucus, beginning in the large airways."

The patient has mild dysuria and pyuria and empirically receives oral therapy with cip-rofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection prior to the procedure and tolerates the procedure well. Approxi-mately 48 hours after the procedure, the patient presents to the emergency department with confusion, dysuria and chills. Physical exam reveals a blood pressure of 90/50, pulse of 120, temperature of 38.5\u00b0 C and respira-tory rate of 24. The patient is disoriented but the physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. Laboratory test shows WBC 24,000/mm3 and elevated serum lactate; urinalysis shows 300 WBC per high power field and 4+ bacteria. What possible organisms are likely to be responsible for the patient\u2019s symptoms? At this point, what antibiotic(s) would you choose for initial therapy of this potentially life-threatening infection?"
