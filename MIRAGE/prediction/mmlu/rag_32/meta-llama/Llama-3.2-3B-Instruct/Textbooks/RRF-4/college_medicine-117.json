Although the city itself has characteristics, there are several smaller areas, usually congregations of people from the same nationality, who adhere to customs from their prior country of inhabitance. For example, in Little Italy, a small town in the city, it is still customary to greet people with cheek kisses. This is an example of what kind of phenomenon?",

Subculture refers to a smaller, specialized culture within a larger culture, often sharing similar values, norms, and practices. Counterculture refers to a culture that rejects or challenges the norms and values of the dominant culture. Microculture refers to a small, localized culture within a larger culture, often sharing similar customs and practices. Culture lag refers to the gap between the cultural practices and values of a society and the dominant culture. In the context of the question, the phenomenon described is a small town within New York City where people from the same nationality adhere to customs from their prior country of inhabitance. This suggests a small, localized culture within a larger culture, which aligns with the definition of microculture. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Microculture.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

This resolution did not suggest that nothing had changed in the intervening 30 years since the declaration, nor did it dispute that its prescription needed reframing in light of changing public health needs. The 2008 WHO World Health Report describes how a primary health care approach is necessary \u201cnow more than ever\u201d to address global health priorities, especially in terms of disparities and new health challenges. As discussed below, this report highlights four broad areas in which reform is required (Fig. 13e-6). One of these areas\u2014the need to organize health care so that it places the needs of people first\u2014essentially relates to the necessity for strong primary care in health systems and what this"

Although communicable diseases continue to be a major cause of death, CVD has emerged as a significant health concern in LMICs. With 85% of the world\u2019s population, LMICs are driving the rates of change in the global burden of CVD (Fig. 266e-1). In most LMICs, an urban/rural gradient has emerged for CHD, stroke, and hypertension, with higher rates in urban centers."

            "content": "While some have posited natural limits to human life expectancy, the limits have been surpassed with some regularity, and at the very oldest ages in the leading countries with the highest life expectancy, there appears to be little evidence of any approaching asymptote. Indeed a surprising discovery was that life expectancy in the leading country over the last century and a half, with different countries taking the lead in different epochs, could be represented almost perfectly by a straight line, with the increase for females showing a steady and astonishing increase of three months per year or 2.5 years per decade (Fig. 93e-3). No single country kept that pace of improvement the entire time, but this trend calls into question the notion that improvement must slow down, at least in the near future."

One of these areas\u2014the need to organize health care so that it places the needs of people first\u2014essentially relates to the necessity for strong primary care in health systems and what this requirement entails. The other three areas also relate to primary care. All four areas require action to move health systems in a direction that will reduce disparities and increase the satisfaction of those they serve. The World Health Report\u2019s recommendations present a vision of primary health care that is based on the principles of Alma Ata but that differs from many attempts to implement primary health care in the 1970s and 1980s."
