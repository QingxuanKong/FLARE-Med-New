    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to analyze the structure of bronchioles as described in the provided documents. Bronchioles are part of the respiratory system and are involved in both air conduction and gas exchange. They are the first part of the bronchial tree that allows gas exchange. The documents describe the histological features of bronchioles, including their wall composition. From Document [1], we know that the wall of a respiratory bronchiole consists of alternating thick and thin regions. The thick regions are lined by cuboidal Clara cells, while the thin regions have a wall similar to that of the alveoli, with a capillary and a basal lamina. However, Clara cells are present in the thick regions. From Document [5], we know that the smallest conducting bronchioles, the terminal bronchioles, are lined with a simple cuboidal epithelium in which Clara cells are interspersed among the ciliated cells. From Document [6], we know that the main features of the bronchiolar wall include bundles of smooth muscle and the lining epithelium, which is ciliated. From Document [10], we know that the respiratory bronchioles are the first part of the respiratory portion of the bronchial tree that allows gas exchange. They give rise to alveolar ducts, which branch into alveolar sacs, and the alveoli. From Document [11], we know that the respiratory portion of the respiratory system includes respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. From Document [15], we know that the thin regions of the bronchiole wall are lined by Clara cells and smooth muscle bundles, while the thick regions have a wall similar to that of the alveoli, with a capillary and a basal lamina. From Document [21], we know that the respiratory bronchiole has a histologic feature of ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, and Clara cells are present in the thick regions. From Document [25], we know that the bronchial epithelium in respiratory bronchioles contains Clara cells, which secrete a surface-active agent that prevents luminal adhesion of bronchiolar walls during expiration. Based on these descriptions, the walls of bronchioles contain smooth muscle and respiratory epithelium. However, the presence of cartilage is not mentioned in the documents as a component of the bronchiole wall. Therefore, the correct answer is D. smooth muscle and respiratory epithelium.\", \"answer_choice\": \"D\"}",

Beyond the segmental bronchi, the airways divide in a dichotomous or asymmetrical branching pattern. Bronchi, distinguished by their size and the presence of cartilage, eventually become terminal bronchioles, which are the smallest airways without alveoli.

            "content": "Although the most important cause is cigarette smoking, other air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, may contribute. These environmental irritants induce hypertrophy of mucous glands in the trachea and bronchi as well as an increase in mucin-secreting goblet cells in the epithelial surfaces of smaller bronchi and bronchioles. These irritants also cause inflammation marked by the infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. In contrast with asthma, eosinophils are not seen in chronic bronchitis. Whereas the defining mucus hypersecretion is primarily a reflection of involvement of large bronchi, the airflow obstruction in chronic bronchitis results from (1) small airway disease, induced by mucous plugging of the bronchiolar lumen, inflammation, and bronchiolar wall fibrosis, and (2) coexistent emphysema. In general, while small airway disease (chronic bronchiolitis) is an important component of early, mild airflow obstruction, chronic bronchitis with"

However, the defective Cl channel protein in the bronchial epithelium causes decreased Cl secretion and increased Na and water reabsorption from the lumen (Fig. F19.2.1). As a result, the \u201cmucociliary escalator\u201d malfunctions, with consequent accumulation of an unusually thick, viscous mucous secretion. The pulmonary lesion is probably initiated by obstruction of the bronchioles. Bronchiolar obstruction blocks the airways and leads to thickening of the bronchiole walls and to other degenerative changes in the alveoli. Because fluids remain trapped in the lungs, individuals with cystic fibrosis have frequent respiratory tract infections. The cloning of"

            "content": "The lung has both pulmonary and bronchial circulations. The pulmonary circulation supplies the capillaries of the alveolar septum and is derived from the pulmonary artery that leaves the right ventricle of the heart. The branches of the pulmonary artery travel with those of the bronchi and bronchioles and carry blood down to the capillary level at the alveoli. This blood is oxygenated and collected by pulmonary venous capillaries that join to form venules. They ultimately form the four pulmonary veins that return blood to the left atrium of the heart. The pulmonary venous system is located at a distance from the respiratory passages at the periphery of the bronchopulmonary segments."
