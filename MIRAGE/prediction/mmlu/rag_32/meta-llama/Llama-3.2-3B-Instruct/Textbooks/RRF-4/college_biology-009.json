    "predict": "Here's the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to understand the process of how an influenza virus enters a host cell. According to the provided documents, influenza viruses enter cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. After entering the cell, the virus is delivered to endosomes. The low pH in endosomes activates a fusion protein in the viral envelope, which catalyzes the fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes, releasing the viral genome into the cytosol. The question asks what the influenza virus immediately starts doing after entering the cell. We can eliminate option A, as influenza viruses have single-stranded RNA genomes and do not incorporate DNA into the host cell's chromosome. Option B is also incorrect, as there is no information that suggests influenza viruses destroy the host cell's transcriptional machinery immediately after entering the cell. Option D is incorrect because reverse transcriptase is not mentioned in the provided documents as a mechanism used by influenza viruses to manufacture viral DNA. This leaves us with option C, which states that the influenza virus replicates its genetic material and synthesizes viral proteins. This is consistent with the process of viral replication that occurs after the virus enters the cell and its genome is released into the cytosol.\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

In 2009, a new H1N1 swine virus emerged that derived genes from pig, avian, and human influenza viruses. Such recombination events allowed the new virus to replicate rapidly and spread through an immunologically naive human population. Generally, within two or three years, the human population develops immunity to a new recombinant strain of virus, and the infection rate drops to a steady-state level. Because the recombination events are unpredictable, it is not possible to know when the next influenza pandemic will occur or how severe it might be."

They are unusual in that their genome consists of several (usually eight) strands of RNA. When two strains of influenza infect the same host, the RNA strands of the two strains can reassort to form a new type of influenza virus. In normal years, influenza is a mild disease in healthy adults, although it can be life-threatening in the very young and very old. Different influenza strains infect fowl such as ducks and chickens, but only a subset of these strains can infect humans, and transmission from fowl to humans is rare. In 1918, however, a particularly virulent variant of avian influenza crossed the species barrier to infect humans, triggering the catastrophic pandemic of 1918 called the Spanish flu, which killed 20\u201350 million people worldwide.

The answer was revealed in a classic paper that took advantage of a clone of T cells whose T cell receptor was directed against an antigen assoicated with the nuclear protein of the 1968 strain of influenza virus. The authors of the paper found that when they incubated high concentrations of certain peptides derived from the viral nuclear protein, the cells became sensitive to lysis by subsequent incubation with the cytotoxic T cells. Using various peptides from the 1968 strain and the 1934 strain (with which the cytotoxic T cells did not react), the authors defined the particular peptide responsible for the T cell response (Figure Q24\u20131)."

Influenza virus has an outer-membrane hemagglutinin glycoprotein that binds to sialic acid on respiratory tract cell plasma membranes. The hemagglutinin mediates adsorption to cell membranes, receptor aggregation, and endocytosis. As the endosome pH decreases in the cell cytoplasm, the influenza hemagglutinin conformation changes, enabling hydrophobic helices, which are initially at the base of the hemagglutinin, to extend, interacting and fusing with the endosome membrane and thereby releasing the viral genome into the cell cytoplasm. The influenza virus M2 membrane channel protein has a key role in lowering endosome pH and permitting virus and cell membrane fusion."

Similarly, human influenza viruses spread readily to other humans, but have never been detected in birds. The key to this specificity lies in the viral capsid protein, hemagglutinin, which binds to sialic acid residues on cell-surface glycoproteins, triggering virus entry into the cell (Movie 23.8). Hemagglutinin on human viruses recognizes sialic acid in a 2-6 linkage with galactose, whereas avian hemagglutinin recognizes sialic acid in a 2-3 linkage with galactose. Humans make carbohydrate chains that have only the 2-6 linkage between sialic acid and galactose; birds make only the 2-3 linkage; but pigs make carbohydrate chains with both linkages. How does this situation make pigs ideal hosts for generating new strains of human influenza viruses?"

Antigenic variation may involve the hemagglutinin alone or both the hemagglutinin and the neuraminidase.

This action is called neutralization. The ability of an antibody to neutralize a pathogen may depend on its affinity, its isotype subclass, complement, and the activity of phagocytic cells. For example, preexisting antibodies are required to protect against the polio virus, which infects critical host cells within a short period after entering the body and is not easily controlled by T lymphocytes once intracellular infection has been established.

The type A viruses infect humans, pigs, horses, and birds and are the major cause of pandemic and epidemic influenza infections. Epidemics of influenza occur through mutations of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens that allow the virus to escape most host antibodies (antigenic drift). Pandemics, which last longer and are more widespread than epidemics, may occur when both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are replaced through recombination of RNA segments"

            "content": "Viruses that infect animal cells generally exploit cell-surface receptor molecules that are either ubiquitous (such as the sialic-acid-containing oligosaccharides used by the influenza virus) or found uniquely on those cell types in which the virus replicates (such as the neuron-specific proteins used by rabies virus). Although a virus usually uses a single type of host-cell receptor, some viruses use more than one type. An important example is HIV-1, which requires two types of receptors to enter a host cell. Its primary receptor is CD4, a cell-surface protein on helper T cells and macrophages that is involved in immune recognition (discussed in Chapter 24). It also requires a co-receptor, which is either CCR5 (a receptor for \u03b2-chemokines) or CXCR4 (a receptor for \u03b1-chemokines), depending on the particular variant of the virus; macrophages are susceptible only to HIV variants that use CCR5 for entry, whereas helper T cells are most efficiently infected by variants that use CXCR4"

            "content": "The factors that result in the inception and termination of outbreaks of influenza A are incompletely understood. A major determinant of the extent and severity of an outbreak is the level of immunity in the population at risk. With the emergence of an antigenically novel influenza virus to which little or no immunity is present in a community, extensive outbreaks may occur. When the absence of immunity is worldwide, epidemic disease may spread around the globe, resulting in a pandemic. Such pandemic waves can continue for several years, until immunity in the population reaches a high level. In the years following pandemic influenza, antigenic drifts among influenza viruses result in outbreaks of variable severity in populations with high levels of immunity to the pandemic strain that circulated earlier. This situation persists until another antigenically novel pandemic strain emerges. On the other hand, outbreaks sometimes end despite the persistence of a large pool of susceptible"

            "content": "The membrane fusions catalyzed by viral fusion proteins are well understood. These proteins have a crucial role in permitting the entry of enveloped viruses (which have a lipid-bilayer-based membrane coat) into the cells that they infect (discussed in Chapters 5 and 23). For example, viruses such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, bind to cell-surface receptors and then fuse with the plasma membrane of the target cell (Figure 13\u201321). This fusion event allows the viral nucleic acid inside the nucleocapsid to enter the cytosol, where it replicates. Other viruses, such as the influenza virus, first enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis (discussed later) and are delivered to endosomes; the low pH in endosomes activates a fusion protein in the viral envelope that catalyzes the fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes, releasing the viral nucleic acid into the cytosol. Viral fusion proteins and SNAREs promote lipid bilayer fusion in similar ways."
