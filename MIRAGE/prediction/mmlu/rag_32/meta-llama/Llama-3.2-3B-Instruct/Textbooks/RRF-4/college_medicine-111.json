    "predict": "To solve this problem, we can apply Boyle's Law, which states that, at constant temperature, the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure. Mathematically, this is expressed as: P1V1 = P2V2 where P1 and V1 are the initial pressure and volume, and P2 and V2 are the final pressure and volume. Given: P1 = 200 atm V1 = 0.1 L P2 = 1 atm We need to find V2. Rearranging the equation to solve for V2, we get: V2 = P1V1 / P2 Plugging in the values: V2 = (200 atm \u00d7 0.1 L) / 1 atm V2 = 20 L So, the volume of the gas will be slightly more than 20L.

Eq. 23.7 is an example of how Dalton\u2019s law is used in the lung. According to Henry\u2019s law, the concentration of a gas dissolved in a liquid is proportional to its partial pressure.

Due both to surface tension at the air-liquid interface between alveolar wall lining fluid and alveolar gas and to elastic recoil of the lung tissue itself, the lung requires a positive transmural pressure difference between alveolar gas and its pleural surface to stay inflated; this difference is called the elastic recoil pressure of the lung, and it increases with lung volume. The lung becomes rather stiff at high volumes, so that relatively small volume changes are accompanied by large changes in transpulmonary pressure; in contrast, the lung is compliant at lower volumes, including those at which tidal breathing normally occurs.

As a consequence of gas exchange, however, the fraction of O2 in the alveolus decreases, and the fraction of CO2 in the alveolus increases. Because of changes in the fractions of O2 and CO2, the partial pressures exerted by these gases also change. The partial pressure of O2 in the alveolus (PAO2) is given by the alveolar gas equation, which is also called the ideal alveolar oxygen equation: Equation 23.13 CHAPTER 23 Ventilation, Perfusion, and Ventilation/Perfusion Relationships PO2 159 150 102 90 40 PCO2 0 040 40 46 PH2O, 37\u00b0C 0 47 47 47 47 PN2 601 563 571"

An important anatomic feature of the pulmonary airways is its treelike branching structure. While the individual airways in each successive generation, from most proximal (trachea) to most distal (respiratory bronchioles), are smaller than those of the parent generation, their number increases exponentially such that the summed cross-sectional area of the airways becomes very large toward the lung periphery. Because flow (volume/time) is constant along the airway tree, the velocity of airflow (flow/summed cross-sectional area) is much greater in the central airways than in the peripheral airways. During exhalation, gas leaving the alveoli must therefore gain velocity as it proceeds toward the mouth. The energy required for this \u201cconvective\u201d acceleration is drawn from the component of gas energy manifested as its local pressure, which reduces"

Fick\u2019s law of diffusion could be used to assess the diffusion properties of O2 in the lungs, except that the capillary partial pressure of oxygen cannot be measured. This limitation can be overcome with the use of carbon monoxide (CO) rather than O2. Because CO has low solubility in the capillary membrane, the rate of CO equilibrium across the capillary is slow, and the partial pressure of CO in capillary blood remains close to 0. In contrast, the solubility of CO in blood is high. Thus the only limitation for diffusion of CO is the alveolar-capillary membrane, and thus CO is a \u2022Fig. 24.1 Oxygen (O2) and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Transport in Arterial and Venous Blood.

The respiratory and circulatory systems contain several unique anatomical and physiological features to facilitate gas diffusion: (1) large surface areas for gas exchange (alveolar to capillary and capillary to tissue membrane) with short distances to travel, (2) substantial partial pressure gradient differences, and (3) gases with advantageous diffusion properties. Transport and delivery of O2 from the lungs to the tissue and vice versa for CO2 are dependent on basic gas diffusion laws.

This occurs for three reasons: (1) there is a resistive pressure drop caused by the frictional pressure loss associated with flow (expiratory airflow resistance); (2) as the cross-sectional area of the airways decreases toward the trachea, gas velocity increases and this acceleration of gas flow further decreases the pressure; and (3) as lung volume decreases, the elastic recoil pressure decreases."
