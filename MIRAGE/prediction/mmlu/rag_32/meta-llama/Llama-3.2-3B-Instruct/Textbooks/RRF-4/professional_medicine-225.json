To establish the diagnosis, we need to measure the levels of catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, or their metabolites in the urine. Among the given options, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) is a metabolite of epinephrine and norepinephrine, and its elevated levels can be indicative of pheochromocytoma.

Catecholamine crises can lead to heart failure, pulmonary edema, arrhythmias, and intracranial hemorrhage. During episodes of hormone release, which can occur at widely divergent intervals, patients are anxious and pale, and they experience tachycardia and palpitations. These paroxysms generally last <1 h and may be precipitated by surgery, positional changes, exercise, pregnancy, urination (particularly with bladder pheochromocytomas), and various medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, opiates, metoclopramide). The diagnosis is based on documentation of catecholamine excess by biochemical testing and localization of the tumor by imaging. These two criteria are of equal importance, although measurement of catecholamines or metanephrines (their methylated metabolites) is traditionally the first step in diagnosis."

Fine-cut CT scanning of the adrenal region is the method of choice because it provides excellent visualization of adrenal morphology. CT will readily identify larger tumors suspicious of malignancy but may miss lesions smaller than 5 mm. The differentiation between bilateral micronodular hyperplasia and a unilateral adenoma is only required if a surgical approach is feasible and desired. Consequently, selective adrenal vein sampling (AVS) should only be carried out in surgical candidates with either no obvious lesion on CT or evidence of a unilateral lesion in patients older than 40 years, because the latter patients have a high likelihood of harboring a coincidental, endocrine-inactive adrenal adenoma (Fig. 406-12).

If a 24-h urine collection is not feasible, it is advisable to obtain two or three daily urine determinations, as the values may vary considerably. The normal value for urinary excretion of cortisol is approximately 12 to 40 mg in 24 h, but some assays that measure additional metabolites of the hormone may allow normal values up to 100 mg. This should be followed by lowor high-dose dexamethasone suppression testing. A test using high doses of dexamethasone (2 mg every 6 h orally for 2 d, or a single dose of 8 mg at midnight) is the most dependable screening method for separating Cushing disease from ectopic secretion of ACTH. In the latter condition, the urinary excretion of cortisol is not suppressed by the administration of dexamethasone; in contrast, 60 to 70 percent of patients with"

Rosenthal, MD A 29-year-old Peruvian man presents with the incidental finding of a 10 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8-cm liver cyst on an abdominal com-puted tomography (CT) scan. The patient had noted 2 days of abdominal pain and fever, and his clinical evaluation and CT scan were consistent with appendicitis. His clinical find-ings resolved after laparoscopic appendectomy. The patient immigrated to the USA 10 years ago from a rural area of Peru where his family trades in sheepskins. His father and sister have undergone resection of abdominal masses, but details of their diagnoses are unavailable. What is your differential diagnosis? What are your diagnostic and therapeutic plans?"

Signs include bone marrow suppression, proptosis, hepatomegaly, subcutaneous nodules, and opsoclonus/myoclonus. CT scan; fine-needle aspirate of tumor. Histologically appears as small, round, blue tumor cells with a characteristic rosette pattern. Elevated 24-hour urinary catecholamines (VMA and HVA). Bone scan and bone marrow aspirate. CBC, LFTs, coagulation panel, BUN/creatinine. Local excision plus postsurgical chemotherapy and/or radiation.

Associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (hemihy-hemihypertrophy. pertrophy, macroglossia, visceromegaly), neurofibromatosis, and WAGR syndrome (Wilms\u2019, Aniridia, Genitourinary abnormalities, mental Retardation).

            "content": "Acute Porphyrias An acute porphyria should be suspected in patients with neurovisceral symptoms after puberty, such as abdominal pain, and when the initial clinical evaluation does not suggest another cause. The urinary porphyrin precursors (ALA and PBG) should be measured (Fig. 430-2). Urinary PBG is virtually always increased during acute attacks of AIP, HCP, and VP and is not substantially increased in any other medical condition. Therefore, this measurement is both sensitive and specific. A method for rapid, in-house testing for urinary PBG, such as the Trace PBG kit (Thermo Scientific), can be used. Results from spot (single-void) urine specimens are highly informative because very substantial increases in PBG are expected during acute attacks of porphyria. A 24-h collection can unnecessarily delay diagnosis. The same spot urine specimen should be saved for quantitative determination of ALA, PBG, and creatinine, in order to confirm the qualitative PBG result and also to detect"

            "content": "64e-1). This explanation is compatible with the very high TTKG, i.e., an increase in K+ excretion that is inappropriate for the plasma K+ concentration. What caused an increase in mineralocorticoid activity in this patient? The patient had bilateral adrenal metastases, indicating that primary hyperaldosteronism was unlikely. The clinical presentation (hypokalemia, hypertension, and alkalosis) and the history of small-cell lung cancer suggested Cushing\u2019s syndrome, with a massive increase in circulating glucocorticoids, in response to ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion by his small-cell lung cancer tumor. Confirmation of this diagnosis was provided by a very high plasma cortisol level, high ACTH level, and increased urinary cortisol (see the laboratory data above). Why would an increase in circulating cortisol cause an apparent increase in mineralocorticoid activity? Cortisol and aldosterone have equal affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor (MLR); thus, cortisol"

A chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a right 2.8 \u00d7 1.6 cm infrahilar mass and postobstructive pneumonia. The patient was an active smoker. Past medical history was notable for laryngeal carcinoma treated 15 years prior with radiation therapy, renal cell carcinoma, peripheral vascular disease, and hypothyroidism. On review of systems, he denied headache, nausea, and vomiting. He had chronic hip pain, managed with acetaminophen with codeine. Other medications included cilostazol, amoxicillin/clavulanate, digoxin, diltiazem, and thyroxine. He was euvolemic on examination, with no lymphadenopathy and a normal chest examination.
