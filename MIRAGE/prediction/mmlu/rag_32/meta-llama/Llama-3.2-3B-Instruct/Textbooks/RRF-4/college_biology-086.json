    "predict": "After analyzing the given documents, I have come to the conclusion that the crouching of very young birds in response to a predator's shape overhead is an example of a fixed action pattern. Here's my step-by-step thinking: 1. I looked for information on \"fixed action patterns\" in the given documents. In Document [0] (Title: Neurology_Adams), it is mentioned that \"exaggerated forms of the normal startle reflex\" can be considered as a fixed action pattern. This indicates that fixed action patterns are innate responses to specific stimuli. 2. I also found information on \"conditioned responses\" in Document [0] (Title: Neurology_Adams), which refers to learning through associations between stimuli and responses. This does not seem to match the description of young birds crouching in response to a predator's shape overhead. 3. In Document [25] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts), it is mentioned that \"fixed action patterns are innate and unlearned responses to specific stimuli.\" This further supports the idea that the crouching of young birds is a fixed action pattern. 4. I did not find any information on \"imprinted behavior\" in the given documents. Imprinting is a specific type of learning in animals that involves forming a strong association between a stimulus and a response, typically in young animals. This does not seem to match the description of young birds crouching in response to a predator's shape overhead. 5. Finally, I did not find any information on \"learned behavior\" in the given documents. Learned behavior is behavior that is acquired through experience or learning, which does not seem to match the description of young birds crouching in response to a predator's shape overhead. Based on the above analysis, I conclude that the crouching of very young birds in response to a predator's shape overhead is an example of a fixed action pattern. Here is my output in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The crouching of very young birds in response to a predator's shape overhead is an example of a fixed action pattern because it is an innate and unlearned response to a specific stimulus, as described in Document [0] (Title: Neurology_Adams) and Document [25] (Title: Cell_Biology_Alberts).\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

In general terms, stress has been defined as a feeling of self-doubt about being able to cope with some situation over a period of time. The term stress syndrome refers to perturbations of behavior and accompanying physiologic changes that are ascribable to environmental challenges of such intensity and duration as to overwhelm the individual\u2019s adaptive capacity. The biologic effects of this phenomenon can be recognized in many species; chickens laying fewer eggs when moved to a new coop and cows giving less milk when put in a new barn, or monkeys going berserk when repeatedly frustrated by threats that they cannot control. Human beings forced to work under confined conditions and constant danger and cultural groups removed from their home and traditional way of life lose their coping skills and suffer anxiety and stress reactions."

After the last ice age ended about 10,000 years ago, marine sticklebacks colonized many newly formed freshwater streams and lakes. Marine sticklebacks extend sharp spines from their pelvic skeleton. These spines are thought to help protect the fish from soft-mouthed fish predators. In contrast, several populations of freshwater sticklebacks have lost these spines, usually in lakes that lack such predators. The different morphologies reflect differences in control of the expression of a transcription regulator called Pitx1. Whereas marine sticklebacks express the Pitx1 gene in the pelvic bone precursor cells that will form the spikes,"

Viperids are characterized by somewhat triangular heads (a feature shared with many harmless snakes), elliptical pupils (also seen in some nonvenomous snakes, such as boas and pythons), enlarged maxillary fangs, and, in pit vipers, heat-sensing pits (foveal organs) on each side of the head that assist with locating prey and aiming strikes. The New World rattlesnakes possess a series of interlocking keratin plates (the rattle) on the tip of the tail that emits a buzzing sound when the snake rapidly vibrates its tail; this sound serves as a warning signal to perceived threats. Identifying venomous snakes by color pattern is notoriously misleading, as many harmless snakes have color patterns that closely mimic those of venomous snakes found in the same region."

Two species are distributed worldwide: T. spiralis, which is found in a great variety of carnivorous and omnivorous animals, and T. pseudospiralis, which is found in mammals and birds. T. nativa is present in Arctic regions and infects bears; T. nelsoni is found in equatorial eastern Africa, where it is common among felid predators and scavengers such as hyenas and bush pigs; and T. britovi is found in Europe, western Africa, and western Asia among carnivores but not among domestic swine. T. murrelli is present in North American game animals."

The nature of the phenomenon displayed by the \u201cjumping Frenchmen of Maine\u201d has been disputed. The syndrome was described originally by James Beard in 1868 among small pockets of French-speaking lumberjacks in northern Maine. The subjects displayed a greatly exaggerated response to minimal stimuli, to which there was no adaptation. The reaction consisted of jumping, raising the arms, screaming, and flailing of limbs, sometimes with echolalia, echopraxia, and a forced obedience to commands, even if this entailed a risk of serious injury. A similar syndrome in Malaysia and Indonesia is known as latah and in Siberia as miryachit. This syndrome has been framed in psychologic terms as conditioned"

Cell death helps sculpt hands and feet during embryonic development: they start out as spade-like structures, and the individual digits separate only as the cells between them die, as illustrated for a mouse paw in Figure 18\u20132. In other cases, cells die when the structure they form is no longer needed. When a tadpole changes into a frog at metamorphosis, the cells in the tail die, and the tail, which is not needed in the frog, disappears. Apoptosis also functions as a quality-control process in development, eliminating cells that are abnormal, misplaced, nonfunctional, or potentially dangerous to the animal. Striking examples occur in the vertebrate adaptive immune system, where apoptosis eliminates developing T and B lymphocytes that either fail to produce potentially useful antigen-specific receptors or produce self-reactive receptors that make the cells potentially dangerous (discussed in Chapter 24); it also eliminates most of the lymphocytes"

A frog, a chicken, and a mammal, for example, even though they develop in similar ways later, make eggs that differ radically in size and structure, and they begin their development with different sequences of cell divisions and cell specializations. Gastrulation occurs in all animal embryos, but the details of its timing, of the associated pattern of cell movements, and of the shape and size of the embryo as gastrulation proceeds are highly variable. Likewise, there is great variation in the time and manner in which the primary axes of the body become marked out. However, this polarization of the embryo usually becomes discernible very early, before gastrulation begins: it is the first step of spatial patterning."

Other extracellular signal molecules that stimulate apoptosis are especially important during vertebrate development: a surge of thyroid hormone in the bloodstream, for example, signals cells in the tadpole tail to undergo apoptosis at metamorphosis. In mice, locally produced signal proteins stimulate cells between developing fingers and toes to kill themselves (see Figure 18\u20132).

Evolution has tuned each of these largely independent processes to run at an appropriate rate, matched to the needs of the organism as a whole. For some purposes, however, this is not enough: a global coordinating signal is required. This is especially true where changes have to occur throughout the body in response to a cue that depends on the environment. For example, when an insect or amphibian undergoes metamorphosis\u2014the transition from larva to adult\u2014almost every part of the body is transformed. The timing of metamorphosis depends on external factors such as the supply of food, which determines when the animal reaches an appropriate size.

As shown here, an individual cell often requires multiple signals to survive (blue arrows) and additional signals to grow and divide (red arrows) or differentiate (green arrows). If deprived of appropriate survival signals, a cell will undergo a form of cell suicide known as apoptosis. The actual situation is even more complex.

In animals, almost all cell locomotion occurs by crawling, with the notable exception of swimming sperm. During embryogenesis, the structure of an animal is created by the migrations of individual cells to specific target locations and by the coordinated movements of whole epithelial sheets (discussed in Chapter 21). In vertebrates, neural crest cells are remarkable for their long-distance migrations from their site of origin in the neural tube to a variety of sites throughout the embryo (see Movie 21.5). Long-distance crawling is fundamental to the construction of the entire nervous system: it is in this way that the actin-rich growth cones at the advancing tips of developing axons travel to their eventual synaptic"

West Nile virus was introduced into New York City in 1999 and subsequently spread to other areas of the northeastern United States, causing die-offs among crows, exotic zoo birds, and other birds. The virus has continued to spread and is now found in almost all states as well as in Canada, Mexico, South America, and the Caribbean islands. C. pipiens remains the major vector in the northeastern United States, but several other Culex species and A. albopictus are also"

            "content": "Figure 23\u201332 Model for the evolution of pandemic strains of influenza virus by recombination. Influenza A virus is a natural pathogen of birds, particularly waterfowl, and it is always present in wild bird populations. In 1918, a particularly virulent form of the virus crossed the species barrier from birds to humans and caused a devastating worldwide epidemic. This strain was designated H1N1, referring to the specific forms of its main antigens, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Changes in the virus, rendering it less virulent, and the rise of adaptive immunity in the human population, prevented the pandemic from continuing in subsequent seasons, although H1N1 influenza strains continued to cause serious disease every year in very young and very old people. In 1957, a new pandemic arose when three genes were replaced by equivalent genes from an avian virus (green bars); the new strain (designated H2N2) was not effectively cleared by antibodies in people who had previously"

            "content": "Visual discrimination is reflected in manual reactions, just as auditory discrimination is reflected in vocal responses. Much of early visual development (first year) involves peering at objects, judging their position, reaching for them, and seizing and manipulating them. The inseparability of sensory and motor functions is never more obvious. Sensory deprivation impedes not only the natural sequences of perceptual awareness of the child\u2019s surroundings but also the development of all motor activities. Auditory discrimination\u2014reflected in vocalizations such as babbling and, later, in word formation\u2014is discussed further on in connection with language development.
