The ovum (egg) is released from the ovary through the ovarian follicle and enters the fallopian tube, where it is transported towards the uterus. The spermatozoa, on the other hand, are produced in the testes and travel through the epididymis, vas deferens, and ejaculatory ducts before entering the female reproductive tract. After capacitation, which involves biochemical changes and modifications to the spermatozoon and its plasma membrane, the spermatozoa are able to penetrate the zona pellucida of the ovum. The zona pellucida is a glycoprotein layer surrounding the oocyte cell membrane. Fertilization typically occurs in the ampulla of the uterine tube, near its junction with the isthmus. The ampulla is the widest part of the fallopian tube, and it is here that the spermatozoa are able to penetrate the zona pellucida and fuse with the oocyte. Therefore, the correct answer is the structure where the spermatozoa and ova meet and fertilization occurs.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

Using this system, the entire spermatozoon\u2014including the head, midpiece, and tail\u2014is assessed, and even mild abnormalities in head forms are classified as abnormal. Most sperm from normal men exhibit minor abnormalities when subjected to Tygerberg standards. An abnormality of sperm morphology is known as teratozoospermia, and these sperm have poor fertilizing potential and may have abnormal DNA.

            "content": "Capacitation involves several biochemical changes and modifications to the spermatozoon and its plasma membrane. They include: \u0081 Increased activity of adenylyl cyclase leading to increasing levels of cAMP \u0081 Increased rate of tyrosine phosphorylation (measurement of tyrosine phosphorylation is used clinically as a biochemical marker of capacitation) \u0081 Activation of Ca2 channels resulting in increased intracellular Ca2 levels \u0081 Release of seminal fluid glycoconjugates from the surface of the head of the spermatozoon. These surface glycosides (also called decapacitation factors) added during sperm maturation in the epididymis inhibit binding to the zona pellucida receptors \u0081 Extensive modification of the plasma membrane by removal of cholesterol, the predominant inhibitor of capacitation, and redistribution of phospholipids and carbohydrate moieties"

            "content": "The activated egg completes the second meiotic division as the sperm DNA decondenses and a pronucleus forms around it ( Fig. 44.32). Once the egg has completed meiosis, CHAPTER 44 The Male and Female Reproductive Systems a pronucleus forms around the female chromosomes as well. A centrosome contributed by the sperm becomes a microtubule organizing center from which microtubules extend until they contact the female pronucleus. The male and female DNA replicate as the two pronuclei are pulled together. Once the pronuclei contact each other, the nuclear membranes break down, the chromosomes align on a common metaphase plate, and the first cleavage occurs. Fertilization typically occurs on day 16 to 17 of the men strual cycle, and implantation occurs about 6 days later. Thus the first week of embryogenesis takes place within the lumens of the oviduct and uterus. For most of this time the embryo remains encapsulated by the zona pellucida."

            "content": "\u0081 Zona reaction. The released enzymes (proteases) of the cortical granules not only degrade the glycoprotein oocyte plasma membrane receptors for sperm binding but also form the perivitelline barrier by cross-linking proteins on the surface of the zona pellucida. This event creates the final and permanent block to polyspermy. The corpus luteum of pregnancy is formed after fertilization and implantation. If fertilization and implantation occur, the corpus luteum increases in size to form the corpus luteum of pregnancy. The existence and function of the corpus luteum depends on a combination of paracrine and endocrine secretions, collectively described as luteotropins. Paracrine luteotropins are locally produced by the ovary. They include:"
