    "answer": "C",
    "predict": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average number of fragments that a restriction enzyme would cleave a double-stranded DNA molecule into. Document [2] states that \"an enzyme that recognizes a specific 4-bp sequence produces many cuts in the DNA molecule, one every 44 bp.\" This means that the probability of a cut occurring at any given point in the DNA molecule is 1/44. Since the DNA molecule has a size of 5,000 bp, we can calculate the average number of fragments as follows: 1. Calculate the total number of possible cut points in the DNA molecule: 5,000 bp / 4 bp per cut = 1,250 possible cut points 2. Calculate the average number of fragments: 1,250 possible cut points / 44 bp per cut = approximately 28.6 fragments However, this calculation assumes that the enzyme can cut at every possible point in the DNA molecule. In reality, the enzyme will not cut at every point, but rather at a specific sequence of 4 base pairs. Since there are 1,250 possible cut points, and the enzyme recognizes a specific 4-bp sequence, the actual number of fragments will be lower. Document [2] also states that \"many sites of cleavage will occur, purely by chance, in any long DNA molecule.\" This means that the actual number of fragments will be close to the expected number of cut points, but not exactly equal to it. Therefore, we can expect the actual number of fragments to be around the calculated average, but slightly lower due to the randomness of the cleavage process. Given the options provided, the closest answer to our calculation is C. about 20. {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average number of fragments that a restriction enzyme would cleave a double-stranded DNA molecule into.

In comparison, a restriction nuclease with a target sequence that is eight nucleotides long would be expected to cleave DNA on average once every 65,536 nucleotide pairs (1 in 48).

Although the DNA molecules in a cell can be randomly broken into small pieces by mechanical force, a fragment containing a single gene in a mammalian genome would still be only one among a hundred thousand or more DNA fragments, indistinguishable in their average size. How could such a gene be separated from all the others? Because all DNA molecules consist of an approximately equal mixture of the same four nucleotides, they cannot be readily separated, as proteins can, on the basis of their different charges and biochemical properties. The solution to this problem began to emerge with the discovery of restriction nucleases. These enzymes, which are purified from bacteria, cut the DNA double helix at specific sites defined by the local nucleotide sequence, thereby cleaving a long, double-stranded DNA molecule into fragments of strictly defined sizes."

A consensus nucleotide sequence is derived by comparing many sequences with the same basic function and tallying up the most common nucleotides found at each position. It therefore serves as a summary or \u201caverage\u201d of a large number of individual nucleotide sequences. A more accurate way of displaying the range of DNA sequences recognized by a protein is through the use of a sequence logo, which reveals the relative frequencies of each nucleotide at each position (Figure 6\u201312C)."

            "content": "Most current methods of manipulating DNA, RNA, and proteins rely on prior knowledge of the nucleotide sequence of the genome of interest. But how were these sequences determined in the first place? And how are new DNA and RNA molecules sequenced today? In the late 1970s, researchers developed several strategies for determining, simply and quickly, the nucleotide sequence of any purified DNA fragment. The one that became the most widely used is called dideoxy sequencing or Sanger sequencing (Panel 8\u20131). This method was used to determine the nucleotide sequence of many genomes, including those of E. coli, fruit flies, nematode worms, mice, and humans. Today, cheaper and faster methods are routinely used to sequence DNA, and even more efficient strategies are being developed (see Panel 8\u20131). The original \u201creference\u201d sequence of the human genome, completed in 2003, cost over $1 billion and required many scientists from around the world working together for 13 years. The enormous progress"

If these mutations were distributed randomly around the genome, how many pro-tein-coding genes would you expect to be affected? Would you expect cell function to be compromised? Why or why not? (Assume that 2% of the genome\u20141.5% protein-coding and 0.5% regulatory\u2014is crucial information.) 5\u201314 Draw the structure of the double Holliday junction that would result from strand invasion by both ends of the broken duplex into the intact homologous duplex shown in Figure Q5\u20133. Label the left end of each strand in the Holliday junction 5\u02b9or 3\u02b9 so that the relationship to the parental and recombinant duplexes is clear. Indicate how DNA synthesis would be used to fill in any single-strand gaps in your double Holliday junction. (Problem 5\u201314)."

            "content": "Why might an erasable RNA primer be preferred to a DNA primer that would not need to be erased? The argument that a self-correcting polymerase cannot start chains de novo also implies the converse: an enzyme that starts chains anew cannot be efficient at self-correction. Thus, any enzyme that primes the synthesis of Okazaki fragments will of necessity make a relatively inaccurate copy (at least one error in 105). Even if the copies retained in the final product constituted as little as 5% of the total genome (for example, 10 nucleotides per 200-nucleotide DNA fragment), the resulting increase in the overall mutation rate would be enormous. It therefore seems likely that the use of RNA rather than DNA for priming brings a powerful advantage to the cell: the ribonucleotides in the primer automatically mark these sequences as \u201csuspect copy\u201d to be efficiently removed and replaced."

It normally begins with the digestion of the DNA samples with appropriate restriction enzymes, which will discriminate wild-type and mutant DNA by size and the separation of DNA samples in an agarose gel by electrophoresis with appropriate DNA size markers, called the DNA ladder. The DNA gel is stained with a dye, usually ethidium bromide, and photographed with a ruler laid alongside the gel so that band positions can later be identified on the membrane. The DNA gel then is treated so the DNA fragments are denatured (i.e., strand separation). The DNA then is transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by capillary diffusion or under electricity. After immobilization, the DNA can be subjected to hybridization analysis, enabling bands with sequence similarity to a radioactively or chemilumi-nescently labeled probe to be identified.The development of Southern transfer and the associated hybridization techniques made it possible for the first time to obtain information about the"
