The patient has a right to confidentiality, but the physician also has a duty to protect the wife's autonomy and prevent potential harm. The correct answer choice should reflect the balance between these competing ethical principles.\\n\\nThe patient's autonomy is compromised by his decision not to disclose the information to his wife, which could lead to emotional distress and potential harm to the wife if she is also infected. On the other hand, the physician's beneficence is also at stake, as withholding the information could lead to harm to the wife. The physician's duty to do no harm (nonmaleficence) is also relevant, as withholding the information could be considered a form of harm to the wife.\\n\\nThe correct answer choice should reflect the principle that beneficence overrides autonomy in this situation, as the physician's primary duty is to act in the best interest of the wife, who may be at risk of harm if she is infected. This is a classic example of the 'Tarasoff rule', which requires healthcare providers to breach patient confidentiality in certain situations to protect others from harm.\\n\\nThe other options are incorrect because autonomy does not override beneficence in this situation (A), autonomy does not override justice (B), and nonmaleficence does not override autonomy (D).\", \"answer_choice\": \"C\"}",

            "content": "MAINTAINING CONFIDENTIALITY Maintaining confidentiality is essential in respecting patients\u2019 autonomy and privacy, encourages them to seek treatment and to discuss problems candidly, and prevents discrimination. However, confidentiality may be overridden to prevent serious harm to third parties or to the patient. Exceptions to confidentiality are justified if the risk is serious and probable, if there are no less restrictive measures by which to avert risk, if the adverse effects of overriding confidentiality are minimized, and if these adverse effects are deemed acceptable by society. For example, the law requires physicians to report cases of tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infection, elder or child abuse, and domestic violence."

Following a sleepless night with significant dyspnea, the patient develops nausea and vomiting and collapses. He presents to the emergency department in cardiac arrest and is unable to be resuscitated. His autopsy shows a posterior wall myocardial infarction and a fresh thrombus in an atherosclerotic right coronary artery. What went wrong? The clinician had decided, based on the patient\u2019s appearance, even before starting the history, that the patient\u2019s complaints were not serious. Therefore, he felt confident that he could perform an abbreviated and focused examination by using the URI assessment protocol rather than considering the broader range of possibilities and performing appropriate tests to confirm or refute his initial hypotheses. In particular, by concentrating on the URI, the clinician failed to elicit the full dyspnea history, which would have"

He has hypertension, and during the last 8 years, he has been adequately managed with a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. During the same period, JH developed the signs of benign prostatic hypertrophy, which eventually required prostatectomy to relieve symptoms. He now complains that he has an increased urge to urinate as well as urinary fre-quency, and this has disrupted the pattern of his daily life. What do you suspect is the cause of JH\u2019s problem? What information would you gather to confirm your diagnosis? What treatment steps would you initiate?"

            "content": "As a result of electronic access to medical information, patients sometimes have more specific medical knowledge of a given medical problem than the physician does. When this is the case, the physician must avoid feeling defensive. The patient often lacks broader knowledge of the context of the problem, awareness of the variable reliability of electronic sources of information, the ability to assess a given study or journal report within an historical context or in comparison with other studies on the topic, knowledge of drug interactions, an ability to maintain objective intellectual distance from the topic, or essential experience in the art and science of medicine. The physician possesses these skills and extensive knowledge, whereas the patient has an intensely focused personal interest in her specific medical condition. Surveys of physicians\u2019 perceptions of the impact of Internet-based health information on the doctor\u2013patient relationship found both positive and negative"
