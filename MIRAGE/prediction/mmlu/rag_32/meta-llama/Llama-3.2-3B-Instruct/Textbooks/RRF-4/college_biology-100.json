Extensive protein similarities, however, suggest that both organelles originated when a primitive eukaryotic cell entered into a stable endosymbiotic relationship with a bacterium. Although some of the genes of these former bacteria still function to make organelle proteins and RNA, most of them have been transferred into the nuclear genome, where they encode bacteria-like enzymes that are synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes and then imported into the organelle. The mitochondrial DNA replication and DNA repair processes are substantially less effective than the corresponding processes in the cell nucleus. Damage therefore accumulates in the genome of mitochondria over time; this damage may be a substantial contributor to the aging of cells and organisms, and it can cause serious diseases.

Although much larger than mitochondria, they are organized on the same principles. They have a highly permeable outer membrane; a much less permeable inner membrane, in which membrane transport proteins are embedded; and a narrow intermembrane space in between. Together, these two membranes form the chloroplast envelope (Figure 14\u201337D). The inner chloroplast membrane surrounds a large space called the stroma, which is analogous to the mitochondrial matrix.

In eukaryotic cells, most of the ATP that powers life processes is produced by specialized, membrane-enclosed, energy-converting organelles. These are of two types. Mitochondria, which occur in virtually all cells of animals, plants, and fungi, burn food molecules to produce ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Chloroplasts, which occur only in plants and green algae, harness solar energy to produce ATP by photosynthesis. In electron micrographs, the most striking features of both mitochondria and chloroplasts are their extensive internal membrane systems. These internal membranes contain sets of membrane protein complexes that work together to produce most of the cell\u2019s ATP. In bacteria, simpler versions of essentially the same protein complexes produce ATP, but they are located in the cell\u2019s"

But strong and direct evidence for the evolutionary origins of chloroplasts can also be found in the molecular structures of photosynthetic reaction centers revealed in recent years by crystallography. The positions of the chlorophylls in the special pair and the two branches of the electron-transfer chain are basically the same in photosystem I, photosystem II, and the photochemical reaction centers of photosynthetic bacteria (Movie 14.11). As a result, one can conclude that they all have evolved from a common ancestor. Evidently, the molecular architecture of the photosynthetic reaction center originated only once and has remained essentially unchanged during evolution. By contrast, the less critical antenna systems have evolved in several different ways and are correspondingly diverse in present-day photosynthetic organisms (Figure 14\u201353)."

In chloroplasts exposed to light, H+ is pumped out of the stroma (pH around 8, similar to the mitochondrial matrix) into the thylakoid space (pH 5\u20136), creating a gradient of 2\u20133 pH units across the thylakoid membrane, representing a proton-motive force of about 180 mV.

In addition, nondividing cells must replenish organelles that are degraded as part of the continual process of organelle turnover, or produce additional organelles as the need arises. Organelle growth and proliferation are therefore carefully controlled. The process is complicated because mitochondrial and chloroplast proteins are encoded in two places: the nuclear genome and the separate genomes harbored in the organelles themselves. The biogenesis of mitochondria and chloroplasts thus requires contributions from two separate genetic systems, which must be closely coordinated."

            "content": "and, as for the mitochondrial matrix, it is the place where ATP is made by the head of an ATP synthase. Like the mitochondrion, the chloroplast has its own genome and genetic system. The stroma therefore also contains a special set of ribosomes, RNAs, and the chloroplast DNA."

            "content": "Although plants and animals are both eukaryotes, they have evolved separately for more than a billion years. Their last common ancestor is thought to have been a unicellular eukaryote that had mitochondria but no chloroplasts; the plant lineage acquired chloroplasts after plants and animals diverged. The earliest fossils of multicellular animals and plants date from almost 600 million years ago. Thus, it seems that plants and animals evolved multicellularity independently, each starting from a different unicellular eukaryote, some time between 1.6 and 0.6 billion years ago (Figure 15\u201368)."
