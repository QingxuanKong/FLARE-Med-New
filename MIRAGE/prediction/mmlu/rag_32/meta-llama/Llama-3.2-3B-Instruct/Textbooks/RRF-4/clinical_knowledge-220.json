The question is asking about the term \"passive movements\" in the context of motor control and physiology. **Step 2:** Review the relevant documents to find a definition of \"passive movements\". **Step 3:** After reviewing the documents, I found that \"passive movements\" refers to movements that are initiated by an external force or stimulus, rather than by the individual's own muscle contraction. In other words, the movement is not voluntary or self-generated. **Step 4:** Analyze the options to determine which one matches the definition of \"passive movements\". **Step 5:** Based on the definition, I can eliminate options A, C, and D, as they all imply some level of resistance or stopping at the end of range, which is not characteristic of passive movements. **Step 6:** Option B, \"Movement without resistance, stretching at end of range\", matches the definition of passive movements. **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the correct answer is: ```json {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"Passive movements are movements that are initiated by an external force or stimulus, rather than by the individual's own muscle contraction, and are characterized by the absence of resistance and the ability to stretch at the end of range.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"} ```",

Most activities\u2014 including running, reaching, eating, talking, writing, and reading\u2014ultimately involve motor acts. Thus motor control is a major task of the central nervous system (CNS), and from an evolutionary perspective, it is probably the reason that nervous systems first arose. Not surprisingly, a large amount of the CNS is devoted to motor control, which can be defined as the generation of signals to coordinate contraction of the musculature of the body and head, either to maintain a posture or to make a movement (transition between two postures)."

When the limb muscles are passively stretched, the patient appears to actively resist the movement (gegenhalten, paratonia, or oppositional resistance). Natural relaxation normally requires concentration on the part of the patient. If there is inattentiveness\u2014as happens with diseases of the frontal lobes, dementia, or other confusional states\u2014this type of oppositional resistance may raise a question of parkinsonian rigidity. This is not a manifestation of basal ganglia disorder per se but may indicate that the connections of the basal ganglia to the frontal lobes are impaired. A similar difficulty in relaxation is observed normally in small children.

If the arm is extended or the leg flexed very slowly, there may be little or no change in muscle tone. By contrast, if the muscles are briskly stretched, the limb moves freely for a very short distance (free interval), beyond which there is an abrupt catch and then a rapidly increasing muscular resistance up to a point; then, as passive extension of the arm or flexion of the leg continues, the resistance melts away. This velocity-dependent tone constitutes the \u201cclasp-knife\u201d phenomenon of spasticity. With the limb in the extended or flexed position, a new passive movement may not encounter the same sequence. Thus, the essential feature of spasticity is a velocity-dependent increase in the resistance of muscles to a passive stretch stimulus. Although a clasp-knife relaxation following peak resistance is highly characteristic of cerebral hemiplegia, it is by no means found"

Local tetanus occurs most often in relation to a wound of the hand or forearm, rarely in the abdominal or paravertebral muscles. Gradually, some degree of continuous involuntary spasm becomes evident. There is sustained tautness of the affected muscles and resistance of the part to passive movement. Superimposed on this background of more or less continuous motor activity are brief, intense spasms, lasting from a few seconds to minutes and occurring spontaneously or in response to all variety of stimulation (Struppler et al).

The term infant flexes lower and upper extremities.

In this sense it is a kinetic or action tremor, but the latter term has connotations of the essential tremor to neurologists, as described earlier. The term ataxic is a suitable substitute for intention, because this tremor is always combined with cerebellar ataxia and adds to it. Its salient feature is that it requires for its full expression the performance of an exacting, precise, projected movement. The tremor is absent both when the limbs are inactive and during the first part of a voluntary movement, but as the action continues and fine adjustments of the movement are demanded (e.g., in touching the tip of the nose or the examiner\u2019s finger), an irregular interruption of forward progression appears.

In contrast to what occurs in paralysis (the primary symptom of corticospinal tract lesions), strength is not significantly diminished. Also, hypokinesia is unlike apraxia, in which a lesion erases the pattern of movements necessary for an intended act, leaving other actions intact. Hypokinesia is expressed most clearly in the parkinsonian patient where it takes the form of an extreme underactivity (\u201cpoverty\u201d) of movement. The frequent automatic, habitual movements observed in the normal individual\u2014such as putting the hand to the face, folding the arms, or crossing the legs\u2014are absent or greatly reduced. In looking to one side, the eyes move, but not the head. In arising from a chair, there is a failure to make the usual small preliminary adjustments, such as pulling the feet"

            "content": "Finally, the complexity of motor activity is almost beyond imagination. Reference was made earlier to the reciprocal innervation involved in an act as simple as making a fist. Scratching one\u2019s shoulder has been estimated to recruit about 75 muscles. But what must be involved in playing a piano concerto? Over a century ago Hughlings Jackson commented that \u201cThere are, we shall say, over thirty muscles in the hand; these are represented in the nervous centers in thousands of different combinations, that is, as very many movements; it is just as many chords, musical expressions, and tunes can be made out of a few notes.\u201d The execution of these complex movements, many of them learned and habitual, is made possible by the cooperative activities of not just the motor and sensory cortices but integrally of the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and reticular formation of the brainstem. All are continuously integrated and controlled by feedback mechanisms from the sensory and spinal motor neurons."

            "content": "The limbs are observed to determine if during natural activities, there is excessive or reduced quantity, speed or excursion of movement, tremor, and if normal postural adjustments. The resistance of muscles during passive movement by the examiner (tone) gives information about spasticity and extrapyramidal rigidity. Testing of Reflexes Testing of the tendon reflexes at the biceps, triceps, supinator-brachioradialis, patellar, and Achilles tendon are an adequate sampling of reflex activity. Underactive or barely elicitable reflexes can be facilitated by voluntary contraction of other muscles, such as pulling the grasped hands against each other (Jendrassik maneuver)."

Although a clasp-knife relaxation following peak resistance is highly characteristic of cerebral hemiplegia, it is by no means found consistently. At times, a form of velocity-independent hypertonia is found that is termed rigidity and is more characteristic of basal ganglia lesions as discussed in Chap. 4."

            "content": "Thus the tension in the spindle fibers and the state of excitability of the alpha and gamma neurons (influenced greatly by descending fiber systems) determines the level of activity of the tendon reflexes and muscle tone (the responsiveness of muscle to stretch). Other mechanisms, of an inhibitory nature, involve the Golgi tendon organs, which detect the tension produced by active contraction of muscle. These encapsulated receptors, which lie in the tendinous portions of muscle, activate afferent fibers that end on internuncial cells, which project to alpha motor neurons, thus forming a disynaptic reflex arc. Golgi tendon receptors are silent in relaxed muscle and during passive stretch; they serve, together with muscle spindles, to monitor or calibrate the length and force of muscle contraction under different conditions. They also play a role in naturally occurring limb movements, particularly in locomotion."
