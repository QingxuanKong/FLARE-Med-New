Insulin stimulates the translocation of GLUT4 transporters to the cell membrane, which is an insulin-dependent process. GLUT4 is the primary glucose transporter responsible for glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. The question asks about the mechanism of glucose transport in muscle cells, so we need to consider the role of GLUT4 and insulin. Glucose can also be transported into muscle cells through facilitated diffusion, but this process is not dependent on insulin. Hexokinase is an enzyme that phosphorylates glucose, but it is not a transport mechanism. Monocarbylic acid transporters are not directly involved in glucose transport into muscle cells. Therefore, the correct answer is related to the insulin-dependent glucose transporter GLUT4. The question also mentions that glucose uptake in muscle cells is stimulated by insulin, which is consistent with the role of GLUT4. Insulin stimulates the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane, increasing glucose uptake in muscle cells. So, the correct answer is A. via protein transporters called GLUT4.\", \"answer_choice\": \"A\"}",

A primary way by which insulin promotes glucose tolerance is activation of glucose transporters in skeletal muscle. Insulin stimulates translocation of preexisting GLUT4 transporters to the cell membrane (reaction 1D). Insulin also promotes storage of glucose in muscle as glycogen (reaction 2D) and promotes oxidation of glucose through glycolysis (reaction 3D). During the fasting phase, low insulin results in a low number of GLUT4 transporters at the membrane (reaction 1F), so these cells consume less glucose (glucose sparing). Skeletal muscle fibers with mitochondria switch to the use of FFAs from adipocytes and KBs from hepatocytes (reaction 3F). Skeletal myocytes do not express glucagon receptors. Uptake of FFAs and KBs and their oxidation for ATP is largely upregulated by intracellular Ca++ levels and a high AMP:ATP ratio. Exercise also"

In the liver, glucose 6-phosphate is transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by glucose 6-phosphate translocase. There, it is dephosphorylated to glucose by glucose 6-phosphatase (the same enzyme used in the last step of gluconeogenesis; see p. 121). The glucose is then transported from the ER to the cytosol. Hepatocytes release glycogen-derived glucose into the blood to help maintain blood glucose levels until the gluconeogenic pathway is actively producing glucose.

For example, one of the physiological responses of skeletal muscle to exercise is the recruitment or opening of capillaries that are not perfused at rest. This opening of previously closed capillaries increases capillary density and thereby reduces the diffusion distance between the capillary and the muscle fiber so that oxygen and cellular fuels (e.g., fatty acids and glucose) can be delivered more quickly to the contracting muscle fiber. In resting muscle, the average distance of a muscle fiber from a capillary is estimated to be 40 \u00b5m. However, with exercise, this distance decreases to 20 \u00b5m or less."

In adipose tissue, glucose is metabolized to lipids, which are stored as fat. Besides promoting lipid synthesis (lipogenesis), insulin also inhibits lipid degradation (lipolysis) in adipocytes.

            "content": "Like all cells, muscle cells depend on the energy source contained in the high-energy phosphate bonds of ATP and phosphocreatine. The energy stored in these high-energy phosphate bonds comes from the metabolism of fatty acids and glucose. Glucose is the primary metabolic sub-strate in actively contracting muscle. It is derived from the general circulation as well as from the breakdown of glyco-gen, which is normally stored in the muscle fiber cyto-plasm. As much as 1% of the dry weight of skeletal and cardiac muscle may be glycogen. In rapidly contracting muscles, such as the leg muscles in running or the extraocular muscles, most of the energy for contraction is supplied by anaerobic glycolysis of stored glycogen. The buildup of intermediary metabolites from this pathway, particularly lactic acid, can produce an oxygen deficit that causes ischemic pain (cramps) in cases of extreme muscular exertion. Most of the energy used by muscle recovering from contraction or by resting muscle is"

            "content": "Insulin, the major hormone secreted by the islet tissue, decreases blood glucose levels. Insulin is the most abundant endocrine secretion. Its principal effects are on the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. Insulin has multiple individual actions in each of these tissues. In general, insulin stimulates \u0081 uptake of glucose from the circulation. Specific cell membrane glucose transporters are involved in this process. \u0081 storage of glucose by activation of glycogen synthase and subsequent glycogen synthesis. \u0081 phosphorylation and use of glucose by promoting its gly colysis within cells. Absence or inadequate amounts of insulin lead to elevated blood glucose levels and the presence of glucose in the urine, a condition known as diabetes mellitus. Reduced expression of insulin and insulin growth factors in the central nervous system (CNS) has recently been linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Folder 18.3)."

            "content": "II. STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION The main stores of glycogen are found in skeletal muscle and liver, although most other cells store small amounts of glycogen for their own use. The function of muscle glycogen is to serve as a fuel reserve for the synthesis of ATP during muscle contraction. That of liver glycogen is to maintain the blood glucose concentration, particularly during the early stages of a fast (Fig. 11.2; also see p. 329). [Note: Liver glycogen can maintain blood glucose for <24 hours.] A. Amounts in liver and muscle"

RESTING SKELETAL MUSCLE Skeletal muscle accounts for ~40% of the body mass in individuals of healthy weight, and it can use glucose, amino acids, FA, and ketone bodies as fuel. In the well-fed state, muscle takes up glucose via GLUT-4 (for energy and glycogen synthesis) and amino acids (for energy and protein synthesis). In contrast to liver, there is no covalent regulation of PFK-2 in skeletal muscle. However, in the cardiac isozyme, the kinase domain is activated by epinephrine-mediated phosphorylation (see p. 100). Skeletal muscle is unique in being able to respond to substantial changes in the demand for ATP that accompanies contraction. At rest, muscle accounts for ~25% of the oxygen (O2) consumption of the body, whereas during vigorous exercise, it is responsible for up to 90%. This underscores the fact that skeletal muscle, despite its potential for transient periods of anaerobic glycolysis, is an oxidative tissue."
