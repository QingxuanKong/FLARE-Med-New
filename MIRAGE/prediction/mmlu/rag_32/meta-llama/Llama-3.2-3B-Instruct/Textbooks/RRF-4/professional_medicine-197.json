    "question": "A 55-year-old man has had crushing substernal chest pain on exertion over the past 6 weeks. He had a myocardial infarction 2 months ago. He takes nitroglycerin as needed and one aspirin daily. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years. Examination shows normal heart sounds and no carotid or femoral bruits.

    "answer": "A",
    "predict": "Here is the step-by-step thinking and the answer in JSON format: {\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and is experiencing crushing substernal chest pain on exertion, which is a classic symptom of angina pectoris. The patient is also a smoker, which is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The treatment with a \\u00d7-adrenergic blocking agent is considered to improve symptoms of angina.\\n\\nTo understand why \\u00d7-adrenergic blocking agents are effective in treating angina, we need to consider the pathophysiology of the condition. Angina is caused by transient myocardial ischemia due to a mismatch between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. In patients with angina, the coronary arteries are narrowed or blocked, leading to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. This results in a buildup of lactic acid and other metabolic byproducts, which can cause chest pain.\\n\\n\\u00d7-adrenergic blocking agents, such as beta blockers, work by reducing the heart rate and contractility, which in turn reduces myocardial oxygen demand. This can help to improve blood flow to the heart muscle and reduce the severity of angina symptoms. Additionally, \\u00d7-adrenergic blocking agents can also cause peripheral vasodilation, which can further reduce blood pressure and increase blood flow to the heart muscle.\\n\\nHowever, the correct answer is not C (Peripheral vasodilation) because while peripheral vasodilation is a effect of \\u00d7-adrenergic blocking agents, it is not the primary mechanism by which they improve angina symptoms. The correct answer is D (Preventing fibrin and platelet plugs) because \\u00d7-adrenergic blocking agents can also inhibit platelet aggregation and prevent the formation of fibrin clots, which can contribute to the development of myocardial infarction.\\n\\nTherefore, the treatment with a \\u00d7-adrenergic blocking agent is most likely to improve the patient's symptoms due to its ability to prevent fibrin and platelet plugs, which can help to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and improve blood flow to the heart muscle.\"} \"answer_choice\": \"D\"",

Angina is usually crescendo-decrescendo in nature, typically lasts 2 to 5 min, and can radiate to either shoulder and to both arms (especially the ulnar surfaces of the forearm and hand). It also can arise in or radiate to the back, interscapular region, root of the neck, jaw, teeth, and epigastrium. Angina is rarely localized below the umbilicus or above the mandible.

He has also had an episode of hypo-tension (86/50 mmHg) that responded to a fluid bolus. Blood cultures were obtained at the time of his fever and results are pending. The ICU attending physician is concerned about a bloodstream infection and decides to treat with empiric com-bination therapy directed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The combination therapy includes tobramycin. The patient weighs 70 kg (154 lb) and has an estimated creatinine clear-ance of 90 mL/min. How should tobramycin be dosed using once-daily and conventional dosing strategies? How should each regimen be monitored for efficacy and toxicity?"

The patient receives a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as adjuvant therapy. One week after receiving the first cycle of therapy, he experiences significant toxicity in the form of myelosup-pression, diarrhea, and altered mental status. What is the most likely explanation for this increased toxicity? Is there any role for genetic testing to determine the etiology of the increased toxicity? A 55-year-old man presents with increasing fatigue, 15-pound weight loss, and a microcytic anemia. Colonoscopy identifies a mass in the ascending colon, and biopsy specimens reveal well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC). He undergoes surgical resection and is found to have high-risk stage III CRC with five positive lymph nodes. After surgery, he feels entirely well with no symptoms. Of note, he has no other illnesses. What is this patient\u2019s overall prognosis? Based on his prognosis, what"

Typically, angina is described as tightness, heaviness, or dull pain, frequently substernal, that lasts for a few minutes. This discomfort may radiate to the left arm, neck, mandible, or epigastrium. Angina is most often provoked by activities that increase metabolic demand on the heart such as exercise, eating, and states of intense emotion, and it is typically alleviated by rest or use of nitroglycerin. It is important to note that a signifi-cant number of patients with myocardial ischemia, particularly diabetics, females, and the elderly, may have \u201csilent\u201d angina or angina equivalents (dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, or fatigue).

He smokes (2\u20133 packs per day), drinks alcohol only rarely, eats a \u201ctypical\u201d diet, and walks with his wife most weekends. His blood pressure has been normal. Family history reveals that his father and paternal aunt died of heart disease at age 45 and 39 years, respectively. His mother and younger (age 31 years) brother are said to be in good health. Physical Examination (Pertinent Findings): BJ is pale and clammy and is in distress due to chest pain. Blood pressure and respiratory rate are elevated. Lipid deposits are noted on the periphery of his corneas (corneal arcus; see left image) and under the skin on and around his eyelids (xanthelasmas; see right image). No deposits on his tendons (xanthomas) are detected."

She has never smoked but has a history of hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level of 245 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] of 160 mg/dL recorded 1 year ago) and admits that she has not been fol-lowing the recommended diet.

On physical examination, the patient\u2019s blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, and her heart rate is 80 bpm. She is in no acute distress, and there are no other significant physical findings; an electrocardiogram is normal except for slight left ventricular hypertrophy.
