    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the information provided in the documents about the normal heart rate in adults at rest. Document [1] states that the average resting heart rate is approximately 70 beats per minute in normal adults. However, there is some variation in heart rate based on age, activity level, and other factors. Document [2] provides a range of normal heart rates for different age groups, but the question asks for a general range for adults at rest. Document [1] also mentions that the range of normal for any given age is approximately 30 beats/minute above or below the average. This suggests that the normal heart rate range for adults at rest is around 70 \\u00b1 30 beats/minute, which is approximately 40-100 beats/minute. However, this range includes values that are higher than the average, and the question asks for a range that is more conservative. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is the range 60-100 bpm, which is a more typical range for adults at rest, considering the normal range of variation.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

When a resting individual is given atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist that blocks parasympathetic effects, the heart rate generally increases substantially. If a resting individual is given propranolol, a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist that blocks sympathetic effects, the heart rate usually decreases only slightly ( Fig. 18.1 ). When both divisions of the autonomic nervous system are blocked, the heart rate of young adults averages approximately 100 beats per minute. The rate that prevails after complete autonomic blockade is called the intrinsic heart rate."

During sleep, the heart rate decreases by 10 to 20 beats per minute. It may increase during emotional excitement, and during muscular exercise, it may increase to rates well above 150 beats per minute. In well-trained athletes, the usual resting rate is only approximately 50 beats per minute. Both divisions of the autonomic nervous system tonically influence the cardiac pacemaker, which is normally the sinoatrial (SA) node. The sympathetic nervous system enhances automaticity, whereas the parasympathetic nervous system inhibits it. Changes in heart rate usually involve a reciprocal action of these two divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Thus the heart rate ordinarily increases with a combined decrease in parasympathetic activity and increase in sympathetic activity; the heart rate decreases with the opposite changes in autonomic neural activity."

The range of normal for any given age is approximately 30 beats/minute above or below the average. Tachycardia may be a manifestation of anemia, dehydration, shock, heart failure, or dysrhythmia. Bradycardia can be a normal finding in patients with high vagal tone (athletes), but may be a manifestation of atrioventricular block.

The principal increase in cardiac output during exercise must therefore be attributed to other factors. Such ancillary factors include the pronounced reduction in peripheral vascular resistance because of the vasodilation in the active skeletal muscles and the increased contractility of cardiac muscle associated with the generalized increase in sympathetic neural activity. Nevertheless, the increase in heart rate is still an important factor. Abundant data show that if the heart rate cannot increase normally during exercise, the augmentation in cardiac output and the capacity for exercise are severely limited. Because stroke volume changes only slightly during exercise, the increase in heart rate may play an important permissive role in augmenting cardiac output during physical exercise."

If the workload is moderate and constant, the heart rate reaches a certain level and remains there throughout the period of exercise. However, if the workload increases, the heart rate increases concomitantly until a plateau of approximately 180 beats per minute is reached during strenuous exercise. In contrast to the large increase in heart rate, the increase in stroke volume is only approximately 10% to 35%, the larger values occurring in trained individuals (see Fig. 19.17 ).

At such high pacing frequencies, the ventricular filling time is so severely restricted that compensation is inadequate, and cardiac output decreases sharply.

Rate should be assessed with exertion and medications adjusted accordingly. Exertion-related symptoms are often an indication of inadequate rate control. The initial goal is a resting heart rate of less than 80 beats/min that increases to less than 100 beats/min with light exertion, such as walking. If it is difficult to slow the ventricular rate to that degree, allowing a resting rate of up to 110 beats/min is acceptable provided it does not cause symptoms and ventricular function remains normal.

Highly trained athletes have a lower resting heart rate, a greater stroke volume, and lower peripheral resistance than they had before training or after deconditioning. The low resting heart rate is caused by a higher vagal tone and a lower sympathetic tone. During exercise, the maximal heart rate of a trained individual is the same as that in an untrained person, but it is attained at a higher level of exercise. A trained person also exhibits low vascular resistance in the muscles.

Under basal conditions, myocardial O2 consumption (V\u02dcO2) is approximately 8 to 10 mL/minute/100 g of heart. It can increase severalfold during exercise and decrease moderately in such conditions as hypotension and hypothermia. The O2 content of cardiac venous blood is normally low (\u22485 mL/ dL), and the myocardium can receive little additional O2 by further extraction of O2 from coronary blood. Therefore, increased O2 demands of the heart must be met mainly by an increase in coronary blood flow (see ). In experiments in which the heartbeat is arrested but coronary perfusion is maintained, O2 consumption falls to 2 mL/ minute/100 g or less, which is still six to seven times greater than the O2 consumption of resting skeletal muscle."

The decrease in stroke volume is caused by the reduced time for ventricular filling. The change in stroke volume is not inversely proportional to the change in heart rate because the direction of the change in cardiac output (Qh) is markedly influenced by the actual heart rate (see Fig. 19.14B ). For example, as pacing frequency is increased from 50 to 100 beats/minute, the increase in heart rate augments Qh.

            "content": "Cardiovascular fitness can be evaluated by measurement of heart rate during exercise. As conditioning improves, the heart rate stabilizes at a fixed level. The heart rate at which conditioning will develop is called the target heart rate (1). The traditional formula for calculating the target heart rate is 220 minus the patient\u2019s age times 0.75. A 2010 study examined the definition of a normal heart rate response to exercise stress testing in women and noted that the traditional male-based calculation of target heart rate may not be appropriate for women (47). The new formula for target heart rate, based on this research, is 206 minus the patient\u2019s age times 0.88."

            "content": "A mean systolic pressure gradient >40 mmHg with a normal CO or an effective aortic orifice area of approximately <1 cm2 (or approximately <0.6 cm2/m2 body surface area in a normal-sized adult)\u2014i.e., less than approximately one-third of the normal orifice area\u2014is generally considered to represent severe obstruction to LV outflow. The elevated LV end-diastolic pressure observed in many patients with severe AS and preserved ejection fraction (EF) signifies the presence of diminished compliance of the hypertrophied LV. Although the CO at rest is within normal limits in most patients with severe AS, it usually fails to rise normally during exercise. Loss of an appropriately timed, vigorous atrial contraction, as occurs in atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrioventricular dissociation, may cause rapid progression of symptoms. Late in the course, contractile function deteriorates because of afterload excess, the CO and LV\u2013aortic pressure gradient decline, and the mean left atrial (LA), pulmonary"
