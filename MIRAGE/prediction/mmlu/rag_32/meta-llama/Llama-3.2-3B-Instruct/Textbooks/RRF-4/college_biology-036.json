    "predict": "{\"step_by_step_thinking\": \"To answer this question, we need to consider the structure and function of a sarcomere in a striated muscle (such as skeletal muscle) and evaluate each option accordingly.\\n\\nOption A: During contraction H zones become elongated. - This statement is incorrect because in a sarcomere, the H zone (also known as the I band) is the region where the thick myosin filaments are present without any actin filaments. During contraction, the H zone remains the same width, but the I band (where the actin filaments are present) shortens. So, the H zone does not become elongated.\\n\\nOption B: In the relaxed position tropomyosin impedes myosin's access to the binding site of actin. - This statement is correct. In the relaxed state, tropomyosin, a protein that is associated with the actin filaments, blocks the myosin binding sites on the actin filaments, preventing myosin heads from binding to actin and initiating contraction.\\n\\nOption C: Each myosin helical tail contains an actin-binding site and an ATP-hydrolyzing site. - This statement is incorrect. The myosin heads, which are part of the myosin filaments, contain an ATP-binding site and an actin-binding site, but not both. The ATP-hydrolysis event is what powers the movement of the myosin head along the actin filament.\\n\\nOption D: The proteins troponin and tropomyosin constitute the thick and thin filaments, respectively. - This statement is incorrect. Tropomyosin is associated with the thin actin filaments, while troponin is a protein that regulates the interaction between tropomyosin and myosin. Tropomyosin is a long protein that wraps around the actin filaments, and troponin is a complex of three proteins that bind to tropomyosin and regulate its position relative to the myosin binding sites on the actin filaments.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\", \"answer_choice\": \"B\"}",

The sarcomere is a contractile unit in skeletal muscle. Each sarcomere is approximately 2 \u00b5m in length at rest and is bounded by two Z lines. Sarcomeres are arranged in series along the length of the myofibril. Thin filaments, containing actin, extend from the Z line toward the center of the sarcomere. Thick filaments, containing myosin, are positioned in the center of the sarcomere and overlap the actin thin filaments. Muscle contraction results from the Ca++-dependent interaction of myosin and actin, in which myosin pulls the thin filaments toward the center of the sarcomere. 2."

Therefore the probability of observing an intact filament by electron microscopy is extremely low. In contrast to skeletal muscle, which contains a transverse alignment of thick and thin filaments that results in striations, the contractile filaments in smooth muscle are not in uniform transverse alignment, and thus smooth muscle has no striations. The lack of striations in smooth muscle does not imply a lack of order. The thick and thin filaments are organized in contractile units that are analogous to sarcomeres."

Although the sliding filament model can explain contrac-tion in a single sarcomere, it cannot adequately explain the shortening of a myofibril of a muscle fiber. Obviously, if the activity just described were to occur simultaneously in adjacent sarcomeres, no contraction could occur. Equal and opposite forces would be exerted on either side of the Z line, and the contraction of any given sar-comere would be prevented by the contraction of its two immediate serial neighbors. Recent studies with ultrahigh-speed photography have demonstrated that an extremely small temporal delay occurs between the contraction of adjacent sarcomeres, so that a wavelike contraction actu-ally occurs in each muscle fibril and, consequently, in each muscle fiber."

This high-magnification electron micrograph shows a longitudinal section of the myofibrils. The I band, which is bisected by the Z line, is composed of barely visible, thin (actin) filaments. They are attached to the Z line and extend across the I band into the A band. The thick filaments, composed of myosin, account for the full width of the A band. Note that in the A band there are additional bands and lines. One of these, the M line, is seen at the middle of the A band; another, the less electron-dense H band, consists only of thick filaments. The lateral parts of the A band are more electron dense and represent areas where the thin filaments interdigitate with the thick filaments. 35,000. b.

The rapid synchronized shortening of the thousands of sarcomeres lying end-to-end in each myofibril enables skeletal muscle to contract rapidly enough for running and flying, or for playing the piano."

In both cardiac and skeletal muscle, the contractile elements\u2014 thick and thin filaments\u2014are organized into sarcomeres surrounded by sER and mitochondria. Both cardiac and smooth muscle cells retain their individuality, although both are in functional communication with their neighbors through gap junctions. In addition, cardiac and smooth muscle cells have a spontaneous beat that is regulated but not initiated by autonomic or hormonal stimuli. Both have centrally located nuclei and perinuclear organelles. These common characteristics suggest that cardiac mus-cle may have evolved in the direction of skeletal muscle from"

Thus the myosin filament is polarized and poised for pulling the actin filaments toward the center of the sarcomere. A cross-section view of the sarcomere near the end of the A band shows that each thick filament is surrounded by six thin filaments, and each thin filament receives cross-bridge attachments from three thick filaments. This complex array of thick and thin filaments is characteristic of both cardiac and skeletal muscle and helps \u2022 Fig."

In the contracted state, the myosin cross-bridges slant toward the center of the sarcomere, which is consistent with the ratchet action of the myosin head. The cross-bridge cycling mechanism just described is called the sliding filament theory because the myosin Cycle stops here in relaxed living muscle (because of actions of regulatory mechanisms)"

Muscle fibers (cells) are arranged in parallel; they are vertically oriented, and the length of each fiber extends beyond the upper and lower edge of the micrograph. The fibers appear to be of different thicknesses. This is largely a reflection of the plane of section through the muscle fibers. Note on the left the epimysium, the sheath of dense connective tissue surrounding the muscle. 160. b. At higher magnification, cross-striations of the muscle fibers are readily seen. The nuclei of skeletal muscle fibers are located in the cytoplasm immediately beneath the plasma membrane. 360."
